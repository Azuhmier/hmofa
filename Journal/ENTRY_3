Long time no write. Since the last entry pastebin nuked itself. Sucks
since 'Project Urgent Furry' was built around it, but I guess that will teach
me to be more dynamic when it comes to such transient media forms as pastebin.
So as one could guess, I have been doing major overhauls to the project with
new objectives.

Journal entries are going to be a lot less formal now. 'Project Urgent Furry'
is just a name given to this effort of making /hmofa/ more easily accessible and
more easily searchable and analyzable.

Current Tasks (whilst juggling school and work):

1. |Masterbin updates|
- done every 25-100 editions, though this may vary
- go through every thread since last updated edition via the "previous
thread" link
- use the OP's to fill in the masterbin
- search for AO3 and sofurry links for writers just now moving form pastebin
and record them on the writers link archive on the /hmofa/ wiki
- using the writers link archive check each author for new submissions and fill
in masterbin for AO3, sofurry, et. al links that were not stated in the thread.

2. |OHM- Omni Hash Manipulator|
- found in my hmofa git repo; will eventually be moved to it's own repo
- written in {erl
- txt file oriented; should work for any storybin; helps maintain consistency
and develop many versions of said story bin.
- new features will be added once I get a pre-alpha version off the ground

3. |story tagging|
- will resume after syncing the catalog and masterbin for OHM. I said "by
Christmas" in the thread but I forgot how close christmas was, still trying
though.


OK now that every thing has been caught up, here is the "Journal Entry" or what
they will look like in the future.
