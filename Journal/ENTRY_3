## ENTRY_3  (WIP)
# Created by Azuhmier

Long time no write. Since the last entry pastebin nuked itself. Sucks
since 'Project Urgent Furry' was built around it, but I guess that will teach
me to be more dynamic when it comes to such transient media forms as pastebin.
So as one could guess, I have been doing major overhauls to the project with
new objectives.
