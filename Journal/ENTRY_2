I have been delaying making another journal entry, due to my insistence that it
needed to be concise and informative, but now I have decided to go against this
irrational standard as one can evidently see. Nevertheless, I think I should
state the context and current project I am talking about:

===========================================================================
| Project Overview|
PROJECT NAME: Catalogue of Tagged /hmofa/ Stories (aka 'Project Urgent Furry')
URL:          https://pastebin.com/dBVB0h3f
OBJECTIVE:    Help readers find stories; increase writer exposure; increase
              the overall production capacity, networking, and overall 
              influence of /hmofa/

===========================================================================
| Part I of Operation Urgent Furry: Foundation |

A.1) redo tagging programming (it is currently unreadable and unnecessarily 
     complex) and make it output a hash structure so anybody can use it 
A.2) with the hash structure one can easily (theoretically) put it into
     markdown 
A.3) Be able to turn other writebin's of other generals into hash structures,
     with the final boss being able to do it "/tg/'s smut index" b/c why not
     Also be able to turn the GPG into a hash structure: 
     https://pastebin.com/wpdsc7nC
A.4) learn how to use git and put it on github to put program on


B.1) Learn how to SQL to get archive hmofa from this: 
     https://archive.org/details/desuarchive_db_201909 
B.2) Turn /hmofa/ thread findings to something readable and where I
     can search for a pattern in them all at once 
B.3) Learn how to use the "picture tables"



C.1) Use pastebin API to get stories instead of being an ass an scrapping them
     in non-permitted ways (only going to scrape again through their API from 
     now on. 
C.2) Got a file full of story htmls, so I need to extract: txt, author,
     date of creation, date last edited, etc.


D.1) Finish tagging and giving summaries to the stories in the master bin


E.1) fixing my .vimrc / and hmofa related perl modules and junk so I don't have
     anymore surprises 

===========================================================================
| Part II of Operation Urgent Furry: from batch to continuous |
* Following is hypothetical and is not anytime soon

> Regarding C.2, A, and B.4: have program get this information every t hours.
No idea how I am going to do it, right now it is just a dream.  
> I got a hold of some electronics from a holiday in express hotel's
cable/networking room.  One of those items was "server computer" that goes on
those "server tower" things. Came with an uninterruptible power supply. It can
handle some simple fetching right (old: 3.4 GHZ cpu and DDR2) ram?

===========================================================================

I am currently going into overdrive to complete A,B, and maybe C by thread 
number 1000, but as always that could not happen. Nevertheless I am hoping 
for the best. Will go into more detail about A in a future journal for I
believe people may still not understand what exactly it is I am trying to
do with this.
