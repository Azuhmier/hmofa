7503  An older work of mine that I never finished. May come back to it some day. The original intro: "It's a big galaxy out there. Some one-hundred million light-years across, home to trillions upon trillions of sentients. You're one of them, a lonely human. Humans aren't good for much out there. They're not good fighters, too small and weak. Not good leaders, not clever or smart enough. They don't even have the advantage of numbers once Earth died. No, humans were good at two things. Flying and lying. Humans had a certain mixture of traits that made them more likely to be exceptional pilots: smaller bodies to withstand the G-force, an advanced sense of spatial awareness, and an odd human invention they'd mastered over anyone else, the joystick. The deceit however, was just human nature."

422  This was a commissioned story courtesy of "Dr. Allegedly." In a world where anthros and humans co-exist (for the most part), what's a guy to do when anthros, including his best friend, overshadow him in a good chunk of sports? Specialize, adapt, evolve, and overcome, of course. What are humans the best at? What can we do that so many other animals can't? Besides boiling water really, really well, I mean. This is the start of a long and winding road straight to the Olympics (and the altar) for two young couples. The first chapter focuses on the budding relationship between "Anon Y. Mous" and "Naomi." Features second-person perspective narrative exposition.
243 "Broken Sanctuary" follows the saga of Venka, a huntress from the Hollow Reed Tribe, as she races to reunite with her people who flee a merciless, genocidal force.

Venka grapples with her growing feelings for him and the cultural divide between their two peoples. As they traverse treacherous lands and brave dangers both natural and mystical, Venka must confront her deepest desires, the weight of tribal expectations, and the raw power of her own instincts. Exploring themes of survival, cultural collision, forbidden love, and the delicate balance between duty and personal happiness in a world where primitive societies endure the remnants of the Sky People.

8217 It is the year of our lord 850, the once-great Western Roman Empire, divided through succession, is no more, and the sons of the empire fight over her remains; as the pagans in the north and in the east, and the saracens in the south, watch their lands hungrily from the edges of civilization.

6660 The tale of a kindly young man who gets an unexpected visitor in the wee hours of the morning... A rather unique entry in my catalog, After Midnight has a somewhat more melancholy tone at times, but is ultimately meant to be a cozy, uplifting story. It's unique among the CYOAs as the only one that lacks any official art for any characters present.
6666 The tale of an urban explorer's greatest find ever... Based on a character who haunted my dreams for months, Aftermarket Parts was hyped for a long, long time before release, and was rather well liked, thankfully.

752 There were too many, with the same debilitating affliction. In varying degrees of severity, from unresponsive hands, to full body paralysis.The latter of which begged to be put out of their misery. The water was the source of our suffering, poisoning all life around it. Soon, the gnawing hunger and thirst dulls the senses of many. Fury, fear and despair surfaces from the minds of once honorable beings. Now driven mad, cornered and forced to act.  What would you do in the face of extinction?

4578 This is a revision of my earlier stories called "My Obsession". Warning: This story contains kidnapping, molesting, female on male rape, implied murder, and impregnation.  Like before, the picture is drawn by blokfort over at https://www.furaffinity.net/user/blokfort I wanted to clean up the story, fix the long blocks of hard to read text, and try to flesh out scenes to better build up plot points. I am hoping that it's a straight up improvement over the original. To those who read, thank you.

102 This is my first ever story and I am still trying to figure out what I'm doing. I have read a lot of fics involving foxes but I haven't ever really found one that I particularly like so that's why I'm writing this (also to hopefully cure myself of foxchosis). Expect maybe 1 chapter a week, but don't be surprised if I'm not consistent. Any and all feedback/criticism is welcome. Anon is a 1st year university student moving to the big city from the country. A deep fear of Anthros was instilled in him at a young age and now he is going to the City where Humans and Anthros co-exist. In an attempt to make his interaction with the Anthro population as minimal as possible, even with his limited financial state. He has taken every precaution but the sight of an ad for extremely cheap and high-quality accommodation with just one roommate comes to be his downfall. Fox Hijinks ensue.

Accidentally bringing a human into her world, she has to hide him from her roommate by pretending he's her boyfriend. Shenanigans ensue, as he is more enthusiastic about the disguise than she is.

When he received a message from Advent about a mandatory medical check-up, he had little choice but to get it over with.

319 Welcome to the Frostscape, the land neglected by the sun’s warm touch, a territory harbor of all kinds of legends, human and monstrous — living and dead. Scenery that witnessed the spawn and decline of beasts, spirits, demons, and Gods alike. Next — and possibly last — destination of the ex-mercenary known in the south as Marek Blakesley. Paying the expenses of the jobs of his past even today, the now adventurer seeks the journey that could end all his problems in one way or another — the slaying of one of the most dangerous monstrosities ever known on Gebaten: a wyrm, one of the Seeds of the World itself. But as his time on the wintry landscape passes, he will find himself accompanied by the most unusual partner — a bipedal owl-wolfess chimera that incites fear, hatred, and fascination in most of the inhabitants of the arctic tundra — both humanoid and animalistic. And so, spectates the duo made up of a fighter and winged chimera as they traverse the most frozen territory on the continent — facing the different hostile residents of the snow and even standing against century-old evils — at the same time they develop a relationship that may transcend the human-beast boundary.
