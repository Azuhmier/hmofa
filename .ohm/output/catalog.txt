*It was to be that the veil of normalcy would be torn, what barred unreality from reality wafer thin and so very easy to breach. Yet somehow life moved on, world of the living seemingly uncaring or outright blind to otherworldly processes and schemes. Continuing on inside an existence built by the hands and minds of solitary mankind.  In this state of unknowing, something outside human concept caught the scent of unclaimed souls.  One man will be stripped from his life, held in the grip of wickedness and hunger dwarfing the innumerable evils of man's darkest myths and legends. Despite his peril, another being wishes to see him out of this. Both for his sake and their own.*

His rescuer, Maeve the Dragon-Kin Druid, believes Anon was saved from exile by the God of Nature for his virtuosity, and now offers him a way to create Eternal Life, as she feels he is rightly owed. Anon is a bit hesitant to accept this offer, but this Dragon-Kin is more than eager to give it to him, and much more. While Anon easily finds her more than amicable, he might be a little nervous to find himself rustling in the bushes with her. Though luckily for him, Maeve has no such qualms.*

After a final insult, the brilliant but troubled anthro lioness finally takes matters into her own hands. She's intent on claiming you no matter the pain she must inflict on her competition. At the request of other posters, there are three possible endings: a "good end", a "bad end", and an action-packed, off-the-wall ending. The "bad end" is explicit and contains cuckquean content, so beware. The others are relatively clean, with the action ending containing some violence.*

Not far behind, the fierce Colonel Braxys has her own plan. She is determined to have Miles and bring the residents of Zion into the fold, all with as much cunning and cruelty as necessary.  Nothing will come without sacrifice for Miles and Finn.  Book 2 of "Assignment Risk"*

Him and the rest of his little band scramble to make it to Zion as Administrator Paxi heads up the manhunt, but there are yet-uncovered truths about the Daxy's occupation which will shake the Penn family to its foundation.  A recovering Colonel Braxys has learned much from her encounters with Miles and her rival Rax. Making a change in herself and in her tactics will be necessary to Induct the residents of Zion into the Empire, and have a shot at true love with Miles.  Meanwhile, on a distant corner of Mars, high-value human inmate "Forty" is subjected to the realities of internment in a Daxy prison. Unbeknownst to all, she might hold the key to end the Empire's authoritarian occupation of Earth once and for all.  Third part of the "Assignment Risk" and "Risk Assessment" trilogy.*

Also it's a /hmofa/ story and none of the turtles physically show up at any point (during the main story at least), so there's that, hope you enjoy it.*

*Being the only human in an Ancient China dominated by animals, you'd never expected to last as long as you had, or rise as high as you'd risen. As the Equipment Manager of the Jade Palace's prestigious Training Hall - home to some of the greatest Kung Fu warriors in all of Asia, the Furious Five - you build and replace the numerous tools with which the masters hone their skills. A tinkerer at heart and a former grease monkey by trade, it should've been your dream job. As it turns out, cleaning up after a bunch of glorified thugs with a penchant for breaking crap isn't all it's cracked up to be. It's the tiger who irks you the most; she's always going out of her way to be that little bit more rough with the equipment that she needs to be, always shooting you those angry, sidelong glances. It isn't until the two of you finally butt heads that you both realize there's more to each other than meets the eye.*

*Christina Marlowe's newest client is a junior architect that thinks someone is out to get his firm. Going by the fact that he's willing to pay one of Nuevo Cargangel's chimeras—descendants of the survivors of a plague that mutated them into animalistic but anthropomorphic forms—he might be right and desperate. Why else would he trust a notorious vixie?  As usual, the rest is a mess of schemes that's headed downhill. Why does Boss Jones, the half-bison, think Marlowe knows something about his stolen blueprints? Are the buns of The Warren involved or just another distraction? And where does the arrest of one of the city's biggest confectioners fit in?  The easy answer is that everyone wants a bigger slice of power and resources.  Marlowe is one of them, but is she anyone's sweetheart or about to take a trip to the body farms?*

* This was a commissioned story courtesy of "Dr. Allegedly." In a world where anthros and humans co-exist (for the most part), what's a guy to do when anthros, including his best friend, overshadow him in a good chunk of sports? Specialize, adapt, evolve, and overcome, of course. What are humans the best at? What can we do that so many other animals can't? Besides boiling water really, really well, I mean. This is the start of a long and winding road straight to the Olympics (and the altar) for two young couples. The first chapter focuses on the budding relationship between "Anon Y. Mous" and "Naomi." Features second-person perspective narrative exposition.*

*The cruel dead refuse the dark, in this world of madness, only kept at bay by the Third Revenant Defence institution, exorcists risk their lives every day to keep the people of the central continent, Magna, safe and sound. The year is 1971. A knight of the Arnoket family must work with a dangerous tiger spirit to keep his status. Silas wants respect, Raiya wants revenge, and in a world full of cryptids, psychics, angels, and monsters, they might not get what they want. An action-packed, supernatural, urban fantasy heavily inspired by Chainsaw Man and Jujutsu Kaisen. Criticism is appreciated!*

Havelock is a hunter, living on the outskirts of Lothorn, the smallest in a dwindling number of bastions left. When he finds a beast capable of speech, a beautiful, intelligent creature, he cannot bring himself to kill her. The beast in question is desperate and afraid of death, so a deal is struck, she will stay until the black moon falls, then, they will see if they can part ways at all.*

*In the nation of Battahl, a fell shadow looms over the beastren's sovereign. Though her wishes seek naught but peace for her people, Empress Nadinia's life has become endangered by a shadowy conspiracy. The latest attempt on her life only narrowly twarted by the timely intervention of a stranger among their midst, can her allies find the culprit behind these attacks against her, afore the next blade finds its mark? Can she trust that the Arisen is who he says he is? Can Her Highness even trust her own judgement, as she feels her faith waver like a candle in the storm? An AU where Itsuno didn't get cucked by Capcom(AGAIN!), and the second half of the second game was actually fleshed out rather than being only some filler before The Dragon fight, written by someone who has spent 3000+ hours playing through the whole franchise(and is still playing both games).*

*"Broken Sanctuary" follows the saga of Venka, a huntress from the Hollow Reed Tribe, as she races to reunite with her people who flee a merciless, genocidal force. Along the way, she encounters an improbable ally--the lone survivor of a lost, advanced civilization. Venka grapples with her growing feelings for him and the cultural divide between their two peoples. As they traverse treacherous lands and brave dangers both natural and mystical, Venka must confront her deepest desires, the weight of tribal expectations, and the raw power of her own instincts. Exploring themes of survival, cultural collision, forbidden love, and the delicate balance between duty and personal happiness in a world where primitive societies endure the remnants of the Sky People.*

*Vel'Thara, one of the many Lords of Change, seeks to crush and overtake a Slaaneshi cult on a planet before it blooms fully. However, she finds that her most recent glimpses into the future were mere falsities by Tzeentch, stifling her many schemes. Frustrated with her inability to make any headway, she strikes at the very heart of the planet, its assigned governor. She finds that he's unwilling to fall to her promises of wealth and knowledge, but a small plunge into his mind uncovers a new route to his subservience. Lust for her.*

*You are Anon Anonerson, living it up in the Anthrostate, the (totally) benevolent totalitarian government that manages a world of humans and Anthros. You've managed to skirt around most of the restrictive laws by faking a relationship with an Anthro named Talia-- humans that are paired up with Anthros get better treatment. And if you try to avoid it for too long, the state kindly mandates a 'civil union' for you-- which is something you'd like to avoid, considering the way the state treats people who don't play nice with their convoluted system.

Scenery that witnessed the spawn and decline of beasts, spirits, demons, and Gods alike. Next — and possibly last — destination of the ex-mercenary known in the south as Marek Blakesley. Paying the expenses of the jobs of his past even today, the now adventurer seeks the journey that could end all his problems in one way or another — the slaying of one of the most dangerous monstrosities ever known on Gebaten: a wyrm, one of the Seeds of the World itself. But as his time on the wintry landscape passes, he will find himself accompanied by the most unusual partner — a bipedal owl-wolfess chimera that incites fear, hatred, and fascination in most of the inhabitants of the arctic tundra — both humanoid and animalistic. And so, spectates the duo made up of a fighter and winged chimera as they traverse the most frozen territory on the continent — facing the different hostile residents of the snow and even standing against century-old evils — at the same time they develop a relationship that may transcend the human-beast boundary.*

*Anon is an outlier among the Náisiúin. For one, he’s human. For another, he serves in the Míleata as part of Na Gconstáblaí, tasked with crushing the Human Resistance Army (HRA). To him, it's a necessary fight—one that will bring lasting peace between anthros and the Indigenous human reservation. It’s the dream he’s always held, shaped by the influence of his mother; Seansailéir of the state. But as he delves deeper into his assignments—forced into the shadows to handle the state’s dirtiest work in the Human Reservation—he begins to hear the stories the HRA tells. Stories that gnaw at his convictions. And with each revelation, a chilling thought takes root: his mother may not be the peacemaker he always believed her to be. Anthrostate story inspired by some talks on 4chan's /trash/ & /hmofa/ board, regarding the lack of blood mother-son relationships in the anthrostate. After pondering the idea that a high ranking anthrostate woman would be allowed to create her own genetically modified human egg, I came up with this story and had to get it on paper. 2nd p POV, multi endings maybe.*

*You toil as a wage slave at the second tackiest store in the mall. Spencer's Gifts The store is a constant parade of tweens and "adventurous" adults who come to gawk at the "scandalous" selection of goods you have available. Nothing quite as exciting as cheap nipple piercings manufactured in a sweat shop and overpriced sex toys. And who could forget the chalky, stale, and flavorless penis-shaped candy! The worst part of all of them is the kids. They know they aren't supposed to play around in the adult section, but that doesn't stop them. Cleaning up after them is not fun. The only thing that has kept you along for this awful ride is your manager. Her name is Violet, a drop-dead sexy possum anthro that's a few years older than you. Even in this day and age, she proves that Goth is far from dead. You'd do anything to tear those fishnets of hers, and she seems like she'd let you. Those silly rules about fraternization are the only thing keeping you off of each other. However, the carefree, comfy days of non-stop flirting with your boss can't last forever. A pint-sized spanner gets thrown into the gears after you catch her eye. And she won't take no for an answer.*

*You are Anon, a simple man living in a heavily mixed anthro city trying to live a happy life. Unfortunately, happy lives don’t come easy. You’re stuck in an endless cycle that never changes. Work, sleep, wake up, and do it again until your day off, where you relish in the one thing that you truly enjoy: the wonderful rush of the arcade.  Unfortunately, your favorite hobby can only distract you for so long. After a few years of depressing monotony, you simply can’t ignore the fact that you’re lonely. Despite that, you’re so desperately afraid of change that you rarely try to seek companionship. Whether it be friends or something more, you don’t have many people to talk to. Until one fateful Tuesday, when you meet a slightly dazed cat at the arcade who asks if they can play with you.*

Foxers lead others beyond the walls of Enclave in order to secure valuable relics only found in Purgatory. But Purgatory is no cakewalk.  It’s a world teeming with anomalies, centuries of overgrowth, harvesters, and worst of all: Corvid — heretics — the enemy of humanity.  Despite your ordinary looks, sub-par grades, and feisty fox, Echo, you harbor a deep secret: you’re a mutant. A dream walker who can step into the dreams — or nightmares — of others.  Captured by the Church and pressed into service on a special mission, your dreams connect you to a woman named Elia, a woman claiming to have the same gift as you.  Only problem?  She’s a heretic.*

You and Alex decide to carry on tradition and get the girls together on the roof of the school with the promise of grilled meat, cold beers, and the best seats in Ranchview to watch the fireworks. Only, something — or someone — is missing on that night, a fact that does not go unnoticed by a certain vixen. And what starts out as a fun evening drinking on the roof like old times becomes an exercise in the pain of loss, and the power of moving forward. Oh, and there’s lots of fireworks.

But as Halloween approaches, strange things start happening, and a dark ritual begins with the finding of a curious red book. It's a race against time for you and your friends to stop a group of students from ushering in an age of darkness, and to also figure out just what the hell is wrong with that rabbit.*

Though the townsfolk seem friendly, and his new cabin in the woods is everything he hoped for, there seems to be something a little strange about this town and it's history. An infestation of wolves, a rash of abductions in the past, a government investigation, and a diner that doesn't serve chocolate milkshakes? It won't be long until he learns the truth behind all the town's secrets, and gains a new companion in the process.*

*It's not easy being a witch. Seen as freaks and bad omens by society, forced to live in the outskirts of civilization, having to deal with the potentially lethal result of a miscast spell or fumbled potion, it's a hard life for sure. But you know what's even worse than being a witch? Being a chimera as well. Urmine and Gothetta are two sisters in such an unfortunate situation. Urmine, nominally a black bear, has a twisted set of antlers growing between her ears and Gothetta, mostly a doe, has a fearsome pair of fangs hanging down from her upper jaw. After the unfortunate passing of their mother when they were children the sisters have been living a humble life in their childhood cabin. Yet after so many years of their lonely existence Gothetta finally cracks, no longer content to spend the rest of her days talking to the only other person whom she shares a connection with. She shares her discontent with Urmine and they agree to summon a companion into existence, one that is intelligent, one that is agreeable, and one that is AHEM physically compatible. The sisters retrieve one of their many tomes and prepare for their companion's arrival, totally unaware that this summoning may bring with it more trouble than they expect.*

Drawn back to the land of the talking animal people, syrup slurping smugglers, and sweet crimson melonade he now finds himself spread thin as multiple forces threaten to tear apart not only him, but his new family as well. A shadowy witch hunter with motives unknown, a devious moose who aims to deceive, an object of great power resting above a humble fireplace, and a frog that seems to slip through the sister's fingers time and time again. Will Henry get back home? Will Urmine ever get over the loss of her antler? Will Gothetta ever find her beloved Edmund again?

*This is my first ever story and I am still trying to figure out what I'm doing. I have read a lot of fics involving foxes but I haven't ever really found one that I particularly like so that's why I'm writing this (also to hopefully cure myself of foxchosis). Expect maybe 1 chapter a week, but don't be surprised if I'm not consistent. Any and all feedback/criticism is welcome. Anon is a 1st year university student moving to the big city from the country. A deep fear of Anthros was instilled in him at a young age and now he is going to the City where Humans and Anthros co-exist. In an attempt to make his interaction with the Anthro population as minimal as possible, even with his limited financial state. He has taken every precaution but the sight of an ad for extremely cheap and high-quality accommodation with just one roommate comes to be his downfall. Fox Hijinks ensue.*

*Leonardo Colombi is a regular italian who just got out of school. When he was in school he wrote a letter as an assignment and lost it. Turns out he didn't actually lose it. DISCLAIMER: Nobody is real. If you think someone is real then you're obviously not thinking of anyone from this story. The story contains implicit material and eventually explicit material too. While I will not limit myself with the implicit and "almost there" material, any and all future naked action narrated here will be sweet HMOFA stuff, pinky promise.*

* An older work of mine that I never finished. May come back to it some day. The original intro: "It's a big galaxy out there. Some one-hundred million light-years across, home to trillions upon trillions of sentients. You're one of them, a lonely human. Humans aren't good for much out there. They're not good fighters, too small and weak. Not good leaders, not clever or smart enough. They don't even have the advantage of numbers once Earth died. No, humans were good at two things. Flying and lying. Humans had a certain mixture of traits that made them more likely to be exceptional pilots: smaller bodies to withstand the G-force, an advanced sense of spatial awareness, and an odd human invention they'd mastered over anyone else, the joystick. The deceit however, was just human nature."*

It is a fulfilling job for Johann, even though he has to deal with his coworker's teasing at times. The mischievous Kitsune is Johann's superior and is currently out of the office on important business. However, on one seemingly average day, Johann gets an unexpected client, an inexperienced Kitsune. Usually, a client like that would fall under his Kitsune superior's jurisdiction, but since she is currently away, Johann reluctantly takes the case.*

*For ten thousand years the kingdoms of men stood proud atop the cosmic hierarchy, dominating the lesser races of the earth as a singular unitary imperium. With the resurgence of unimaginably powerful ancient magic, unseen for nearly nine thousand years, that unity was shattered. In the self declared, far eastern fledgling Empire of Zamor & Rozkha, one common tavern owner finds himself subject to forces beyond which any man can control. In this world filled with fantastic beings from elves to beastmen, he will witness a people's desperate struggle for existence. The question is, can he tread the path fate has carved for him, or will he be cursed to become another soul lost in the echoing chamber of history.*

Try as they might, residents found themselves incapable of handling the situation, and so called forth the aid of anyone willing to slay the creature, a great prize having been placed on its head.  A lonesome drifter looking to claim his next clean bounty soon caught wind of this debacle, and eagerly took up the challenge. But the job hasn’t gone as swimmingly as he was hoping, and misfortune seems to have followed him yet again…*

*It is the year of our lord 850, the once-great Western Roman Empire, divided through succession, is no more, and the sons of the empire fight over her remains; as the pagans in the north and in the east, and the saracens in the south, watch their lands hungrily from the edges of civilization. Europe is in chaos, as squabbles between brothers turn into long bloody wars. The Kings muster their levies for war, leaving the lesser nobles within their lands with nothing but the minimum garrisons. Many men are forced to pay the price for these decisions, but this story follows one man: the son of a Duke. Thrust into a world he knows nothing about, set against a task few men would be brave or foolish enough to agree to outright. A shadow of these lands' past calls for him. To most, it is considered a death sentence, but to him perhaps it is an opportunity.*

He makes his living fixing shoes, seeing people's stories inscribed in their soles when they come to him for repairs. He spends his days wondering if there is something more out there for him. On an unassuming winter's day, he is surprised when he runs into an old friend: a kobold he hasn't seen in some time. They were best friends in their childhood, but their lives went in different directions. Could this chance encounter change all of that in one night? Could she be the very thing that has been missing from his life? Or did I lie in the tags and they just stay good friends? Check out the story if you want to know so bad.*

But the war's closing battles rage on elsewhere, and scavengers continue to toil as everyone desperately seeks scraps of the old regime's technology in order to maintain some semblance of civilized life. When a massive batch of fertilized viper eggs is found in an ADVENT storage facility, City 31 takes up the cause. Fearful that disposal would look bad to its non-human population, the city asks its resident vipers for assistance in raising the young. Jia, a former soldier turned schoolteacher, considers the offer. Already familiar with human children and further enticed by the promised increase in basic income, she asks herself: how hard could it be?*

https://archiveofourown.org/works/62459470
*Five years after the Liberation War, a mission to extract a mole in the ADVENT Remnant goes horribly wrong. With the threat of traitors amongst XCOM's ranks, Bradford pulls an old soldier out of retirement as a desperate act. This soldier enters into a world alien to the one he left behind, a world trying to rebuild from the destruction of the Liberation War and wipe away the taint of the Elders. He soon finds himself falling down a rabbit hole of terrorist plots, schemes and conspiracies in a secret war that could end XCOM itself. And leading him into this world of human and alien cooperation is the only survivor of the failed extraction. A jaded, chubby, French-accented viper.*
