Chapter 1

>The deep bass of the speakers reverberates through your body. The smells of weed, cheap beer, and vomit pierce the air like a knife. Despite the large crowd all around, you stand alone, sipping on… whatever hard alcohol is mixed in with this soda. 
>It tastes fucking awful, and you know you can't stomach any more of this rancid concoction that some alchemy major probably brewed up on the fly. Why did you come to this frat party again? 
>You sigh and look around for the nearest exit.  No sense sticking around for the rest of this trainwreck.
>Luckily, there's a window just a little ways away.
>Unluckily, you're gonna have to get past a couple sucking face to get there. Jesus.
>Moving with the erratic flow of the crowd, you elbow your way past the kissing couple, not particularly caring about interrupting them, and hop out the window.  Good thing this fraternity is only one floor tall…
>You dust off your old jeans and T-shirt, then sigh, looking back at the party overflowing onto the frat  house’s porch.  God, it doesn't even LOOK like a good time. The only ones even smiling are clearly baked out of their minds.
>The self-proclaimed “campus constable” strolls by, takes a look at the scene, then shrugs and walks away, muttering.
>”(Nope. Not even a single cute gal there, I'm not gonna bother.)”
>Great, not even THAT weirdo thinks this party is worth her time.
>Fuck it. You know a place where you can get a DECENT drink. A nice little hole-in-the-wall bar just off campus.
>No need to go back to your dorm and change. The bartender knows who you are and what your usual is. 
>You immediately trod off to the Tipsy Vixen. You know the way there by heart. It's the usual gathering spot for you and your friends. 
[https://youtu.be/HMnrl0tmd3k]
>This place is usually pretty bustling during the day, but at night?  It's a lot more mellow.  Hell, maybe even… melancholy at times.
>The bar is pretty much empty.  You suppose all the usual folks must be partying, what with exams just ending.
>Just you, a couple of old, white-haired regulars, and the bartender.  One fellow, a particularly gnarled gremlin with a wild shock of grey hair, nods at you in acknowledgement, coughing up a cloud of cigar smoke.
>”Evenin’ kid.”
>”Howdy, Gus.  Doin’ alright?”
>”Ehhhh… I guess I can't complain too much.  The ol’ Vix is still here, after all.  Huhuhuh.”
>”Heh, yeah, I feel you.”
>Gus looks up and catches the bartender’s attention, his yellow eyes glinting with a little mischief.
>”Ey, give the kid a round on me, wouldja?”
>He winks at you with a gruff chuckle.
>”Consider that a congrats from me on survivin’ another exam season.”
>”Thanks, old man.  I owe you one.”
>”Damn right you do, kid.  Damn right you do.  Huhuh.”
>You head up to the bar, where your usual is already waiting.  The lady behind the counter grins and nods at you.
>”That’s the usual, yeah?”
>”Heh, yeah.  You oughta know by now, bonehead, it's only the thousandth time I've been here.”
>”Nyeheh, well, I just wanna make sure, yeah?  Enjoy~”
>With that, the Hallow wanders off, polishing up some glasses.
>Normally you'd take a seat by Gus and his buddies… but… eh, for once, you'd rather just kick back and enjoy the night alone.
>Your grizzled pal tips his hat a little as you head off to the corner table, then returns to muttering to the other old farts sitting with him.
>You moodily stir your drink and just take in the music drifting from the old jukebox.
>...damn, why are you sitting here moping so much?  You should be happy, you just knocked out another semester, for fuck’s sake.
>Probably just that party.  Nothing worse than a bad party when it comes to getting you down.  You make a mental note to kick Tyler’s ass for insisting his party was gonna be lit this time.
>Oh well.
>You take a swig of your drink, only to almost choke when a loud wolf whistle catches you off guard.  What sounds like someone walking in high heels punctuates the whistling.
>You turn just in time to see an absolute bomb-shell ordering her drink.
>She’s definitely a goat anthro. Her fur appears to be a dusty gray, and by the looks of it, she's got cheeks that could kill a man if he were to have her sit on his face. 
>”...damn, what an ass…”
>The woman glances over her shoulder in your direction.  ...you said that out loud, didn't you.  Shit.
>She grabs her drink and sashays over to your table, taking a seat with a silvery laugh.
>”Did I hear you say something, hun?”
>”Uhhh, well…”
>”Cause, y’see, I coulda SWORN I heard you commenting on my ass.”
>”You're hearing things, lady.”
>She chuckles, grinning at you as she swirls her drink around in one hand.
>”What a shame.  I think you're kinda cute, but if YOU weren't the one who said that, I guess you're not interested in an old gal like me…”
>Holy crap. She's for real. Either she's looking for an easy college boy or just a night out with some drinks and fun. 
>Either way you aren't gonna let this opportunity slip by. 
>”I never said it wasn't me.” 
>Her smile widens a little.
>”Well, ain't that music to my ears~ What's your name, sugar?”
>”Uhh… it’s Brody…. B-Brody Matthews….”
>Play it cool, man. Don't mess this up. 
>”Well, ain't that a nice name…!”
>She downs her entire drink in one gulp, then grins.
>”Lemme introduce myself, sugar.  My name is Jiji~...”
>.........
>Bluh.  
>You wake up with one hell of a headache.
>What the hell happened last night… Where are you? 
>You scan the room around you carefully.
>Certainly not your dorm… it's too clean.
>The neat bedroom is decked out in shades of green, with fairly minimalist decor.
>It’s comfortably warm in here… especially compared to your eternally drafty dorm room.
>You hear someone snoring beside you, and soon notice there’s an arm wrapped around your middle.
>You crane your neck…
>You’ve become the little spoon to an absolute amazon of a woman, it seems.  She seems to be a goat Hallow…
>...wait, goat?
>...oh yeah… it's starting to come back to you now.  She must be that bombshell that came into the Tipsy Vixen last night.
>Ji…
>...the fuck was her name again?  God, your head hurts. You swear to God you're never drinking during the fall semester if you run the risk of feeling like this on a weekday morning. 
>You inadvertently groan in pain, and feel your partner stir.  She moves her arm off you, and you roll to face her properly.
>A low, cool voice speaks up.
>”Oh, good morning, sweetie~”
[https://youtu.be/yKKui-LzUxY]
>Looking at her face now, you notice a few… oddities.  
>She's got the requisite horns a goat should have, sticking straight out and sweeping towards the back of her head.  Her ears swivel and twitch as she yawns, with a small, silver piercing glinting in one of them.
>Her fur isn't EXACTLY grey, so much as a sort of dirty white with countless flecks of black.  Salt-and-pepper, you'd call it.
>Most strikingly, instead of hair, the woman has countless paper slips that form an imitation of a long, cascading hairstyle.  The papers even form long “bangs” that conceal her eyes completely.
>Each of the countless slips has a different inscription written on it in green ink, ranging from plain English to absurdly complex runes.
>Those… are paper talismans. 
>Wow, that's cool as fuck. You've only ever heard of them in theory, from studying up for Professor Cordy’s Magic History course...
>You'd like to ogle her a little more, but your head feels like it is about to explode.
>The goat lets out a little groan of sympathy.
>”Awww, you don't look too well, hun.  Let Mama take care of that headache for you.”
>She plants a kiss on your cheek, then rolls out of bed, giving you a clear view of her entire body.
>...and what a body it is, holy SHIT.
>You've seen some tall Hallows, but this woman?  She's got to be the absolute largest person you have EVER laid eyes on.  Her head very nearly scrapes the ceiling, even.
>Your eyes travel down her body, drinking in her dangerous curves.  They're BARELY held back by a green bathrobe, which hangs loosely on her shoulders.
>Damn.
>She heads off into another room, humming quietly, then rushes back in, her hooves clomping against the wood floor loudly.
>”Here you go, sweetie~”
>She hands over a steaming mug filled with a heated potion.  The liquid shimmers several different colors.
>Without hesitation, you down the whole mug.  A soothing warmth rushed over your entire body within seconds.
>The headache is still there, but you can feel it weakening already.
>”Better?”
>”Y-yeah.  Thank you.”
>She nods happily and sits on the bed next to you.
>”Don't mention it, sugar. Those old things work a lot faster when they're nice and hot.”
>The woman stretches, and her robe slips a little, letting an eye-poppingly huge tit slip out.  A black nip pokes out from among her fur teasingly.
>”Oh my~”
>You stare at her exposed breast. She doesn't even seem to care about her modesty, leaving herself exposed without so much as an attempt to pull her robe back into place.
>She chuckles at your dumbfounded expression, patting you on the head affectionately.
>”Yesterday was real fun, honey. How about I cook you some breakfast? Although… I doubt that you're very hungry with how much you ate last night~”
 >You follow her swaying hips out of the bedroom and into the kitchen. 
>”It looks like the daughter is out this morning. Too bad. I think she would've liked you.”
>”O-oh… You have a daughter!”
>The Hallow peers into her pantry; must be looking for something quick to fix for the both of you, you guess. 
>”Yes sir! She must be at school. She moved off a few years back, but she's been staying with me for a few months to study at good old PKU…”
>”Oh, that's nice… I'm there t-too.”
>The goat laughs again.
>”I know, sweetie.  I've seen you on campus.”
>”...what?”
>She turns to face you again, her paper talismans swaying.
>”Don't you recognize me…?  You've only had two of my courses in your career at Placid Knoll U.”
>Realization strikes like lightning as your head is abruptly cleared of your hangover fog.
>It's…!  
>It’s Professor Jiji?! The Enchanting Items professor?!
>You studied in her department for your first two semesters, but that was a long time ago… no wonder you didn't recognize her.
>Your mind races at max speed, throwing up one message in huge, neon lettering.
>YOU FUCKED ONE OF YOUR PROFESSORS LAST NIGHT
>Miss Jiji looks a little concerned for a moment, putting the back of her hand to your head.
>”Are you okay, sweetie?  You're pale…”
>”...I fucked one of my professors….. I'm so fucked…. Jesus H. Christ, th-this is… not good…!”
>”Take it easy, honey.  It's all going to be okay. Take a deep breath.  Deeeep breath.”
>You follow her orders, and calm down a little.
>”Now then. Sweetie, you're not going to get in trouble.”
>”H-how do you figure?!”
>She lets out a giggle.
>”Honey bunches. You aren't the first strapping young man I've picked up at the Tipsy Vixen.”
>Jiji motions to herself. 
>”But I wanted one last go before I really quit the bar pick-up scene. I figured an old gal like me wouldn't get many nibbles on her bait. And I didn't for a while. But then… you came along and ate me up~”
>Jiji pulls you into a hug, resting her massive bust atop your head.  
>”Thank you for showing a lady like me a good time.”
>Dear god, you hadn't realized just how HUGE she is until now… she really IS an amazon.
>You push lewd thoughts out of your head and back up from her a couple steps. 
>”Y-you're welcome, Professor. ...C-can we please put something in my stomach? I'm still kinda blitzed from last night…”
>She laughs heartily, patting your shoulder gently.
>”Of course, sweetie.  I know you humans don't handle your liquor as good as a Hallow.  And please, just call me Jiji~”
>”Okay then…”
>”...you're not still worried about getting in trouble, are you?”
>”...maybe a little?”
>”Oh, hun.  Do you think I'd let that happen?  Trust me, sweetie, everything will be alright. You just let me handle it… I've got… experience in this sort of thing.”
>”Th-thank you.”
>With a nod, Jiji serves up a hearty breakfast of bacon and eggs.  You immediately wolf down your plate, hoping to sober yourself up a little more.  Your hostess eats more slowly, humming a merry little tune to herself.
>Damn, Jiji is a great cook. M-maybe you could get breakfast from her again….
>No! Bad brain! She's university faculty! A leaked student-faculty relationship could mean the end of your social life.
>And possibly your college career… depending on PKU’s policies.
>After you both finish breakfast, she leads you back to her bedroom. 
>”Okay, sweetheart. We both need to get dressed. You'll probably need to be back at your dorm soon.”
>You just now think to look down… you're clad in some VERY ill-fitting pajamas made of green silk.  They’re fucking massive...
>The milf goat gives you a knowing smirk.
>”You can change in the bathroom if you’d like… or out here with me in the bedroom. Either way, I don't mind.”
>Fuck it. You shuffle off your borrowed pajamas and hear the sound of her robe hitting the floor….
>.... a little peek couldn't hurt… right…?
>You silently turn and face the woman that picked you up from the bar last night. 
>Her long paper talisman “hair” hangs down past her shoulders. Extra floofy gray wool covers her neck. Her salt-and-pepper fur is smoothed from her head to her hooves feet….
>And there are two other surprises that you don't remember from last night: the purple, runic markings on her fur that appear to be where her womb is… and a second pair of udder-like breasts that hang near her groin. 
>Huh. So goat Otherworlders DO in fact have a second pair of knockers. 
>Her hips are impressively wide, her thighs perfectly plump.  Combined with her awe-inspiring bust, she cuts an amazingly curvy figure that's only supported by her having a noticeable amount of padding on her belly.
>Oof. She's got the perfect mom bod…
>She doesn't even look back at you, but her little tail wags teasingly.
>”You know, Brody, it's a shame that you don't remember last night. You said all sorts of nice things about me~”
>”R-really…?”
>Jiji stops dressing herself for a few seconds. She seems… almost sad that this is coming to an end…
>”Oh yes~ You said that you loved my huge breasts. And that my motherly pudge was perfect...”
>Fuck. This is so embarrassing. 
>”...and you ESPECIALLY had a lot of kind words for my, ah, extra breasts~”
>”I-I’m sorry if I offended you by saying anything lewd…”
>”Offended?  Me?  Why, honey bunches… your words were the sweetest things I've heard in years…”
>You hear her sniffle a few times, and she wipes her obscured eyes.
>”You… you made this old gal feel so beautiful… thank you.”
>Wow. It seems that besides her daughter, she hasn't had much intimate interaction in a while. 
>That's… pretty sad considering her looks and occupation. You're surprised that she doesn't seem to be married… at least not currently.
>You finish getting dressed, and so does Jiji.  You take a deep breath… and go in for a hug.
>”Thanks for, uh… last night.  And breakfast.”
>”Think nothing of it, sweetheart. Thank you for giving me a good time~”
>Wow. As crazy as it seems… she really is sweet. She shouldn't have been at the bar last night looking for some chump like you. She should have been out on a date at a super nice restaurant or something…
>...
>”...hey, uh… c-can I ask you something?”
>”Yes?”
>Oh fuck.  Can you even go through with ASKING this…?
>”...w-would… uhhh… w-w-would you b-be opposed t-to… to us, uhhh… g-going out f-for dinner sometime…?”
>Fuck, way to sound smooth.
>......
>Her voice is as quiet as a whisper. 
>”......l-like a… real date….? You would want to go out in public and be seen with… this old maid?”
>”...y-yes.”
>She's silent for a long time.  You see a few tears flow down her face as she just stares quietly from behind those paper bangs.
>Jiji says nothing, but pulls you into an incredibly tight embrace.  She takes a long, shuddering breath, then answers in an extremely soft, wavering voice.
>”I-I would love that…”
>You still can't believe that you're still conscious. Time to round the bases and head home on this. Don't fuck this up, Brody Matthews!
>”Uh, o-okay. D-does tonight sound good..? I, uh, don't really have any obligations tonight, and it'll be my treat….”
>”That sounds fine… and don't worry yourself, honey, I'll buy your dinner~”
>Despite your very apparent dehydration from last night’s drinks, you're sweating buckets.
>”H-here. Let me write my number down… You can text me when you're, uh, free…”
>A few tears streak down Jiji's face as her voice cracks. 
>”I'll definitely…  let you know… when I'm free this evening.”
>...damn… this really is new to her, isn't it…?
>Was she really expecting you to just… leave…?
>How many guys have done just that to her?
>You can’t let that happen again. You've just met her, but… you're determined to help Jiji feel young and loved again. 
>”Consider it a date, Jiji. C-call me when you're ready. We'll both decide where we will eat.”
>The amazonian Hallow rubs her eyes and looks bashfully at her own foot-hooves. The insides of her ears flush a strange sort of greenish color.
>”A-alright, sweetie… I'll call you later.”
>You hand her your number, then head for the door.  You stop and look back to see her again wiping her eyes, this time also cleaning some tears off her glasses.
>”Hey, Jiji?”
>”...yes?”
>”See you tonight, b-beautiful.”
>With that, you rush off before you inevitably explode into pasta.
>You book it back onto PKU campus and sprint into your bedroom. 
>Looks like your friends were wrong. You ARE going to finally end your rejection streak with a date. 
>Just… not with any of the girls in your class

Chapter 2: First Date

>The time flies by, and before you know it, it's already almost time to call up Jiji to see if she's ready. 
>You're cold all over, sweating buckets. D-Damn your nerves. 
>In the middle of your dialing, your phone buzzes with a text.  
>Thank God. Your voice would probably be nothing but a series of nervous squeaks...
>”Hey, sweetie! It's Jiji! Ready for our hot date?”
>You send a pretty standard reply and quickly rummage through your closet for some half decent clothes. 
>A plaid button-up and one of your nicer pairs of black jeans will be good. It's not like you'll be going to a Michelin Star restaurant or something.
>You shoot her a quick text back to see if she's okay with where you've picked: 
>“Hey, Jiji, how do you feel about Schlittz and Giggles? I know it's not the fanciest place, but I wanted us to just have a no-pressure date.  No fancy clothes, no wine tasting, just you, me, and a pizza.”
>There's a short pause before she replies.
>”Lol, that place is a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine, anyway.  Sounds great, sweetie.”
>Phew.  You half expected to get shut the fuck down…
>”Alright, where do you want to meet up?”
>...
>”How about you come to my place? We can walk there together~”
>You nod and tell her that's fine, then set out.
>It’s only when you get outside that you realize how cold it is.  Fuck, your coat’s back up in your dorm, and you don't have time to go back for it.
>You're just gonna have to grin and bear it.
>Luckily, Jiji’s house isn't far from the campus.  You walk up to the humble little brick house and knock on the green door.
>Your date answers almost instantly. Was she just… standing there, waiting?
>Jiji smiles down at you as you take in her outfit.
>She's got on a VERY tight, green dress that's dangerously short, ending well above her knees. A generous amount of her cleavage is on proud display.
>She also has a little jacket on over the dress, a fashionable but obviously warm accessory.
>She's even traded out her normal pair of black-framed glasses for a green-framed pair.
>She definitely looks like she's ready for a night out on the town. 
>”Brody! You didn't bring a jacket? Aren't you cold?”
>You try not to sound like an idiot when you answer.  
>”Uh, I forgot it… In my dorm…”
>The towering anthro reaches behind her head. 
>”Just a sec, sweetie. Let Momma get you warmed up for our date~”
>Jiji tugs at the back of her head and yanks a talisman off. It's got a small campfire delicately drawn on it in shimmering green ink. She sticks it onto the back of your hand as she intertwines her fingers with yours. 
>”There we go. You should feel a little more comfy in no time. I can't have my strapping young man shivering in the cold!”
>All of a sudden, you feel yourself warming up as if you're sitting next to a fireplace. A magical aura of heat blankets you in the most comfortable way possible. 
>Faint orange sparks of magic occasionally waft away from your body, harmlessly fading away moments after meeting the open air.
>Jiji smiles down at you warmly.
>”Better?”
>”M-much. Thank you, Jiji.”
>”Awww, don't mention it, honey.  I couldn't let you just be cold now, could I?”
>She chuckles and pats your back merrily.  You laugh along with her, returning the gesture.
>You squeeze her hand in your own and silently enjoy the night as you both walk towards the restaurant. 
[https://youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5Pbug5nRw]
>The usual light fog has rolled in as the sun has set. The street lamps, dim and flickering as always, guide your way into town. 
>You've been to the pizzeria before, but it's been a while. It doesn't really surprise you that it's a favored place for Jiji. 
>Like the Tipsy Vixen, it's a hole in the wall that only seasoned locals really visit. None of that touristy dive bullshit. 
>The green neon lettering and bright yellow light-up pizza signal your arrival at the pizza place. 
>A man dressed in a sauce-stained t-shirt and ripped black pants greets you at the front of the store. 
>”Evenin’! Table for two I assume?”
>”Y-yes, please.”
>The host guides you both to a small table in the back of the dimly-lit establishment. You pull out Jiji's chair to let her sit down first, and then seat yourself. 
>The waiter, a white-haired Hallow who you swear you've seen drinking with Gus and his pals before, speaks up after you've both settled in. 
>”Nice of you to treat Mom to dinner, son! What can I get ya both to drink?”
>Holy shit; he must think you're her son, or step-son, or whatever. 
>Before you can fall out of your chair and curl up on the floor in embarrassment your date starts to giggle.
>”Meheh! Sorry honey, this isn't my son… Even though I let him call me ‘Mommy’ sometimes~”
>Oh dear lord.
>You feel your face practically burst into flames as a hard blush hits.  The waiter looks shell-shocked, standing perfectly still as his jaw flaps silently. Eventually, he seems to snap out of it, adopting a fake smile and a tone of pre-practiced enthusiasm.
>”W-well isn't that just dandy!  Haha… a-anyway, what'll you folks be drinking tonight….?”
>You and Jiji just order a couple of sodas for now.  The waiter shuffles off, sweating profusely, and returns with two large glasses.
>”Oh, honey, we only ordered mediums.”
>”O-oh, uh… we were out of medium cups, yeah.”
>The old fellow shoots you a wink and a grin as he heads off to take someone else’s order.  Jiji shrugs, but grins and takes a sip of her drink.
>”What do you wanna get, sweetie?  I'm game for whatever.”
>”...uh… let me think.  Does just a plain old pepperoni work for you?”
>”Hm.  Put some pineapple on there, and we're gold.”
>”Wh- you actually eat pineapple pizza?”
>”Of course I do!  You don't?”
>”W-well…”
>Your date’s voice picks up a more teasing tone, as does her grin.
>”You haven't even tried it, have you?”
>”Uhh…”
>”That's what I thought!  Tell you what: we'll get one with half pepperoni, half pineapple. Then you can see what you've been missing~”
>The goat leans in extra close as her voice drops to a whisper.
>”I'm surprised that you don't eat pineapple Brody! It makes you taste… sweeter. I know I do after eating a good bit~”
>”H-how… Y-you’ve… Wow…”
>The Hallow gives you a sly wink as you let certain images race through your mind.
>Goodness gracious. This woman is something else. 
>After a few more minutes of cheeky chit-chatting, the waiter returns for your order: one large pizza, half pepperoni and half pineapple. 
>”Don’t worry sweetie. If we can't finish it here, we can take it back to my place.”
>While you wait for the food to arrive, you decide to get to know Jiji a little more. Some back-and-forth questions seem like a good way to burn time.
>”So, uh, Jiji… H-how long HAVE you been teaching at PKU? I know you've been staffed there for a while… b-but I want to know more about you..”
>A deep blush immediately becomes apparent inside her long ears as she looks down at her hands. 
>”M-meheh. I might as well tell you. I've been teaching at Placid Knoll U for about, oh, twenty-six years now…? Yeah. About that long. I started as a TA in graduate school when I was studying Elemental Enchantments. My baccalaureate was in Magic History, if you could believe that! My first year as a TA was 1992… B-boy does time fly…”
>Your date continues to ramble on about her time when she was a student at PKU and some of her own personal experiences...
>”When I first started teaching, there was a nice young woman named Emmas. She was a Hellhound, transferred to PKU from the Underworld.  My goodness, she was so gorgeous. So very fit and muscular… in my youthful naivete, I thought that she might have been… well, the one. But like you, she was a student, and I was already a part of the faculty at that time. We had our... fun as the fling came and went. Our time together was special, and I'm still good friends with her. Even if our intimate relationship was rather short… I'm thankful for the time we had together. She eventually found a nice man, and I'm happy for her.”
>Recognizing a name, you half-jokingly add:
>”Emmas, like the Mayor’s first name?”
>Jiji’s blush intensifies wildly.
>”...y-yes, exactly.”
>”...wait. You don't mean…”
>”Yes, indeed; in her younger days, Mayor Brimstone… was my girlfriend.” 
>“No fucking way… That's… Incredible!”
>”H-ha, it's nothing special, really…”
>An uncharacteristically bashful smile crosses Jiji’s face as she twiddles her fingers.
>”Are you kidding?  Mayor Brimstone is a great lady; I had to interview her once for the college newsletter, and loved it.  A-and you aren't joking about those muscles… damn.”
>”Ha, well… she was a bit smaller back then.  But still a beautiful young woman.”
>Your conversation is temporarily put on hold as the piping-hot pizza is slid onto your table. 
>”H-here we are! One large p-pizza! Half-pepperoni and half-pineapple. Dig in!”
>Judging by the look on the waiter’s face, you'd wager he heard enough.  He hurries off the moment he sets the food down, leaving the two of you alone.
>”Oh dear, I rambled too long… and I didn't even let you talk about yourself!  Sorry, sweetie.”
>”No, no… it's fine, Jiji; I thought it was very, uh, interesting. To say the least.”
>You'll certainly never look at the Mayor the same way again…
>”Why don't you just share a little about yourself?  I'm sure you're just as interesting!”
>Aaaaand it looks like it's your turn in the spotlight. Don't choke, don't choke...
>”W-well, you already know my name… h-heheh…”
>Jesus Christ, don't weird her out now, man. 
>”I, uh, grew up in the States…. I-In the South, really…. I-I've always had a fascination with Otherworldly studies… Particularly the Arcane Arts. After my senior year in highschool, I got a scholarship to PKU and, y’know, that pretty much set my future in writing.  But then, when I got here, I ended up majoring in something a little different than I planned…”
>”Ah, that's right; you're studying Blue Magic, yes?”
>”T-that's right.  I just find it really fascinating, being able to mimic so many different things via magic.  I met a professional Blue Mage who could even give herself mock wings and such for days at a time…!”
>”Ha, yes, it's a fun field, to be sure! Myself, though, I enjoy my cozier field of enchanting items.  I DO have a bit of a natural advantage there, heehee!”
>She playfully runs a hand through her talismans; you notice that she takes good care not to expose her eyes…
>”Hey, that's a great one too.  Without enchanters like you, imagine where we'd be!”
>”You flatter me, sweetie. I'm just an old lady with a bunch of paper slips, nothing special.”
>You take one of her hands in your own. 
>”You're so much more than that, Jiji. You're a beautiful, kind woman, a mother, and a professor at one of the world's most prestigious magic universities.”
>She says nothing as she slowly tightens her grip around your hand. 
>.....
>”How about we eat this pizza, honey bunches? If you butter up this old maid any more, I just might drag you to the bathroom and jump your bone~”
>Oh goodness. 
>”W-well we haven't even taken a single slice yet… M-might as well eat…”
>Jiji takes a slice of the pineapple half and mercilessly chows down. She must have had just as much nerves as you, because you haven't eaten all day, barring the hangover-curing breakfast she cooked for you this morning. 
>May as well give the pineapple a fair shake…
>...eh.  It's not AWFUL, really, but not something you'd eat if you had a choice.
>Jiji smiles, apparently pleased that you at least gave it a shot.
>The two of you soon devour the whole pizza, idly chatting in the meantime.  When you're finished, Jiji excuses herself.  The second she's out of sight, the waiter wanders over.
>He glances back and forth, then leans in close, an excited gleam in his old eyes.
>”Hey kid, good job scoring that babe! Don't worry about your dinner, alright?  It's on me.  Any pal of Gus is a pal of mine. ESPECIALLY a young playboy like yourself, heheh. Ah, you remind me of when I was that age…”
>Jiji rounds the corner, and he cuts his reminiscing short.
>”Ah, anyway, you folks have a nice night!”
>The waiter practically sprints away as your date takes her seat.
>”Goodness! This place always has great food! I'm so glad that I could share tonight with you!”
>Jiji’s towering form leans over the table as she plants a solid kiss right on your lips. 
>You lean in and reciprocate the gesture. Fortunately nobody apparently notices or seems to care. 
>As she leans back, you swear she must have adjusted her top while she was in the bathroom or something. They seem… more pronounced than earlier. Almost as if they're pushed up a little more. 
>When you both stand up you catch a glance at something stuck to her chest. 
>Is that… a talisman she stuck to herself?
>You can't make out what's written on it…
>Jiji grins, apparently noticing your gaze.
>”See something you like~?”
>Distracted, you mutter:
>”(More like two things…)”
>Unfortunately for you, she heard.  The goat laughs heartily as you realize what just happened.
>Damn. That's the second time that's happened. 
>”It's okay, sweetie. I don't mind my man admiring the goods. If you really are a good boy I may even have some dessert for you~”
>Phew, this woman…!
>Jiji hugs you close, then pulls away.  She then looks off at something behind you.
>”...what's that over there, sweetie?”
>You turn to look, and hear a faint slap behind you.  When you turn back around, Jiji has an innocent smile on her face.
>It takes you a moment, but you soon notice that there's now a SECOND talisman stuck to her chest.
>And yep, they're even bigger now.
>”Sorry, honey-bunches, must’ve been my imagination, meheh~”
>You try to not make your ogling too obvious as you walk her back to her house. 
>You swear that green dress is going to fall apart any second now. Those two talismans are really pushing the envelope for that dress’ capacity. 
>Jiji was already blessed in the chest department, but now? She's practically bouncing out of her top with every step.
>Thankfully (or maybe sadly…), you make it back to her place without any wardrobe malfunctions. 
>As you both stand on her front porch, you wonder if you should try your luck again….
>On one hand, you're ninety-nine percent sure that she'd lay down and let you bone her until the sun came up. 
>On the other hand, you want to be a gentleman and wait. You both had a drunk hook-up just a day before. You don't want her to feel like some cheap easy lay. 
>In the end, you feel like you make the best choice. 
>For both you AND Jiji. 
>”Jiji. I just wanted to say that I had a lot of fun.
It was nice getting to know you a little more…. A-and I'd like us to do it again… a-as an official couple. We're both adults here, and u-understand what we're getting into. A-and I th-think I want to be a part of your life… I-in a serious, committed relationship.”
>The towering Hallow goes silent.  She starts to shake slightly, then nearly collapses onto you, pulling you into an almost painfully tight hug.
>”Y-y-you… you really m-mean it?!”
>”...Yes, I d-do.”
>She squeezes you even tighter, her magically-enhanced bust resting atop your head comfortably.
>”You… you h-have no idea… how m-m-much this means to me.  Thank you.  Th-thank you so much…”
>”Thank YOU, Jiji.  F-for taking a chance on me, and giving me the best dinner date I've been on in… well, uh, ever, really.”
>Jiji looks at you incredulously.
>”A-are you serious?”
>......
“Y-yeah… I am.”
>The goat woman continues to embrace you. You feel her shuddering breaths steady out as she composes herself.
>W-well if… if you want to come inside…  I, uh, can make us some hot coffee if you'd like…”
>You know what she's hinting at, and you don't want to use her like that. 
>Not tonight. She is you girlfriend now, after all.
>”H-haha. M-maybe next time, Jiji. I appreciate the offer, though. 
>”Well I can't let my stud leave totally empty-handed, can I?”
>Without warning, Jiji pulls the top of her dress down, letting you get an eyeful of her massive, magically-engorged mammaries. They bounce free of their containment in a tantalizing show of jiggling and wobbling.
>”Maybe next time you'll get a good look at the other pair. And who knows… maybe even a taste~”
>Your unsaid question is answered when she gently pulls a talisman off her head and holds it out. 
>It's a cute little picture of a cow. 
>Dear God. This woman is going to be the death of you. 
>...but you sure as shit aren't going to complain.

Chapter 3 

>So. With the first date officially in the books, and you successfully bagging a bombshell MILF girlfriend, you start doing everything you can to help her feel younger again. 
>You continue to go on more dates. Whether it be the bowling alley, the local bar, or even just hanging out at her house. You make it your mission to show Jiji that she's still got it in her to have some genuine fun, even after all these years...
>It's kind of weird.  For as much as she puts herself down, Jiji can still keep pace with you with no problem. Hell, she's actually probably better suited to partying than YOU are; she's got experience.
>On an unusually warm December day, you decide to take her out again for a date night. You're spending most of the winter break days around her now that you're in a committed relationship. 
>”H-hey Jiji. Did you ever g-go to the clubs when you were younger?”
>The goat woman scoffs and tilts her head back. 
>”Brody, sweetie, I practically lived at the clubs and bars when I was your age! I, ah, doubt I could still pull the same moves now as I did back then on the dance floor, but you should've known that I practically OWNED the night life back in my day!”
>A wide smile spreads across her face as she reminisces. 
>”Meheh, I used to be the last one out of those clubs some nights.  I'd show up to work late the next day, told the President I was sick, meheheh! ...I'm still not sure if she actually believed me or if she was just kind enough to let me off the hook anyway.”
>”Well, how would you like to hit one w-with me tonight?”
>”Sounds like a great time, sweetie. Let me change into something more… ah, suitable, then we'll head out.  Make yourself home while I'm gone! You know the drill~”
>You decide that the v-neck and ripped designer jeans you're wearing are suitable enough. Not like the club has a dress code...
>While you wait for your date, you have a seat on her couch, sinking into the cushions, as always. You chuckle and lovingly run a finger over the permanently-affixed talisman stuck to the side of it.
>You've grown to admire Jiji’s ability to put enchantments in even the least-serious looking inscriptions; her couch’s talisman literally just has SOFT written on it in comically flowery cursive.
>Hey, it works; why question it?
>She actually removed it once to show you how well it worked; this old sofa is like a damn brick without her magic touch…
>You let your hands sink into the plush cushions, your mind wandering.
>Mm, imagine if Jiji used this talisman on herself… what would THAT be like…? Sounds like a worthwhile experiment… f-for research, of course, not so you can literally bury your face in your girlfriend’s fluffy wool.  H-ha...
 >Your thoughts are interrupted by the bedroom door creaking open. You hear the telltale clack of Jiji's foot-hooves on the wood floors. 
>”S-so how do I look? I, uh, haven’t tried this thing on in….  A long time…”
>And you thought the green dress she wore to Shlitzz and Giggles looked good on her. 
>A sheer-cut, black dress hangs over her motherly form. As she spins around, you notice that there are deep V-shaped cuts in the chest as well as along the back of the chest. The cut in the chest goes SO deep, in fact, that it even shows off some underboob. 
>She's definitely not wearing a bra under the sheer fabric, because her breasts bounce freely underneath the minimal covering straps of cloth that cover them. There is also a tantalizingly high cut on the bottom of her dress. As she poses for you, a dangerous amount of thigh is shown from out of the cut. 
>Mercy, please.
>A blush comes to the inside of her ears as she smiles.
>”Well…?”
>”Y-you… uh… l-look g-g… g-gre… you're fucking beautiful!”
>You clap a hand over your mouth and blush as Jiji breaks out into her usual bleating laughter.
>”Meheheh! You're too sweet, honey-bunches. I'm just glad this old thing still fits me…!”
>Boy, does it fit her. You're pretty sure you might even have to keep a few folks away from her if you let your guard down. 
>”I, uh, have… never been clubbing. B-but some of my friends go to the Red Tide if they want to have fun…”
>A glint appears in Jiji's eyes as soon as you mention the name. 
>”The Red Tide? I remember when that place opened up! ...I maaaay have convinced Emmas to let me take body shots off of her the one time we partied there~”
>Oof. Y-you might have to see if you can do the same…
[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ua33ffcq8n0]
>After an uneventful walk, you arrive at the club.
>The whole place, as the name suggests, is bathed in red neon lights.  The bass from the speakers pumps energetically; Jiji almost immediately picks up on the beat, bobbing her head and grinning.
>The decor is pretty gaudy and colorful, but everything is tinged a hysterical red thanks to all the colored bulbs.
>The club is… surprisingly sparse of party-goers.  There are a few folks here, but not nearly as many as you had anticipated.
>The dance floor is pretty dead for the moment… that won't last long if you can help it.
>Jiji puts a hand on your shoulder with a nod.
>”Let's grab a couple drinks first, shall we?”
>The two of you make your way over to the bar, where a few people idly sip their drinks, bobbing their heads or tapping their feet.
>”Bartender! Mind giving me and my strapping young man something? I'll take a shot of Cîroc. What do you want, sweetness?”
>Fuck it. Time for some liquid courage. 
>”I'll have a London Mule.”
>A very chipper voice speaks up from somewhere behind the counter.
>”Comin’ right up!”
>Suddenly, a woman pops up from beneath the bar, grinning almost literally ear to ear.
>Her eyes glimmer with enthusiasm as she mixes up your drinks, whistling a happy tune loudly.
>While she works, you can't help but stare a little, mainly thanks to her… uh, loud appearance.
>Even in the red light of the club, you can tell this canine lady’s fur is blue, in the most literal sense of the word.  She must spend a fuckton on fur dye… 
>Some unusual patterns run through her fur; lines, spirals, curves, all apparently drawn on in black, red, or white.
>...well, you HAVE heard of some Otherworlders getting “fur tattoos,” but… aren't those super expensive?  How could a bartender at a club afford THAT much, uh, ink?
>Her outfit is also very blue, and is EXTREMELY tight-fitting; hell, her top and shorts almost look painted on.
>A little blank nametag is pinned to her shirt, showing that she at least works here. 
>Once she serves your drinks, the woman’s eyes dart back and forth a few times. 
>The glasses she hands the both of you are filled with blue-tinted liquid….
>You're pretty sure that neither gin nor peach-flavoured vodka usually have blue food coloring in them….
>How long has this weirdo had her bartending license?
>The blue coyote interrupts your train of thought. 
>”Alrighty then! ...say, Spelltag, how's the girlfriend doing?”
>Jiji’s ears blush again.
>”...c-come again? Do I know you?”
>”Nope!  Well, maybe~ Don't you remember the day this place opened?”
>”...yes, but, you surely aren't old enough to have BEEN there, are you, dear?”
>The blue-furred canine shrugs and snickers.
>”What can I say? When you drink like I do, you just don't age like other folks, gah-hah-hah! I made this little cocktail up years ago… I call it the Martian Mule Deer; I'm pretty sure it's why I still look good. But, I'm rambling… so you and Muscles aren't a thing anymore?”
>”I… I’m afraid not…”
>”Aww, that's a shame.  It’s funny… I'm pretty sure I saw your ex-lover around here somewhere…”
>Suddenly, a booming voice rings out from behind you, making you flinch and nearly choke on your drink.
>”JIJI!?  IS THAT YOU?”
>You turn around… and feel your jaw drop a little.
>Holy fuck, It's the Mayor.
>While she's only as tall as you, her physique is something that would make any amateur bodybuilder blush. Her smartly-styled shirt sleeves are rolled up, showing off her steely arms. Her sheer dress bottom shows off strong, muscular legs. It's very obvious that she's kept herself in great shape.
>S-she looks like she could break you in half with just her bare hands...
>A man who appears to be about her age has his arm around her waist. That's probably her husband. 
>”Emmas, Michael! What a welcome surprise!”
>Your date quickly throws back her drink, runs over to her friend, and gives her a tight embrace. The bartender winks at you with a mysterious grin, then ducks back behind the counter with a chuckle.
>What a weirdo…
>The mayor reciprocates the hug, very nearly lifting the amazonian Hallow off the ground in the process.
>When the Hellhound releases your date, she turns to you with a fanged, friendly smile.
>”An’ who's this, Ji? Your daughter’s boyfriend?”
>The motherly goat laughs and smiles almost… smugly when she replies.
>”Not quite, meheh!  This is Brody, and he's MY boyfriend, Em.”
>The Mayor looks shocked for a moment, her red eyes darting back and forth between you and your companion frantically.
>”Oh. My. God! Ji, you crazy girl! You've wrangled yourself a cute little man there!”
>Your face burns with embarrassment. It's a fucking good thing that the artificial light masks your blush because you're pretty sure you're as red as a tomato. 
>The two women walk back to the bar while you shake Michael's hand. 
>”So…. You and Jiji, huh? I don't think I caught your name.”
>”Brody. Brody Matthews.”
>Michael's hand is fairly rough and calloused. He must be a pretty hard worker… 
>He wears a wide, genuine smile as he looks you in the eyes. 
>”Michael Brimstone. Nice to meet you, man.”
>”Huh. You took her last name, Sir?”
>Michael lets out a chuckle. 
>”Please. Don't call me ‘sir’. I’m your friend, not your father… Yeah. It's Underworld tradition to take the female’s last name. She IS the link to the next line of family members after all.”
>”Huh. I wouldn't have pegged the Mayor as a traditionalist.”
>”Oh, absolutely. Demons take that stuff very seriously. I'm certainly not gonna argue, heh.”
>The both of you glance over at Jiji and Emmas. Their laughter is mostly drowned out by the pounding music, but they both look ecstatic to see each other. 
>”You know…” your new friend pauses for a moment. ”We hadn't seen Jiji for a good while. It's nice to see her out and having actual fun for once. After her husband left, she changed… almost as if she was afraid of becoming one of those old babushkas you see on television. An old, boring woman. She dressed more provocatively, went to the bars constantly, and picked up a good share of guys… But you. You're different. You're helping her discover that it's okay to get older. And that with age comes grace.”
>You swig down the rest of your mule and ponder his words. 
>”I, uh, just wanted to show her how beautiful she really is. I DID pick her up on a whim while pounding some drinks at the Tipsy Vixen, but there's something about her that enchants me… Maybe it's her refusal to conform to what some in society might come to expect with her age and profession… I don't know… What I DO know is that she's a wonderful person and I want to be with her.”
>The man lets off a fatherly chuckle and slaps your back heartily.
>”You seem like a good kid, Brody. I honestly believe that you might be a good fit for Ji.” Mike lays an arm around you and leans in close. 
>”But if you break her heart, I'll have to let old Nurse Carrie gut you into a million tiny pieces. Nothing personal!”
>It takes a moment, but the second you put a face to that name, you realize what a grave threat that is.
>Michael guides the two of you back to the bar where the ladies are still chatting and giggling. They order you all a round of shots. 
>The grinning bartender winks at you again, audibly suppressing a snicker. The hell is wrong with this woman…? 
>Maybe she's just part hyena or something… You hear her lean in near the girls with a pleading look. 
>”Aww, come on! One more, for old time's sake! ...Tell ya what: if you do it, the next two rounds are on me!”
>The Hallow and Hellhound look at each other with shy grins. Jiji speaks up over the pulsing bass. 
>”Okay, lady! J-just this once! F-for old time's sake.”
>Suddenly the two women stand up and face the three of you. Jiji quickly lifts the bottom of her dress while Emmas lifts her blouse. 
>Aaaaaaand Jiji’s not wearing any panties. Emmas’ washboard abs and perky tits are on full display for the rest of you to ogle. 
>Holy. Fucking. Shit. 
>But this spooky ride apparently isn't quite over. 
>The Hellhound quickly jumps onto the bar countertop and lays upward. Her shirt is still pulled up a little. 
>The coyote bartender dumps a shot glass worth of alcohol onto her abs, where it pools around her navel. Jiji quickly swoops down and drinks the body shot off of Emmas’ rock solid body. 
>Both girls quickly readjust themselves and immediately return to their barstools as if nothing ever happened. The bartender’s smile almost literally stretches ear to ear as she wheezes loudly, fighting back tears of laughter.
>.....
>.................
>.......................................
>You and Michael stare dumbfounded. 
>”W-we should come here more often.”
>Both Jiji and Emmas’ faces are hidden in their hands. It's pretty apparent that they're both absolutely embarrassed by their antics. 
>”Hey! I'm gonna keep my word, guys and gals!”
>The bartender pops open some Maker's Mark and slides all of you two full shot glasses each of the brown liquid. 
>Fuckit. You plan on having as much fun as possible. 
>You quickly slam your shots down and throw your arm around your date. All the drinking is really taking its number on you. You're not stupid drunk yet, but your body feels pretty numb and restless. 
>Yup. You're pretty lit. Time to hit the dance floor. 
>Or it would be, if you didn't have two left feet. M-maybe Jiji’s buzzed enough not to notice your limp flailing...
>The moment you step onto the brightly lit dance floor, Jiji strolls over, smiling at you and giggling.
>”Did you enjoy the show, honey-bunches~?”
>”...u-uh, yeah… heheh.”
>”Meheheh! I, ah… I wasn't planning for that to happen, but… oh, to hell with it; it was so liberating! It's good to see Em’s still got that body she had all those years ago…”
>Your date stares over at the athletic Hellhound as Michael and his wife dance. Jiji then turns to you, beaming as she wraps an arm around you.
>”We’re not gonna let them be the cutest couple here, are we? Let's show them how it's done, sweetie!”
>With that, you attempt to outdance Michael.
>Key word here being “attempt”.
>The man isn't really even dancing that well; you just suck worse. Jiji still smiles encouragingly, dancing around you and occasionally grinding her rear up against you lewdly. 
>Mayor Brimstone catches sight of this and chuckles heartily, eventually winking and imitating the gesture on her husband, who grins at you helplessly.
>The two women share a look, then grin devilishly, apparently silently kicking off a competition.
>Oh boy.
>Jiji quickly drops any and all subtlety in her moves, practically running her hands all over your body.
>Not to be outdone, Emmas strips her buttoned shirt off, tossing it aside and flaunting her chiseled body.
>The two women dance around their respective dates for what feels like hours; by the time they stop, you're ready for… well, something a little more fun than just dancing.
>It seems you're not alone either.
>The Mayor lifts her husband over her shoulder and marches off into a private VIP room, her forked tongue lolling from her mouth as she goes.
>She keeps enough self awareness to drape her shirt over the doorknob, at any rate…
>Jiji watches this display quietly, but you feel her grip on your shoulder slowly tighten. After a while, she smiles down at you.
>”Well, I guess they win, honey-bunches… but… how opposed would you be to… getting a little consolation prize back at my place~?”
>With literally no hesitation, you answer.
>”Hell yes. Let's go.”
>You take Jiji's hand in your own and immediately leave the club. As you pass by the periodic street lamp you eventually notice something. 
>There's a rather noticeable line of… fluid… running down her leg…
>Whether it's the alcohol fueling your courage or just you nutting up, you're not sure. But you feel absolutely compelled to have a taste. 
>Sure you have a consolation prize at the house. But who can you blame for such a teasing sample bouncing right next to you. 
>Your date lets out a muffled “Eep!” as you spank her ass and quickly rub a finger across her sopping wet snatch. 
>She tastes so different… so foreign. 
>You need more. 
>You're both practically dragging each other to the house now. Both trying to claim your prize as soon as possible. 
>A concern suddenly interrupts your lewd train of thought.
>”W-wait! Jiji! What about your, uh, daughter!”
>The amazonian goat looks down at you with a positively wicked smile. 
>”I think Angela can deal with Mommy's moans for one night. She's a big girl and knows that I get what I WANT~”
>The two of you finally reach the front doorstep, but before you can throw yourself inside, your date picks you up off the ground and wraps her arms around you in a tight embrace. 
>”You're so nice, Brody… W-we can put this off if you have second thoughts about this…”
>”Why would I have second thoughts about making love to one the most beautiful woman I've ever seen? I'm absolutely ready, Jiji, as long as you are.”
>...............
>Your date says nothing as she mashes her face into yours. Your tongues collide and fight for dominance as you sloppily make out on the porch. 
>The two of you sneak inside without so much as a peep. The kitchen clock reads 0200, so hopefully Angela is fast asleep. 
>As you walk, Jiji quietly peels off her outfit, which… doesn't take long.
>You wait until you step into her cozy bedroom to get undressed, yourself.
>As you shed your pants and shirt, you look over to your girlfriend. 
>”I've, uh, never gotten this far with… anyone.”
>Jiji puts a finger to your lips. 
>”Shhhh. Don't worry about that. Just let Mommy take care of all the work.”
>Jesus Christ. 
>Your naked lover lays on the bed face-up, her heavenly figure on full display.
>”So, which hole do you want, sweetie?”
>You want to immediately dive in and to go to town on her, but you want to build up the moment. 
>You lay across her form backwards. Your head is pointed towards her feet. 
>She lets out a little giggle. 
>”Is my man hungry? Well it's a good thing I've got a nice tasty snack for him right…. Here~”
>You hear a “slap” as a cow talisman is stuck onto her chest.
>Jiji starts to put her hand on the back of your head, but before she can push you down you're already eating her out like a starving animal. 
>”O-oh! Goodness, Brody! You're so good! Work that precious tongue you ha-ahh~”
>You give her lower pair of teats a kiss and hard suckle as you give your girlfriend the attention she deserves. 
>You taste her milk and swap between her wonderful lower breasts and her pussy.  
>First you try the alphabet. Then numbers. Then shapes. Anything that comes to mind. 
>The flavour of her love juices and milk are addicting. 
>Before you know it, her massive bust is shaking around you as she gently holds you back by your hair. 
>”W-whew, tiger! Don't get too far ahead of yourself! You've still gotta finish and feel good, too~”
>The huge goat shifts herself so you are now on the bed with her towering over you.
>...Do you hear a sloshing noise? Huh. Must be your imagination or something. 
>Jiji effortlessly lifts you so that you are sitting closer to the edge of the bed while she kneels on the floor. 
>”Time for your prize, sweetie~”
>Before you can do anything, the milf takes your rock-solid member into her mouth. 
>You hear her gag a little as you hit the back of her throat, but it only seems to spur her onward. 
>Her massive breasts sway as she sucks you off. Her hard nipples leak small trails of milk…
>She pulls away for a moment to speak, voice smooth and seductive.
>”Your Mommy needs her late night snack…”
>Jiji continues to lewdly suck on your dick as you nearly pass out from pleasure. 
>It feels like it's been hours since you both stripped and started fooling around. 
>”Jesus, Jiji. I-I'm close…”
>She immediately doubles down on her pace. The lewd sucking noises are too much. 
>Jiji lets off a muffled moan as you begin to shoot load after load into her mouth. Her audible swallowing proves that she's seriously into this. 
>Though her paper bangs conceal her eyes, you can tell she's making eye contact as she gulps down every single drop of what you have to offer.
>Dear lord, this woman.
>Your vision fades as you become engulfed by pleasure. 
>”Hehe! Thanks for the meal, babe~”
>You're almost too dazed to respond at all.
>The bed creaks a little as you feel your girlfriend slide on.
>Her nine foot frame totally encompasses you as she holds onto you as the big spoon. 
>........................
>”Thank you, Brody… I… I love you.”
>You snuggle in close with her, letting her bust smoosh against your head. 
>”I love you too, so very much, Jiji.”

Chapter 4: The Morning After

>A raven caws outside loudly as a new day dawns on Placid Knoll. The harsh rays of the early morning sunshine creep through the blinds and strike your face. 
>”Ugh. Five more minutes… C-can you close the blinds, Jiji?”
>Your question goes unanswered as you reach over and try to smother yourself between her voluminous breasts. Those two massive pillows should be MORE than enough to shield you from the invasive sun...
>The problem is that you don't feel two nice, milky tits to fall back asleep between. 
>As a matter of fact. You're completely alone in the bed. 
>You slowly open your eyes and sit up. As you continue to wake up and gather your bearings you hear a faint noise coming from the kitchen. 
>Huh. You bet that Jiji or Angela is making breakfast. 
>You throw on your boxers from last night and trudge into the kitchen. You're immediately hit with an array of wonderful smells. 
>Grits, eggs and cheese, bacon, and sausage. 
>A familiar tune plays from a small record player on a side table in the kitchen. 
[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6l6vqPUM_FE]
>You see your favorite salt-and-pepper goat chopping up what appears to be some bell peppers. Her back is towards you. 
>The kitchen's island separates you from her, and it appears as if she isn't wearing a shirt under the apron. Her heavy breasts sway back and forth freely as she prepares the breakfast. 
>You slink past the island and realize that she's wearing NOTHING besides the apron. 
>Jiji lets out a soft hum of appreciation as you hug her large form from behind. You bury your face into the fur of her back and press yourself against her. 
>”Good morning sweetie. Looks like you're awake and ready for breakfast~”
>You don't even try to hide your morning wood as it presses against the bottom of her plush rump. 
>Because of your rather severe size difference, you’d have to jump up a little to really get frisky. 
>But that doesn't stop Jiji from crouching ever so slightly, pretty much aligning you with her from behind. 
>”What are you waiting for, Brody? Angie probably won't be up for a little while longer, and you've sparked this old gal's heart. Now it's time to set me ablaze…”
>........................
>”Make love to me…”
>You nip her back with your teeth and slowly enter her. It's nothing like you’ve ever imagined.
>Your arms wrap around her waist and greedily grab at her paunch and lower breasts. 
>She's so… WARM. You feel like you're going to melt into a puddle of nerves as you build yourself into a slow rhythm, subconsciously matching the record playing...

>Your slow thrusts are punctuated with soft gasps and whimpers. You breathe heavily and try to avoid passing out at all costs. 
>As quick as the moment started, it comes to a close as you quickly find yourself coming to a climax. 
>”J-Jiji. Unf, I'm gonna-”
>”It's okay, sweetie. Cum inside of Mommy~”
>Her honeyed words of encouragement make you weak at the knees as you nearly fall down and finish inside her. You both immediately pepper each other with kisses and whispers of sweet nothings. 
>As she looks down at you, her paper bangs part for a split second, and you catch a fleeting glance at her eyes. 
>They're… not what you expected at all.
>Rather than having clear irises and whites, her eyes are both a chaotic swirl of green and purple, without so much as a pupil to ground things. Her eyes almost seem to… spiral… as she looks down, the colors shifting and moving slowly.
>The moment she realizes you can see her eyes, Jiji seems a little panicked. She quickly pulls her bangs back over them with an embarrassed sound.
>”Jiji. What are you doing?”
>”N-nothing, Brody. J-just making sure you get my ‘good side’… H-haha…”
>You turn off the griddle, reach up, and part her hair.
>Jiji’s usually confident attitude seems to almost immediately melt away as she fidgets uncomfortably.
>”...c-can you… please not do that, honey-bunches…?”
>You stare, transfixed, into her eyes as they swirl about. Your girlfriend sighs shakily and gently fixes her bangs once again, this time straightening up a little so you can't reach them.
>”...th-there… now you don't have to look at those weird things anymore…”
>She frowns for a while, but eventually puts on a little smile, throwing an arm around your waist.
>”Thank you for the morning time fun, sweetie. I really needed that~”
>Your mind is a blur, partially because it's still early, partially because you're still reeling from your climax. Either way, you can't focus on anything but the mental image of Jiji’s eyes.
>”...your eyes are beautiful, Jiji.”
>The record stops at the perfect moment, it seems. Jiji pauses for what feels like several minutes.
>”...R-really?”
>You squeeze her tightly in a loving embrace. Your hands roam her motherly form. 
>”Of course. And please don't ever think differently.”
>A noticeable blush comes to the insides of her ears. 
>”W-well… if you say so...”
>You adjust your underwear accordingly and allow your girlfriend to finish cooking the breakfast. This time she doesn't shield her eyes from you as they come into view. 
>That said… she still seems a little self conscious of them. You get the impression she's trying to avoid eye contact as she cooks, keeping you either behind her or off to one side, minimizing how clearly you can see those gorgeous eyes.
>You decide to not press the issue any further as she sets the table and dishes out your fair share of the food. 
>”I'll be right back sweetie. I should get dressed. I'm pretty sure Angie wouldn't want to see her mom naked and full of seed. Unless you want to make her jealous~”
>”H-haha. Y-you should probably get SOMETHING on. I think I'd die of embarrassment.”
>Your girlfriend giggles, but leaves the kitchen momentarily. You almost immediately hear Angela's bedroom door open. 
>Jiji's daughter looks fairly similar to her mother. Both have that grayish salt-and-pepper wool color (as well as large chests). However, Angela's horns spiral backwards rather than staying straight, and she is missing the paper talismans atop her head. Instead, silvery-gray hair flows down to her shoulders. 
>Angela is also considerably shorter than her mother, standing at most 10 inches taller than you, whereas Jiji is… well, a lot more than that.
>”Is it over…?”
>It takes a quick second to register as to what she's referring to...
>”Uh… Y-yeah. Nothing going on here!”
>The goat sighs and rubs her temples.
>”God, I’m sorry you have to deal with her and her, uh… whatever the hell you wanna call it. Hormones, midlife crisis, I don't even know anymore.”
>Angela sits herself down and fixes herself a plate of food. Her running shorts and tank top leave little to the imagination. 
>Before you dig yourself an early grave with awkward small talk, Jiji comes back into the kitchen. 
>”Good morning, Angie! I see you've made yourself a plate already. Dig in!”
>Like her daughter, Jiji wears a tank top that's dangerously small
>She's only wearing a pair of panties to cover her bottom. Her motherly paunch hangs over her panty line, and it looks like there are special pockets sewn into her panties to hold her lower self of breasts. 
>Goodness gracious. 
>You try not to stare at the three pairs of barely-contained knockers. 
>”Soooo, uh, Jiji. H-have any place in particular that you might want to visit today?”
>Your girlfriend ponders for a minute while you pick at your eggs. 
>”How about a shopping day? I still have to get my strapping young man a present for Christmas. It IS just a few days away!”
>Holy crap. You totally forgot that Christmas is almost here. 
>Angela cringes a little at Jiji’s complimenting of you, but her mother seems to ignore that.
>”Okay, Jiji. That actually sounds like a, uh, pretty good idea.”
>Your girlfriend claps her hands together happily, sending her massive bust into a bit of a jiggling fit. It's… VERY hard not to stare.
>”Great! Let me just find a coat, and we'll head out.”
>You follow Jiji to her bedroom, where she dresses herself for your outing. 
>”So, Brody! Did you have any place in particular that you wanted to visit first?”
 >”H-how about we just hit up the PK mall and work our way out along the outlet stores? I'm sure we can find something worth gifting to each other.”
>As you throw your shirt from yesterday on, you notice that Jiji is carefully adjusting her “hair” so that her eyes remain hidden. 
>”Jiji. You remember what I said earlier about your eyes?”
>She immediately stops and looks back to you. 
>”Y-yes?”
>You walk in front of her and part her bangs. 
>”Please, Jiji. Don't be afraid.”
>She looks down at you somewhat sadly, sighing.
>”...I… I'm n-not afraid. I just… would r-rather keep these freakish things hidden. You shouldn't have to l-look at them…”
>”...Jiji, they're not freakish. Your eyes are beautiful, I've never seen anything like them.”
>”...yes, well… they're a result of, well, this.”
>She gestures at her mass of talismans.
>”All these enchantments, they made my eyes this way. Th-they're horrible, I know. I was told that many times growing up… and even… even in my adulthood, a few times.”
>A few tears run down her cheeks. 
>...who could ever insult someone as kindhearted as Jiji? 
>You wrap your arms around her tightly, pulling her into a warm embrace.
>”They were wrong. You're not a freak, and your eyes aren't horrible. You're a wonderful woman with gorgeous, exotic eyes. I love them, and I love you.”
>The tears stop running down her face as she composes herself. 
>”What did I ever do to deserve you?”
>You lift yourself off the ground, stretching in an attempt to get eye-level with her. 
>”You gave me a chance to be your boyfriend… Not some cheap easy hook up at after a few drinks. Not some easy lay to never call back. You are… No. WE are the real deal. Come on, Ji. Let's finish getting dressed and go have some fun.”
>Jiji takes your words to heart as she rummages through the closet, emerging with a pair of well-fitted jeans to go with the white tank. 
>As you both leave the house you extend an invite to Angela, who is still sitting at the table, absentmindedly munching on a small slip of paper along with some grits. 
>”Uh, no thanks, guys. I think I'll sit this one out. The boyfriend and I have plans.”
>You hear Jiji snicker as you both exit through the front door. 
>You both walk to the mall side by side, holding hands. 
>”It's funny. I'm pretty sure that Angie doesn't have a boyfriend right now~ I mean, it's her fault for not using discrete packaging when she ordered that toy.”
>You begin to sweat a little bit at the thought of Angie having fun in the house while you both are gone. 
>Jiji notices your expression and guffaws loudly. 
>Before you even realize it, you arrive at the Placid Knoll Centre. 
>Well, calling it a “mall” is a bit of a stretch. It's more like a small strip of shops in the middle of downtown Placid Knoll. But then, pretty much everyone you know calls it either a mall or a marketplace.
>Hell, the street’s called “Market Street” anyway.
>All manner of Hallows bustle about, preparing for Christmas, presumably. At the end of the street, the ever-ominous Placid Knoll Memorial Hospital stands, looming over the town.
>It looks like every shop is open and crowded. Even the curse shop is packed, oddly enough.
>It looks like the shopkeep there, a friendly (if creepy as hell) orange cat is out front greeting everyone. You double take when you realize she's standing outside in nothing more than a Santa hat. 
>You made the typical mistake that lots of humans do when visiting PK for the first time and visited that damn shop. 
>What's even worse was that you actually BOUGHT a curse that she had for sale. 
>Let's just say that you shouldn't use your own lock of hair when checking to see if a voodoo doll works…
>The shopkeep… what's her name, Firth…? Something like that. 
>She's always weirded you out. Today is no exception, as she glances over at you with that big, glassy, green eye. 
>She stares for a moment, tongue slightly poking out of her mouth, then returns to greeting folks like nothing happened. What a creep…
>You shake your head and focus on the shop Jiji is heading into: the local blacksmith’s place.
>...wait, what?
>”Jiji, what are you looking for in here?”
>”Hm? Oh, I have a friend at work who likes the knives they sell here.”
>”Oh, I see.”
>The two of you step into the humble little shop.
>It's very crowded inside considering the limited space; easily 15 people are crammed in here, not counting the blacksmith herself.
>She stands behind the counter, towering over everyone in the room but your girlfriend, who actually has her beat out by a handful of inches.
>That said, the sabertooth’s muscular build could rival even Mayor Brimstone.
>Though a mass of bandages cover her eyes, a look of deep concern, and perhaps even… fear is apparent on the shopkeep’s face.
>Poor gal must be overwhelmed at the crowd.
>Jiji politely excuses her way through the mass and makes her way to the front with a knife she's picked out.
>”Good morning, Miss Razel! How are you?”
>”.........n… not good…”
>”Oh dear. What's the matter?”
>”......l-loud…”
>Now that she mentions it, you realize the shop IS filled with an uproar thanks to the many shoppers. This “Razel” woman must have sensitive ears...
>You nod in sympathy. Being surrounded by so many folks must make her pretty uncomfortable. 
>Jiji speaks carefully, as to not hurt the feline's ears any more.  
>”Your knives look very pretty today. Did you just make some?”
>The sabertooth nods silently, her frown softening a little in favor of a more neutral expression.
>”Well, that's nice. Made any specials for Christmas?”
>”....mm.”
>The hulking blacksmith meanders over to a display case and returns with a few knives.
>Each one has a little engraving of Christmassy things, like reindeer, Christmas trees…
>The images are a little crude, but they're recognizable. It kinda gives them a little handmade charm, really.
>A bit of eagerness creeps into her attitude as she shows off an absolutely massive Bowie knife with a shaggy, monstrous figure engraved on the lengthy blade. Jiji appraises it for a moment, then smiles.
>”Oh, you did a Krampus blade this year? Very nice, I'm sure someone will love that.”
>”....mm…”
>With that, Razel quickly returns the blades to their displays, then makes her way back to the counter.
>Her moves are slow and deliberate, and seem a little… unsure. She very nearly bumps some glass display cases a few times.
>It's apparent that Jiji can see fine through her obscuring bangs, but…
>Can this woman not see through her bandages…?
>When she finally gets back to the register, she wordlessly rings Jiji out, delicately handing over the chosen knife with the air of giving someone their firstborn child.
>”Thank you! Have a merry Christmas!”
>”......y-you… too.”
>You and Jiji weave through the crowd and step outside. You breathe a sigh of relief as the racket dies down.
>”God, no wonder she's upset. It's a madhouse in there! What's the deal, does she have sensitive hearing or just crowd anxiety?”
>”Mm… a little of both, I suppose. Miss Razel is blind, you know. She gets around using her hearing, so I guess having all that ruckus kinda… scares the poor gal.”
>”...she's blind? And makes those knives?”
>”Meheheh, those little engravings are more impressive now, huh?”
>”Y-yeah, I'll say! Damn, she must work hard.”
>”Mhm, I bet she does.”
>Even though you've shopped here quite a few times before, you still stop to take a look at the storefront directory. 
>”H-hey Jiji. How about we get some new clothes?”
>”Hmmm. Well, I DO have to buy a little something for Candy at the university… she ADORES those ugly sweaters that are trendy right now. ...not in an ironic sense either, she thinks they're adorable.”
>You nod, and the two of you head off to the clothes shop.

>If it had to be summed up in one word humble, this place is…
>Cozy.
>It’s comfortably warm in the shop, and the whole place is laid out so there's plenty of room for everyone to browse without bumping elbows.
>The decor reminds you of Jiji’s place, actually; it's warm and inviting. It actually looks almost like this used to be a house that simply got converted into a store.
>The walls are painted a soft baby blue, and there are countless paintings of… sheep…? Weird choice.
>A small speaker sits on the counter, playing an upbeat little tune.
>Your eyes follow an incredibly long, floofy tail (at least, that's what you THINK it is...) all the way through the store and to the counter.
>There doesn't seem to be anyone at said counter…
>You walk over and lean against the counter absentmindedly as Jiji browses the sweaters, only to nearly jump out of your skin when you hear a chipper voice from behind you as someone jumps up from beneath the counter.
>”MERRY CHRITHMATH!”
>Startled, you whirl around to face the shopkeeper.
>She’s a red fox, that's for sure, but she seems… different, somehow. Her baby blue eyes give off an extremely soothing sort of aura, immediately calming your racing heartbeat.
>Below the waist, her body seems to smoothly transition into her massive, obscenely fluffy tail.
>It's like she's some kind of… fox… snake?
>The woman is in a frankly adorable, clearly homemade sweater covered in all manner of festive designs. It tightly hugs her body, especially her chest, which, while nowhere near as colossal as Jiji’s, is still fairly respectable.
>She smiles at you warmly, showing off a mild overbite as her canines poke out slightly.
>”Eheh, thorry if I thcared you. I jutht LOVE the holidayth!”
>”Oh, it's fine, miss…”
>”Clio, heheh! I actually jutht opened up thop here a couple of weekth ago. Nithe to meet you!”
>”Likewise. How's business?”
>”It’th great; I've thold more handmade outfith and dollth here than I EVER did back home…!”
>”Is EVERYTHING here handmade?”
>”Yup!” 
>The... snekfox smiles proudly. 
>Wow. The store is fairly large... and all the racks are covered in handmade clothes? That's quite a feat. 
>Jiji walks up to the counter with a particularly cheesy sweater, grinning.
>”I think this is all for today, miss.”
>Clio claps her hands together happily and rings your girlfriend up.
>”Ith thith for a friend? Or yourthelf?”
>”Oh, for a friend at work, actually.”
>”Oooh! I can wrap it, if you want? It’ll only take me a minute, topth.”
>”Really? Thank you, sweetie. That’ll save me some time!”
>The fox nods, then dutifully starts wrapping the sweater at a blinding pace. True to her word, it's ready in less than 60 seconds, even with a blue bow on top.
>”Thanks, miss! I'm sure my friend will love this. Your clothes look like high-quality stuff!”
>As you both turn to leave the store, you notice Jiji snap her vision over to the right. And what you see sets your motor running.  
>A hand made virgin killer sweater sits in the very far corner of the store. It seems that most folks shopping there at the store have passed it over. 
>You both look at each other at the same time and quickly make your way over to it.
>It looks a tad small, but finding properly sized clothes for a 9-foot tall milf is probably hard enough. 
>You hold Jiji's gift sweater while she quickly makes her way over back to Clio and pays for the other one. 
>A wild blush hits Clio’s cheeks the moment she lays eyes on Jiji’s purchase. You hear her giggle loudly the whole time she rings the goat up; Jiji laughs along with her.
>You quickly make your way out of the store and peruse the rest of the shops. 
>There is one last shop you'd like to take a look through: an antique and thrift store. 
>”Hey, Ji. Mind if we take a quick look here?”
>She quickly pulls you into the store. 
>”Call me frugal, but I love thrift stores! You never know what crazy crap you'll find here!”
>You pass by some old computer equipment that you've never heard of before. 
>The fuck is a Gateway?
>You continue past to the video section. 
>DVDs and VHSs line the shelves. Everything from The Magic School Bus to Y2K survival videos adorn the area. 
>The small box in the back of the store is what you're looking for. Countless vinyl records are haphazardly thrown in there. A lot of them are missing their cardboard sleeves. 
>You find what you're looking for and stash it away, making sure that Jiji can’t immediately see what artist is on the musical frisbee. 
>The cashier, an older gentleman who smiles nostalgically at the record, quickly rings you up and sets your new vinyl in a plastic bag. 
>”Ready to head home, Jiji?”
>”Yes sir!”
>She quickly throws a mock salute and takes your hand in hers as you both walk back home. 
>You didn't spend TOO much time out shopping, so it's still fairly early in the afternoon. 
>Jiji unlocks the front door and you both usher yourselves inside. 
>”Looks like Angie is gone…. We have the whole place to ourselves~”
>Before you can do anything, your milfy girlfriend pushes you down onto the living room couch.
>Stay right there, sweetie. Mommy needs to… get changed and ready~”
 >You audibly swallow as you try to prepare yourself for the show that's apparently about to start. 
>Before you can even think of getting off of the couch, Jiji bursts through her bedroom door. 
>It looks like she's wearing her new virgin killer sweater… ONLY the new sweater. 
>To say it hugs her body would be an understatement; it looks nearly painted on, leaving almost nothing to the imagination.
>Her enormous bust appears to strain the fabric a good deal, and it looks like she stretched it a little to get the bottom past her tail. The bottom hem of it rides up, and you catch a glimpse of her glistening lips. 
>And something else…
>”I h-haven't done this in a while… Whew….”
>She dances in front of you, giving you occasional teases with quick flashes of her breasts and ass. 
>After a few minutes, she stops. 
>”Okay, big boy. You've buttered me up enough today. I think you've earned your prize~”
>As she bends her large frame over, you notice something extra special as she spreads her ass and looks at you over her shoulder. 
>”I hope you like your present, Brody. T-time to claim it.”
>That crazy girl. 
>Between her cheeks is a very obvious butt plug stuffed inside her. You can now hear Jiji pant and moan slightly as she intermittently clamps down on it. 
>”H-holy shit! How long…..have you…”
>”Ever since this morning. Guh… I need you Brody. Again!”
>You waste no time in shedding your clothes. You toss them over into a corner of the room. 
>Jiji sits down over your aching member and takes you all in one fluid motion. 
>You give her ass a playful smack as you call her a bad girl. 
>”Keeping a plug in your ass ALL DAY? Now that's dedication. Just like how I'm dedicated to finish inside you!”
>You basically hop on top of her lower back and rut her like a wild animal. 
>”God dammit, Jiji. You're so beautiful. No matter what others say, nor how you might feel. Just remember that I fucking love you.”
>The only noises you hear are you and your girlfriends’ labored breathing as well as the lewd sounds of your bodies colliding. 
>Her voice cracks as she responds. 
>”Oh, Brody. I love you so much too! P-please finish inside of me. J-just like this morning!”
>You quickly pick up the tempo and grab onto her large bust from behind. With her completely bent over, and you basically rutting her doggy-style, you know you're not going to last long. 
>”Dear God, Ji. I'm gonna-ugh!... Mate you… I'm going to claim you all for myself!”
>”Not yet, sweetie. Just one second!”
>Your massive milf pushes you off slightly and turns herself over so that she can face you. 
>”N-now. Do it!”
>You let out a few harsh grunts as you roughly slam into her and keep yourself inside her as you both climax. You feel yourself shooting rope after rope of your seed into her begging pussy. The rune above her womb glows bright purple as she trembles in ecstacy.
>You reflexively begin to suck on her tits to maximize her pleasure and almost choke when you feel creamy liquid fill your mouth. 
>When you look up, sure enough, there is the same cow talisman STILL stuck to her chest. 
>You greedily drink her milk and let out an occasional thrust. Jiji hums in appreciation as you make sure that you've properly mated her. 
>You part her bangs and stare directly into her eyes. Her mesmerizing, swirling irises almost put you into a trance. 
>You share a long, loving kiss with her, then the two of you collapse into a hot, sweaty heap.
>God, you love this woman.
>Jiji wraps her arms around you tightly, her eyes filled with little tears of joy as a genuine smile lights up her face. She whispers into your ear.
>”Thank you. Thank you so much…”

Chapter 5

>It’s been a week since your shopping trip with Jiji… and it's very nearly Christmas. Only two days left!
>Your girlfriend walks by, humming a festive tune as her stubby tail wags happily. She sets a freshly-wrapped gift under the tree, nodding.
>”There! All set for the big day~”
>Jiji turns to you with a smile, and you snicker at her dumb sweater again.
>Stretched tightly across her massive bust is a distorted picture of Jesus, wearing a party hat and sunglasses, with a caption reading “Birthday Boy”.
>You wish you knew where the heck she found that ugly thing. You'd buy everyone you know one.
>You glance down at your own sweater, one Jiji bought for you. It's a hideous red sweater covered with Christmas lights… that actually light up and even change colors.
>It's the ugliest fucking sweater you've ever laid eyes on. And you love it.
>The amazonian goat stretches and flops onto the couch next to you, throwing an arm around your waist and pulling you close.
>”Don't you just love this time of year…?”
>”Absolutely. Especially when I have such a wonderful woman to spend it with.”
>Jiji chuckles and sticks her tongue out.
>”You flatterer, you~”
>She hugs you close, sighing happily as you share an embrace for a few minutes. Then, she suddenly pulls away with a gasp.
>”Oh! I almost forgot about Sasi’s party…! That could've been bad; I'd have felt awful if we were late!”
>”Party?”
>”Yep! An old friend invited me to her annual Christmas party… and you're my plus one, if you want to go.”
>”Wow, I'm honored. I'd be happy to go with you, if you really don't mind me going…!”
>”Of course I don't mind my handsome little man coming along. It'll be fun!”
>With that, you and Jiji quickly get ready to head out. Angela is off somewhere, apparently at a party of her own, so it's just you and your lady.
>Before long, you're walking down the streets of Placid Knoll, heading for the town’s event center.
>It’s a chilly day, so you and Jiji both bundled up, as did everyone wandering the streets ...except Miss Thrif (or whatever the hell her name is). She's still just as bare as she is every other day.
>As you pass by the one-eyed Hallow, you strike up a conversation with Jiji to distract yourself from her bare chest.
>”So, uh, your friend rented the event center for the whole day?”
>”Mhm, she did. She does every year, actually. Sasithorn loves nothing more than a day spent with friends and family.”
>”Aww. That's nice of her!”
>The older goat smiles thoughtfully as you walk hand-in-hand. 
>”Yup! She even has a daughter who also goes to PKU, just like you and my little Angie. Have you ever had a class with a black feline named Stargazer?”
>”I... can't say that I have.”
>Jiji nods.
>”Ah. Well, you ARE studying a pretty niche form of magic, after all. And since she's studying the same things her mother did back then, you most likely never shared a class together… well, rest assured, if you ever meet her, you’ll see she's an intelligent and kindhearted, if shy young woman.”
>”She sounds nice.”
>”Meheheh, Sasithorn raised her well. Like mother like daughter, they say!”
>As you close in on the event center, you notice two familiar faces... and one that you've never seen in your life.
>The Mayor and her husband are excitedly chatting to a Burmese feline. Her accent and slow speech pattern definitely tip you off. She has a similar motherly build like Jiji, but one striking difference is her height… Or lack thereof. 
>Her chocolate-brown fur is silky smooth, and she is very blessed both in the chest and the hips. However, she can't be any taller than 5’4”. She only comes up to your chest… meaning Jiji absolutely towers over her!
>Your girlfriend excitedly calls out to her friends.
>”Em! Mikey! Sasi! How are you guys?!” 
>The mayor quickly runs over to Jiji and gives her a tight hug. 
>”Hey, girl! We were just catching up with Sasithorn! Hurry up and come say hi before Michael bores her to death!”
>You both laugh and make your way to the duo at the front entrance. 
>The feline smiles up at Jiji, not looking even a little intimidated despite being nearly half the goat’s height.
>”Hello, Jiji! It is good to see you! I miss you so much!”
>Jiji looks away, slightly embarrassed. 
>”H-hehe. Sorry about not keeping in touch… Stuff… has happened. But I promise you that I'm going to be better about it from now on.”
>”How is little Angie doing?”
>”She's not so little anymore, meheh! She's about as tall as my man here now. She's studying Black Magic… not quite what I was hoping for, but I'm proud of her.”
>Sasithorn lets a long smile cross her face. 
>”And who is this young man that you've brought with you today?”
>Jiji slings an arm around you and picks you up a little for a deep kiss.
>”This is my boyfriend, Brody Matthews!”
>Your face flushes with embarrassment as you quickly look at the ground. 
>”N-nice to meet you, Ms. Sasithorn.”
>The shortstack eyes you up for a solid minute before speaking again. 
>”Very nice to meet you, Brody! I can assume that you attend PKU?”
>”Y-yes ma’am.”
>”Good! Very good. That means you're smart. And Jiji deserves a smart man. You might have even seen my daughter on campus. She just transferred from the human world campus.”
>”J-Jiji was just telling me about her… I'm afraid I haven't seen her, though.”
>”Ah, well, it is a big campus. Maybe you will run into her another day. What are you studying, young man?”
>”B-Blue Magic, ma’am.”
>”Oh! Wonderful! Such a fascinating field. Myself, I studied to become a witch doctor. And bless her, my daughter is on the same path.”
>”Oh wow, you're a witch doctor? That's amazing!”
>The feline blushes faintly in her ears.
>”Ah, you flatter me, young man… Jiji, is your beau always such a silver tongue?”
>”Meheheh, you could say he knows how to use his tongue well~!”
>Michael walks up to you and shakes your hand. 
>”Afternoon, Brody! Glad you could make it!”
>”Same, Mister Brimstone. Always glad to see another friendly face.”
>You all shoot the bull for a few more minutes until you decide to break off with Jiji and head inside the event center.

>It's immediately obvious that Miss Sasithorn spent a LOT of time decorating and prepping for this party.
>The inside of the usually-plain event center looks like Santa’s Village exploded. There's all manner of garlands, wreaths, tinsel, ornaments…
>Basically, if it's Christmas related, there's at least 20 of it here.
>A peppy, festive tune is playing from somewhere.
>You don't immediately recognize anyone inside the building, besides your girlfriend. 
>It looks like there is a small cook-off over in one of the corners of the building. 
>Across there is a community pile of presents. 
>Next to the door you entered from, a little sheet of paper has a sign-up list for an ugly sweater contest later tonight.
>And in another corner is a huge table absolutely COVERED with all manner of food. It's a veritable feast…
>As you look around, you start to pick out a few faces you recognize, even if vaguely.
>Isn't that the University nurse and her wife…?
>Oh, there's Professor Candy, already carrying around something sweet to eat.
>...isn't that, uh… dammit, what was her name? The bartender at the Red Wave… shit.
>Oh well.
>You also notice a long tail weaving through the-
>”MERRY CHRITHMATH! AGAIN!”
>You jump and spin on your heels to see Clio “standing” behind you, a massive grin on her face.
>”Oh, hi, Miss Clio.”
>”Hello! Ithn’t thith plathe BEAUTIFUL? Mith Thithi… Thoth… bleh, Thathithorn really knowth how to throw a party!”
>Jiji chuckles warmly.
>”She certainly does. It's good to see you here! I'm glad someone invited you.”
>”Me too! That nithe lady who maketh kniveth brought me ath her pluth one.”
>Clio nervously fiddles with the drawstrings of her outfit. 
>”I'm tho glad that Plathid Knoll hath tho many kind people here. Everyone hath made me feel tho welcome!”
>You notice that the long lady is wearing a very long, hooded sweater. The front has Frosty the Snowman's face on it with a pointy foam carrot nose poking outward. 
>”I would hath altho tried my hand at the cook-off. But I'm terrible at cooking real food… H-haha.”
>She smiles nervously at her own “joke,” and Jiji gives her a friendly pat on the back.
>”Miss, if you cook half as well as you sew, you're selling yourself short.”
>”Th-thankth…”
>Clio looks across the crowd with a little sheepish chuckle.
>”I… uh… I'm not uthed to crowdth like thith… in my job back home, I work with one perthon at a time, heheh.”
>You grin and mirror Jiji’s reassuring pat.
>”Hey, you're doing fine with all these folks here. Just gotta get used to it, is all. Everyone I've met here in Placid Knoll is friendly, I think they'll all be accommodating of your nerves.”
>”...th-thankth..! I think I'll go thay hello to thome more people; have fun, you guyth!”
>With that, the fox slithers away on her massive tail. She almost immediately bumps into a woman you recognize as that skeleton bartender from the Tipsy Vixen. They seem to hit it off pretty quickly.
>Aww.
>Jiji laughs warmly and hugs you close.
>”She seems sweet, huh? But not as sweet as you, honey-bunches~! Let’s go check out some of the fun stuff.”
>You blush wildly as your girlfriend practically carries you over to the bake-off going on in the corner.
>It looks like all sorts of desserts are being created: both traditionally as well as magically. 
>You recognize one face almost immediately, and your blood runs a little cold when you do.
>Towering over every other competitor, a dead serious look on her face, is Professor Coprina, the most notorious teacher in your major. Everyone's warned you she's a bitch when it comes to grades… but she's supposed to be one of the greatest Blue Mages in the field.
>Despite being a wasp, she lacks the characteristic thin waist of her kind; rather, her black dress and apron are pulled rather taut over a slightly pudgy midsection. It appears that, not only is she fond of baking, she's fond of taste-testing her baking as well…
>Her generous figure rivals even Jiji’s, with thick thighs, wide hips, and an impressive rack. That said, Jiji still has her beat out in height and bust size.
>Her pink eyes are narrowed in concentration, glowing faintly with magic; even the smaller eyes on her forehead are aglow. Her hat, a massive ink-cap mushroom, gently leaks black ink down her face, not that she seems to notice or care.
>Pots, pans, and all other sorts of cooking utensils fly around as the Hallow works feverishly on her dish. 
>It appears as if she's making some sort of ice cream or frozen snack. Must be a layered spumoni. 
>As she focuses, her wings beat wildly and her abdomen twitches. She's clearly ignoring everything but the task at hand.
>Eventually, she finishes her dessert and looses a haughty laugh, presenting it proudly to a panel of awestruck judges.
>The couple next to the large wasp calmly continue on their dishes without a care in the world. The midnight-black furred feline and human man hunch over together as they lovingly assemble a little gingerbread model of PKU.
>Huh. Judging by her looks, that might be Miss Sasithorn’s daughter…
>The cat looks over at her companion with a loving smile, and they momentarily stop working to share an embrace. A few observers let out a chorus of AWWWWWs as the couple blush and get back to work. The detail that the couple put into the large gingerbread model is pleasantly impressive. 
>Professor Coprina eyes the model up with increasingly apparent envy, her eyes glowing brighter and brighter as it nears completion. She says nothing, but her smile becomes more forced as well.
>Eventually, the gingerbread university is complete, and the judges take a look. All three unanimously agree it's a perfect replica; they even made stained glass windows out of sugar glass!
>To their delight, the couple are deemed the winners. The wasp woman goes dead silent, her face quickly becoming absolutely covered in ink from her hat.
>After a far-too-long pause, she wordlessly shakes the cat’s hand and storms off. 
>Jiji laughs loudly.
>”Good job, Stargazer! You sure showed that jealous old hag!”
>The short black cat shyly pulls her large hat down over her face as her boyfriend(?) hugs her from behind. 
>She speaks in a fairly hushed tone, with a pronounced, nervous stutter. 
>”I-I-I couldn't have done it… w-without my Davie…. Th-thanks, Dave.”
>Dave kisses the top of her head. 
>”Hey, Star. We did this TOGETHER. Thank you.”
>The couple immediately start to deconstruct the gingerbread model into fair-sized chunks and plate them up. 
>”Huh. Let's see if it tastes as good as it looks~”
>You and your amazonian girlfriend each take a plate of the snack and pop a piece into each other's mouths. 
>The gingerbread is heavy, but soft. The icing is perfectly sweet and balances out with the hint of cinnamon in the gingerbread. 
>It's freaking delicious.
>”Holy crap, Ji. This is super good! We'll have to see if we can grab seconds after everyone has a taste.”
>Jiji takes a bite of hers, and immediately perks up.
>”Oooh! You’re right, this is fantastic!”
>Stargazer blushes madly and pulls her hat down even farther.
>Professor Coprina, face now clear of ink, quietly grabs a plate of the gingerbread herself. The moment she takes a bite, her eyes light up. The towering wasp kneels down to be eye level with Dave.
>”I… I’m very impressed with this. You two truly deserved to win; congratulations.”
>Before he can reply, she stands and walks away… bumping into you.
>”Oh, my apologies- ...hang on a moment. Brody Matthews, I presume? I've heard about you, young man. I understand you're registered for one of my courses next semester…?”
>You struggle to look her in the eyes, thanks to her huge chest being in the way...
>”Err, y-yes ma'am.”
>Coprina narrows her pink eyes, then closes them altogether, nodding sagely.
>”Very well. Bring your best, and nothing less.”
>”Of course.”
>Jiji snorts and wraps an arm around you.
>”Copey, you're in for a surprise when you see my man at work. He'll blow those stockings of yours right off if you give him a chance~”
>The white wasp looks over at Jiji as if she didn't notice the massive goat standing there.
>”...hmph. We’ll see about that… but, if you truly are something special…”
>A tiny smile crosses her face.
>”...I’ll be happy to nurture your skills.”
>A look of possessiveness flits across Jiji's face as she quips. 
>”Oh, don't worry, Copey… I can assure you that Mister Matthews here is a very talented man… Take my word~”
>Jiji gives you a quick peck on the lips and pulls you away from Coprina, who blinks in shock before walking away, shaking her head and chuckling quietly.
>You and Jiji chat with Stargazer and Dave for a moment, then meander over to the community present pile. Jiji examines them with a mischievous grin.
>”Let’s see if any have OUR names on em~”
>...
>There actually are a few…!
>Notably, you and Jiji got one each from Professor Candy, Miss Clio, and Mayor Brimstone. Jiji also got one from Miss Sasithorn, while you find a scrunched up brown paper sack with your name scrawled on it in Gus’s shitty handwriting.
>The party’s hostess clears her throats behind you, making both of you jump. Sasithorn laughs merrily.
>”Don’t get ahead of yourselves; it is not present time yet! You need to go visit Santa and ask him for what you want!”
>Sure enough, there is an odd-looking… blue… Santa Claus that is barely suppressing an outburst of laughter. 
>It only takes a second for you to recognize that weird coyote bartender under the beard and hat. A huge grin is plastered across her face as she hefts a bag of gifts, all wrapped in blue paper, over one shoulder. 
>”Santa” ambles over to you and Jiji, dropping the bag of gifts with a grunt before taking a seat in a blue chair you don't remember seeing earlier. 
>She pats her lap, and Jiji gently takes a seat. The canine doesn't even attempt to change her voice as she speaks.
>”Gah-hah-hah! And what would YOU like for Christmas, little girl?”
>The sheer absurdity of “Santa” blinking up at Jiji and calling the Amazon “little girl” has you wheezing with laughter. Jiji laughs along, then manages to choke out an answer.
>”I want some new clothes. Something that'll knock the socks off my little man~”
>The blue-furred woman gives Jiji a maniacal grin before letting her up. 
>”Pffff… I'm sure you've been nice enough this year to be given a naughty gift… Gah-hah-hah!”
>The coyote winks and digs around in her giant bag of gifts, grunting and muttering under her breath. She eventually cries out triumphantly before pulling a box wrapped in blue paper out. She hands it over to Jiji with a grin.
>”Merry Christmas, enjoy!”
>To the mutual shock of you and your girlfriend, the gift even has a tag reading “TO JIJI”... 
>”...how did you know my name?”
>”Why, Santa knows the names of everyone there is!”
>Jiji chuckles as she opens her gift.
>”I suppose I can't argue with that!”
>The goat Hallow opens the box, then gasps at the contents.
>Inside is a VERY slinky green dress, one that would put even Professor Cordyllia's notorious outfit to shame. Jiji blushes and checks the tags.
>”...th-this is even my size… how did you…?”
>”Santa” winks and elaborates no farther, instead motioning for you to sit this time.
>You nervously sit down in the mascot's lap. 
>”Merry Christmas to you, sir! Have you been a good boy this year?”
>Before you can reply, Jiji answers for you.
>”Oh, he's been such a good boy most days. But sometimes… Sometimes he can get extra naughty.”
>Your face burns with embarrassment as your girlfriend playfully nudges the canine with her elbow. The coyote practically dies laughing, slapping your back merrily.
>”Gah-hah-hah-hah! I should come here more often, you Hallows are funny! So, mister naughty boy, what do YOU want from Santa?”
>”Uh… Smash Brothers. I-I guess?”
>She blinks in surprise a few times.
>”....pfffffft, is that it? That's too easy! But sure, if that's what you want, then I've got just the thing.”
>The canine hums a festive tune as she digs a small box out of the gift bag, handing it over.
>”There you go! And I even made sure every character is already unlocked for ya!  AND there's a code in there for the DLC pass. Enjoy!”
>You unwrap the box and, sure enough, it's exactly what you asked for, complete with the extras she mentioned…
>...and a coupon for some free drinks at the Red Tide.
>You glance back at “Santa”, and she winks coyly.
>”Be sure to bring Spelltag with ya when you cash in on that~!”
>You wordlessly nod and quickly excuse yourself off of “Santa”’s lap. She giggles mischievously and motions for someone else to come sit, but not before getting in a parting shot.
>”You both better be good! Don't play with your gifts until you get home! Gah-hah-hah!”
>Jiji grabs you by the hand and guides you back over to the community pile of presents. Mrs. Sasithorn's voice comes over the intercom. 
>”Has everyone asked what they've wanted from “Mister Santa?” It's time to share our gifts with the ones that we love!”
>Everyone meanders over to the Christmas trees and grabs their presents. 
>You cast your eyes over the gathering crowd, soaking in the Christmas spirit.
>That new lady, Clio, is sitting(???) in a small pile of gifts, teary-eyed and smiling ear to ear. You can hear her thanking everyone in earshot rapidly.
>Miss Sasithorn, her daughter, and said daughter’s boyfriend all sit together smiling happily.
>Mayor Emmas and Michael cuddle up close on a sofa, holding hands.
>A fox, clad in a clean white labcoat, sits with Razel from the knife shop, carefully helping the huge sabertooth with her gifts.
>Professor Coprina sits quietly off to the side, away from everyone else. A tall, incredibly slender woman you don't recognize makes her way to Coprina, and you see a smile gently cross the grouchy wasp’s face.
>A bony canine you recognize as the part-time bartender at the Tipsy Vixen cracks jokes to Miss Thrif from the curse shop, getting her to crack up every now and again.
>Even your old pals from the Tipsy Vix showed up, all crowded together around a table. 
>You decide to open up Gus’ present first….
>.....It's literally just a bottle of cheap liquor from the gas station down the street. 
>The old man grins at you from his table, winking.
>Never change, Gus…
>Jiji opens up a gift addressed to her and peeks inside, only to shut the box immediately and quickly hide it away from the rest of the guests. 
>As you lean over to her, she tips open the present to let you peek inside…
>A ball gag sits inside the box. 
>You quickly glance up at your milfy girlfriend. And she looks… embarrassed...!
>You barely get a glance at the tag to see who it's from… “Clarissa”, apparently.
>You grab another gift off your pile… this one’s from… oh, Miss Clio.
>...
>It's a little hand-made doll of Jiji. This must've taken her a whole night to make…! Every little detail is perfect, even down to the strips of cloth representing her talismans having mock spells on them.
>It's… kinda cute.
>Jiji opens up another gift… and coincidentally, hers is ALSO from Clio.
>You both are and aren't shocked when your girlfriend pulls out a doll of YOU. Again, every detail seems perfect.
>Chuckling, you pull out the next gift, this one from… 
>...who the flying fuck is “Marris”?
>You open the box up anyway…
>...oh. It's your tab from the Tipsy Vixen… and it's all paid off. Huh.
>Well, that was a pleasant surprise!
>Next, you grab a cylindrical present from Professor Candy. 
>Wow, a brand new wand! You've been meaning to get a replacement for your hunk-of-junk discount model you basically got for free. 
>You go over to your teacher and give her a big hug, which she reciprocates with all four of her arms without hesitation.
>Eventually, you and Jiji finally get to the presents that you got for each other. 
>”Open mine first, Jiji.”
>Your girlfriend nods and carefully opens the small box, gasping at the contents.
>”...is this…”
>She pulls out the accessory and stares at it silently.
>”Yep. It's a hair band, complete with green gemstones to match your usual outfits. I wanted you to have a way to tie your hair back and show the world your beautiful eyes.”
>...
>Jiji pulls you into a tight embrace, tears running down her cheeks.
>”Th-thank you so much, Brody… I love it. I-I love YOU.”
>She shakily reaches up, takes a deep breath, then uses her gift to pull her bangs back and out of her face. Her eyes, gently swirling as always, are on full display now; the hair band’s beautiful green gems glint in the light.
>”W-what do you think, honey-bunches…?”
>”...you're so beautiful, Jiji. My god, you're perfect.”
>She blushes madly and wipes a few tears of happiness away.
>”Y-your turn…!”
>You slowly open the meticulously-wrapped box…
>To find a necklace with half of a heart hanging from the center of the chain. 
>Jiji shows you that she's been wearing her half this entire time, and shows that her necklace has the other half of the heart. 
>After you secure the small chain around your neck you connect the two halves together. They glow a soft purple as the two halves almost appear to fuse together. You can literally sense and feel the intangible love for you that courses through your girlfriend. 
>You're leaning in so close that her lips graze yours. 
>The two of you share a quiet, loving kiss. No tongue, no groping around.
>Just two people in love, expressing that love.
>”This is such a beautiful gift. Th-thank you… So much…”
>Jiji wraps you up in a big hug. 
>”Anything for you, honey-bunches… I-I love you so much. Thank you. Thank you for everything…”
>The two of you remain in each other's arms for what feels like forever. The rest of the party seems to fade away. All that exists in the world right now is you and your beloved girlfriend.
>You run a finger along the joined necklaces, feeling the heart pulse with your shared love, then kiss her again.
>”I couldn't have asked for anything better, Jiji. I love it! And most importantly, I love you.”
