>You weren't sure why the mood took you, but you had to get out of this stupid town
>You had to get out of this stupid country
>A few months later you're getting off at Heathrow, having hopped the pond
>You've been accepted into a British university to do some shit that took your fancy when you were applying
>More importantly, you're 4000 miles away from your hometown
>Time for 3-4 years of hard drinking with a different set of weirdos
>Check in at uni, you get a key to a small room in a shitty dorm
>No roommates, but some people in your corridor
>You're too tired to socialise so you just go to sleep and figure you'll do something tomorrow
>The morning
>Get talking to your housemates
>Apparently these Brits have something called a "society"
>Which is like an after-school club
>They're all really excited to go to "freshman's fair" to see what "societies" there are
>Whatever, you'll tag along just out of boredom
>Bigass tent in the parking lot
>Fuckton of people, you lose your housemates quickly
>The societies are out on desks, talking to passers-by and taking down emails for mailing lists
>There's a bunch of sports societies, some cringy anime society, political shit, nothing that interests you
>Quite a few anthros, though
>There weren't that many back in Bumfuck, Kansas
>Diversity in action
>Suddenly…
"Hey dude!"
>Right into your ear.
"Ahh! Who the…?"
>Turning round, you see an anthro
>A goat girl
>She's probably about your age, rake thin, little stubby horns, soft white fur all over, and a "goatee" of downier stuff
>She's wearing a loose cloth dress and is bare footed
"Hey. Too many people here, right?"
>No shit
"Uhh, yeah."
>She smiles knowingly
"I'm Sugandha. You looking for a society a bit more relaxed than, ah…"
>She points her head and you can see the anime society
>They're doing some cringy shit
>You laugh nervously
"I guess so, heh. My name's Anon, by the way."
>She gestures to a table not so far away
"I'm the treasurer of the Psychonaut society. Would that be something that would interest you?"
>Her accent is pretty, soft and struggling a little with the Rs
>Wait, psychonauts?
>That sounds weird
>But, kinda interesting
"Uh, yeah, sure."
>She beams at you
"Great! Do you know your university email address? Write it down here please… We actually have a meeting tonight, do you have a map of the campus?"
>You head back to your dorm with a map of the campus, the name of a lecture hall, and the building it's in circled in pen
>Pop into the campus shop on the way back
>The drinking age is only 18 here, score!
>You go home with a few packs of instant noodles and a six pack of beer
>Just do whatever until the evening, get your stuff unpacked and have a little to drink before leaving
>You seem to be one of the last to arrive
>Sugandha is there, sitting on the ground at the front of the lecture hall
>There are a few other freaks there; mostly anthros, but a couple of humans too
>Dreads and sandals at six o'clock
>One of Sugandha's ears twitches at the sound of you opening the door, and she turns round
>She recognizes you and flashes you a grin
"Anon! Glad you could make it!"
>How many randoms did she try to press into this little club and how did she remember you
"Oh, hey. You remembered me?"
>She's smiling wistfully
"Of course. I noticed something in you when you came by the table. You have an interesting aura."
>Aura what-now?
"We were just about to have a beginner's meditation session. Have you ever chanted mantras before?"
>Meditation? Mantras? Where is this going?
"Uhh, not really…"
>Best not to bring up that you were raised a Christian
"That's fine! We're all beginners at some point."
>She lays a hand on your shoulder
"I can tell you're not too sure about this, and that's okay. We're going to have a relaxed pace today. You know there's scientific evidence that meditation is good for you?"
>That's plausible, you read an article about it once
"How about you just take a cushion and sit with the others? It will be quite laid-back, I promise."
>Well, why not. You can always just leave when the freaks start seeing Vishnu or whatever.
>Sit on a cushion next to some laid-back looking vegetable of a person
>Some kinda chill music starts playing, guys at the front close their eyes
>You humour them and close your own eyes, and get into the groove of the music
>Hmm, this isn't so bad
>They're softly chanting something, but you can't quite make it out
>Decide to just relax and enjoy sitting listening to the chill music
>Before you know it, you're being told to open your eyes
>You head to the front, feeling energized
>Sugandha is getting to her feet, and smiles as she sees you coming
"Hey Anon! You made it through the whole session?"
"Yeah, I guess I did."
"Not bad! Did you see anything?"
"Not really. I just enjoyed the music and stuff. It was relaxing."
>She smiles
"Hey, I'm glad you enjoyed it. I'm going to go and get something to eat now, do you want to come with me?"
>You've got nothing better to do
"Sure, why not?"
>Wow she has a nice smile
"That's great! Let's head out. I'm sure the others will catch up in a bit."
>Turns out the others don't turn up
>You and Sugandha end up being alone eating tacos together and shooting the shit
>She's as weird as you thought she was, but fun to talk to
>She laughs at your jokes and gets you to come out of your shell
>She's pretty funny herself
>You end up discussing all sorts of things, from her religion to what brought you out here
>She ends up giving you her number and you head home feeling pretty good about the whole affair
>Sleep as soon as your head hits the pillow

2.
>Your phone rings, waking you up
>It's a text
>It's from Sugandha
"Namaste Anon! You know where the Einstein building is? My room is in there, wanna come check it out? I made curry!"
>Might be cool
>You won't get any food except instant noodles if you stay home
"Sure. I'll be right over."
>It's easy to find on the map and not too hard to find outside
>Sugandha is standing outside waiting for you
>She's wearing a colourful dress, and a string of prayer beads around her neck
"Hey," you say by way of greeting
>She notices you and smiles widely
>God she has a nice smile
"Hi there! Glad you could make it."
>She takes your hand and leads you inside
>This dorm is a lot nicer than yours
>She opens her door
>Her room is a lot bigger than yours
>It looks… well, as you expected it to
>Big poster of some blue-skinned four-armed fellow on the wall
>A bong, a big food pot, a rice cooker, and a teapot are on her desk
>The teapot is steaming slightly, with two cute mosaic-patterned mugs
>Her clothes are in a bit of disarray all over the ground
"Sorry about the mess, I've been meaning to clear up…"
"Hey, it's not like my place is much better."
>She giggles
"Let's not worry too much about that, then. I've made enough curry for the both of us, but it's vegetarian I'm afraid…"
>Hey, you're an open-minded fellow, you'll give it a try
"Sounds good! I've not eaten anything yet today."
>She raises an eyebrow as she works at spooning some
"Not even breakfast? Are you fasting for something?"
>Your turn to chuckle softly
"Naw, I only just got up."
>She smiles softly at you as she gives you a bowl
>Tasty looking yellowish rice with a healthy dollop of curry on top
>It looks really good
>Smells great too
>You realise how hungry you are
>But, you're a gentleman, so you wait for her to serve hers up too
>You both sit on the ground together, cross legged, and dig in
>She's not really that dainty when she eats
>Much like you she just shovels it in by the forkful
>You both finish before too long
>That was really good
"Thanks so much Sugandha, that was great!"
"Hehe, thank you Anon!"
>She pours out two mugs of tea and gives one to you
"So, I know you don't know me very well but I have a bit of a favour to ask you. Not too big of one, but a favour all the same…"
>You sip your tea and nod
>Mmm, spiced chai
"I just bought some new stuff from my dealer to try out, and I was hoping you could be my trip sitter? None of my friends are around right now, and all the psychonauts are terrible flakes."
>Oh man
>Fucking hippies
"What would that involve?" you ask cautiously.
"Oh, nothing much. You just have to sit in with me and make sure I don't hurt myself while I'm tripping. We can watch a movie or order some food if you like. The dealer told me the trip should only last a few hours."
>You mull it over
>Spending time with this cutie is fun
>But you're not really a drug guy
>Meh, you don't have to take any yourself, just look after her
>Maybe she'll do something funny or cute under the influence
>With that you've made up your mind
"Yeah, sure, I can do that."
>She smiles and claps her hands gleefully, that was pretty cute
"Thank you, Anon! Let's get started right away…"
>She opens one of her desk draws and pulls out a little ziplock bag
>Inside there are three or four pink pills, about the size of dimes
>She opens the bag and fishes one out
"Wish me luck!"
>And she pops it
>She's looking normal
"No effect?"
>She giggles
"They usually take a while to kick in, silly! Let's put a film on while we're waiting…"
>She peruses another drawer for a second and pulls out a DVD case
>DVDs in CURRENTYEAR
>She pops the DVD into her computer and sets the movie running, it's a Hong Kong action movie
>You both sit on the bed together and get watching
>Not long after the second act break, she starts making a weird noise
>Halfway between bleating and… moaning?!
>She leans on your shoulder and moans softly
"Uhn… fucking dealer… Those weren't psychedelics…"
>That's the first time you've heard her swear
>Moreover, she's getting a little grabby
>She's now gripping your arm, squeezing herself close
>You turn away from the movie to look at her
>She has big wet patches in her dress
>Right over her nipples
"Uhhh, Sugandha, are you okay?"
>She's giving you bedroom eyes
>Without warning, she pushes you down by your shoulders, pinning you on the bed
>She licks her lips
"Mmm, I need a little pressure release. You'll do nicely."
>She's straddling you, and weighs enough that struggling to get off won't do any good
>She pushes the straps of her dress aside and pulls the front of her dress down, revealing decent sized tits for such a skinny girl
>Her nipples are pointing out, erect, and a steady stream of milk is coming out
>She guides your hands up to her chest and places them on her tits
"Give them a good squeeze, and I might let you drink some."
>That's about as fucked up as it is really hot
>You don't need telling twice, as you squeeze her breasts gently
>The fur on her breasts is so soft and downy
>The squishy feeling of her boobs combined with the fluffiness of her fur feels heavenly
>There's milk spraying everywhere, and she's bleating and moaning softly
>You can feel a stirring in your pants at the lewd sight, sound, and feeling, and let out a moan of your own
>Sugandha smiles widely
"Mmmm, good boy."
>Seeing you're not going to go anywhere, she shuffles back to sit in your lap, grinding up against you, and lets you sit up
>You rest up against her, snuggling into her fur, wrapping your arms around her, guiding her rhythmic humping
>She squeezes you up against her, and nibbles your neck
"Sugandha, Sugandha!" You can't help but say her name. She giggles again.
"You're so cute, I knew it from the moment I saw you!"
>She gently untangles herself from your arms, shuffles round, and cradles your head in one arm
"Now, your reward~!"
>Her nipples are right in your face, and you open your mouth and suckle on one of them
>Her milk is sweet and smooth tasting
>You can't help but let out a few soft moans
>She's beaming at you giggling softly
"Good boy, good boy!"
>You feel a fluffy paw caressing your tummy and pushing under your belt
>Her hand is on your cock, giving it a light squeeze before pulling it out of your pants
"How lovely, hehe"
>She starts stroking you off
>She seems a bit inexperienced, but it feels pretty good
>The sensation of being held in her arms, having a face full of breasts, and a mouthful of milk is way too pleasant
>Before long you're squirming up against her, sucking and biting her nipple, muffled moans let out every few strokes
>She too is moaning, pausing it only to say "good boy" a few times
>It's really too much to handle, and you finish before long, squirting all over your chest (When did your top come off!?) and her arm
>You both collapse on the bed, snuggling up to each other, and the next thing you know, you're asleep, feeling safe, comfortable, and warm in her downy belly fur
