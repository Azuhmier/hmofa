>YFW they start to climb over the railings.
>No thinking, just action. immediately run forward and grab hold of their top, you can tell from the touch its a pretty heavy material which would soak up water. Notice they seem to have the worst clothing possible for being into water, the kind that really drags you down.

>Now its her turn.
>She tells you about her prison sentencing. What happened in the prison. Her court ordered hysterectomy, along with how she is not allowed to work with or care for any individual under 16, nor work in any capacity in a place of education.

>Walk away, feel guilty as you can hear her crying.
