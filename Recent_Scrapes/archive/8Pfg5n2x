>Another day in Heaven's Mount
>Dalamadur is off elsewhere; possibly feeding
>Her form is so large and long that you're always in close proximity with some part of her, even if her head is a day's trek down the mountain and her tail a day's trek down the other side
>Normally you'd be bored to bits waiting for her to return, but with her revealing that she senses your every touch has certainly livened up your day
>Time to time as you go about your schedule, you make contact with a part of her
>Sometimes you give a momentary pat, or a slow rub, sometimes even a quick kiss to her scaley hide
>She always lets you know with a slight shake
>Thankfully not enough to cause a rumble in the earth or crack the stone, but just enough visibly to let you know she felt it
>Maybe it was something in the air or the heat of the sun was getting to you, but you wanted to go further
>You approached the long wall that is her mountain destroying snake-body and slowly rubbed your hand along one of her long, sleek scales
>The hide shakes ever so slightly, as expected
>You press your lips against her and feel her shiver, the vibrations coursing through you as you press your head close against her
>But now... you try something different
>You removed your warm, comfortable shirt, revealing your bare chest and skin, then pressed yourself against hur like trying to hug her
>Your actions were met with an immediate response
>Stones clatter against the ground as her body squirms, to which you see her normally controlled and still body shake even further down the mountains
>You pushed yourself against her hide and rub at her with both of your hands, feeling the vibrations reverberate through the ground and yourself
>You felt hot
>Way too hot
>Your tongue momentarily fell from your mouth as you tried to breathe out, only to ever so briefly touch against her scale
>You hear a sharp wind echo through the mountains and ever loudening sounds of stone against stone
>Knowing immediately what power you held, you drew your tongue out and licked the person-sized, smooth scale that was in your reach
>The part of her body that was closest to you shook violently, but you could see her restraining herself for your safety as on both sides reaching away from your her body tensed and writhed against the terrain
>The sharp wind you heard earlier picked up in intensity, as the breeze flowed through the rocks and whistled it's tune to you in sporadic patterns
>Her acting this way was too much for you
>You couldn't hold yourself back anymore as you feel an immense heat radiating from your groin
>Your penis was harder than you'd ever imagine it to be and burning a hole against the fabric of your pants
>Damn the consequences
>You needed this
>Pulling down the hem of your pants and underharments, your member stood pulsing and ready for action
>Her body stills in the momentary lapse of contact, her possibly assuming you retired for other activities
>You could HEAR her surprise as you pressed your dick against her
>A loud cry pierced the serene mountainside like a gale of an enraging storm, almost too loud for you to hear so far away
>Her restraint was tested to the limit as her section of body you were in contact with thrashed against the rock platform and you, while the rest of her body flailed wildly into their surroundings as if she had been dealt a life-ending blow
>Rocks tumble and fall around you as her body vibrates against you, finally sending you into a climax as you erupt your searing, life-bearing seed against her struggling hide
>You were forced back by a mightly blow as the form she fought so hard to keep under control tossed and turned with the rest of her body
>Your ears hurt as the roar became louder, sending you out of your ecstasy to cover your ears as you rode out the earth-quake you caused
>The stone cracked around you as your Dalamadur lover rode out her explosive reaction, until finally she began to slow
>Her body rested against the scars you causes against the mountainside, frozen still for an hour
>Finally, her body began to slowly shift
>Within moments, she finally returned to you, seeing you face to face
>She struggled to breathe and her tongue flipped wildly in the air as she saw your still naked form
>You doubted she could speak in her state, but you could see her intent clearly in her piercing, red eyes
>She was fully intent on paying you back
>And you could assume how as her enormous head neared down to your form and her thin, forked tongue flicked out to graze against your bare skin
>This is going to be a long, enjoyable night
