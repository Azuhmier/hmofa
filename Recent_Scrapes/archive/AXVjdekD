>I come home from the bar, and I feel good
>The drink was nice and plentiful, as always
>The door is being a pain, and I keep fumbling with the keys
>Calling for my hubby, he opens the door
>"Honey, you were supposed to be home two hours ago, what happened?"
>'You don't need to know.'
>He sighs and walks over to the couch, sitting down
>"Why are you drunk?"
>'I'm not.'
>"Bullshit."
>I give a grunt, to tell him off
>Stumbling to the kitchen, I open the fridge, grabbing some leftover pork
>"Why are you doing this? You know I hate to see you like this."
>'It's my life, my choice.'
>"I know that, but I'm worried."
>'Then stop.'
>"Fine."
>He walks away in a huff, annoyed
>When he's gone, I sneakily drink some rum I had saved over
>Walking to the bathroom, I look in the mirror
>I was a drunk hyena that looked like shit, the drink had messed with me
>He walks behind me, and frowns
>"What's wrong?"
>'Nothing.'
>"Dear, I know something is up."
>'You're wrong.'
>"Why are you being so hostile?"
>'Shut up.'
>He doesn't take to that kindly, and he runs up to me, pointing a finger at me
>"You know, over the last week, you've been drinking more, and spending less time with me? Why?"
>'Fuck off, I don't want to talk about it!'
>"No, you're being a complete bitch!"
>That does it
>Turning around, I sock him in the head
>He falls back and hits the ground
>Picking him up, I throw him into the living room
>I have to make an example for him not to do this shit ever again
>As he moans on the floor, I hold myself above him
>And I start to strike
>Hitting him over and over
>"Zahra, please stop!"
>He needs to learn
>"Plea-agh!"
>With me swinging my fists into his face, he slumps down
>"You're gonna k-"
>And I kick him full force, into his back
>He writhes in pain
>To end the lesson, I slam his head into the floor
>I hear a loud crack
>I must of broken the wood, that'll teach him
>But, why was I so violent?
>He was my love, I wasn't supposed to beat him up!
>Wait, that's a lotta blood flowing...
>Fuck, I've hurt him!
>That realization sobers me immediately
>What did I do?
>Oh god baby, please be fine
>Please please please
>I turn him over, I already beat him, I hope it won't be too bad
>I'll do everything to make it up, I'll make him breakfast in bed for the rest of his life
>I'll take him to the Bahamas like he always wanted
>I'll never hurt him again, and I'll stop drinking, and spend more time with him
>He slumps over
>His head flops down
>He isn't breathing...
>Oh god
>No
>No
>No
>His neck...
>It's broken
>God no
>'Will? Wake up!'
>I start to shake him around
>'Babe, please, wake up!'
>I can't stop the tears from flowing
>'Please!'
>He doesn't move
>He's gone
>'No...'
>The guilt crushes me
>I just killed my lover
>I beat him to death
>A innocent human man who loved me
>Who just wanted the best for me
>I pick up his body and walk to the bed, laying down, with him on top of me
>I wrap an arm around him, and shove my face into his right shoulder
>I'm sobbing uncontrollably
>'I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, please, I didn't mean to...'
>'Just wake up, I need you...'
>Nothing happens
>What did I expect, I killed him
>He didn't deserve this
>He was so good
>And he's gone, because of me
>I'm a monster
>Why is he dead?
>Why am I alive?
>I can't do anything about it, I'm a piece of filth
>I can't bring him back to life
>I want to be with him
>And with him I will go
>My left paw goes to my right wrist
>It's scary, but I can't live knowing what I've done
>The pain is sharp, sliding down my arm
>The blood flows, staining my fur and the bed
>I repeat that with my left arm
>And I lie there, with my dead husband
>The world is fading away
>And all I can do is apologize
>'I'm sorry...'
>And I leave this world

>"Jones?"
>'What?'
>"You think this is gonna be bad?"
>'A Hyena, and it's domestic troubles. It isn't gonna be good. Hopefully, the poor guy doesn't get any scars.'
>Me and Alda knock on the door, the station got a call not too long ago, hearing screaming and banging
>"Zahra? Will? This is the police, can you open the door?"
>After some time, there's still no response.
>'Fuck, not good. Kick that door down, taser ready, this could be bad.'
>"Got it."
>Alda steps in front of the door, and readies herself
>"Stand back from the door, we're coming in!"
>Alda kicks it down easily, her Dragon legs destroying the hinges
>'Come out with your hands up!'
>Oh fuck
>Theres blood on the floor, and some damaged wood
>Shit
>"Jones, get ready for anything."
>'I'll guard the door, to make sure nobody gets out, check the rooms.'
>"Understood"
>Alda runs from room to room, not finding much of interest except for a broken bottle of rum in the bathroom
>Eventually, I hear her, and in a terrified voice
>"Jones! Get over here, I'm calling for EMT's!"
>I run fast as I can, making it to the bedroom
>It's a horrible sight
>Will was lying on top of Zahra, blood coming down his head, and his neck was obviously snapped
>Zahra was on the bed, with blood staining her arms
>Her face is one of anguish
>Will's is one of fear
>God in heaven...
>'Christ.'
>"They aren't breathing, and no pulse."
>'Zahra's claws are stained red. Possible murder-suicide?'
>"It seems like it."
>'I've never seen something like this.'
>"Neither have I."
>As we wait for the ambulance, we check the house
>Hidden camera's lie in each room, probably to catch burglars
>'We need to see this.'
>Taking the footage, I play it on a tablet I have
>And it scares me
>Zahra came home drunk, and got into an argument
>Then, she starts to beat Will
>And with a loud snap, he dies
>Zahra quickly notices it, and becomes despondent
>As she carries his body to the bed, she cries and asks for him to come back
>But of course, he doesn't
>Zahra is broken, and with her own claws, she slices her arms
>Her death is fast but painful
>"I-I can't believe what I just saw."
>I feel the same
>'I don't think I'll ever forget this.'
>As I sit on the bed, Alda sits next to me
>'Honey, can you promise something?'
>"Yes?"
>'I know that our job is dangerous, but no matter what, don't ever start drinking. Not after that.'
>"I won't."
>Alda hugs me, and we both wait for the ambulance
>Zahra's mistake won't ever leave my mind

>Beeping
>It's all I hear
>My sense of smell is overwhelmed by alcohol
>I can't see
>My body feels numb
>What is happening?
>"Hey, She's awake!"
>'W-Where am I?'
>"You're in St.Paul's hospital, don't worry."
>'What happened? Is Will alright?'
>"Shit..."
>'What?'
>"We'll t-tell you later, you need to rest."
>'Okay...'
>Time passes, I feel as if I was in a dream
>It all feels so weird
>Eventually, the sound of footsteps comes to me, along with an opening door
>"In here, officers."
>"Thanks."
>'Who's there?'
>"Zahra, we will be restraining you for both our safety and our own."
>'Why, I'm not dangerous?'
>"That's incorrect, now stay still."
>As the restraints are slipped on, I cannot move my limbs
>"Now, we know that you do not remember what happened last night."
>'What was it, and where's Will?'
>"Will... is dead. You killed him. Claw marks, brusing on the head and body, and a snapped neck."
>'What? I would never hurt him!'
>"Zahra, you did. I don't exactly know why, but we found you in a sorry state. You slashed your arms in an attempt at suicide on your bed. Will's body was lying on top of you, and a shitton of alcohol was in your system."
>'No, that isn't possible! You're lying!'
>"I'm sorry, but it's the truth. We don't want to be so blunt, but would you be able to remember any of it?"
>Nothing comes to mind
>This is some elaborate hoax, Id never lay a finger on Will
>As I feel anger brewing at the lying men, a sense of deja vu hits me
>It all comes back
>The drinking
>The arguing
>Killing him
>The suicide attempt
>I killed my lover
>It's too much
>'I-I'm a fucking monster, he loved me...'
>"Christ..."
>'I was so drunk, I didn't even realize it, he was begging me to stop, oh god why...'
>'He didn't deserve this, I should be the one dead!'
>'Will, I'm so sorry...'
>"Damn, this is bad."
>'I just want you back baby, please...'
>"Get the boys, we're moving her to the slammer."
>I didn't care that I was going to jail
>That was nothing
>What hurt was what I did
>And the pain doesn't go away

--------

>It's late at night, I was falling asleep
>Moving to the jail didn't faze me
>I already felt dead
>As sleep takes hold, I feel uneasy

>I'm walking home from work, happy to see my husband
>It's been a long hard day, so seeing his bright smile will make everything better
>He was so caring and kind, he was a complete keeper
>Thank god you had him, he kept you sane in your job
>Fucking cocksuckers at the office could go get stuffed
>As I walk up the steps to the front door, I pull out the keys
>Unlocking the door, I walk in
>'Honey, I'm here!'
>No answer
>You sneaky boy, I'll find you!
>Looking around the house, Will is nowhere to be seen
>'Will?'
>Ah, of course, he'd be waiting in the bedroom
>He has to take care of the girl after all
>Opening the door, you see Will facing away from you, on the bed
>You hear something wet hitting the ground
>Is he crying?
>I walk over to the bed, crawling onto it
>'Are you alright honey?'
>"How could I be alright?"
>'Well, we have eachother.'
>"Used to."
>His head turns completely around, his neck twisted and torn, with lifeless eyes
>Recoiling back, I crawl away to a wall
>"I just wanted to love you, why did you do it?"
>'What are you talking about?'
>"YOU KILLED ME."
>Oh god, the memory comes back
>'I-I'm sorry Will, I never meant to hurt you.'
>"YOU SNAPPED MY NECK. TELL ME, DID YOU LIKE WATCHING ME DIE? YOU SICK FUCK."
>He stands up, and with a blink of my eyes, he's right in front of me
>'OH GOD WILL PLEASE I'M SO SORRY, PLEASE DON'T HURT ME!'
>"Oh, it's fine having me die, huh? You are scum. You killed your husband, the person who cared for you. You know how painful it felt?"
>What was he talking about?
>"You fucking beat me like I was filth. I was in horrible pain, and then you killed me. Why?"
>'I was drunk, and angry, I lost control, I-I wish I was who died, not you...'
>"And yet, here you are, talking to a walking corpse."
>'I'm sorry...'
>"Burn in hell."
>He vanishes, and I am left alone
>That scares me more than anything
>Not dying
>Not jail
>It's that he's gone
>And it's all because of me

-------

>I awake in a cell, restrained
>They think I'm mad
>They're right
>The worries about what you did flows back
>And you can't stop laughing
>It's not funny
>It's horrible
>I killed my love
>I'm in jail, and probably deemed mentally unwell
>And not even in sleep can I calm down
>This is hell
>The worst part is that I made it this way
>All I had to do was put down the bottle
>But I ignored him and kept drinking
>That was such a mistake

>My eyes are open, only seeing darkness, my body bursts upwards from the bed
>Looking around, I turn on the lights
>Oh thank god
>Will is sleeping soundly next to me
>I move over to him, and he awakes
>"Zahra, what is it?"
>'I-I had a nightmare...'
>"Well, don't worry about it.'
>'Can we talk about it?'
>"Sure."
>It was horrifying, the thought of him being gone, but having him next to me feels wonderful
>'It was real messed up, please don't think I'm a psycho.'
>"I have weird dreams every now and then, don't worry about it."
>'I-I killed you...'
>"Oh."
>'I was coming home from the bar drunk, and we got into an argument. I thought I could beat you up to teach you a lesson, but your neck...'

>And before I start to sob, Will moves over and embraces me in a huge hug
>"Don't worry, it's not real, and you never hurt me."
>This is why I love him
>He's so selfless
>Even when I was stuck to the bottle, she stayed by me and pulled me out
