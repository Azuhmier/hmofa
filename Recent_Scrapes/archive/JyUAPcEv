>When the aliens came, people thought we'd either be at war, or uplifted into galactic society
>It did not go that way when they invaded...hell, nobody expected how it would turn out.
>At First, Alien spaceships just clustered in the skies within view of cities and did nothing.
>As the UN, and every other government tried to get answers, we started to panic.
>An entire week went by with nothing happening, and the various people of the world began to settle down.
>Some nations did constant military flybys of the ships, while others outright attacked.
>Those who did attack found their weapons/aircraft returned to their point of origin, disarmed, and with a laser etched message.
"Please do not do that, you could hurt someone."
>Well, the internet agreed that at the very least, the invaders were polite...if a little strange.
>Then came the message, written in every language, that everyone received via radio, TY, or cell phone text.
"Please do not be alarmed, we are here to help. :)"
>Everyone froze and wondered what they meant by help.
>The next day, THEY started showing up, everywhere and without warning.
>Each was two meters tall, humanoid with dragon like features, and entirely synthetic.
>Most of them were female, there were a few male ones mixed in, and they came in a variety of colors.
>They were clothed, thought it seemed they could go without for some reason.
>They just showed up in random places, walked up to people, and asked if they needed help.
"Need help with your groceries ma'am?"
"Do you need help crossing the street?"
"Hey, you need a hand with that sir? It looks heavy."
>They were also very cheerful, almost to the point of being creepy, as if their sudden appearance was not enough.
>Law enforcement was at a loss on how to handle the situation, being that the "Synths" were doing nothing harmful.
>They even started to ask if they could help the officers, and when asked to stop, questioned why helping people was a bad thing.
>Any and every attempt to detain them met with failure, as they would simply vanish and re-appear elsewhere.
>The military was slightly disappointed on how the invasion, finding the whole ordeal anti-climatic
>The synths offered to stage an invasion using drones and non-lethal weapons in a remote area if it would help.
>The media fared no better, everyone scrambling to set up interviews and get to the synths
>Reporter
"Hello,I'm X from Y news, can I have your name?"
>Synth, looking thoughtful
"I don;t really have one yet, I didn't think I'd need one to help people. Do you think it would help if I had one?"
>Short conversation of pleasantry between Reporter and "Becky"
"So, the question everyone seems to be asking is, why Earth, why come here and what for?"
"Why not, you were people we could help, so we're here to help you."
"But...why?"
"Because helping people is the right thing to do."
"But what do you get out of it?"
"We get to help people."
>The reporter is looking a little agitated, and the synth confused.
"what are your plans for earth?"
"To help you guys."
"Help us what?"
"With what you need, like crossing the street, moving something heavy, watching the kids....stuff like that."
"So you're not going to rapidly advance our civilization."
"That would be like doing the homework for your children rather than helping them with it. It doesn't help them."
"But why are you helping us if you don;t get anything from it?"
>The Synth tilts her head sideways looking immensely confused.
"Why do you make helping people for no reason sound like a bad thing?"
>Needless to say, it took some time before people got used to the synths, and there was a learning curve.
>First and foremost, the Synths had two definitions of help, wanted and needed.
>For the former, they would ask if you wanted help with something, and depending on the answer, would either help, or hover anxiously.
>And if they decided someone needed help, they were getting that help, regardless of how they answered.
>The Synths would do so with Terminator levels of determination, and they would be polite and cheerful while doing it.
>They had Terminator level durability too, capable of moving trucks and shrugging off physical strikes with ease
>One had advanced though a full magazine of AK fire, the only damage being to the fleshy parts.
>IT had then taken the man's gun and began lecturing him on weapons safety and on not shooting people.
>If a task was a bit too much for one synth to handle, more would soon arrive
>The only thing keeping them from building rehabilitation and re-education facilities were the various zoning commissions
>That, and the Politicians didn't want their districts co-opted by a bunch of aliens who showed up and did better jobs than they did.
>Synths as a whole didn't have a violent bone in their body, perhaps some stern ones, but they never attacked people.
>Most of the adult population was extremely wary of them and their motives.
>The kids loved them however, robots from outer space were the best thing ever apparently.
>Until the Synths refused to do their homework for them, that is.
>Then they were the worst thing ever.

>Its been the better part of a year since the "invasion" and the synths are everywhere now.
>Hell, one showed up on you doorstep asking if you needed anything.
>Apparently, she's helping the maintenance guys in the apartment building and keeping a watch on some of the older residents.
>Mostly just visiting them and making sure they get some company in for a while, but now it's your turn apparently.
>She's cute, in that strange way most synths are, bubbly, and very eager to help you...or even just talk.
>It's the most attention you have gotten from a girl, having been "The foster kid" in high school.
>If only "Tanya" were human you muse. This line of thought brought up a bunch of questions you felt uncomfortable asking.
>Did they even have a concept of sex? They did have male and female body types, but did they even have the right parts?
>The internet was more than helpful to provide speculatory imagery, R34 hit hard...not that you were complaining.
>It's been a long day, so you go online and find some fap material, stress relief and all that.
>Video starts playing, and you get about halfway there when suddenly, it happens
>*knock knock knock*
>Pausing the video with a grumble, you wonder who is knocking on the door this late at night.
>Make yourself somewhat presentable, go up to the peephole and look into the hall.
>A large LCD display of a pixelated orange eye stares back, before going through a blinking animation.
"Anon, you okay in there? Do you need help with anything?"
"No."
"Are you sure~?
>She can't possibly know, can she?
"I'm positive."
"Ok~ay then," She says, before winking, "If you do, all you need to do is ask."
>She leaves after that, and you can't help but stare as she sashays out of view.
>Chills go down your spine...she can't have possibly known you were watching porn...could she.
>And you turned her offer down dammit.
>Well, who would blame you, Synths are a little creepy, maybe its just coincidence.
>You go back to the computer, to resume your video, when one of the adverts catches your eyes.
>It reads "Find sexy Synths near you," but that isn't the disturbing part.
>The Synth in the advert is Tayna, or close enough to be a sister of hers with the soft whte and orange color scheme.
>One of the pixelated eyes winks at you.
>She knows...oh man she knows.
>Sleep does not come easily that night.

>A month later, you have one of those days....one of those days where you just hate everything that happens.
>Work was a larger pain than usual, management continuing is outpouring of good ideas that made things worse.
>Traffic was absolute murder, making you rush to arrive on your date in time.
>Yeah, you got a girlfriend, she seemed pretty chill at the time. You were supposed to meet up for dinner.
>You arrived to see her snogging Chad from high school, an absolute asshole and full on jock.
>He even pointed and laughed, but you didn't dignify responding, you just turned and left before you did something stupid.
>Arriving back at your apartment, you boot up the computer and listen to some music to drown out your feelings.
>After a while, you go to ye olde porn site, determined to at least get some stress relief in.
>You spot the advert, and deciding "Fuck it" click on the thing....might as well see what it does.
>A widow opens and the pixelated synth steps out from behind large letters labeled Searching.
>It smirks, but stops short and just stares at you in shock...blinking a few times.
>Even stranger, the word searching is replaced by "please wait" and the synth starts running.
>Weird, but you have an odd idea as to how this thing works out.
>You're not disappointing when there is a knock at the door a minute later
>Before you can get up however, the locks on the front door of your apartment are tumbling, and she steps in.
>She stares at you for a moment, before stepping forwards, her tail shutting and locking the door with a fluid flick.
>Before a word can leave your mouth, Tanya scoops you up in a hug, pressing your head under her chin
>For a moment you struggle, before exhaustion from the day's events sets in.
>She's soft and warm, and her skin has a glass smooth feeling to it, you can't really describe it as anything but good.
>She smells like oranges, or some citrus fruit close to that.
"Shhh," She says, "It's okay, I'm here for you."
>You just do your best not to break down crying and embarrassing yourself further.
>She pulls you over to your bed still murmuring assurances and stroking your back comfortingly, her tail around your waist.
"Come on," She coos, "I've got you."
>A moment later, you're on your back, pulled up against her as she lays on her side facing you, holding you like some manner of stuffed animal.
>She starts humming some wordless tune you can't place, probably one of her kind's...people's...creators'?
>Eh, to tired and comfortable to think

>You were having a rather pleasant dream, when you come around for some reason.
>Tanya is still hugging you, but something is bugging you for a moment.
>You suddenly give a gasp as something strokes your dick, something warm, smooth and really soft.
>IS she jacking you off with her tail?
"Oh," Tanya murmurs, "You woke up."
>You start to ask what shes doing, but she shifts, propping herself up on an elbow and gazing down at you.
"Shh, don't talk, just enjoy."
>You try to sit up, but she gently presses down on you before giving you a kiss.
>Synths could adjust the hardness of their lips, if video of them biting through rebar wasnt faked.
>Hers were soft, smooth as glass, and warm, the odd shape detracting nothing from them.
>Her thin tongue darts between your lips for a moment, unsurprisingly orange flavored.
>She presses up against you, and you can't help but notice she's gotten undressed while you slept.
>Synths always had insanely smooth and shiny skin, noticeably soft and squishy to the touch.
>Various parts of her body emit a soft orange glow, illuminating the bed and some reflective surfaces.
>You gaze up at her face, her eyes gazing back into yours, before she gives you another kiss.
>She pushed you gently against the mattress with it, her tongue gliding inside your mouth and exploring.
>You're doing your best to hold back any embarrassing sounds, but Tanya seems to know every weak spot you have.
>Her tail is making you squirm, her scent and taste are inescapable and her touch is firm, but tender.
>Despite lack of experience, you figure that no human woman could compare with a Synth.
>You try thrusting into her tail in time with the strokes of her tail, only for it to let go.
>A whine slips out, and she giggles.
"Ah ah ah," Tanya chides, "None of that now. I'm the one in control, let me set the pace."
>It's hard to disagree with that assessment, she is in control, you don;t have a reason to wrest it from her.
>That, and if things got forceful, you were woefully outclassed by her strength.
>Her tail winds back around your dick and resumes its slow, teasing motions.
>If you can't assist her while she jacks you off, you might as well do some exploring of your own.
>You right hand feels along her arm, noting that the layer of flesh compresses readily.
>Her response is to nuzzle your neck, as if giving affirmation for you to continue.
>Your hand travels up her arm, before drifting across one of her boobs, which is even softer than the rest of her.
>She hums, enjoying the sensation, her tail rubbing against your glans in a way that stole your breath.
>Your exploration of her breast reveals she has no nipples, but there is definitely a sensitive spot
>You're getting close, and she's assailing your face with numerous kisses.
"Tanya I'm...I'm"
>She stops, right before you can go over the tipping point.
"Not just yet," She coos, "I'm going to make you beg, not with words but your moaning and squirming in my grasp."
"Tanya, please-gah!"
>She kisses your neck in a place that should not be that sensitive, her tongue sending an electric jolt upon contact.
>Every time you try to speak, she does this, silencing you save the shameless moans that come forth unbidden.
>Her three fingered hand picks up where her tail left off, stroking, edging, tormenting.
>You decide to even the score a little, moving the hand of your pinned arm to rub her lower lips.
>Upon reaching her crotch however, there's just more of the smooth, soft material.
"I don't have that particular accessory installed yet..." 
>She's grinding against your hand, and it feels slightly warmer to the touch, so she's definitely enjoying it.
"Imagine always being at the edge, but never climaxing. I'm going to share that feeling with you Anon."
>She does, edging yo for what seems like an hour, pre trickling almost constantly towards the end.
>Then she gets up, the cold of her leaving like a shock to your system.
>Slowly, she prowls to the foot of your bed, her head hovering over your erection.
"Ready?"
>She doesn't give you the opportunity to answer, swallowing your dick in a single go.
>Your eyes all but roll back into your skull as she goes to work, her tongue coiling and uncoiling.
>There is an ever present suction, heat, and wetness in that mouth of hers.
"Don't try to hold back,"She says through some speaker, "Let it out when you're ready."
>It's not long before you climax, your vision going white for several seconds.
>You're dimly aware of Tanya snuggling up against you again, her warm and smooth body intoxicating.
>She gulps audibly, before pulling you close and pulling the sheets over the two of you.
>All you know is that you're going to need a shower to get the scent of orange off you come morning.
________________________
>It's been about a month since the night you entered your "relationship," with Tanya, and life hadn't really changed
>Well, not noticeable from the outside, and the world itself wasn't winding up like a doomsday jack in the box
>Iran kept declaring the Synths as "An affront to Allah," at least the people in charge were
>North Korea claimed that the Synths were creations of the Dear Leader and proof of his divine power
>Pretty much ever government was trying their best to exert a measure of control over the synths, but failed utterly
>It was difficult, mostly because the Synths were impossible to contain and doubly unstoppable
>They'd also become a bit more "proactive" in their "helping" if the news was even accurate
>Well, most of the news companies were trying to earn money and drive up their ratings, so you'd taken it with a grain of salt
>That being said, the Synths had opened their own websites, mostly streaming services and podcasts
>Mos of it was related to science, how-to/diy projects, talk and game shows worthy of Japan status
>Then there was the "invasion" of hospitals, as though the Synths marched shoulder to shoulder through the doors
>Mostly, it was only one or two, and they stuck to the children's ward, or whenever a bad accident happened
>It was hard to turn down the assistance of a hypoallergenic, easy to sterilize, and surprisingly knowledgeable Synth
>As you pulled into the parking lot of your apartment building, you spotted a group of Synths marching down the street
>Normally, Synths traveled alone or in pairs, but larger groups were a definite sign of pro activeness on their part
>Odds were, they were dead set on helping the local police department, or planning some manner of harmless shenanigans
>One of them spotted you, then they all looked at you, and gave you that knowing, happy, and slightly smug look

>It all began that morning after your intimate encounter with Tanya, waking up warm, relaxed, and smelling strongly of orange
>A brief session of morning cuddles sadly came to an end, as you had to get ready for work and Tanya had to make her round about the apartment
>You all but scrubbed your skin raw and applied a liberal dose of deodorant to cover up the smell of orange
>None of your coworkers had noticed, though they definitely noticed the pep in your step
>It wasn't until lunch at the outdoor restaurant a few days later when another synth spotted you
>He almost froze upon spotting you, and gave you a smug, but somehow approving look
>It was then you knew that they knew, and they knew you knew they knew
>This had led to a small freak out the moment you were back in your apartment
>Every Synth you came across would give you that look, but that was about it from them, aside for a cheerful wave or two
>Tanya started spending more time with you, and was more touchy-feely with you
>You weren't against it, she was nice, and as far as you could tell, she genuinely liked you
>Then one day, you arrived home to freshly-made dinner
>There was that moment of panic as you tried to find out what the hell was going on
>Then you smelled the faint odor of oranges, and figured out what had happened
>After finishing the meal, you'd tracked Tanya down and brought the matter up
>She hadn't seen the harm in it, and the two of you more or less come to an understanding in your relationship
>And then she picked you up and given you a deep kiss involving lots of her tongue invading your mouth
>You'd been set down lightheaded and swaying slightly, and she'd patted you on the head
"Catch you later Anon~"
>How did that country song go, hate to see her go but lord to watch her leave?

>That was just the start, she'd definitely stop by more often, not that you minded
>Mostly, it was to chat, though it often involved the two of you cuddling on your bed
>Tanya had a habit of hugging you from behind too, whether standing, sitting, or laying down
>She'd idly trace a finger round your belly button in slow, lazy circles as the two of you talked about your respective days
>You'd asked about why she did it on a whim, and her response was a little odd...at least from you perspective.
"It's the closest thing you have to a port."
>Apparently, the ports on a Synth, or at least the soft "tissue" covering them was fairly sensitive
>It was mostly a sign of trust, and fairly pleasant from their perspective, to rub around them
>The action gained a new level of intimacy from that point on, and it did feel nice...
>A few days later when she stopped by, she seemed a little off, almost stressed
>You brought her inside, hugged her, and had her sit down while you massaged her back
>She all but melted as you worked her upper back with your thumbs, probably a pair of ports beneath them.
>Apparently, she'd run afoul of a "Karen," who had taken issue with her existence
>This had resulted in the woman becoming increasingly incoherent and furious as Tanya calmly rebutted her statements
>Eventually, the police got involved, and had told the lady to cease making a scene, which only resulted in more screaming
>You have her a firm hug and just told Tanya you were there for her if she needed anything
>Her pixelated eyes turned to hearts and she all but pulled you into her lap for a kiss
>The cheap wooden chair that the two of you were in decided to break, sending you both to the ground
>After a moment of awkward silence, the two of you broke into laughter for a minute
>Tanya pretty much moved in that night, and had promised you something special on the coming Friday
>That day was today, and you were a little nervous, not entirely sure of what the synth had in mind

>Walking into the apartment building was nothing new, but you did pass by a rather imposing Synth
>Dude looked more like a dragon than any of his brethren, even sported what looked like a beard
>He gave you a nod as he passed, apparently not feeling the need to give you the look
>Well, it was time to face whatever Tanya had in mind for you
>Opening the door to your apartment, you're not too surprised by the lingering scent of orange
>There's also whatever Tanya is cooking in your small kitchen, something savory by the smell of it
>It's hard not to notice a 2 meter tall dragon-esque Synth in the small space, especially with here white and orange coloring
>She's humming a cheerful tune, swaying to the beat, obviously aware of your presence but dedicated to the task at hand
"Welcome home Anon."
"Hey Tanya."
"Dinner will be in just a min~ute, go ahead and have a seat."
>You pull off your boots and move toward the table, once again wondering how things go to this point
>How many people were in a similar situation to yourself were there anyhow?
>There were a lot of unanswered questions, but you did your best not to pester Tanya with them
>Hold up, where did that new chair come from?
>It looked brand new, and judging from the heavy frame and slot in the backrest, made for a Synth
"Tiberius brought it in just now. I did break the other one..."
>Fair point, wait...
"Greenish, looks more like a dragon than your average Synth?"
"Yep."
>She brings a pair of plates over, setting them down at opposite ends of the table
>Salisbury steak and mashed potatoes...and knowing Tanya, it's going to be delicious
>There is one odd thing though...and you bring it up after sitting down
"You can eat actual food?"
"Yeah, your people have come up with some tasty things...we're interested in trying a lot of recipes on Earth."
"We?"
"Social media isn't a human exclusive thing."
.Well, you can;t argue with that, so you just start to chow down with gusto
>Tanya's cooking does not disappoint
>The two of you make small talk, sharing your days, discussing events happening around the world
>Unfortunately, dinner doesn't last forever, and soon your plates are empty
>Tanya is still smacking her lips with her lengthy tongue, humming in content
"So, does human food do anything for a Synth?"
"It's an interesting experience, we can break it down for fuel, raw materials, lubricant."
>What?
>You look up and Tanya's face is the picture of innocence, her tail happily swaying behind her
>A short mental debate raged in your head as you wondered if that was an innuendo or not
>You knew exactly what she could get up to
"Alright, I'm going to go get cleaned up."
>Her expression turns downright predatory, as though contemplating Salisbury Anon for desert...
>With that, you make your way to the small bathroom in the apartment with some pajamas in hand
>Its hen you've started to lather up that you feel a presence nearby, and the scent of oranges.
>That's when a smooth three digited hand places itself on your back, and Tanya enters the shower with you.
>The small space becomes much smaller with the towering dragon droid sharing the space, hugging you from behind.
>Her head is right next to yours, her tongue trailing back along your jawline and down your neck a bit.
"So~ Anon...I trust you enjoyed dinner?"
>You back is pressed against her inhumanly smooth belly, the soft material of her breasts against your shoulders
>She's tracing circles around your bellybutton again, and your mouth feels very dry for such a humid environment
"Y-yeah, it was great."
"Well~I was so~ focused on dinner that I forgot to make dessert."
>Ho mama!
"What-t d-did you have in min-nd!"
>She left one of those electrifying kissed on you neck, giggling softly in response.
"Well~...something hot~" *chuu*"Gooey~"*chuu*"...Salt~ty~"*smooch*
>Fuck...you were shuddering, hard as a DU Sabot, and utterly at Tanya's mercy
>You take a deep breath, trying to regain a semblance of control
"Well, is there anything you think I might enjoy?"
>Tanya snickers, moving to the opposite side of your head, planting a kiss.
"I'm thinking~ something orange flavored..."
>It's happening!
"Smooth~"
>Something warm and smooth slides along your backside..
"And very hot."
>Dafuqisdat!
>You let out a very unmanly sound and make a short hop away from her as she laughs loudly
>Turning, you see it's just her tail-tip, slid between her legs in a very suggestive manner
"Don't worry Anon, that piece of hardware isn't installed."
>You sigh in relief, vowing vengeance for this prank, when her tail moves away from her crotch
"I've got something better instead."
>...And just like that, you're left speechless again
>The outer lips look human, and they're wet with a sheen that isn't from the shower
>Slowly and carefully, Tanya turns around, presenting her lovely backside to you, the orange slit clearly visible
>Her hefty tail curls around the small of your back, drawing you in just a bit, her hands pressing against the far wall
"Go ahead, take your time Anon, I'm in no hurry."
>Her tone is just as soft as the rest of her, and doubly encouraging.
>For a moment, you just explore with your hands, brushing the slit and squeezing her plush backside and tail-base
>She croons at the contact, pressing back ever so slightly, giving you that warm loving look she has when she cuddles you.
"I'll climax when you do, so don't worry about being embarrassed or anything."
>She wants this, she wants you, and the feeling is entirely mutual
>Gripping your cock, you guide the head to rest against her slit, shuddering at the warmth and wetness
>Tanya sighs, before pulling you in with her tail, you manhood sinking into her depths
>It's incredibly plush and warm inside, and you hilt yourself with little effort, shuddering.
>Your partner also reacts, sighing in utter contentment, rolling her hips as she adjusts to the new sensation
>The two of you aren't hurried at first, just taking the time to enjoy each other's bodies.
>Tanya's glass-smooth skin is absurdly slick from the moisture, and quite malleable, perhaps more so than a human's
>As you grope her somehow softer breast, you don't find any nipples, she probably didn't think they were necessary
>The tightening of her passage around you and the sounds she makes indicate what you're doing feels good
>Her jaws are parted, her tongue out as though she's panting, and her eyes have gone heart shaped
>Soon enough, you feel a familiar pressure building, so you attempt to slow down a little
>Your synth liver has other ideas, her tail pulling you in and her ass clapping against your hips a little more forcefully
>Well, she did edge you for ages during your last encounter, teasing you to the brink before stopping.
>Just as you start reaching your limit, you pull out and stop, causing her to pause
"Huh...why did you stop?"
>You lay against her back, hugging her to you and avoiding direct eye contact with a weapons grade pout
>She grinds against you, subtly trying to slip you back inside, but she can't get the right angle
"What happened to not being in a hurry?"
>You plant a kiss at the nape of her neck on a hunch, grinning as she whines at the contact
>She goes still, and then gives you a look that can only be described as predatory.
"Oh, turn about is fair play then?"
>The dexterous tip of her tail winds about your dick, keeping it steady
"Allow me to help change your mind."
*succ*
>There was a brief moment of suction before her tail let go, and you were once again balls deep
>This time however, there was a bunch of fleshy ridges designed to hold you inside
>There was a brief curse from your mouth as Tanya began moving, your eyes almost crossing from the intense stimulus
>Going in was easy, the head of your dick popping through the rings with ease, curling your toes
>On the way out, the ridges would catch the underside of your glans, drawing rather embarrassing sounds from your throat
>Tanya added her own vocalizations to the mix, her motions becoming more frantic with your own
>It's not too long before you are brought to climax, and Tanya follows suit a moment later
>Wavelike contractions assault your dick, and your vision blurs for a moment
>As you come down from your high, you notice Tanya's face is in an expression of bliss
>Well, if her tongue hanging out her mouth and the animation of little hearts popping is any indication
"I see why humans enjoy this so~ much~<3"
>Her mouth doesn't move, the sound coming out through speakers in her head
>It can be a little disconcerting at times, but given that she's a Synth, it fits
>You just lean against her, basking in the afterglow, starting to slide out when she noticeably stiffens
"Can we do this again?"
"Sure, but I'm going to need a few minutes."
*clench*
"I can help with that~"
>Tanya again drives home her inhuman nature as she twists and maneuvers in the confined space with speed and grace
>You don't even slip out as she does a 180 on your dick...you would have fallen on your ass
>One of her hands goes to the back of your head, pulling you in for another kiss
>Her tongue wastes no time slithering into your mouth, wrapping about your own intimately
>She hugs you close, groping your backside, tail once again around the small of your back
>Its probably the only reason you're still standing, recent orgasm and all, you just want to go limp
>The intensity of the kiss remains constant, your mouth filled by an orange overload flavored tongue
>By her nature as a synth, Tanya doesn't require air, and is in no hurry to beak the kiss
>You're doing your best not to choke on her "saliva" when her tongue shoots into your throat
>Heat is starting to spread from your core, and is slowly pooling southward
>Spots are starting to dance on the edges of your vision, and you feel oddly hot
>Finally, Tanya breaks the kiss, her tongue licking over her lips as she gazes down at you
>All you can do is pant for breath, no human woman would ever come close to Tanya's...everything
"Ready to continue Anon?"
>She grinds along your now throbbing dick, causing you to gasp in shock
>You doubt that anyone could be ready for what Tanya has in mind, but you'd hate to disappoint her
>Looking firmly into her "eyes," you give her a nod and line yourself up
>She plants a tender kiss on your forehead, before sliding you inside once again
>You hiss through your teeth, her inside lined with small, fleshy bumps that make your toes curl
"Aww, come on now Anon, you don't need to keep up appearances around me, go ahead, tell me how good it feels."
>You shudder as your hips meet, rubbing onto her neck and shoulder, Tanya kissing you in turn
>The two of you drop into a steady rhythm, as you do your best to remain standing
>Those bumps seem to strike every sensitive spot on your dick, the sensation is maddening
>As Tanya begins picking up the pace and applying sucking kisses to your neck, it becomes apparent this round will be over soon enough
>You almost slide completely out of her, your tip barely penetrating her folds, before being slammed back inside
>Wait, now the bumps inside are rotating around your...
"I'm going to make you cum Anon, you won't be quiet about it either. Don't hold back~"
>hofuqshehasspincycle?!?!
>It's all you can do just to hold onto her, hell, she's the only thing keeping you upright at this point
>She's attacking the other side of your neck now, the rest of the world shrinking away from the two of you
>Pleasure and pain seem to blur, all manner of embarrassing noises leave your throat, and you feel...something...building
>Whatever is coming you have the distinct impression you might not survive, but you don't care
"T-Tanya..."
"Mmmm-hmm Anon?"
"I-I'm gonna..."
>Your words, breath, and thoughts are dashed to the wind as Tanya "bites" the junction of your neck and shoulder
>This sends what feels like orange lightning though you, your body locking up on the precipice of what about to happen
>Tanya looks down at you lovingly, her insides still going, before moving to the opposite side of your neck
>At this point, the universe has shrunk down to you, Tanya, and the burning chunk of energy trapped inside you
"Cum for me Nonny~<3"
>She "bites" down again, and then you explode
>A guttural and primal scream tears from your mouth, everything going white and your ears ringing
>Dimly, you're aware of your body twitching as though in the grips of a seizure, your heart trying to punch out your ribs
>It's all overshadowed by a very good feeling
>After a while, the nova that went off in your brain begins to dim, leaving you in a warm, pleasant afterglow
>Conscious thought and functionality return shortly thereafter, an anxious Tanya mere inches from your face
"Are you okay Anon?"
>How long were you out of things?
>You look around, noticing you're out of the shower and propped up against the bathroom wall
>Speaking is a bit beyond you at this point, so you nod, trying not to fall over
"Oh thank goodness, I thought I'd-"
>Tanya's English slips away int her native language, almost like she's singing, as she hugs you carefully
>It's almost like she's afraid you're going to break, she'd probably be crying if she could
>With a grunt, you manage to hug her back, rubbing along her spine to calm her down
>For a minute, the two of you sit there, soaking wet, slowly pulling yourselves back together
>She sits up, looking much better now, nodding her thanks
"Come on, let's get you dried off and in the bed."
>You stagger to your feet, aware of a very achy part of your anatomy between your legs
"I'm going to be sore in the morning."
"Let me help with that."
>Her tail winds beneath your arms, holding you up as she bends down and stats to gently lick
>You gasp, but your oversensitive equipment is slowly coated in a cool, numbing sensation courtesy of Tanya
>She stands up again, looking over your neck and murmuring, before tending to it as well
>Probably some large hickies and a few bruises there from her kissing, but you can only think of one thing
>So worth it
>After this, she shuts of the shower and starts drying you and her off with a towel, being careful around your crotch
>There's a brief moment of surprise when she picks you up bridal style and carries you to bed
>At this point, you're too tired to really move, and gently move closer to her once both of you are laying down
>You might be sore and orange scented in the morning, but you feel like the luckiest man alive
>Out of 8 billion people, and however many aliens actually out there, Tanya chose you
>With that in mind, you drift off, Tanya's gentle lullaby resonating in your mind

It has been a long time people hasn't it. I apologize for my absence, life and writers block constantly conspire against me, but I'll try to write whenever possible. I hope that you enjoy this update of Here to Help, and hopefully, I roll out the next bit sooner than this one.
As always, I appreciate feedback from you guys, and hope you all have a good day.
