>you're cornered, your plan backfired terrifically
>Steve's hounds surround you, barking and growling as you fend them off with a firepoker from the nearby fireplace
>you're in Steve's "trophy" room
>might as well be a morgue
>and it was probably going to be your grave
>You could hear him coming
>not amount of pleading from your Aunt would save you this time
>you were between him and his prey, his prize, his trophy
>Freja is Behind you, whimpering and trying to dig into the carpeted floor
>but goddamit you weren't going down without a fight
>you bring the poker down onto one of the hounds earning a pained whimper
>normally you would hate to hurt a dog but you would make an exception this time
>as you swung your makeshift weapon you prayed to every deity you know
>"let me protect her, let her escape, i dont care if i die! SHE doesnt deserve this"
>Steve burst through the doorwith his double barrel shotgun in hand
>he studied the situation for a moment before grinning 
>this must be perfect for him, get rid of you AND get his prize
>he levels his shotgun at you calmly
>"Goodbye Anon, I would say I'm going to miss you, but that would be lying"
>but it seems one of the gods heard you
>a flash of blinding light, a loud bang
>the hounds scatter, you hear Steve swear angrily 
>you cover your eyes for fear of being blinded, Freja hides behind you
>when at last the light and sound die down you uncover your eyes to..
>a Man? No.. not a man, a giant standing at 7 feet tall easily
>He stands looking at a watch on his wrist, wearing a pitch black suit and tie with a black helmet that reminded you of a knights helmet, except with horns; the word "titan" in green lettering on the side
>he looks away from his watch and turns his head so his neck cracks and pops and you hear a faint sigh
>a finger to his ear and his helmet just dissolves into nothing
>he breathes in deep, eyes closed
>"terra" you make out a mumble from him
>a Gunshot resonates, tearing you away from the spectacle before you


>you are Titan, the giant human raised by Anthros
>you didn't know WHY they chose you for this
>something about your Augs and steam vents able to handle this travel
>whatever
>you were told of a man doing the unthinkable
>Hunting down Anthros for sport
>SPORT of all things
>the second they said that you signed on, anger flowing through you
>"lets enjoy this" said the little voice in your head
>you agreed with it wholeheartedly
>your combat suit donned and your helmet ready you were transported via some science you didn't understand
>might as well be space magic for all you understood
>but what you knew was it worked
>you were in the middle of a room looking at a human male with a fox anthro behind him
>he had a firepoker pointed at you, his knees trembled but he stood fast
>hmmm how brave
>you click your helmet and feel it dissolve and breathe in
>"Terra" you murmur
>you had never been on the homeworld and it meant everything to you
>even if it was some weird alternate universe or something
>you're enjoying the freshest air you've ever tasted when you hear it
>a gunshot
>you feel what is equivalent to a child punching you in the back
>snapped out of your trance you turn to the source
>an elderly man stands before you, double barrel shotgun pointed at your chest
>you frown and look around the room
>animal heads lined the walls
>your eyes settle on a pair of Anthro foxes
>how could you not recognize Anthros? they raised you
>anger envelops you like a lover
>he HUNTED them? for SPORT?! you had hoped it was a joke, no one was that heartless
>but then your mind drifts to Maggie, how she was hunted and murdered
>you rush the man down 
>he fires of the second shell of he shotgun into your chest earning him nothing but more anger
>a quick knee to his stomach makes him double over, dropping his weapon
>the discarded weapon is now in your hands
>"you think THIS is fun" you gesture to the room, the soulless eyes stare down on him
>you bend the shotgun into a pretzel and overcharge your Augs throwing it full force through the wall above him
>>"ill show you fun, you have 10 seconds"
>the man whimpers at your feet trying to comprehend
>"w-what?"
>you scowl
>"Run"
>he tries, he really does
>desperation is great motivation
>but he cant outrun you
>you catch him before he can even leave the house
>dragging him by the throat, you stomp back into his "trophy" room
>you feel the floorboards cracking beneath your boots
>the young man stands petrified but unwavering before you as you drag the old man into the room
>>the eyes of the fallen are on him
>you look up into the eyes of the Fox Anthros and you feel your heart sink
>a quick glance an the fox behind the young man told you these were her parents
>you scowl
>"hurt him" says the voice
>you dont hesitate
>his head is slammed into the wall beneath the poor anthros, your hand trying to crush every bit of life from him
>He crumples, a bleeding laceration on the back of his head
>you stand over him frowning
>a look up at the two fox heads, one's twisted in terror, the other in anger
>a peek at the one behind the young man
>"you know what to do" says the voice "just like always"
>you pick the man up by his neck once more and slam him into the wall
>Cracks form in the plaster as you slam him face first into the wall beneath the fallen foxes
>you then look at the man, bleeding and struggling in vain
>some how still alive
>a full lunge downwards with all your body weight and strength, smashes him into the floor
>"time for our signature move"
>you raise a heavy foot over his bloodied face
>"Look at those foxes, and tell me it was worth it, that it was fun" you growl
>he doesnt get a chance to respond as you Overcharge your Augs again and Slam your heel through the floor
>all thats left now is a headless body and you prying your leg out of the carpet and floor beneath it
>you turn to the young man
>"take care of her" is all you say before pressing a button and zipping back to your timeline

>Be Anon
>somehow you were saved
> whats left of steves body lay on before you, broken on the floor
>his head somewhere beneath the house, probably turned to pudding from that giant earthshaking stomp
>Freja whimpers behind you
>"i-is it over?"
> you drop the fire poker and run your fingers through your hair
>"i..i think so"
>you hug her close 
>"i think so"
