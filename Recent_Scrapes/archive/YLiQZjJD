Connect the Sweet Spots [Jaguar; Comfy, Scratches and Massages, Intimacy]: The greatest reward a firefighting jaguar can receive at the end of a long day is coming home to her Anon for a little bit of pampering, enough to bring the little kitten out of the big cat.

>It’s late in the afternoon when you get the text
>[on my way home soon :3]
>It’s Turrula
>Her 24-hour shift at the fire station is finally over
>So now she has the weekend with you
>It’s heartbreaking to be away from her for whole days at a time, but it’s for a good cause
>Plus, she’s never far from your side whenever she gets off work
>At least one of these two days will be spent pampering her
>She doesn’t demand or even ask it of you, but you’re willing to treat her well regardless
>None of the other men at the fire station ever interested her
>It’s mostly dogs
>Mostly bigger ones
>Not only is she one of the few women on the team (not even enough to fill a full calendar, unlike the boys), but she’s the only feline as well
>However, the jaguar grew up where it’s hot and humid, so the roaring fires and the torrents of water barely faze her
>Not to mention she’s no slouch in the strength department
>The job came naturally to her
>Even the Dalmatians can’t take away her title as “the best spotted firefighter on the team”
>Turrula takes pride in what she does, though you can tell it wears on her sometimes
>But her duties are tolerable thanks to the love you provide whenever she’s off the clock
>So when you receive the text you have precious minutes to prepare everything
>Lay out her favorite robe
>Set the fireplace
>Grab a glass for her warm milk
>You might have time to get a meal started when you know she’s close to being done with her shift
>Though more often than not she just brings take-out home with her
>Turrula walks through the door with a powerful sigh
>Usually she comes home exhausted from just sitting around waiting for a call
>If it’s something particularly hazardous, you can be sure the news crew is tracking it
>More than once you’ve seen your girl in action live
>Occasionally she’ll be covered in dirt or doused in water, depending on what kind of emergency occurs
>One time she came back looking like a black panther with all the soot on her fur
>Today she’s a little cleaner, but that’s because she’s sopping wet
>”Rookies”, is all she can say with a shake of her head
>Every step she takes peels another bit of clothing from her
>She’ll grab them eventually, but picking up for her is one more way to score some brownie points
>She drags herself into the bathroom and kicks on the shower
>Now’s your chance to heat the milk and finish what you didn’t get to yet
>Kick on the music
>Take some blankets out
>Turrula is a fan of her showers, but you can tell this one is going to be short-lived
>The singing is cut short, followed by the water
>”Anon!” she calls out
>You head over to the bathroom door
>”I forgot my towel…” she whines
>Technically, you forgot it
>But she’ll never blame you for missing a step of her routine
>After all, you’re not obligated to do any of it
>And yet it’s that sort of commitment that has made the relationship grow tighter
>You hand her a towel and the jaguar dries herself off
>You’re about to leave the bathroom when you hear her whine again
>She’s sitting on the edge of the tub half wrapped up
>With her body partially exposed and her expectant look, someone else might have thought she’s asking for something a little more sensual
>But after being with her for so long, you know that isn’t quite the case
>No, THAT kind of intimacy will come another time
>For now, she just wants you to help her dry off
>You grab a second towel and the two of you work the fur in unison
>Turrula does her legs while you take care of her back and head
>She needs to leave her favorite spots for YOU
>As you run the towel over her, she begins her process of unwinding
>You’re not just wicking up moisture, you’re also breaking down her tension
>Her muscles relax as you work your hands into them
>”Mmmm…” she hums
>You continue for a bit even after her fur is dry enough
>You let her enjoy the moment, then move on when she wants to
>Her royal blue robe is all ready for her
>The jaguar ties it comfortably around her athletic body
>You take her by the paw and lead her to the living room
>Everything’s waiting patiently for her

>The couch will be your nest for probably the next few hours
>You get settled in, and Turrula lies down next to you
>She places her head on your lap, and the night begins
>You start with some simple head scratches
>Almost immediately she falls into a hypnotic sort of trance
>Her round ears flatten as you rub behind them
>The jaguar doesn’t exactly “purr” like you’ve heard from smaller cats
>But the sound that reverberates deep in her chest at your touch is as close to purring as one could get
>Turrula bunches her body up, pulling her legs in closer
>There’s no way she’d fit on your lap entirely
>She always makes an earnest effort to, though
>After showing ample attention to her ears, you move to her face
>Her mossy eyes close as your fingers stroke the bridge of her nose
>From her wide, rosy snout all the way up to her forehead
>Her nostrils flare with the motion
>This is where she really seems to start enjoying herself
>There’s no wrong way to rub her here
>The tip of her pink tongue sticks out from her black lips
>It slides in and out in slow gestures, though only a bit at most
>You press firmly with your thumb as you continue to stroke her nose
>Sometimes her eyelids are pulled open just slightly along with your strokes
>When they are, you can see her green eyes roll back in bliss
>You move down the sides of her head
>A smile forms on her face as you draw circles on her cheeks
>Then you gently navigate through the spaces between her whiskers
>Your hands reunite under her jaw, where the massaging resumes
>You scratch under her chin with your knuckles
>Then your hands flatten to rub her neck
>She loves the scruff in the back the most
>You can steal a quick tug at it from time to time
>She’s told you it reminds her of her childhood when you do that
>Turrula brings her arms up to her chest
>Her large paws flex and knead the air
>She’s the biggest kitten you’ve ever seen
>Her eyes open lazily
>You already know what she’s looking for before she can say it
>”Milk?” she mouths silently
>It’s still plenty warm
>You bring the glass to her lips and let her sip at her own pace
>Yeah, just like a kitten
>The jaguar continues to paw at the air while she downs the milk
>She has an adorable white mustache when she finishes it
>You wipe the milk off, but her rough tongue is too fast
>She licks your fingers clean, then nuzzles her head into your hand
>The girl just doesn’t want those fingers to go a moment without attending to her needs
>The scratches go on for some time
>You grab one of the floating paws and work the spots between the digits
>No part of her will go unloved
>The shoulders are next, though you never dwell on them for too long
>She gets frequent back and shoulder rubs throughout the normal day
>The “kitten treatment”, on the other hand, is its own special process
>There are much more infrequent, but you can tell she appreciates them more when they do occur
>It’s at this point that Turrula slowly rotates herself over
>Her head leans over your lap, now on her belly
>She continues her attempt to fit her whole body on top of your legs
>They’d soon fall asleep if you let her full weight bear down on you like that
>But…you don’t mind it every once in a while
>You move to recline on the couch fully
>Your own head lies back on the armrest
>Turrula immediately scoots up as far as she can go
>Her fuzzy head nestles under your chin
>Those large paws are folded underneath her chest, like a Sphinx
>You can feel the nails softly burrow into your shirt
>The jaguar still hangs off of you quite a bit, but she acts as though she could fit in the palm of your hand
>She makes fidgeting motions, waiting for you to keep going
>”Please,” she seems to say without so much as a word
>You’re happy to indulge
>You massage down her spine, giving her pleasure even through her bathrobe
>Her shoulder blades roll with the sensation
>When you travel farther down her back, then the kitten truly comes out
>Is it an instinctual thing, or something she just imitates?
>Whatever the case, she relishes it
>As your hand glides down toward the base of her tail, her rump lifts into the air
>It drops when you reach the end, only to rise once again when the next rub approaches
>Again and again you stroke down her back
>Her tail curls along the journey
>And once you hit the sweet spot, it flicks up rigidly
>This is her meditative element
>Eyes closed
>Tongue poking out
>Paws kneading your torso
>The rumble of her chest resonating through your body
>Her legs rubbing together to stay on your lap
>And her long, graceful tail swaying in time with everything, like a metronome
>The heat of her body keeps you warm
>And the crackling fire keeps her warm
>As does your love
>You’d think the last thing she’d want to see at the end of her shift fighting fires is to see flames dancing in the corner of her eye
>But she knows when they’re meant for comfort
>Just as she knows when she’s safe in your arms
>Turrula is very much like the fire herself
>There’s the strong, stalwart jungle cat in her when she’s on the job
>But under that spotted fur coat is just a little kitten at the end of the day
>The way things are going now, you’ll likely be on the couch for the night
>You’ll get the use of your legs back in the morning
>Maybe they’re already falling asleep, but the longer you have Turrula on your lap the lighter she seems to be
>Her tail satisfied, you slowly work your way back up her body
>Up the spine, along the neck, and finishing with her head
>You scratch behind those cute, round ears to lull the jaguar into a peaceful rest
>Though not without receiving a heartfelt, “I love you, Anon.”
>From your Turrula, the biggest kitten you know
