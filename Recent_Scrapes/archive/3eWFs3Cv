>This evening had been perfect for you.
>How could it not have been?
>You got to spend the entire day with Aisha, your girlfriend
>Sure both of you earned random stares throughout the day, but you did your best to ignore them.
>After all, people staring was nothing new.
>She is a 7 foot tall African spotted dog anthro, while you are just...You.
>Her confession of love to you was out of the blue, with her saying she loved you because of all you did for her.
>Turns out all you did was let her copy your homework so she wouldn't fail chemistry back in high school.
>But that was all it took it seems, with you now in college and her in a trade school for fixing Motorcycles.
>Both of you had stuck through it, despite how it looked to outsiders
>She was... Is? ...Has been? Whatever, she would usually be described as a delinquent
>Tall, Tough, and with fur dye tattoos covering her muscular arms
>Her short hair, dyed neon blue, and usually wearing a leather biker jacket; she looked like she was robbing you
>In fact a few cops had stopped you both in the streets on date nights, asking you if everything was ok.
>You always wrapped one arm around Aisha's waist and pulled her close, earning a surprised yelp from her when that happened
>That little squeak is what made the cops believe you when you said it was a date between the two of you.
>Her embarrassed look is what convinced them, and her trying to hide behind you really sold it
>She was, and still is embarrassed about being seen as soft and loving
>Having grown up in a large family of criminals, she had to be tough
>Her father has been in prison for 15 years, her older brother was in jail for robbery, and her younger siblings all had various crimes marking their records
>But Aisha didn't.
>Mainly because of you
>You told her that if she needed money, you would help her so she didn't have to rob people or burgle or whatever
>She deserved better, and you were determined to help her realize it
>But all that falls to the wayside as you step out of the sushi restaurant, your arm locked around her muscular arm
>"Where to now Babe?" you ask happily, looking up at her.
>The two of you had a classic date, a Movie at the theaters and dinner.
>She bites her lower lip and looks to the side concerned at what she has to say
>You already know it’s because of something with her family
>"Uh...Can we go to your place Anon? I think one of my brothers has a girlfriend over or something" she says, not looking you in the eyes.
>A weak excuse, but not one you were going to argue with
>"Ok Love, Lets go" you say with a smile
>You hand interlocked with her padded fingers, you lead her back to her motorcycle.
>She learned to ride early on, and buying a car is expensive, so usually she gave you rides everywhere
>The confused looks from people at your college were priceless she dropped you off and gave you a goodbye kiss
>A muscular paw squeezes your butt as you grab your helmet, making you jump in surprise
>"Hey!" you call out in anger as you look to Aisha, who giggles
>"Sorry sorry! You’re just SO cute!" she says with a grin, buckling her own helmet over her dyed hair
>With a quick sweep of her leg, she’s on her bike and patting the seat behind her
>"Come on Anon" she cooes softly, the way she speaks would surprise anyone else, the soft voice coming from such a tough looking woman is startling at best
>Quickly you swing a leg over the bike and wrap your arms around her waist, earning a satisfied “mmm" from her
>You know that it is only for you to hear, as she reves up her bike and sets off to your apartment
>The world blurs by as you hug her close
>In times like this, when there was nothing but the sound of her bike, you and her
>You were truly reminded of how close you were to her
>Yea, you both looked like polar opposites, but you knew everything about her, her loses and fears
>But that didn’t matter, it never did
>Even now as your arms were wrapped around Aisha's thicc waist, you didn’t think about your differences
>Rather you thought about everything you had in common
>Both of you had parents who didn’t care
>Sure, it was pure coincidence that you grew up with parents who would rather get high 
>And she grew up with parents who would rather go rob someone over raising thier children
>Somehow it brought you both closer together
>Maybe it’s because when you have no one else rooting for you, all you need is one other person rooting you on
>For you that other person just happened to be her, and you were sure for her, you were that other person
>And in the end, you didn’t need anyone else; you were self-sufficient, but having Aisha's approval made every accomplishment that much sweeter.
>When she told you of every small thing,  her getting accepted into the local trade school; her graduating high school as the first one in her family... you threw a small party consisting of just you and her.
>Her bike roars as she splits the lanes of traffic, zooming in-between the cars at a standstill.
>Your state never did make it illegal, so she would take advantage of it, regardless of how you said it terrified you.
>Some things you just could never change, and her veering through traffic was one of them.
>But if that was it, just her being defiant about lane splitting, that was one you were willing to concede.
>The highway is packed because of nothing, just people being right assholes and slowing down for literally nothing.
>It used to annoy you, getting stuck in traffic for some assholes who were so engrossed watching a cop pull over some dumb idiot who sped.
>Those things didn’t bother you anymore, Aisha liked to drive, and you didn’t mind being a passenger to this wild ride.
>You hold her close as the world zips by in a roaring flurry, earning satisfied high pitched “A Hummmm" noises from Aisha
>If you didn’t have your head pressed against her back you would miss those small noises, but you were so glad you didn’t.
>Hearing her enjoyment from it all was the best drug you could ever have.
>You're so lost in thought, mesmerized by Aisha's firm body and the sounds she makes, that you don’t even realized that you're at your apartment.
>Nuzzles, tight hugs, and happy whimpers from Aisha tell you this night isn’t one of sex, but one of quiet snuggles.
>Overflowing love between two people who deserved it.
>It was perfect as you unlocked your apartment door and got pulled softly by Aisha to your bedroom.
>No words are needed as you bother strip happily.
>Her to just a pair of stretched panties, and you to a pair of loose boxers.
>You had gotten an extra-long bed to accommodate her height a while ago, even though she hated that you spent money on her.
>She always did hate when you bought things for her sake, even now, after so many months into your relationship.
>months? Years? Did it matter?
>She is your best friend and you don’t mind spending a bit of money for her comfort.
>Both of you slip into your bed in your preferred sleeping positions; you on your back and her cuddled up to your side
>Perfect for you to wrap one arm around her waist and pull her close.
>"I love you Anon" Aisha whispers happily, snuggling her head into your chest.
>"I love you too Aisha" you murmur, half asleep already.
>It had been a long day; although it had been wonderful to spend with Aisha, a day on your feet all day was exhausting
>Aisha's large head nuzzles into your chest, pulling the blankets into a small pillow between her head and your bony ribs
>"Thank you for such a wonderful day" she murmurs happily, her large ears twitching and tickling your chin.
>You rub your hand up and down her back in reassurance
>"I had such a good time with you babe" you say with the aloofness only fatigue can bring.
>A happy, "Ahum" is the only answer you get from her and she pulls you closer to her.
>You hear rain start to splatter against your windows and the two of you drift off to sleep together

>Weight, or was it pressure?
>Something pressing down on your chest and limbs.
>Not pressing like Aisha's comforting weight on you.
>No, this was all encompassing.
>You struggle against it and feel your body collapse upon itself, not listening to your commands to move.
>Nothing.
>No response from your body at all.
>You struggle against it, trying hard to move, only to have the feeling change
>It was no longer crushing weight, but dozens of spectral hands pulling you downwards into the bed.
>The only thing you can control is your eyes as you search around for answers as to what is tormenting you.
>They rest, at long last, on your semi open closet door.
>Did you leave it open? Or did Aisha?
>Doesn’t matter now as a pair of blood red glowing eyes stare at you, with dozens of ghastly hands spewing forth from the closet opening.
>All you can do is whimper softly, as you feel the hands pulling you towards the closet.
>Your fearful whimpers cause a soft stirring 
>How could you forget Aisha? Probably because the crushing weight from these hands made the weight from her head unnoticeable
>"A-anon?" she whispers looking at you, her blue eyes glinting in the dark.
>You can't answer, looking your eyes onto hers in a panic, trying to ignore the red eyes from the closet.
>"A-anon!? Are you ok?! She cries sitting up quickly, looking over your body for any physical issues.
>You can't move, you can't answer, and all you can do is blink like an idiot.
>It’s been a long time since you suffered from sleep paralysis.
>Your body is still asleep but your mind isn’t.
>Ok... Stay calm.
>Blink at her, get her attention.
>You blink your eyes furiously at her, until she looks at them.
>"Why are you?... Can't you..." she murmurs with a slight frown.
>Come on, you had talked to her about this before
>"That thing, night frozenness or something!" she says in realization, looking into your eyes with unwavering determination.
>Her muscular frame wraps around you, seeming to push aside the specters hands 
>"Uh... I got you love, it's ok, I got you" she whispers, nuzzling your head into the crook of her neck
>"It's ok...it's ok" she reassures you softly
>You focus on her instead of the hundreds of shadow hands trying to get to you.
>They all seem to be repelled by the soft caress of you love, which was a welcome surprise.
>Closing your eyes and ignoring everything besides Aisha, you stay awake and unable to move.
>Aisha's whispers turn to soft snores as she keeps you pressed to her.
>You don't even realize you’ve fallen asleep, until you feel your eyes snap open to sunlight streaming through the window.
>The smell off coffee and bacon fills the air as you wander out of the bedroom and find Aisha in the kitchen, wearing short shorts and an apron.
>Her ears swivel towards you as you walk up behind her.
>"Hey love" you say, wrapping your arms around her waist.
>"Hey baby, you ok?" she says happily as she tends to the bacon.
>"Mhm, I love you" you say pushing the side of your face into the soft fur of her back.
>she gives a short snicker and Smiles happily.
>"Love you too"
