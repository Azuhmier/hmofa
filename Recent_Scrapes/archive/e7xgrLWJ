SATELLITE

>Be Anon
>You were 27 years old, standing at a height of 5'11".
>It was Saturday night, during late Summer.
>The weather had been cooler lately, with several large thunderstorms rolling through the state as of lately.
>Right now, for example.
>Currently, you were laying in your twin bed, staring at the window.
>Through the blinds, you could see (and hear) fat drops of rain beating against the windowpanes.
>Every minute or so, the room would be lit up for a split second by lightning, which would be quickly followed by the deep rumble of thunder.
>You thought it was relaxing, as you've always liked storms.
>Unfortunately, your roommate in no way shared your feelings for the current weather.
>Your roommate, an Anthro Border Collie gal named Sarah, has always been kinda skittish around storms. Thunderstorms in particular.
>As a result, she had been having quite the tough time lately.
>During the past couple days, every time a clap of thunder would ring out, you would see Sarah jump a bit, followed by some quiet whimpering and seeking the nearest blanket to cover herself with.
>It would be pretty sad if it wasn't so cute.
>Poor Sarah.

>Currently, you were just laying in bed, letting the sound of rain lull you to sleep.
>Just as you're about to drift off though, you hear a noise out in the hallway.
>The sound of claws softly clacking against the wood floor.
>You slowly flip over, facing the door just as it creaks open.
>Sure enough, illuminated by the light from her phone, stands Sarah in your doorway.
>"A-Anon?"
>There's another sudden flash of lightning, and a roll of thunder that seems to shake the floor.
>You can her a loud yip from Sarah, who very nearly drops her phone.
>You softly speak to her, acknowledging her presence.
>She whines loudly, shuffling inside your room.
>"I'm sorry to bother you... I know you're trying to sleep."
>"But... Um..."
>Her ears flop down, and she frowns.
>"C-Can I share the bed with you? Just for tonight!"
>Another clap of thunder, and this time she -does- drop her phone.
>With the light out, you can't see her anymore.
>You shush her whines, pulling the blanket back for her.
>Sarah crawls into bed, pressing against you and pulling the covers over her.
>It was only a Twin sized bed, so she had to get real close to keep herself from falling off the edge of the bed.
>She was warm, her soft fur pressing against your bare chest.
>Another crack of thunder and lightning, and she quickly wraps her arms around you, her legs curling up close between the two of you.
>Without a word, she buries her muzzle into your shoulder, and you can hear her take a couple quick sniffs.
>She seems to relax almost immediately, her grip on you loosening.
>You pat the top of her head, earning yourself a satisfied huff.

>The two of you just lay there, listening to the sound of rain and the occasional crack of thunder.
>She of course shivers each time it happens, gripping you tighter.
>Lucky for you, you know the perfect method to calm her down. Sixty percent of the time, it works every time.
>You free one of your arms from her grip, eliciting an annoyed grumble as she tries to wrangle it back into her floof.
>She stops in her tracks though as soon as your fingers make contact with her head.
>You start to softly stroke the fluff on the top of her head, and she practically melts into you, going completely limp.
>Within minutes, you're pretty certain she's fast asleep.
>She's snoozing softly, her head nestled into your neck under the blankets.
>Good girl.
>Her fur tickles against your skin, but it's something you've become used to by now.
>In any case, it feels good to have Sarah by your side.
>Patting the Collie one last time, you stop and get ready to fall asleep.
>Sarah clearly has objections to that plan though, as the second you stop petting her, she begins to whine in her sleep.
>Not wanting to disappoint, you keep on petting her.
>You're not sure how long you run your hands over her soft fluffy head, but you end up falling asleep as you do it.

>You crack your eyes open, deeply exhaling through your nose.
>Yawning, you try to sit up, only to be stopped by a mysterious weight.
>At first, you're confused, until you look directly to your left.
>Sarah was still laying here, having your torso in a deathgrip as her muzzle was buried into your shoulder, blowing warm air onto your neck with every breath.
>You had almost forgotten about last night...
>Oh boy, here comes the fun part. Trying to stand up without waking her.
>Alright. Baby steps first.
>You try to scooch over to the right side of the bed, only to be met by the first problem.
>The second you jostle her even a little, she lets out a cute little whine.
>Yeah, this is gonna be a problem...
>You're gonna have to just take it slow.

>Around 20 minutes later, you've achieved an almost impossible task.
>You managed to get up out of bed, and exit the bedroom without waking Sarah.
>It took some advanced maneuvering, but you left her alone in bed with a large pillow in her grip instead of your body.
>Being your pillow, it smelled like your head too, to which her nose would know none the wiser.
>Now that you were free, you looked around the apartment.
>It was dark, with the rain still going.
>If you remember the forecast, most of the storm should have passed on by now, leaving only some scattered showers.
>You can't hear any thunder, so you suppose it must have been correct.
>After a quick bathroom break, you walk into the kitchen for a glass of water, looking at the clock on the microwave.
>It was still early, only 7 AM.
>Usually Sarah would be up for a run by now, but it didn't seem like that was gonna happen with the rain going on.
>She had always been firmly against getting her fur wet, especially for no good reason.
>Filling a glass, you look over at the cupboards and fridge. An idea flashes through your mind.
>Hey. Sarah hasn't been feeling too great because of the weather the past few days. Why not treat her?
>Your mind made up, you set the now empty glass next to the sink.
>You were gonna make her some blueberry pancakes (her favorite), and there wasn't a damn thing  in the world that could stop you.
>Before Sarah wakes up and ruins the surprise, you're quick to take out all the ingredients you need.
>And since you weren't very good at cooking, the ingredients consist of just bisquick, milk, and eggs. You couldn't forget the blueberries, either. She had picked them up for you from the store, since she knew you liked them.
>You slap most of the ingredients into a bowl, and mix them up good. You add the blueberries, and then get prepared to cook up a nice amount of pancakes. Sarah may not look like it, but boy could she get an appetite sometimes.
>Taking a moment to grease up a pan, you get some batter in a pan and start cooking the sweet discs up.

>20 minutes later, you have a good amount of pancakes cooked.
>Sure, some of them may be a little dark around the edges, but you'll eat those ones.
>As if right on cue, you hear your door click open.
>Looking into the hallway, you can see a tired Collie peeking through the crack.
>Her nose twitches, sniffing the air.
>She perks up as soon as the scent of blueberry pancakes hits her nose, the door flying open as she rushes over to you.
>She had a huge smile on her face, her nose sniffing at the air madly.
>"Anon! You made pancakes!?"
>She stops in the kitchen, admiring the stack you had sitting on a plate.
>"With blueberries, too... My favorite..."
>She looks to you with a teary eyed grin, before pouncing.
>You're wrapped in a tight hug, the Collie gal rubbing her muzzle against your neck.
>"You're the best, Anon..."
>Smiling, you tell her to take a seat. You'd fix her up a nice plate.
>Not wasting any time, she quickly plops herself down at the table, her tail wagging the whole time.
>Putting a plate in front of her, she begins to butter the pancakes, not wanting to put any jam or syrup on them.
>As much as it must pain her, she waits to eat until you're sitting with her at the table, a plate of your own in front of her.
>You put some butter on your pancakes as well, and then both of you dig in.
>After all, pancakes always tasted better when you had them with a friend.
>Sarah turned to look at you, swallowing a mouthful of pancake.
>"Hey, Anon..."
>She gave you a shy smile, her ears swiveling back.
>"Do you, uh, think we could go back to bed after this? I'm, um, still a little tired. O-Or we could just hang out on the couch!"
>You chuckle, making the Collie whine and hide her face.
>Of course you would cuddle with her some more.
>Just as soon as you finish these pancakes, of course.
