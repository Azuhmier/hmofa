>you decide to crash a party that was happening tonight
>Not wanting to go alone you decided to bring your roommate
>It will be be a great chance to know her better
>You haven't really hung out socially like this before with her
>You didn't know anyone having the party so you wanted a bit off protection so you brought your anthro friend just in case
>she was a rat as well, so people usually seem them as vicious due to their teeth
>But she was far from unapproachable, she's very nice
>She's actually quite reserved when she's not with you
>The party is well under way as you always arrived fashionably late
>Luckily you didn't know anybody there so you could just get straight into the drink
>Plus it would have been awkward arriving first not knowing who was throwing it
>You just saw it on a campus billboard and thought "why not"
>Plus it's a good excuse to bring your friend
>And she's female so you won't feel like a beta if anybody asks if your alone
>But if a girl did ask you wouldn't lie that you came with a girl
>To be honest, you wouldn't really want to talk to girls
>This was all really just a chance to hang out with your roommate
>You get into the swing of things making yourself at home with the store bought beer
>There were was some whiff off Mary Jane but you're not into that stuff anyway
>Still, when in Rome, or a culdesac in this case
>You feel a bit tipsy from a few beers and some shots
>but not as much as your friend you brought
>"Heeeey look Anon, check it out!."
>You give a groan unamused
>You had no idea she was such a light-weight
>She's only been having beers
>And with a dash of lemonade with them as well!
>"Look! check it out, I poked a hole in my cup with my tail, CUP TAILS! WOO OOH"
>She waves her tails directly in your face, the plastic cup smacking you across the cheeks
>People certainly found *that* funny
>Besides, you were more of a Tail Spin kid growing up
>You would have laughed, even politely, but she keeps coming in doing the same joke, walking off forgetting she's talking and then coming back when she thinks she's just done it for the first time
>"Hey Anon come with me, I wanna show you something~"
>Now this is something new
>She leads you by the hand to a bedroom away from the party
>You'd feel awkward touching her hand but she's too drunk to care
>You always did feel you're heart skip a beat when her tail would brush against your leg, or her whiskers grazing your cheek when getting too close
>She jumps on the bed and hangs her head over the bottom and calls you over
>"Y-y-you know like, we're friends yeah?, Well...since I'm too drunk to care *anyway* I'll just come out and say it already ....I love you Anon; like, really love you like uh,...shit I can't think of anything, something something romantic, okay-you-got-it. Now let's have some fun!."
>...Smooth...

>She starts to have ago at your zipper jeans, her fingers keep missing the zip, she waves her hand and wiggles her fingers
>"Open sesame let me see that pepperoni"
>Her drunkenness was funny at first but you can't do this, not in her state
>how could you live with yourself knowing you ruined your long friendship for trashy sex
>"Come on big boy~ let me...ah let me...fluxks yew".
>Okay, she's officially shit-faced
>You take her hand away and prop her up and place her head on the pillows
>You pull up her tank top strap falling and put it back on her shoulder
>There's a glass of water on the bedside table
>You take the glass and help her drink some
>You hope that water wasn't stored for teeth
>You grab her hand and look into her sleepy eyes
>"I love you too. So I don't want to ruin it because of a mistake I'd regret, I know I act like like you're annoying me or I don't want you around, but in reality I really do."
>You climb on the bed as your friend opens her arms for you to cuddle
>"But-but didn't you want me to...to...".
>She's to tired to finish her sentence, as she begins to yawn you pull the duvet over the both of you
>"Let's just get some sleep for tonight, alright."
>"You sure? This isn't even my bed, not that you'd no anything about that... jerk"
>Her bedroom is literally next door from yours in the flat
>She slurs under her breath mumbling about Duck Tails of all things
>"Yeah it'll be fine, I don't know the house owners anyway so I don't care".
>You start getting comfortable under the sheets
>Luckily it was a queen size bed other wise it would be like sleeping in a camping bag
>She was quite tall and lanky
>Her tail feels weird but it gives you a rush whenever she's coils it around your body
>She's breathing deeply fallen fast asleep holding you in an embrace
>You lean closer looking at her cute rat face sleeping peacefully admiring her cute features and sofly kiss her forehead.
>"I'll still love you tommorow".
