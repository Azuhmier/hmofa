>ah thats much better
>after that shower you're feeling much cleaner and greatly de-stressed 
>you towel off and put on your bathrobe 
>before leaving the bathroom you take a quick look up the skylight to see if your peeping tom is still there
>surprisingly enough he's gone
>with that you unlock the door and swagger out into the living with all the confidence you can muster
>but you demeanor is brutally shattered by the sight that greets you
>baily is kneeling on the couch with her face pressed into a pillow, butt in the air and a horrified expression on her face
>coco is crouched behind bailey with her snout pressed firmly and tightly under the cats tail and a similarly horrified expression on her face
>you 3 share a few moments of silence before you have to cover your mouth to prevent your sudden mad giggling from being heard
>you fail miserably 
>coco and bailey seem to calm down when they realize you're amused instead of mad but they don't move an inch from their compromising position
>coco is the first to break the silence on your pets side with 3 loud sniffs against baileys bottom
>baileys horrified expression comes back with a vengeance
"Coco stop that you dumb dog!"
>bailey pushes coco away with her feet and covers her butt by sitting down on it
"Bailey language, I don't want to hear any speciesism in this house, especially against the members of it"
>her ear flatten again
"Sorry"
"Apologize to coco not me"
>bailey rolls her eyes and looks over at coco
"Sorry for calling you a dumb dog coco"
>coco gives bailey a scratch behind her ears
"It's okay bailey, I know you didn't mean it"
>bailey looks miffed at cocos obvious sucking up
>you wait for them to explain themselves
>they just sit there and look at you
>you clear your throat
"So what were you girls up to just now? I thought cats and dogs weren't supposed to get along, I didn-"
>bailey lets out a loud aha and points her finger at you
"Cats and dogs hating each other is a speciesist and untrue stereotype perpetuated by old slapstick cartoons"
>she crosses her arms and smirks like she just won a great victory
"I think you owe us both an apology"
>you have to smirk and chuckle at her antics
>you walk over scratch their heads
"I'm real sorry girls, can you ever forgive"
>coco immediately begins nodding her head vigorously while bailey makes a show of thinking it over
"I guess I can, but don't ever let it happen again"
"Oh don't worry I've learned my lesson"
>with that out of the way you move on over to the fridge
>you suppose breakfast is long overd-
"Hey wait a second, don't change the subject, what were you 2 just doing?" 
>you turn around just in time to see them deflate from their hopes of not having to explain this being crushed
>you cross your arms and wait for whoevers the first one to speak up 
>turns out to be bailey
"Uh well you see..., I wanted to pay coco back for helping me clean myself so..."
>bailey hides her face behind the armrest of the couch
"So you let her smell your butt?"
>bailey points at coco while hiding herself
"It's what she asked for"
>you turn your attention to coco who looks very nervous at the moment
>you hold your silence for a few moments as the pressure gets to her
"What? You can learn a lot about a person from how their butthole smells"
>she seems to realize how dumb that explanation sounds as toward the end it turns into a whisper
"Oh really? So what did you learn about her?"
>she brings up her finger as if she going to launch into a long explanation but it instead trails off into a long uhhhhhhhhhhhh
>then she perks up as she seems to get an idea
"I learned that bailey is deep down a very nice person"
>coco seems very pleased with herself for that save
>but you've had enough embarrassing your pets for today
>you give coco a nod of acceptance and go back to the fridge
>your not in the mood for a fancy breakfast so you just take the half pack of wieners left over from last night and throw them into a pot of water and wait for it to boil
>your food situation is getting pretty dire
>but you also haven't gotten any of the stuff taking care of a pair of pets requires
>and you're not exactly made of money right now
>you planned on going out to town to pick up some stuff but it becomes obvious you can't get everything you need right now
>you're going to have to make some tough choices
