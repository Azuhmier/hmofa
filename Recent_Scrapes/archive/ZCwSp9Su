>Brahmin
>Be Anon, survivor of the vault 100 experiment
>Think of a battle royale game, and that was it
>What a shitshow that was, at least you knew how to handle a bunch of weapons
>You've been wandering the wastes for a few years, meeting people along the way most good...
>Some trying to shank you for your loot
>You've tried to get a travel buddy but the people you met either gave you the creeps or flat out didn't like you for "Being a pampered vault baby"
>You've turned to the lowest you could go, a slave
>After coughing up enough caps to a shady bartender you get the location of a big slaver
>You travel to the location, passing by traders, raiders, and settlers
>All of them having a mish-mash of Human and Anthro residents
>You swear you saw some guy with a Deathclaw walking off to some NCR camp
>Before you know it, you're at the location marked on the map
>Some shack in the middle of nowhere, remembering the instructions the bartender gave you
>You knock on the metal part of the door twice and the wooden parts of it 4 times
>You stand there for a few seconds before you hear somewhere undoing the lock of the door
>It swings open, barely missing you revealing a rather tall man with scars all over his face, giving you an angry glare
>You grimace inwardly and say a specific phrase the Bartender told you
>"Anthony, you never told me you had friends over."
>His glare softens and moves to let you in, keeping his stare fixated on you
>Once you're inside he closes the door and locks it again, walking over to the rug splayed on the floor
>Pulling it away, it reveals a hatch door
>You think how cliche it was, those cheesy spy movies you watched before you left the vault always did that
>Shrugging it off, you see the man pulling open the hatch and walking down the stairs that were under it
>You shuffle towards him and run down the stairs to pick up the pace
>You follow him for a minute before the slim corridor opens up into a large room
>Filled with Human and Anthros alike
>Coyotes, Geckos, Brahmin... Cazadors? HOW?
>They all shrink away as the man walks past, holding his hands behind his back ignoring them all
>You shiver, regretting this visit slightly
>He stops at the end of the cages turning around and looking at you
>"Go on, make your pick."
>The suddenness of him talking after not making a sound just a minute ago catches you off guard
>You simply nod and look around
>ChristOnABike.mpeg
>You look at the droves of slaves until you stop on a Brahmin Anthro
>She's bickering with her second head about something you can't hear
>You wave the man over and point to the Brahmin when he reaches you
>"Oh, her? Alright that'll be 150 caps."
>150? For a slave? What a steal
>You look at your pip-boy and time seemingly freezes in place
>WeirdFeelingButOkay.mpeg
>Handing him 150 caps he turns to the cage and slams a fist onto it, making the Brahmin woman jump
>"You got a new owner, packmule."
>She quickly walks to the gate, keeping her gaze on the floor with both heads
>The man unlocks the door and hands you a rope and a controller with 2 buttons on it, red and green
>"Red is to shock the slave, hold it down to set off the explosives, Green is to remove the collar." he explains in a dismissive tone
>You stare at the controller, you control another beings life. Well you controlled others with bullets and shrapnel but you'll ignore those
>You look back to the man who was walking towards the stairs before a tugging on your armor's sleeve catches your attention
>It's the Brahmin, she's fidgeting with a horn with her other hand
>"Er, Mister thank you for buying us, we won't cause much trouble..."
>You give one of her heads a pat, she shrinks back slightly at it, to your surprise
>A loud AHEM gets you to speed-walk to the stairs with your new slave
>The man leads you outside, waiting for the Bovine to leave with you
>He waves and flatly states
>"Stay safe, come back later" he ends with a chuckle
>You give a nervous chuckle back and pick up the pace when leaving
>Feeling you're far away enough you set up camp
>Looking at the Brahmin woman staring at the fire
>She looked absolutely starved, ribs poking out, skin pressing on bone
>Despite all this, she had a respectable bust, but why the fuck were you looking at that 
>Her body in contrast to feral Brahmin had thin fur, with patches missing revealing the pink leathery skin underneath
>Barely anything covering her, scraps of rags were all that were left
>Noticing this she looks at you, a confused expression appearing on her
>"What are you looking at, do we have something on us?"
>You quickly shake your head
>"No... no. Just, gonna ask what do you eat?"
>She puts a hand to her left head, thinking about the question
>"Uh, we used to eat Agave fruit and plantlife in general."
>You look down at your pip-boy, time feeling like it froze up again you scroll through your Aid items
>Finding a few bits and pieces of fruits and herbs
>Bringing them out from the void that is Robco's engineering you present them to her
>Both heads stare at you for a second, raising a finger in protest then dropping it
>She takes the items and gives an appreciative nod with both heads
>It's been a few minutes and she's still munching on the plant life while you're awkwardly sitting around staring at her
>You clear your throat and try to break the ice or at least break this weird tension
>"So... tell me about yourself, uh..."
>The right head answers your question on their name
>"I'm Steph, and my sister's name is Annie. But you can call us whatever you'd like, master."
>You visibly cringe when she says master, it always rubbed you the wrong way
>"Look, don't call me master first off call me by my name, Anon. Secondly-" You snap at them
>She shrinks back slightly at the sudden change of tone from you
>AwFuckICantBelieveYouveDoneThis.png
>You immediately change your tone, not wanting to scare these poor girls even more than they probably already were
>"Secondly, i'm sorry. I've been a bit.. stressed for the past few weeks, I just want you to know you aren't going to be treated like some labrat."
>You knew how it was to be one, ugh
>Before you could get out your last sentence a yawn escapes you
>Looking down at your Pip-boy, you check the time, the same time stopping feeling not being there anymore
>Aw, you liked that feeling
>... It was like 2 am
>Guess this adventure took longer than expected
>You stand up and stretch, popping a few bones in response
>You hear a disgusted, "Ew" from both of the Brahmin woman's heads
>Oh right, the slave that you bought
>Where the hell was she gonna sleep?
>You look around for anything that could make good padding as a makeshift bed
>Nothing in sight, you look to the woman staring at the fire with both heads again
>You clear your throat to catch her attention
>"Hey, you can sleep on the cot in the tent, i've got my armor for padding."
>She looks at you with a confused look plastered on both faces
>Annie speaks up
>"A-are you sure? We can just sleep outs-"
>You cut her off by grabbing her hand and pulling her towards the tent
>Even in her malnourished state, she was pretty strong slightly holding you back from dragging her at full speed
>Well she was a bovine, a mutated one at that, they were well known for being quite strong
>Pulling her in the tent, you present the bedroll sitting in it
>She fidgets a bit, looking around then stopping on you Annie mutters out again
>"Are you really sure? We can just go outsi-"
>Cutting her off again you wave your hand 
>"Nonsense, i'm sure about it. I've done this before... Uh many many times before."
>She looks back at the cot then both heads sigh apprehensively
>"If you're sure ma-... Anon."
>You give her a pat on both heads and a smile
>"Good, wake me up if you need anything, I mean ANYTHING."
>With that being said, you exit the tent
>Walking up to a large boulder, you pull out your battle-rifle, holding it tight
>With a sigh, your eyes become heavier as you struggle to keep them open
>Soon, you're in an incomprehensible dream
>A mish mash of your past memories and other random bits and pieces
>Though one sound jumps out at you more prominently than any other
>It was extremely muffled, but you can help but try to find it
>Until you're shaken awake
>"Hrng, Wha- huh?"
>A muddled black figure stands over you
>You freak out slightly and instinctively grab the weapon next to you, pointing it at the figure
>It backs up with hands raised as your vision clears
>It's... the Steph and Annie, lowering your weapon you groan
>"Sorry... sorry, just instincts I didn't mean to point it at you."
>Steph gulps a lump in her throat and lowers her hands, the body of the two quivering slightly
>You place both hands on your temples, sighing
>The thought is interrupted by your stomach grumbling
>Right, you didn't eat yesterday
>Lifting your Pip-boy up you scroll through the Aid tab
>Old Spam, Sugar bombs... Eugh this stuff is way past the expiration date, and irradiated to boot
>Why did you even carry those around... oh wait, use in a dire situation
>Mentally facepalming you scroll down a bit farther until you see raw meat from animals you've killed on your journey
>Thankfully, this Robco (TM) void of a Pip-boy "backpack" doesn't let stuff spoil
>Pulling out a chunk of Bighorner meat you look back up to Steph and Annie sitting at the ashes of the past fire
>You should ask her why she's so fascinated by fire, but not right now, right now is food time
>Quickly looking through your Pip-boy again you pull out extra dried leaves and logs along with a skillet
>When you pulled put the skillet you feel like you hear the faint sound of a Bostonian yelling out something
>Need a Dias pencer here or something?
>Shrugging the noise off you walk to the campfire with the supplies in arms
>Dropping the kindling into the pit you set it aflame and prop the skillet over it
>You slide the chunk of meat into the skillet, hearing that satisfying sizzle that you'll never get tired of hearing
>Figuring this may take awhile you sit next to your Bovine "slave"
>Sitting next to her and looking you get a better look at the her thin coat of fur
>Brown and white, like an Ayrshire if you remember correctly
>Steph noticing you turns her head to look at you
>"Yes mast-Uh... Anon, do you need something?"
>You try to summon a question on the spot, only to fail and mutter out giberish
>"Heghehg"
>You mentally facepalm again, she was giving you a concerned look
>"Uhm, Anon are you okay? Do we need to administer one of the healing needles?"
>You shake your head and finally think of a question
>"Steph, Annie, do you need more to eat... you look like skeletons."
>Voluptuous ones, heheh
>Oh god, skeletons with tits are gonna be stuck in your head for awhile now
>Fuck.holoimage
>Both heads look down at their body, looking at their thin and probably fragile figure
>Annie speaks instead of Steph who was still looking at their body
>"I suppose we do, but we won't eat too much of your food reserv-"
>You wave your hand dismissively 
>"Oh hush, you aren't going to mess up my food reserve."
>On the topic of food, a heavenly smell wafts through your nose
>Ah, your steaks are done
>Abruptly stopping the conversation you stand up and speed walk to the skillet and give it a good few shakes
>You place it on a rather conveniently placed rock that was perfect at sitting height to eat on
>Pulling out two knives you get to work on cutting the meat
>You go to town on it, savoring each bite of flavor
>Unbeknownst to you, your "slaves" were staring at you, mouths slightly agape
>You let out a loud belch and sigh out in contentment
>Looking to the Bovine woman, they're back to staring at the fire
>No better time than now, you guess
>Packing up the skillet and knives you saunter over to her and take a seat next to her
>Annie looks over to you then back to the fire, letting her head drop onto your shoulder
>OhOkaylol
>"Hey, you two. You're always staring at the fire whenever I see you, why so interested?"
>Annie sighs but keeps her head resting on your shoulder
>Steph takes lead of the answer, replying in a rather melancholic tone
>"We could have just been meat, nothing more than food for things to eat. Instead, were here, owned by a wanderer who swears he'll help, but we aren't even sure of it, even if it is genuine."
>After finishing the sentence she lets her head fall to her hands, rubbing her eyes and forehead
>You realize you just ate something that is the closest related to her in the wasteland
>Gah, you feel like shit now
>You sigh inwardly and stand up offering a hand to her
>"Come on, we've got to go, sun's bright today."
>She eyes you carefully before placing a hand in yours
>Pulling her up you quickly take down the ramshackled camp, putting it gods know where
>Looking down at your Pip-boy you stare at the map for a few minutes, marking a trading post you were told of then lowering your pip-boy
>Steph and Annie were staring off in the distance talking to each other in hushed tones 
>Clearing your throat they both stop their conversation and look at you
