>LOADING SCENE...
>You are in a park, on a sunny day.  It is early, and so there are few passersby.  
>You scratch your head in confusion, unable to recall why you're here.  You vaguely recall arranging to meet someone here...?
>You glance at your watch.  7:59 AM.
>Somehow you know you're waiting on 8 AM to roll around.  Sure enough, once the clock ticks over to the new hour, a woman approaches, smiling.
>She-

>CREATING PHYSICAL PROFILE...

>Species: Nekomata
>Figure: Lithe
>Height: Relatively Tall
>RESUME.
>She seems to be a cat woman, with two long, thin tails playfully whipping through the air behind her.  a warm smile decorates her face; a smile that suggests she expected you.
>This must be who you promised to meet.
>She strolls closer, a black suit hugging her lean, lithe figure well.  Once she gets to you, it becomes apparent that she's slightly taller than you.
>The woman clears her throat and adjusts her glasses before speaking in a brisk, even tone.  Her voice almost reminds you of some form of instructional video.
>"Hello, Guest!  My name is Tori.  I'm glad you could meet me here today. I understand it's early, so if you don't recall why we're meeting, it's absolutely fine."
>...Guest?
>You definitely don't know why you're here either...
>She sees your confusion and smiles again.
>"If you're lost, that's why I'm here.  I can answer any questions you may have about your current situation, myself, or the current location."
>There's a musical chime from nowhere as Tori gives you a patient, expectant smile.  Her glasses gleam in the sun, obscuring her eyes.

>The cat woman perks up an ear and smiles as you speak.
>"Where are we?"
>"Currently, we are in the Park, Guest.  One of a selection of available scenarios.  This is considered the easiest scenario by most users, as the relaxing atmosphere leads to ease of use."
>"...what?"
>She laughs, a musical sound that almost sounds more like a computerized jingle than a biological chuckle.
>"I see.  Seems you are more lost than anticipated. Worry not.  I am here to help!"
>You're hopelessly confused, but her reassuring smile helps.
>You feel more at ease, and so celebrate by doing a little jig.
>In your head, a jaunty little tune plays.  Tori laughs again and whistles along to the tune.
>Wait.
>Isn't the music in your head?
>You stop dancing, and she stops whistling.
>That same musical chime from before sounds.

>Well, she says she'll answer any questions...
>"What is all this?  Why am I here?"
>She smiles again as her ears swivel about almost mechanically.
>"This is the Y-4 Interaction Simulator.  You are a Guest user of this program, which is designed to educate humans on interacting with inhuman beings, such as myself."
>"...what are you?"
>"I am Tori, an administrative module in charge of directing new users around the program and its features.  My AI is linked to the entirety of this simulation, and so I am fully capable of answering any queries or resolving any inputs you may make."
>She bows deeply as a melodic flourish echoes.
>Once she straightens back up, she adjusts her glasses, momentarily revealing faintly glowing blue eyes.
>"So, Guest: what is it you would like to do now?  You are the user, so you are in control of the action, so to speak."

>Several questions swirl in your mind, but they fall subservient to one very strong desire...
>You reach up and boop Tori's nose.  There's a quiet "beep" sound as she blinks in surprise, then she laughs melodically again.
>"Very funny, Guest."
>Alright, alright; question time.
>"Why me?"
>She smiles warmly as her ears again swivel around.
>"You were randomly selected for the beta test.  Congratulations!"
>"Chosen by who?  Who made this?"
>Tori smiles again, gesturing as some copyright information appears in a bubble.
>"Y-4 Interaction Simulator is developed and maintained by LeCoyle Laboratories."
>"Oh, okay... what kinds of interactions does this cover?"
>"As many as possible.  Conversations, platonic relationships, romances... we take pride in accounting for these and more."
>She nods as the copyright info vanishes with a chord.
>"...what's with the music?"
>"Simply an auditory embellishment for my animations.  I can disable it if it bothers you, Guest."

>"No, no, it doesn't bother me.  But... can you change it to other songs?"
>"Certainly.  What would you prefer?"
>"...uh... Careless Whisper?"
>She puts a hand to her chin, then nods and gestures happily, a familiar saxophone flourish accompanying her motion.
>"Done."
>"Thanks... Tori, why can't I remember signing up for this?"
>She smiles again, a glare from the sun again blocking her eyes.
>"Well... I did say you were randomly selected."
>"I didn't sign up for this?"
>"Not exactly, no."
>"...who are these LeCoyle Labs people?"
>"My creators, and a firm responsible for many great advancements.  Our president chose you randomly to beta test this product... how lucky for you!"
>She claps her hands and smiles with an audible twinkle.  A fang glints in the artifical sun.

>Every question Tori answers raises further ones, it seems.
>"Are there more beta testers?"
>She nods.
>"There are, but they are in their own sessions, so there will be no meeting them. We are still working out the bugs in multiuser sessions."
>"Well, what am I expected to do as a tester?  Anything in particular?"
>"Your job is simply to test this program, and by extension my AI.  Any actions you take are helpful to the testing process, Guest."
>"Okay then... are there any sights in this park you recommend?"
>"Personally, I recommend the lake for you, Guest.  Something about your appearance suggests that you would be at home there."
>"Can you lead me there?"
>Tori nods and beckons before strolling across the park.  Her two tails idly wave about in a looping animation.
>Soon, she stops and gestures with another snippet of Careless Whisper.
>"Here we are: the Lake."
>Indeed, it's simply a pristine blue lake in the midst of the sunny, green park.
>A cool breeze tickles your face as some ducks float along on the water.  Tori watches them with a smile, ears twitching.
>...it's very relaxing and calming here, though you know it's virtual.

>Gazing out across the water gives you an urge to swim...
>"Hey Tori, is it possible for us to take a dip?"
>She laughs again, the melodic sound not carrying the tune of Careless Whisper, but instead the default tune from before.
>"There wouldn't be much point in a lake you cannot swim in, would there?"
>You glance down at your clothes.
>"Too bad I'm not dressed to swim."
>Tori snaps, and suddenly you're clad in swim trunks.  She lets off another laugh.
>"Simple costume change.  Would you like for me to join you?"
>You nod, and she snaps again.  Her suit vanishes in favor of a black bikini, her glasses being the only remnant of her old outfit.
>Now that she's clad in a more skimpy outfit, you can appreciate her lean, attractive figure better.  Her long, slender legs accentuate her modest curves and bust well; altogether she simply looks slim and trim.
>Tori winks with an audible "ding" as she adjusts her glasses again, then she leaps into the lake without hesitation.
>...impressive water physics.
>Tori resurfaces with a chiming giggle, then beckons for you.  You leap into the lake, splashing the administrator, much to her amusement.
>It's amazing how real the cool water feels.  It's as if you're actually swimming...
>"...Tori, how am I feeling all this?  What's this program running on?"
>Her expression momentarily hardens.
>"That is proprietary information only available to employees of LeCoyle Laboratories.  My apologies."
>Her smile returns as she splashes some water in your face.

>After wiling the water from your face, you grin before splashing the cat playfully.
>She sputters and wipes her glasses off with a tail, then casually shoves you, sending you tumbling into the water.
>You're surprised to find that you cannot breathe underwater, even in the simulation.  You kick to the surface and gasp for air as Tori giggles musically.
>Once she realizes you're coughing, she immediately stops laughing and makes her way to your side.
>"Guest?  Breathe, Guest.  Just breathe."
>You slowly catch your breath, much to her relief.
>"I thought this was a simulation?  That really felt... real."
>"We pride ourselves in offering a totally immersive and realistic experience."
>You take a deep breath, then dive as deep as you can go.  The entire process feels so very real... you can even feel the water pressure, the currents, the fish swimming between your toes...
>You resurface, and find yourself face to face with Tori's chest.
>Your mind screams at you to take her right now.
>You slyly run a hand beneath the water, reaching for her bikini bottom...
>As soon as you grab the garment, she gasps and shoves you again before waving a finger scoldingly.
>"Now now, Guest.  It wouldn't be accurate for us to engage in that sort of interaction now, would it~?"
>Another wink is accompanied by a cartoonish ding.
