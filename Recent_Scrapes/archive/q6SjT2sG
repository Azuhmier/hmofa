>you really fucked things up this time
>you're flat on your back in the middle of the street
>everything hurts
>your mouth is full of blood
>through your darkening vision you can see the spotlights from the helicopters, and the blinding blue and whites coming off of the cop cars
>god this hurts
>you try and move, but you can't
>you can't even turn your head
>you can't believe everything went wrong so fast
>it's getting cold now
>there's someone standing over you
>they're saying something
>you can't hear them at all
>everything's going black
>how did you end up like this?

One year earlier
 
>your day is already off to a bad start since your boss called you into his office
>that never happened unless you did something to piss him off
>you can't recall beating anyone you weren't supposed to recently
>you walk into his office, the stench of fur overwhelms your nose
"You wanted to see me?"
>the chief glares at you and slams a newspaper on his desk
>even though he's getting on in years the look in his eyes still makes your balls shrivel up
"I got another excessive force complaint. That's the third one in six months isn't it?"
>you can't recall, every day some asshole gets fresh with you and you end up having to go upside their head, and then they start crying about "muh civil rights"
>faggots
"I don't know. Is that the only reason you called me in here?"
>he got this grin on his face
>that kind of grin he only gets when some real fucked up shit is about to happen
"Actually, I wanted to introduce you to your new partner."
>you'd had one partner for a while, but he's laid up in the hospital
>you told him to wrap his shit up if he's gonna spend all his money on those rat hookers
>but no one ever listens to you
"Okay. Who?"
>the door opens and another officer walks in
>a woman
>decent pair on her from what you can see through the uniform
>her fur isn't bad looking either
>wait what?
>taking a second look she's an anthro
>judging from the shape of her nose, a wolf
>you would guess dog, but something about how she carries herself screams wolf
"This is Claire Whitfield. She's a 5 year vet of the Dallas PD. After that whole mess down there she decided to move here."
>Claire saluted
"I'm looking forward to working here."
>the chief laughed
"So well mannered. You could learn something from her Anon."
>you scoff
"Alright. Never worked with one of you people before. LA's a bit different from Dallas. Think you can handle it?"
>she smiles at you
"I've been in worse places."
 
---
 
>rollin down the street, smokin endo, sippin on gin and juice
>not really, but wouldn't it be cool if you were?
>right now you're riding in your squad car working your beat
>nothing interesting yet
>you figure you should use this downtime to get to know your new partner
"Chief said you were from Dallas?"
"I'm from all over. I was born in Chicago, joined the army and spent four years in Afghanistan, then after hopping around for a bit I wound up in Texas."
"The army huh? See any action over there?" you ask, grinning.
"Not really. I spent most of my time sitting in a tent bored out of my skull."
>you start laughing
"Promise you won't be bored here."
>you turn the corner and see a group of young anthros standing on a street corner
>you pull over and hop out
"What are you doing?" Claire asks
"This is called proactive policing."
>you walk up to the people on the corner and wave
"What's up my dudes?"
>one of them rolls his eyes at you
"Man, why you fuckin' wit us?"
"You know how it is. Too many of you guys in one place and people get all nervous. All right, you know what to do."
>they turn around and place their palms on the wall
>you search them all one by one but don't find anything
>that's for the best
"Alright, when I come back around you guys are gone, understand?"
"Yeah officer. Yo, who's that?"
>you look over and see Claire surveying the scene
"That's my new partner."
"She's kinda hot."
>you can't help but agree
>back in the car Claire looked like she wanted to say something
"Something on your mind?" you ask her.
"So do we just go around stopping and frisking people all day?"
>you groan
"Don't tell me you're one of those bleeding hearts."
"Is that what you call people who actually care about citizens?"
"It's what I call people who have a misplaced sense of compassion. City says we need to reduce crime, so if we see a group of furries we go and jack 'em up. Crime goes down, but then we've got all these activist groups complaining about discrimination, so we stop. Then crime goes back up and we're right where we started."
>she looks at you like you just spit on her
"What?" you ask, defensive.
"Did you really just say 'furries'?"
>you forgot that "furry" was a less than polite way to refer to anthros
>you might as well have called them a pack of niggers
>it was such in integral part of your vocabulary that you said it without thinking
>having an anthro partner will take some getting used to
 
---
 
>today was another day
>you got a call for a drunk and disorderly in a bar
>what kind of degenerate gets drunk at one in the afternoon
>well, after spending most of your career arresting anthros it's nice to bust some human skulls for a change
>you walk into the bar and immediately the thick stench of sweat and cigar smoke assaults your nostrils
>Claire looks ready to vomit
>there are two men arguing by a pool table
>you walk up to them and break them apart
"You two get the fuck outta here. I don't feel like hauling your drunk asses in."
>one guy punches you in the face and knocks you on your ass
>that's what you get for trying to be diplomatic
>you see him standing over you
>then a grey streak flies past
>next thing you know Claire's on top of the guy pounding his head into the floorboards
>the anger in her eyes could kill a man
>you burst into laughter
"Don't kill him. That's too much paperwork."
>Claire drags the bloody drunk to his feet and cuffs him
>you whistle at her
"That was some savage shit. Where'd you learn that at?"
"I got into fights a lot when I was a kid."
>you drag the man into the back of the squad car and take him back to the station
>you're still thinking about that beating Claire gave that guy
>every punch was meant to knock his head off
>that kind of brutality isn't something you see very often
"You know what Claire? You just might be LAPD material after all."
 
--
 
>you're riding around on patrol
>today was a more relaxed day than normal
>so of course you had to blast your theme song at max volume
"Y'ALL NIGGAS CAN'T FUCK WIT MY NIGGAS HO. Y'ALL NIGGAS CAN'T FUCK WIT MY NIGGAS HO. Y'ALL NIGGAS CAN'T FUCK WIT MY NIGGAS HO. Y'ALL NIGGAS CAN'T FUCK WIT MY NIGGAS HO"
>Claire had her hands clamped over her ears
>she was obviously in pain, but her pride wouldn't let her say anything
>if she wanted to be stubborn that was her problem
>this has been a good day so far, all you've had to deal with is a couple street hagglers
>nothing that could piss you off
>of course as you were thinking that a car cuts in front of you, forcing you to stomp on the brakes to keep from hitting it
"Oh you mother fucker!" you shout as you turn the lights on
>you mash on the gas and catch up with the errant driver
>he pulls over, and you pull up right behind him
>you and Claire get out the car and walk up to the driver
>looking at the car it's one of those sleek foreign cars all the street racers are into
>fucking Midnight Club wannabees killed an old man a month ago
>you knock on the window
>the driver rolls it down, revealing himself to be a teenager
>of fucking course
"Do you realize I almost hit you back there?" you say.
"Sorry bro. I didn't see you."
"Step out of the car."
>once he's out of the car you search him
>you find two joints in one pocket
"Oh would you look at this. This is a DWI right here. I could pull your license, even get this car impounded."
>the kid's eyes go wide as saucers
"Shit man I'm still making payments on this. Please don't tow my car. I'm begging you"
>you'd be lying if you say you weren't enjoying this
"I'm sorry kid, but the law's the law."
>you look at Claire and wink
>she seemed to understand
"Oh come on Anon. He's just a kid. Why don't you let him off with a warning."
>you're both trying not to laugh
"You hear that? My partner says I should let you go."
>the relief on his face is palpable
"Say 'thank you Officer Whitfield'."
"Thank you Officer Whitfield."
>you have to commend Claire for being able to keep a straight face
"Just make sure you pay attention to the road from now on" she says in her most serious voice
>the two of you get back in your car
>it only takes a few seconds before you both burst into laughter
"Man the look on his face" Claire says as she wipes a tear from her eye
>eye. Singular
>that had been bugging you for a while, but you figured now wasn't the time to bring that up
"Torturing teenagers makes me hungry. Wanna grab a bite?" you ask
"Sure" Claire responds.
>there's a place you like to go to
>you went there all the time with your last partner
>maybe she'll like it too
 
---
 
>you're sitting in a restaurant munching on a burger
>you like this place
>the food's good, and cops eat free
"So how are you liking LA so far?" you ask
"Way better than Chicago."
"Yeah, I hear it can get pretty rough over there."
"Trust me, I know better than anyone."
>as if to emphasize one of her eyes got that unnatural shine to it
"Hey Claire?"
>she doesn't seem to hear you
>she turns around in her seat and puts a hand on her holster
"What's up?" you ask as your hand moves to your own gun.
"Two men with guns heading for that shop across the street."
>across the street is a pawn shop
>it got robbed a few times last year, but recently it's been okay
"How can you tell?"
"I can hear them."
>you both rise from your chairs and head out the door
>just like she said there are two guys wearing ski masks in the pawn shop
>they both have what look to be shitty hi points
>you and your partner open the door
"LAPD! Drop your weapons!"
>without a second of hesitation, one of the robbers points his gun right at your head and pulls the trigger
*click*
>the gun fails to go off
>maybe it was jammed, maybe it was just poorly maintained
>either way you were pissed
>you raise your weapon and fire
>the bullet strikes the gunman in the neck
>he falls to the ground and starts making these choking sounds
>you walk over and kick his gun away from him
>you radio for  an ambulance while Claire cuffs the other robber
>you're still angry when you drag him back to your car
>you punch him across the face
>and then you do it again
>and again
>and again
>the man's face is covered in blood and bruises
>you reach back for another punch when Claire grabs your arm
"I think he gets it."
>you go to the store owner and take his statement
>by the time you're done you manage to calm down
>back at the station you have to file a report over the shooting
>Claire walks up to you looking concerned
"Are you okay?"
>you sigh
"Yeah. Not the first time I shot someone. Thanks for worrying about me."
>she smiles at you
"We're partners. We have to look out for each other."
>that's reassuring
>it's nice to have someone looking out for you
>especially someone so cute

--

>these calls are always the worst ones
>dispatch said that a woman collapsed in her home and is unresponsive
>you pull up to the house and knock on the door
>a small kitten opens it
>her eyes are welled up with tears
"My mom fell down and she won't get up."
>ah fuck
>you grab the crying cat and pick her up
"My partner's gonna check on your mom."
>Claire walked to the kitchen and found the child's mother on the ground
>she wasn't moving
>Claire kneels next to her and checks her pulse
>she places two hands on the woman's chest and tries to preform CPR
>after what feels like an eternity the woman coughs and greedily sucks in air
>Claire helps the woman to her feet
"Oh god, I thought I was done for" the woman says as she wraps her hands around Claire.
>Claire sighs with relief and guides the woman outside toward the paramedics
>you place a hand on the small kitten's head
>man, this is some soft fur
"Your mom's gonna be okay."
>really soft
>and her ears are so pliable
"Anon"
>you could pinch these small ears all day
"Anon!"
>Claire shouting snaps you out of the trance you were in
>you look down at the kitten, squirming with discomfort in your handso
"Sorry about that" you say, turning red
>you set the kitten down and watch her run off to join her mother
"What was that about?" Claire asks.
>you ignore her question and head back to your car
"Good job by the way. You saved that woman's life."
>Claire's good ear perked up and she grins
"All part of the job isn't it?"
>something about her smile makes your heart race
>in the back of your mind you wonder if she's soft too

>training inna gym
>punching on a heavy bag to blow off some steam
>your shooting skills are fine, but your hand to hand could use some work
>and judging by the laughter you hear behind you you aren't the only one who thinks so
"What's so funny?" you ask.
>Claire tries to stop laughing
"Your form is so shit. Have you ever actually been in a fight before?"
>you're pretty sure beating handcuffed suspects with a club counts as a fight
"Not really" you answer.
>she walks up to you and grabs your hand
"How about I teach you a few things?"
>she guides you to an empty space near the back and hands you a pair of padded gloves
"Are you sure about this? I don't wanna hurt you."
>Claire chokes on her laughter
"Don't flatter yourself."
>you move to attack her
>she grabs your arm and next thing you know you're on the ground with your arm behind your back and Claire's knee in your spine
"How the fuck did you do that?" you ask, incredulous.
"Try and do that to me."
>she gets into a fighting stance and attacks you
>you try and copy her movements, but just get punched in the face over and over
>by the time it's time to leave your face is one giant bruise
>you haven't been beaten this bad since you were a kid
>surprisingly you're not angry
>you're determined
>you're definitely going to beat Claire at least once
>Claire tosses you a towel to wipe your face off
"Sorry I was so rough with you."
>you give a dry chuckle
"It's fine. Guess I've got a lot to learn."
"No shit you do. I leave you like this you'll be dead in a real fight."
>at least she cares
>you move your hand toward her head
>she takes a large step back
>you move closer to
>she moves further away
"What?" you ask
>she just shakes her head at you
>you guess wolves are reluctant to being touched 
>oh well
>now you have two goals

--

"Calling all units there is a 211 in progress at the Chase Bank downtown. Be advised, suspect is a gazelle anthro and is to be considered armed and dangerous."
>that was the dispatch 
>you hit the lights and speed toward the bank 
>the adrenaline is pumping through you 
>finally a reason to get out of bed
>you weave through traffic as fast as possible 
>no sign of the suspect
>Claire shouts in your ear
"I see someone!"
>sure enough out the corner of your eye you see a gazelle sprinting with a bag in one hand and a gun in the other
>there's a red splotch on his shirt
>that better be an ink packet for his sake
"If he's on foot he's not gonna be easy to catch."
>Claire bails out the car and chases after him
>you decide to try a different method
>you turn the corner and speed up
>you push the patrol car to the limit and catch up with the suspect
>once you're an ideal distance away you swerve into him and send him bowling over the hood
>in the rear-view you can see Claire grabbing his gun and cuffing him
>one of his legs looks like it's bent weird
>oh well
>you step out and back her up
>to your surprise Claire grabs you by the collar and growls at you
"What the fuck was that?" she shouted
"What? He was armed and dangerous. I couldn't let him keep running with that gun in his hand. I took the best course of action to keep the public safe."
"Listen, whatever cowboy shit you got up to with your last partner, that shit stops. This shit doesn't stay in a vacuum, it ripples out."
"God, I get it. The last thing I need is a lecture on how to do my job."
>what is her problem
>it's not like you're on some Rampart shit or anything like that
>if some asshole gets a few bruises is it really that big of a deal?
>it's not like you've done anything really awful

--

>another day spent sparring with Claire
>this wasn't as bad as usual
>you actually manage to hit her a few times
>of course that was only due to exploiting her limited field of vision
>that's been bugging you for a while
>it's such a weird thing to lie about
>she obviously doesn't want to tell you everything, but aren't the two of you partners?
>once you were finished you grabbed a towel and wiped the sweat off your face
>Claire helped you to your feet
"You did good this time. You're not anywhere close to being any good, but at least you don't totally suck."
>coming from Claire that was a huge compliment 
>either way there's still time before you have to go back on duty, so you might as well ask this now
"Hey Claire?"
"What?"
"Something I've been meaning to ask you."
"Don't leave me in suspense. What is it?"
"How'd you get into the army with only one eye? I know they relaxed the standards a bit but proper vision is still a requirement last I checked."
>the silence is crushing you
>Claire nervously rubs the back of her head
"You know you're the first person to bring that up?"
"That's a weird thing to lie about. Why would you even need to lie about something like that?"
>her ear lays flat against her head
"I didn't want to tell anyone about my first job."
"Why not?"
"It's so embarrassing."
>you can't believe what you're hearing
>the normally calm and composed Claire Whitfield was so fidgeting like an antsy child
>whatever she used to do was so humiliating that she would rather lie about fighting overseas than tell anyone about it
>obviously you had to know more
"Well, don't leave me in suspense. What happened?"
>Claire sighs
"Like you said, I couldn't get into the army with only one eye, but the recruiter still had me take a few tests. I passed all of them. He thought just kicking me out would be a waste of talent, so he referred me to a few people."
"What kind of people?"
"People who need protection. CEOs, politicians, celebrities. Those sorts of people."
"So you were a bodyguard? That doesn't sound so bad."
"Ugh. You have no idea. I was more of a servant than a guard most of the time. I had to help them buy clothes, take care of their kids, help prepare their meals, all sorts of things. One time I had to fix a guy's car cause he didn't know how. Oh! Once I had to go on a date with a client. God, I still remember that fat fuck latching on to me like a needy kid."
>it takes everything you have not to laugh 
"Was the pay good at least?" you ask
Claire laughs. "I made more money than I knew what to do with. I gave most of it away. Never really had much use for money."
"Of course you're the altruistic type. How'd you end up becoming a cop?"
"I worked out of Houston for a while. I just sort of felt like it. It was nice being able to help regular people for a change. As far as jobs I've had, it was alright for a bit. I'm sure you don't need to know why I came to LA."
"I can't really blame you for wanting to walk away after that, I'm just surprised you still wanted to be a cop after that."
>her ear wiggled back and forth
"I can't see myself doing anything else."
"I can understand not wanting to talk about your old job, but we're partners. We need to be honest with each other."
"Gotcha." 
>you turn to leave when Claire calls out to you
"What about you? Why'd you become a cop?"
>you think for a moment
"So I could carry a gun."

>thinking about it now, this day is probably what started all the shit that happened later
>of course at the time you weren't thinking about consequences
>hindsight is 20/20 after all
>either way it's not like it matters now
>you walk into the station at the start of the day like always
>after you change into your uniform you head to your car
>but, to your surprise, you don't see Claire standing by the passenger side door
>it's someone different
>a man
>he smiles and waves when he sees you coming
"Hiya. I'm Jimenez. I'll be riding with you for a while."
>you shake the man's hand, but you're a little confused
"Where's Claire?" you ask.
"She'll be out for a few weeks. Some kind of anthro thing. Between you and me I think she's in heat. Buddy of mine drove by her house, saw that all the doors and windows were barred up."
>that was kinda hot
>pushing that thought out of your mind you and your new partner hit the town
>for a few hours it's nothing major
>a few busted taillights, an old woman that needs her medicine, some kids loitering
>then the call came in
>home invasion gone wrong, three dead
>you pull up to the scene and there's police and reporters everywhere
>that's no surprise, this is an upscale neighborhood
>not quite one percenter, but still nice
>you get the details from a detective
>three men break into the house, not expecting anyone to be home
>they kill a man, a woman, and their young son, and make off with as much stuff as they can carry
>seems perfectly ordinary
>until you overhear one of the neighbors
"Does anyone know where Kelley is?"
>you walk up to the elderly woman
"Excuse me, ma'am? You mentioned a 'Kelley'? Who is that?"
"Johnathan's daughter. She was there when I went over earlier."
"You were there earlier today?"
"Yes, I was lending them a sewing machine. I saw Kelley there, and I know she hadn't left yet. Did something happen to her?"
>oh shit
>you run to a detective
"How many bodies did you find?"
"Three, the parents and the kid."
"What about the daughter?"
"Didn't see anyone else. You think she got snatched?"
"Assume the worst." 
>you walk back to your partner and rack your brain 
>you've got no idea who could have done this, or where they might have taken the girl
>of course, sometimes fate gives you a freebie
>you feel something tugging on your pant leg
>you look down and find a small puppy looking at the ground
>he was shaking
>you gently pat his head to help him calm down 
"What is it?" 
>the dog lets out a small whine
"I saw people go in the house." 
"Do you think you can tell me what you saw?"
>the young boy nods
"I saw some men go into the house, and then I heard people screaming, then I heard shooting."
>you sigh. This kid's gonna be fucked up for a while
"Do you know what the people looked like?"
"They were big dogs. They looked really mean. They all had these things wrapped around their faces, but I could tell  they were dogs."
>Anthros, gangbangers by the sound of it
>this just got a whole lot worse 
>you send the kid off and head back to your car
>time for a trip to the ghetto

--

>the first thing that hits you is the smell
>poor neighborhoods attract a certain type
>anthros mostly
>all these animals packed together is wreaking havoc on your nose
>and this garbage music blaring from a boombox
>you look around and find what you're looking for
>a group of dogs chilling on a porch, smoking and drinking without a care in the world
>each one with a purple bandanna on them somewhere 
>this is definitely what you were looking for
>even if they didn't his that house, one of them knows who did
>you walk up and make yourself known
"Wassup dawg?"
>one of them laughs
"Man, I know you didn't just say some shit like that. The fuck you want?"
"I just came by to see if any of you knew about that little break in earlier."
>the big dog in the center shrugs
"People get clapped every day, dog."
"Never mentioned any killing" you say.
>he just laughs
"Word travels fast. Some rich humans get killed, so of course you come to my hood and get up in my shit. That's downright discriminatory."
>you look at each one of them
>their eyes have no pity in them
>each one would shoot you dead and not lose a wink of sleep
>you felt a strange sort of kinship with them
"Obviously you all know jack shit so I'm not gonna waste any more time. You all have a nice day."
>you get back in the car
"What was that about?" Jimenez asks.
"I wanted to feel them out. Those guys are hardcases. No way any of them will flip."
"You have any ideas?" 
"If they did take the girl, she's probably with the boss. Those guys know they have to pay tribute to the alpha. Problem is we don't know who this boss is or where we can find him."
>Jimenez looks like he's thinking about something
"Think I might know who the boss is."
>he opens up the squad's computer and begins typing
>an inmate file appears on the screen
>Laurence Jackson, adult anthro
>served ten years for armed robbery, had multiple arrests for aggravated assault and burglary
>was a person of interest in three different murder cases, but nothing ever stuck
>and from what Jimenez told you, he had a taste for human girls
>this is definitely not the kind of guy you just walk up on
"No known address, no next of kin, nothing that ties him to anyone. How the fuck do we find this guy?"
>Jimenez ponders for a second and types on the computer again
"I found something. Jackson has a younger brother. Got busted for a DUI so he's in the system. Goes to a community college if you can believe it. It's a long shot, but maybe he knows something."
>a lead is better than no lead
"Let's go say hello."

--

>of course a community college is filled with people in the middle of the day
>trying to get him out of there would end badly
>nothing you can do but wait
"So what's it like working with an anthro?" Jimenez asks.
"Just like working with a human, just with more hair."
>Jimenez seemed interested in the subject of anthros. He went on and on.
"Dated an anthro chick for a while. She was a cow. Huge tits, bigger than my head. Had to break it off cause she was all religious and started talking about getting married. I wasn't with that. Funny story: buddy of mine actually adopted an anthro. Raised her like his own kid. Now that I think about it his name was Anon too. Maybe the two of you are related."
>you wonder if he'll ever stop talking
>then you see your target
>black Doberman getting into a silver Camry
>you'd taken precautions earlier, now it was simply a matter of getting him alone
>he leaves the school's parking lot, and you follow
>he doesn't seem to notice you following him
>as far as he knows there's no reason to worry
>of course he has no idea that you busted out one of his taillights while he was in class
>you wait until he turns down an empty street and hit the lights
>he pulls over and waits for you
"Cover me." you say to Jimenez as you get out the car
>as you walk toward the car you look around for anyone else
>no one else around
>that's for the best
"Do you know why I pulled you over?" you ask the dog.
"Fuck if I know. All my shit is in order." he responds.
"Actually you've got a busted taillight."
>the dog groans
"Are you fuckin' serious? I just got that fixed."
"While I've got you here, I'm looking for your brother. Any idea where I can find him?"
"Man I don't fuckin' know."
>you chuckle
"See, I think you do, and I really need to find him. If you know where he is, it'd be better if you tell me."
"I don't know shit. Get the fuck away from me with that shit."
>you tried being nice
>if he had just cooperated he wouldn't have a gun pressed to his head
"Get the fuck out the car." you say
"Yo what the fuck is this?" he asks in a panic
"You heard me."
>he gets out the car
>you walk him up the street to an abandoned house
>Jimenez is visibly confused by what's happening 
>you grab the dog by the ear
"Last chance. If you know something tell me."
"I told you I don't know shit."
"I hear anthros, dogs in particular, have really sharp hearing. Is that true?"
"Yeah. Why?"
>you place your gun next to his ear and fire
>to you it was a loud pop
>to him it must sound like a bomb blast
>he falls to the ground clutching his ear
>he'll probably never hear out of that ear again
"Tell me before I destroy the other ear."
"He's got this stash house where he keeps his shit. He's probably there."
"Where?"
>he gives you an address and you radio it in
>soon every cop in the city is heading for that house
>you leave the dog in a pool of blood and tears
>all in a day's work
>of course Jimenez is furious
"What the fuck was that? That was fucking illegal. Do you want to go to prison?"
"What, over him? Who'd believe him anyway? He's just as guilty, happy to take his brother's money to pay his tuition knowing damn well where it comes from."
>Jimenez grabs you by the collar
"We're supposed to uphold the law."
"In this job, the law is something you learn to work around."

>they found the girl, and arrested most of the crew for the home invasion
>from what you heard the boss took a few slugs before he was cuffed
>tough shit for him 
>at least now you're back with your partner
"So how was your vacation?" you ask Claire.
"It was boring as hell. I couldn't leave my house for a month."
>you didn't want to know why
>it's not like it mattered either way
>as long as she could still do her job after she could take as many sabbaticals as she wanted
>speaking of the job, there's a young looking anthro standing on a corner
>based on his posture he's obviously serving
>you know he doesn't have the product on him, but you should still make your presence known
>you ride on him, barely missing him with the front of your car
"You know the drill. Up against the car."
>you pat him down, but all you find is some loose change
"Yo aren't you Anon?" the boy asks
"Yeah."
"Yo I got a buddy up in County sayin' Jackson put ten stacks on your head. Some people are dyin to collect."
>you laugh
"I'm a cop. If no one wants to kill me then I'm not doing my job."
"I'm just tryin' to give you a heads up."
"Get the fuck outta here."
>you think about what that guy said
>only ten thousand? 
>for some reason you thought you'd be worth more
"What was that about a bounty on your head?" Claire asks once you get back in the car
"Some guy I busted got pissed off. Guys like that talk shit all the time, doesn't mean anything."
>Claire looked like she was worried
"I've seen my share of this gang shit. Not all of them are just talk."
"I appreciate your concern, but I'll be fine."
>honestly, what's the worst that could happen?

--

>late at night
>only a couple hours left in your shift
>nothing's happened yet, but you notice people have been looking at you weird all day
>word must have spread 
>either way no one's made a move, so there's nothing to worry about
"Pretty boring" you say
"What?" Claire asks
>shit, must have said that out loud by mistake
"Not much happened today, that's all"
"That's good, boring is a good day as far as I'm concerned."
>but still, it's weird 
>you've barely seen anyone at all today
>it's like people are actively avoiding you
>as if they know something is gonna happen
>a call comes in on the radio
>someone called 911 
>it wasn't too far from where you were at now, so you take the call
>you hit the lights and speed down the street
>it never once occurs to you that whatever has been planned is already in motion
>so you're caught completely off guard when a car slams into you and sends you spinning
>glass flies into your face 
>you're too dizzy to see straight
"What happened?" you ask
>Claire got her composure back
"Somebody hit us. Are you okay?"
"Bleeding, other than that I'm fine."
>Claire's ear perks up and her eye goes wide
>she grabs you and pushes you down
>before you can ask what's up you find yourself being shot at
>from the sound they're all packing automatics
>you're trapped under a wall of gunfire 
>you feel a bullet hit you in the leg
"Shots fired! Shots fired! Officer needs assistance!" you shout into your radio
>the shooting stops for a moment
>you throw open the door and fall out of the car
>the ground smacks you in the face
>you draw your gun and fire back towards the shooters
>it's unclear if you hit anyone, but it should hold them back for a bit
>Claire grabs you and the two of you move to find somewhere to hide
>however this is an empty road, and the only nearby building is an apartment complex
>that might as well be a death trap
>but, it's better than nothing
"What the fuck's going on?" Claire asks
"Guess they're coming to collect" you say
>this isn't exactly how you planned on dying, but beggars can't be choosers
>on the way to the complex another car pulls up in front of you
>four men with guns in their hands
>you and Claire open fire
>you get hit again
>twice in the chest, once in the shoulder
>it burns 
>you can't breathe
>ignoring the pain, you keep shooting
>once the four in the car are all dead you collapse 
>your mouth fills up with blood 
>it hurts to breathe
>everything hurts actually
>with what feels like all of your strength you turn over
>Claire crouches over you and places a hand on your face
"It's gonna be okay. We've got backup coming."
>you can hear sirens in the distance
>fuck, everything's going dark
>Claire stands back up and goes off somewhere
>where's she going?
>is she just gonna leave you like this?
>you hear more shooting before everything goes black

>it wasn't long before you were well enough to leave the hospital
>a collapsed lung and a broken shoulder were the worst of your injuries
>but that's the last thing on your mind right now
>right now you're sitting in a church surrounded by other cops
>there's an organ playing in the background
>you can here some women crying
>a priest is saying some words, but you barely hear it
>your parents are in here somewhere, but you're in no hurry to find them
>you don't see anyone from Claire's family
>then again, she never mentioned having a family
>that's probably the worst part
>looking at the portrait by her casket you'd never guess how alone she really was
>that bright smile of hers had a small hint of sadness in it
>you're such a fuck up you couldn't even be there for her when she died
>this is all your fault anyway
>she tried to warn you about what you were doing, but you just wouldn't listen
>and now she's dead
>a good woman, a good cop, and a good friend
>even in her last moments all she thought about was keeping you safe
>you get out of your seat and go outside
>you can feel everyone's eyes on you as you leave
>it's like they can't believe that she's gone but you're still here
>you can't believe it either
>once you're certain you're alone you fall to your knees
>you don't know when you started crying, but now you can't stop
>sadness doesn't begin to describe this
>it's like you're being crushed under a giant weight 
>no matter how hard you try you'll never be able to make this right
"It should have been me" you say to no one.
"It should have been me."
