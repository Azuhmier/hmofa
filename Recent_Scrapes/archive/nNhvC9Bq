Thanks for the encouragement. This is my first in a while and my first ever sans-lewd comfy.

Polar warmth.


>Be anon.
>Be in Canukistan.
>Dead of winter so it's fuck-ass cold.
>Money is starting to get tighter than you'd like.
>You decided to rent out your other room to a girl named Tasha.
>She's from Russia on an exchange program of some sort in school.
>Also, she's a polar bear.
>Her accent is just about as big as she is at seven feet tall.
>She's not fat or anything but nicely curvy.
>You had been going though a rough patch in your life at the moment and it's nice to have someone to cook for and talk to.
>The arrangement was a nice one. She bought the food, you cooked it and you both did your share of day-to-day running of the home.


>After a nice dinner of Atlantic cod with mushrooms and baked potato, you and Tasha went to bed.
>You heard a bang and then a hiss.
>You jump out of bed at Tasha yelling.
>”Um... HELP! I not know what to do! Water is come out!”
>Bursting though the door, you see the polar bear in boxers and a tank-top holding the knob of the radiator, looking sheepish.
>Behind her, the whole side of the unit was cracked open and water was spilling out.
>You, dove to the ground, under the infernal machine, cracking your head on it on the way down and quickly swing the flow valve from “Open” to “Closed”
>Sitting up you look up at the bear.
”Tasha. What...”
>She pouts at you from behind her large DD breasts.
>”I not know. I move from what was to little warmer because you say you cold and now it explode.”

>After you and her clean up the water on the ground, you sit back and sigh.
“Fuck that's going to be expensive.”
>”Not to worry tonight.”
“What do you mean?”
>”Tonight we sleep.
>Her strong arms wrapped themselves around you, picking you up off the floor and slinging you over her shoulder.
“What are ya' doing, Tash?”
>”I not want you get sick little man. What I then do? I cannot pay rent all myself now.”
“Well. I suppose not.”
>”Good. I climb in bed with you and keep warm, yes?”
“Tash... I'm grateful but I'm not... I'm not into you like that.”
>”Good. Neither am I you. I just do this to keep warm. I miss family and this make me feel like is home.”
>She flips your onto the bed and climbs in herself.
>You being in your boxers leaves her fur to rub luxuriously against your flesh.
>And what a feeling it is.
>Soft and supple flesh beneath a carpet of silky white fur.
>As she snuggles into you, you end up rolling so that she's the big spoon.
>”I sorry for break radiator. I promise that I fix. Until then we snuggle.”
“It's alright. I wanted to get it replaced sooner but at least no one was hurt.”
>Her big meaty paws wrap them selves around your stomach and pull you closer into her embrace.
>”Then all is good. Now go sleep. I keep warm and I keep safe during night.”
>So you do.
>Sleep gently wraps you up, under the blanket, pulled against the huge and very warm bear.
