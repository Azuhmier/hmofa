>The red light glaring at you doesn't give you enough time to calm your nerves as you drive your company van to your next appointment.
>As the light turns green, you hesitate for just a moment then floor it towards your destination and awaiting customer.
>It isn’t long before you reach the quiet suburban neighborhood of your newest client.
>You drive slowly and park in front of a very average house with a very average car parked in front of it.
>As you come to a stop in front of the house, you breathe in and out to calm yourself; no need to panic or freak out, just do what you always do.
>This is just another call, sure Cecile was sick and needed you to cover for her in the meantime.
>Sure, this is one of her regulars; but Cecile had asked that you specifically cover for her this time.
>That counts for something doesn’t it?
>Yea...
>Sure it does; or so you tell yourself that as you get out of the van and walk to the front door.
>As you knock on it, you think about how you got into this whole situation.
>You are a masseuse, trained specifically to work on anthros.
>Honestly, you had taken the job to impress a crush you had had, and it had developed into a full time job.
>And because of your training and species, you are one of the most requested masseuses in the local area.
>Turns out human hands are VERY good at massaging Anthros, and therefore providing relaxation and stress relief.
>Its honest work that earned you a plethora of repeat customers; mainly suburban housewives trying to get rid of stress and elderly anthros looking to get rid of a little back pain.
>You wait, back turned to the door as you look out at the street, the houses all look the same and nothing really stands out; you would swear the neighbors all got together to buy the same car.
>It doesn't take long for the sound of an opening door comes from behind you and you turn around to meet your newest customer.
>You nearly jump back in surprise as you look at her.
>she’s a VERY toned lioness, wearing a loose bathrobe that accents her curves; dark brown shoulder length hair covers her head and a calm smile is on her face.
>But that isn’t what surprises you.
>She’s nearly a foot and a half taller than you, with paws that you're sure are even bigger than your face.
>Courtesy! Don’t just fucking stare like an idiot! 
>You chastise yourself as you extend a hand to her.
>"Hello! I'm Anon with  the Anthro Masseuse company, I'll be filling in for Cecile today" you say politely as you look up at her.
>The lioness looks you over, then engulfs your hand in her paw and shakes it carefully.
>"Faith; Faith Heidern, I didn't know Cecile sent a replacement" She says in a low authoritative voice that makes you smile nervously.
>"She got sick apparently and requested I fill in for her" you explain calmly, pulling your hand away from her.
>Mrs. Heidern nods in understanding and turns away from you.
>"Very well Anon, get your tools and set up in the front room, call me when you are ready" she directs, motioning to a doorway within her house.
>You nod and quickly go to your van, and pull out the necessary things.
>A long massage table with various holes in it to allow the long snout of anthros, a thick powder to message into fur, various incense and herbal tea that you alone mix and bring on jobs.
>The tea isn’t required, but you find it helps clients relax more so you can get out all the various knots and strains in their muscles.
>Luckily you keep everything but the table in a tidy bag, which lets you carry everything in and set up quickly.
>The room she indicated is octagonal, with windows looking out onto a lovely garden with various flowers growing.
>You set up everything; the incense burning with the soft smell of lavender and lilac and a small pot of water heating up for the tea, all on a small fold-able table you have set up.
>As soon as the water is boiling, you add the leaves, then let the tea settle.
>In this business, it’s the little things that clients like; the atmosphere, the smell, the taste of freshly brewed tea.
>Anyone can get a massage, but you strive to truly relax them, and with Mrs. Heidern it looks like you might have your work cut out for you.
>Juyou know you're going to do your best and try to make her happy.
>"Mrs. Heidern? I'm ready for you down here." you call out into the house.
>You hear her footsteps above you and down a flight of stairs as she approaches the room.
>"What was that Anon?" you hear as she glides towards you with a grace usually reserved for someone smaller.
>You pour a cup of tea for her and then one for yourself.
>"I’m ready to begin the stress relief process Mrs. Heidern" you say as you extend the fresh cup of tea to her.
>"Ms. Not Mrs. and just call me Faith" She says as she takes the cup of tea and sniffs it deeply.
>You smile and take a sip of your cup as you lean against your massage table.
>She sips it and gives a heavy, approving sigh.
>"Ohh that’s good, Not even Cecile does this for me...What kind of tea is this?" she asks before taking another drink of the tea.
>You tap the side of your nose with a finger and smile.
>"Special secret blend, and I try to relax my clients in the best possible way" you say as you motion to the massage table.
>She gives you a smile and sips at the tea, eyeing you calmly with her long legs crossed.
>"So tell me Anon, why are you massaging anthros? Indulging some deep seated fetish?" she asks with a wide knowing smile.
>You choke on your hot tea, spilling a bit of it onto yourself, totally caught off guard by the question.
>Quickly, you regain your composure and answer honestly.
>"I tried to impress a crush a long time ago, turns out I’m good at it, so stuck I with it"
>Faith silently sips her tea as she looks you over once more.
>You pour yourself more of the tea and drink deeply as Faith stares, looking at you like a piece of meat.
>"Did it work out?" she finally asks.
>"Excuse me?" 
>"Did it work out with the girl you were trying to impress?" she asks again, explaining further.
>You stare at you steaming cup for a moment, thinking over the answer.
>Do you lie about it? Or tell the truth? She doesn't know you.
>You sigh as you think it over.
>The truth will set you free.
>"No...No, it didn't work out. She was more interested in someone more "macho" than me, at least that's what she said" you answer, staring into your cup.
>You look up at her and watch as she gives a somewhat apologetic nod.
>Did you go too deep with the personal backstory?
>Every client wants to "know" their masseuse to a point, but did you go too deep into the sadness category? 
>Faith sips the tea once more, then sets her empty cup on the fold-able table, then much to your surprise, stands and strips out of her bathrobe.
>Instinctively, you turn away from looking at her and give a sharp "AHEM" to get her attention.
>Even as you turn your head away, you catch a glimpse of her body.
>Cream colored fur covers her very toned and muscular body, with her well-endowed chest and stomach being covered in fur a shade or two lighter.
>You swear you saw light glint of nipple piercings on her breasts above a very defined six pack of muscle.
>"Uh... Ms. Heidern... Why are you undressing?" you ask as you try to focus on the smells of the tea and incense over the memory of Faith’s body.
>"Just Faith, and I prefer my massages to be... more intimate and natural; didn't Cecile tell you that?" comes Faiths voice from behind you.
>"Breathe, you're a professional" you tell yourself over and over as you turn around.
>She lays face down on the massage table, her tail flicking lazily and her muscled body slightly quivering in what you hope is anticipation and not cold.
>you're sweating hard, how could she be shivering?
>"Uh n-no. Ms. Hei- uh- Faith, I...uh.. Cecile failed to mention you prefer nude massages, but if that’s what you would like; I am happy to accommodate" you say with false confidence.
>you are going to KILL Cecile when you see her next from dropping this on you.
>"It is what I would like Anon~" Faith cooes softly.
>Is this even LEGAL? This seems oddly predatory to you, like you just gave her some tea and now she’s naked on a table in front of you.
>It seems super sketchy to you but...the customer is always right...right?
>You down the rest of your tea, hoping it will relax your nerves, and rub a bit of the fur powder onto your hands then start massaging her shoulders, carefully leaning over her tall body.
>You dig your fingers through her fur to her bare skin, letting your nails gently scratch her tense body.
>Anthros LOVE having their skin scratched, no matter what kind of Anthro it happens to be.
>Faith is no different.
>You can already hear her gentle groans of pleasure as you scratch and rub her muscular shoulders.
>"Faith, you have several knots on your upper back... What do you do to cause them? You might want to ask Cecile to focus on them more" you ask as you press the heel of your palm into a tight chunk of muscle.
>"I-I-I-I'm a teac-cher, I t-teach s-shop!" Faith groans out as you work out her stress knots.
>"No wonder she has so many" you think to yourself as you dig your knuckles into her shoulders and arms.
>Being a teacher must be stressful and being an anthro teacher must be even worse.
>PLUS teaching shop would just pile even more stress on; keeping idiot kids from putting a drill through their hands must stressful.
>Because of that information, you slow down.
>A normal massage takes an hour maybe, if you go slowly.
>At the pace you set now, you would be done in two, if that; but she needed the extra attention, and you could feel it under your fingers as your knuckles dig into her strong muscles.
>You work your way down her tall, toned body.
>As you gently knead and press into her body, you can feel that her muscles are not just for show.
>She is truly a strong woman, probably able to bench you without issue.
>As well, as you massage her body, you realize just how small you are compared to her.
>Your hands seem small, almost like a child’s compared to her massiveness.
>That doesn’t deter you though, you have a job to do and you were going to satisfy another customer!
>From her neck to her paws to her thighs to her foot paws, you push your fingers and knuckles into her tightly knotted muscles.
>As you massage the back side of her immense, yet toned body, you skip her lower back, tail and pelvis.
>Regardless of this omission, she gives you moans of pleasure and groans of happy pain.
>"Groans of happy pain" might seem odd to most, but to anyone who has had a massage they know.
>Massages hurt
>They hurt bad.
>But when the massage is done, all that is left in the spots massaged is relief.
>Faith was almost 90% tight knotted muscle as you work out her body, and that's just her strong back.
>As you finished massaging her foot paws, you give her a command you had been dreading since the start.
>"Ms. Hei- Faith, can you please roll over onto your back for me?" you ask calmly, trying to avoid looking at her.
>She gives a soft huffing noise that sounds like deep groans, but you recognize it after years of massage work.
>Faith is chuffing uncontrollably as you rub your fingers through her fur.
>"W-what about my lower b-back?" she moans out softly between her deep chuffs.
>"I want to save that for last Faith, it’s usually the spot that needs the most attention with big cat anthros" you say, trying to avoid staring at her shapely body and toned thighs.
>She gives another chuff of pleasure and slow rolls over, briefly facing you and looking at you with interest.
>As she does, you get another full view of her body.
>A toned six pack, strong muscles...soft looking breasts...pierced nipples and an almost predatory grin.
>With supple and amazing grace, she lays down on her back, still chuffing in pleasure as you work more of the powder onto your palms.
>"Ready?" you ask calmly, more to yourself than to Faith.
>She only nods slowly, still breathing deep.
>Once more, you dig your fingers into her fur, this time starting at her calves and working your way up her body.
>Her muscles loosen as you do your work, earning gentle moans and deep chuffs.
>As you move to her sturdy thighs, you try to avoid looking at her...private areas.
>No need to get accused of being unprofessional or of sexual harrassment.
>Next you work on her stomach, gently kneading your knuckles into her six pack.
>"It’s amazing how toned yet feminine her body is" you think to yourself as you rub your hands down her sides, smoothing out her soft fur.
>Her shoulders and neck follow suit, gently getting caressed and loosened with each pass of your fingers.
>Faith's chuffs grow deeper and more frequent as you massage her tired and strained body.
>"Please let me know if I cause you any undue displeasure Faith" you say as you massage her arms.
>she gives a slight moan as you push your fingers into her upper arm
>"Ooo-OH Anon. You're given me nothing but pleasure" she groans out happily as you rub up and down, tenderizing her muscles.
>"Your hands A-are so m-much different than Cecile's little p-paws, your hands are so big and firm and s-strong; while her paws are s-soft and g-gentle" she chuffs as you gentle squeeze her paws, allowing the tendons to loosen up a bit.
>She thinks your hands are big? Well, compared to Cecile's paws maybe... But compared to Faiths's they look so tiny.
>"Well, I aim to please, and I will do almost anything to please such a lovely lady like yourself" you respond, somewhat unsure of what to say otherwise.
>How do you respond to something like that anyway? It’s a direct comparison to two good things.
>Cecile is good at her job, but does things different than you.
>Faith smiles and looks at you as you focus a bit on her neck, gently rotating and twisting her neck muscles to loosen the muscles.
>"Anything to please me?" she says, through half lidded eyes.
>"Almost" you respond without missing a beat.
>She chuffs a few times in enjoyment before speaking again.
>"Massage my pectoral muscles then"
>That makes you freeze.
>To massage her pectorals means...
>You lick you lips, which seem to have dried in the space of a few seconds before you answer her.
>"Of course"
>Your hands run softly across her fur, never leaving direct contact with her body, from her neck to her chest.
>”This is just a pectoral massage, you've done this a thousand times before, it doesn't matter that she's naked" is your mantra as you begin massaging her breasts.
>NO! Not her breasts, just the muscles under them!
>She chuffs even louder than before as your fingers squeeze and knead her large and soft breasts.
>You can tell the muscles under them are strained and knotted, but you just can't focus on that no matter how hard you try.
>Why is this so different than other customers? You’ve massaged plenty of ladies.
>Is it because she's nude? Is it because you just kind of hit it off with her? 
>You don’t know, but you find your hands focusing on her nipples more than you should; your fingers brush against her piercings more than once.
>FOCUS
>Yes, she's a beautiful lady; yes, your massaging her naked breasts; but that ISN'T an invitation.
>Is it?
>You look at her face to study her reaction to your hands, only to find her already eyeing you with beautiful blue eyes.
>You immediately look away, focusing on the room rather than your client and earning a soft chuckle from her.
>Right, she's just a client.
>You pull your hands away from Faith's body; totally against your body’s wishes.
>To be honest, you have been at "full mast" since you started massaging her toned body.
>The addition of massaging her breasts only added to it.
>Never before have you been so attracted to a client; but you need to keep it under wraps! This is not a fanfic or doujin!
>"Alright Ms. Heidern, I’ve massaged your body, anything else for me?" you ask, trying to avoid looking at her body and focus on her eyes once more.
>She looks at you serenely, gives a deep Chuff, and then rolls onto her stomach with subtle grace.
>"Just faith, and you still need to massage my lower back and tail" she chuffs, wiggling her body slightly on the massage table.
>Fuck.
>You didn't massage that because it is the most sensitive part of any feline anthro; and you had forgotten about it due to her... Large tracts of land.
>But that’s no excuse to be an idiot and forget something so important.
>"Of course, let me get that area nice and relaxed" you say as you lean over her and begin massaging her lower back.
>Felines are odd.
>Anything touches their lower back and tail and it riles them up.
>Your fingers knead Faith's lower back softly, earning longer, deeper chuffs of pleasure.
>As you lean over the table and press your hands into her firm rear, you feel a paw brush your manhood, which makes you jump back slightly.
>Faith rolls her head over, and looks at you innocently.
>"Something wrong Anon?" she asks, a coy smile on her face.
>"Uh...No nothing" you say as you step back up to the table.
>Once more you rub her rear and dig your fingers into the fur around the base of her tail, earning a gentle groan of pleasure from Faith.
>Each time you drag your fingers through her fur, her hips buck up just the slightest bit, making her back arch slightly.
>Heh, cats will be cats, big or small; feral or anthro.
>Just as you begin to think that Faith had just accidently brushed your member, her paw gently wraps around it through your pants.
>"Looks like I'm not the only one who needs some relief" Faith almost purrs, looking back at you with a tripumphant look on her muzzle.
>You blush and try to back away from her only for her to clamp down harder on your engorged member.
>"U...s-sorry M-Ms. Heidran! I-it Uh... your bod-" 
>"Shush, Just call me Faith" she cooes at you softly, still laying on her stomach with you shaft in her large paw.
>"You still need to finish Massaging my tail Anon~" she purrs, whipping the tuft at the end of her tail in your face.
>You swallow and nod, if you keep her happy she might not report you to cooperate.
>aA your fingers part the fur at the base of her tail, she gently rubs your member through your pants, all while chuffing.
>Your hands wrap around her tail and you gently massage the muscles, stretch it softly and roll each individual vertebrae between your fingers.
>"Hmm I can see why Cecile recommended you Anon~" Faith moans as you work on her tail and she slips her large paw into your pants.
>"M-Ms. Heidran? W-what are you d-doing?" you ask, stammering more out of fear for losing your job and getting blacklisted.
>She gives your member a soft squeeze and chuffs happily.
>"Just Faith, and I’m just giving YOU a bit of relief, Cecile always helps me with sexual stress and frustration" she states very matter of factly, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
>So THAT’S why Cecile would always spend extra long on these jobs! 
>Her paw pads are soft and caressing as she looks over her shoulder at you, a small smile on her face.
>"F-faith I’m really not supposed to do anything like this with you" you stammer as you massage the tuft on the end of her tail.
>"Even if I want it? How about you just think of it as an extra massage on my insides~" she chides playfully.
>You think about it for a moment and weigh the options.
>Have a good time with a beautiful lady OR, not have a good time and possibly get reported.
>Easy choice actually.
>You don’t respond but instead, grab her ass and squeeze it firmly, earning a surprised moan from Faith.
>"B-buuut, if you really want to indulge me with me Anon, you need one thing" She says after she recovers from the shock of you grabbing her ass.
>You stop and look at her.
>"What do I need?" you ask, hands still placed on her firm ass.
>"Condoms, I don't know you and you don't know me, so let’s both be safe" she says, leaning onto her elbow to look at you better.
>But that means you have to leave and go to the sto- wait.
>WAIT.
>When you got this job and told your friends about it, that laughed at you.
>Then when you took the company van home one evening, one of them put a box of condoms in the glove box, saying it was for "all the happy endings" as a joke.
>Jokes on them now!
>"Ok Faith... Just let me go get some" you respond, as she eyes you curiously.
>She slips her paw out of your pants and you hurry out of the house.
>You run to the van and tug on the handle, only for it not to open.
>Right it’s locked, you dingus.
>You fish in your pockets for the key and unlock the door then dive for the glove box.
>As you pull it open it and there it is, the unopened box of condoms.
>It's like finding the Holy Grail to you, with an angelic choir and everything.
>Quickly, you grab it and close everything up, then rush back inside.
>Faith is sitting on the massage table, legs spread partially as she looks at you and the box.
>"You always have condoms?" she asks, a bit of irritation in her voice.
>"long story short, prank gift from my friends from when I became a masseuse" you explain, showing her the unopened box of condoms.
>She gives a smile and nods, looking from you to the unopened box in your hand.
>She spreads her strong legs a bit more and beckons you with a padded paw.
>You move towards her, eyeing her large, toned body as if you were hypnotized by it.
>Every curve of her body is an invitation to you.
>Her perfect hips, her succulent breasts, the washboard abs.
>You hand her the box as you move closer to her, pressing your body against hers as she takes it from you.
>"Lose your clothes" she instructs as she casually opens the box and slides the condoms out onto the table she still sits upon.
>You do as you're told, and quickly begin undressing as Faith watches you with a hungry look in her eyes.
>The look only predator anthros can really master and do well, and Faith has it down perfect.
>As you finish undressing she gives you an approving nod and beckons to you once more.
>"It has been some time since I was with a Man, so let’s takes things nice and slow" she purrs as her paws wrap around your stiff member.
>wordlessly, one of your hand trails down her body to her wet nethers and your other hand gently caresses her breast.
>You slide a finger into her slit and put you thumb on her clit and tweak it softly.
>"Mhmmmm, Just like that~" Faith moans as you slide another finger into her.
>She places a large paw on the back of your head and pulls into a deep kiss as you finger her wetness and grope her breasts.
>The feeling is different from when you were massaging them, then it was trying to relieve the muscle, now it’s about arousal and the want to satisfy Faith.
>Her tongue pushes into your mouth and you feel a barbell clack against your teeth; you in turn push your tongue into her mouth, feeling her sharp fangs.
>She moans into your mouth as you pinch one of her nipples and pull it by the piercing, her insides quiver and tighten softly, as you do.
>You curl your fingers in her, probing for the small spot in her that would really get her going.
>Your fingers only graze it and you feel Faith's body shiver as you rub a single finger across it once more, testing the area.
>There it is, the spot all women have yet so few men can find.
>She moans as you run your fingers up and down her g-spot as you finger her.
>"H-Human h-hands are s-so good f-for this" Faith moans as your thumb makes small circles on her clit.
>What had been just a slight dampness has turned into raging flood as your fingers stimulate her g-spot. 
>You pull her into another kiss and she wraps her strong arms around you, moaning and chuffing in pleasure.
>Her body quivers slightly and you feel her muscles tighten around your fingers, almost painfully as she orgasms.
>Faith pulls away from the kiss and pants slightly.
>"Th-that w-was a-amazing" she pants "B-but I'm r-ready for the real thing"
>Slowly you pull your fingers out of Faith, dragging them across her g-spot, which makes her moan softly to you.
>As they slide completely out, she grasps your arms and pulls your fingers to her mouth.
>She suckles on them softly, allowing her tongue piercing to hit each knuckle; her blue eyes locked on yours.
>When she releases your fingers from her soft, beautiful maw, she grabs the condoms and tears one off while you rub her body and tease her breasts further.
>She continues to moan gently as she opens one of the condoms packaging, then kisses you.
>You feel one of her huge paws wrap around your member, than feel the other slide a condom onto your fully erect shaft.
>"There we go~ all ready for me~" she cooes to you softly as she pulls away from the kiss
>You smile up at her and reluctantly let go of her beasts to grab your member and position it against her wet and waiting opening.
>Not to ruin the moment, you rub the tip of your member against her wetness, poking her clit softly and earning groans of pleasure from her.
>"Don't tease~" she moans as you rub her clit.
>Carefully, you position your member to her opening, feeling the sopping wetness and the emanating heat soak into your body from her.
>You continue rubbing until you feel her long, toned legs wrap around you and pull you into her, forcing your shaft into her awaiting and wanting wetness.
>The sudden heat and pressure makes you gasp while Faith moans loudly, not expecting your full length to be pulled into her so suddenly.
>"S-so big" she moans as her arms wrap around you.
>As Faith clings to you, you begin moving slowly; penetrating deep into her and feeling her muscles tighten with each slow thrust.
>The feeling of Faith's silken fur around your neck and pelvis surprises you as she wraps her arms around you.
>As a masseuse, you have felt the fur of SO many anthros.
>Faith's has to be one of the softest you have ever felt, and the feeling of it rubbing against you is memorizing.
>Your hands grab her waist as you push into the large feline, hearing her deep chuffs of pleasure.
>Her breasts push against your chest as you feel every fold of her wetness tighten around you.
>Every feeling from her is intoxicating; the tightness, the smell of her silken fur, her arms and legs wrapped around you.
>Slowly, you being speeding up your thrusts into her, assisted by Faith's strong legs.
>Each thrust has an additional pull from her, forcing you deeper into her
>You can feel her cervix through the condom as you get pulled to her.
>And while most would complain about the condom, this time it was a saving grace.
>Faith is SO tight that you're sure you would have cum into her without it winthin a few moments.
>But because of it you can enjoy her SO much more.
>You speed up once more, thrusting deeper into her.
>Your hands find their way to her toned ass, grasping each cheek as she sits on your massage table.
>She kisses you as you pull her to you, still thrusting in deep. 
>You feel her tighten around your member with each buck of your hips, awaiting what you do next to her.
>And your body awaits what hers will do to you.
>You feel each muscle tighten around your shaft, proving her muscles aren't just for show.
>Hell, her arms and legs prove that without a doubt.
>You couldn't escape her grasp if you wanted too.
>And since you don’t want to, you push into her more, earning soft moans of pleasure from Faith.
>Her claws dig into your back as you push deep into her and her body shudders in a vioent orgasm.
>She pulls you close to her, bellowing a roar of pleasure.
>You don't stop your movements as her legs lock into a rigid position, partially restrictin your moments.
>Doesn’t matter, you have enough room to thrust into her toned muscular body.
>As you feel your limit closing in fast, you reach a hand up and place it on the back on Faiths head and pull her into a deep kiss.
>She moans into your mouth as you unload deep in her, with the feeling of her muscles trying to milk you for all you're worth.
>You both stay in this position for a while, savoring the feeling.
>Her fur all around you in a tight hug; her legs, arms and tail wrapped around you like the best security blanket.
>You feel your member twitching inside her sopping wetness, trying hard to impregnate her through the condom. 
>Finally, you pull out of her, still kissing her and rubbing your hands up and down her sides.
>She gasps and moans, gripping the base of your member to ensure the condom stays on.
>When you're finally out of her she gently pulls the condom off and stares sat the amount of semen you've produced.
>"Mmmm, good thing you wore a condom" She cooes as she ties off the condom and sets it aside. 
>You pant softly and look at the lovely lioness; suddenly aware of how naked you are.
>She pulls you to her once more, wrapping her arms around you in a tight hug.
>The two of you bask in the afterglow, your body against hers, your nethers against hers.
>It’s all very intimate as you feel her breath and her pulse.
>But that togetherness had to end at some point.
>She breaks away from you and grabs her bathrobe, slowly pulling it on.
>"Mmmm thank you Anon, that was....fantastic" she sighs happily as she dresses.
>You don't say anything as you gather your clothes and pull them on as she disappears into the unexplored recesses of her house.
>When you finish dressing, you being begin putting your stuff away, feeling somewhat like a human vibrator.
>Faith's heavy footsteps resound through the house as you lug the tables and your bag out to the van.
>You're loading the van up when you hear a soft "Ahem" behind you, making you jump slightly.
>You spin around to find Faith wearing a form Fitting workout outfit.
>"Anon... Thank you for the massage, I look forwards to employing your services in the future" she says matter of factly, extending a paw to you.
>You take her paw and feel a bit of paper forced into your palm.
>Faith gives a warm smile, as you look at the paper and find a phone number on it.
>The large lioness leans down and puts her muzzle by your ear.
>"In case you ever want to help me with "stress" off hours" she whispers in a sweet sultry voice.
>You smile at Faith as she pulls back and then kisses you quickly.
>"Of course Ms. Heidran, how about sometime this weekend? Saturday maybe? I know a good restaurant that can help with stress relief" you say as she pulls away quickly and looks around to ensure no one saw.
>She nods and gives an approving chuff.
>"8 on Saturday will do nicely. Do not be late Anon. Now if you will, I must go for my afternoon jog" she says with a half-smile, then break off into a graceful stride away from you.
>You watch for a moment, then hop into the Van.
>Dam, you might just owe Cecile one.
>But then again, she doesn’t need to know of your casual affair.
