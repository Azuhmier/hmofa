>another day another dollar, you're on your usual shift cleaning out the complex
>It's abandoned, but it's still owned, and the owners want it tidy for whenever they decide to do something with it, most people find it creepy so the job was an easy take for you.
>It's really not that hard, go in this room here, clear out a cobweb, throw away some old furniture, scoot out some bums.
>The only odd thing is sometimes you hear this humming coming from the swimming pools, you always assumed it to be some sort of leaky pipe or something.
>But every time you go in there the humming stops, like someones turned it off and is fucking with you
>Things were different this sunday however...
>You go in, prepared for the humming to stop and to sweep up the random animal droppings.
>But the humming doesn't stop, in fact this time it's louder then ever.
>Your eyes dart around the chess colored swimming pool to see if you can finally nab whoever's been making that damn sound
>You see a shadow of sorts in the "adult swim" pool that's hidden away from the kiddie pool area
>You make a turn and stare into it, prepared to scold whoever's been making this damn racket
>What you saw you were not prepared for.
>First of all, there was water flowing through the pool.
>Secondly, there seemed to be an odd mist leading to nowhere.
>And the most important, a giant monster was standing up against the pool wall.
>To call this thing weird would be an understatement, it had a head like a dolphin, but no eyes.
>Yet it still had blowholes near its neck
>It had breasts, MULTIPLE breasts, so you knew it was female.
>Well chiseled abs somehow, and nice thighs.
>Webbed feet, and also what appeared to be a giant tentacle flailing from an orifice you can only assume to be it's "vagina"
>Of course there was a tail too, but that fucking pails in comparison to the other worldly pussy your eyes are fixated on.
>You want to scream, you want to
>you wanted to run away,wanted to alert the authorities,tell the world about this fucking awful thing you saw
>you throw your cleaning mop at it, it grabs it with it's tail and snaps it in two, you retreat behind the wall
>"What the fuck am i gonna do? nobody will believe me if i tell them i saw some sort of aquatic monstrosity, am i going insane?!?"
>"But if i just stay here it might goddamn eat me!"
>Pondering your options, the humming seems to start up again
>You look back into the room at it, well no, at her, as her breasts and pussy reminds you for the second time.
>As you look at her, the humming stops,curious, you think of trying something
>You poke behind the wall again, the humming starts, you poke your head out and look at her, it stops.
>Now you know for sure, she's making the humming to attract you to look at her!
>But why? If she wanted you to eat she could have easily jumped at you and snapped you in two like that mop
>Or maybe she's immobile and can't actually move?
>whatever the case, it doesn't seem like she's a threat at the moment
>You walk slowly back in, looking at her yet again, but this time you slowly start to enter the pool
>She makes an odd cooing noise, she sounds satisfied by you entering
>You sit on the opposite end, not very much ready to exactly be within lethal distance of her, but you're willing to at least be on the same elevation
>You wave your hand at her, wondering if she can understand any sort of communication
>Upon doing this her tail waves back, whether that's mimicking or understanding, you don't know
>What you do know, is that after doing that a large amount of pink liquid seems to be filling the area around her crotch
>You can't imagine what that is, but you hope it's not piss
>Suddenly her breasts pop out with nipples, aimed towards you
>Definitely not piss
>You're sitting yards away from a monster that you got horny just from waving hello at it
>You're either leaving here dead, or not a virgin.
