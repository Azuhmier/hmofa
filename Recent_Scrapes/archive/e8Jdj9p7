>your name is Meyla
>you are a female hyena and your gang is pretty much feared in your highschool
>even the lions try to stay clear of you
>remember the time their leader prostrated himself infront of you after a viscious fight
>as you enter the schoolgrounds, you spot an unfamiliar sight
>a human guy in school clothes
>this day was going to be interesting
>you rush up to him and grab him by the shoulder
>"Oi oi, has nobody told you to respect your elders, kid?" you snarl at him with a toothy smile
>he turns around and you notice that he has pearced eyebrows, a very...sturdy build, and wears the uniform in a way that makes even you look approachable
>you have to raise your line of sight to match his eyes, which are either green or blue, youre not sure, and thats when you notice that he is BIG, even for a human
>"What was that?" he shoots back.
>Before the fight can turn physical, you are both separated by two teachers while the rest of the students seem shocked
>"Damn it, break it up! Both of you will turn in to the headteacher at the end of the day!"
>The human scoffs and turns around, walking towards the building with a cocky stride
>Its now that you realize how loud your heart is beating.

>Be Anon.
>First day in the new school and already someone tries to start shit with you
>Not that you complain of course, and it happening infront of pretty much everyone is a big plus
>You are tired as shit and at least today wanted to be left alone
>As you try to find your new class, you notice the low amount of humans.
>There didnt seem to be open friction but you have yet to see an anthro speaking with a human
>A lot of students shoot glances at you
>You ignore them and enter your classroom
>Had you arrived too early?
>More looks, some anxious, some curious
>You look around and choose an empty desk
>Leaning back your chair against the wall, you decide to examine your class
>Two humans, and around twenty anthros from various species
>Most look away when your eyes meet, some courageous souls dont
>Gotta teach them later
>Soon the class is filled and you notice a fidgeting zebra boy looking at you
>Seems you took away his spot from the looks he and another zebra nerd are giving you
>You hear him mumble something
>"Cant hear ya nerd. Speak louder."
>"Um...sorry...that is my c-chair..."
>Your only response is cracking your knuckles
>He trips back with a shocked expression
>"S-sorry..." the zebra says, walking towards the free desk at the other side of the classroom with a sour expression
>You hear murmurs around you and ignore them, fishing your mobile out of your phone and messaging your bois
>The door opens causing you to look up
>A young canine woman walks in, greeting the class
>She seems like the friendly type, great, those are the easiest to deal with
>"Hello everyone, hope you enjoyed your weeekend! We have a new student in the class, Mr. Mous, why wont you come up and and introduce yourself?"
>She seems to get the message after you shoot her a glare and remain seated
>"R-right then, lets get started.." she gulps.

>Your fist meets the metal of your locker
>How dare that human! Oppose her infront of everyone? Her?!
>She would make sure to make him suffer.
>Turning around, you notice your gang coming up to you
>"Hey boss, what's got ya so riled up?" the smallest one, Ellie, asks
>The one to the right laughs 
>"Bet its about the human dude," Carmen says with a smirk
>"Shut the fuck up," you say and glare at her. "I will deal with that cocky bastard later. Lets go eat."
>You and your friends climb the stairs towards the rooftop. No one comes here anymore after your gang beat up some wolves who thought it funny to claim it
>As you drop onto an empty bench and unwrap some quality meat, Ellie pops up
>"So what happened? He started shit?"
>"No, I saw like a new guy and thought I should beat it into his head who the boss here is. Thought simply saying it would be enough but nope, he like had the balls to turn around and shoot me a glare right back" you snarl
>You remember it pretty clear, his blue eyes staring into yours angrily. Again you could hear your heart beat wildly.
>"Haha, pretty ballsy for a walking piece of skin without claws," Ellie laughs. 
>"Eh, wouldn't underestimate him, he looked pretty muscular," Carmen mused.
>"I dont care, I will find him after school's over and will, like, soo show him who is at the top of the food chain round here."

>The schoolbell rings, signaling the big break. You jolt off your chair, swing your bag around your shoulder without much regard to your surroundings and head to the door. As you enter the hallway and join the big mass of students heading to enjoy recess, you notice moving away as you stride forward. Finally you come to the cafeteria
>As you munch off a piece of your sandwich, you notice no one taking the free spots next to you. Suits you fine
>Seems like the incident this morning has left enough of an impression
>A group of wolves approaches you, all male.
>"So you're the new human, huh? You don't like much," the one infront growls
>Big mistake
>You look around, only students around. If you give him a piece now it might make your life easier in the future if others thing you are too much trouble to take on
>Before he can react you're up, fist connecting with furry muzzle. He howls in pain
>"Say that again, you furry fuck."
>Another launches himself at you and looses his footing after you use your arms to keep him in a headlock
>"So this is how it goes, you piss off and let me eat in peace or I'll drop you all before you can say 'meatball', capiche?"
>Their leader glares angrily at you before retreating a few steps
>You loosen your hold and let the wolfboy free, pushing him hard enough to fall
>The group retreats and you quickly munch your sandwich down before exiting the cafeteria before someone else tries their luck
>Or before a teacher starts to bother you
>Fuck, you just wanted to eat a sandwich
>You make your way to the courtyard and drop onto a bench
>A lot of students were about, humans and anthros keeping to themselves
>Hell, even the anthros seperated by species
>But that was how it was elsewhere too, you knew
>atleast you thought so based on your experience at the construction company
>A group of other human students came your way
>"Hell man, you decked that asshole! That was awesome!"
>The boy held his hand out, "Im Drake, we came to say hi, since uh, you know-"
>"Yeah I do, name's Anon."
>You honestly didnt care about him or the others, but making a couple of acquaintances could not hurt

>Well, atleast you learned a couple things. That Drake and his friends didnt seem that bad
>You will still keep your distance tho
>And that they kept together here
>Not that you cared either way
>School day was almost over
>After your display in the cafeteria no one else took a chance with you
>But you bet you will still be in trouble later
>Seems like most trouble makers do their villain shit in areas where the teachers are less likely to see them
>You groaned as you remembered you had to report to the headteach after this lesson
>Fuck that wolf clown, you seriously need to keep your impulsive nature in check next time
>You dont want a repeat of what happened in your last school...
>ignore that, thats in the past now
>Thankfully the bell rings
>You make your way to the headteachers office and find the hyena there
>She is leaning against the wall and you examine her
>Her choice of uniform surely broke a few regulations here
>No skirt seemed a tad shorter and looked worn, her jacket not being any better
>And it was also not bottoned the way it was supposed to be
>as you examined her you noticed the hyena staring up at you with a fiery glint in her eyes
>Was she angry? 
>The fuck was this bitches problem?!
>First she gets you in trouble for no reason and now she acts like youre at fault?
>You frown back at her, anger overriding anything else
>She breaks eye contact and instead knocks at the door
>"Come in."
>Releasing a breath you didnt know you had held, you calm your emotions and open your fists
>Walking past her and opening the door, you walk in and steel yourself for a probably shitty end to a very shitty schoolday

>You walked in after him, heart hammering in your chest. Why didnt he look away and why did it make her heart beat like that?!
>Most males of her species would look away in submission when you glared at them, yet he didnt even flinch
>Taking a seat next to him, you inhaled deeply to calm yourself
>It didnt help however because you immediately noticed his scent
>"Miss Ankali, are you listening?"
>"Wuh?"
>You looked at the headteach, Miss Parson, an older otter who sighed at you
>"Well, now that I have your attention... I heard what happened, and I am finally at my limit. I know you dont care, but next time this happens, you will get a two week suspension."
>She turns her head to the human
>"As for you, young man, considering you didnt start it, and it is your first day here, I will let you off with a warning. But dont expect much leniency if I hear more of you being involved in incidents, I already have too many troublemakers and certainly dont need more. You know you are walking on thin ice, from what I heard about your previous school board. Are we clear Anon?"
>So that was his name
>He shifted uncomfortably before replying with a low "Yes ma'am"
>"Alright you two...Dismissed."
>You followed him outside, wondering what Miss Parson had meant by that last part
>Wait, why did you care all of a sudden?
>Before you could say anything Anon turned around, looking down at you with an expression you couldnt quite read. Humans always were hard to figure out
>"Listen, I dont know what your problem is, why you did that this morning and frankly I dont give a fuck. For your sake and mine, lets just keep out of each others hair...or fur, in your case. Fine?"
>You blinked in surprise and broke eye contact "R-right. Dont want to see you more than I need to anyway.."
>Looking back up you see him already on his way without another word
>You werent sure what annoyed you more, the fact that he had left without letting you finish or the fact you even cared in the first place
>You remember you wanted to show him whos boss after school, but now you didnt care that much about it anymore, and you really didnt want a suspension...
>supressing an angry growl you turn around and started walking towards the exit

>Finally arriving home, you look around as you take your shoes off
>"Uncle Phil?"
>No answer, seems like he still was at work
>You walk into the kitchen and grab an apple before heading to your room
>Falling onto you bed, you take a bite and let your thoughts wander
>The hyena dominates most of them
>What was her fucking problem? You didnt do anything to her and she got you into the trouble, right off the start
>You will to ask one of the humans you met today about her
>The school was just as bad as your last one
>Teachers seemed to turn a blind eye if they could 
>The students segregated themselves by species
>You were glad that atleast some of the students were humans, even if they were few
>As long as you kept a low profile and werent bothered by people you should get through your last year just fine
>A car coming down the street and the garage door opening heralds the arrival of your uncle
>You were on your way to the entrance hall just to see your uncle hanging his jacket up
>Phil was in his late fourties but his appearance said otherwise
>He had broad shoulders and overall a strong build
>After your parents died two years ago he had taken you in, him being your last living relative
>He was a foreman for the construction company you were working for and you were grateful for him getting you
>"Hey kid, how was ya first day? School treat ya fine?"
>"Im not a kid, old man. And it was okay, I guess" you grunt
>He smiles "As long as ya dont get into trouble, okay is fine with me"
>Scratching your neck,  "Yea no trouble, but the school is kinda like the old one. Made some friends though."
>Patting you on the back, he walks into the kitched and opens the fridge "Thats great. Wanna order take out? The game should start in a few"
>You give him a thumbs up 
>Atleast this part of day was good

>Hearing the faint alarm of your phone, you groan and slowly rise up
>Drinking beer during the week was something you wouldnt do but its what you and Phil always do when watching a match
>You quickly put on some joggings and exit the house
>Starting the day with a powerjog was something you have come to really love
>It clears your thoughts and you always feel fresh in your mind and body afterwards
>twenty minutes later you arrive back at your house, exhausted but feeling good
>You quickly jump into the shower and enjoy the warm water before quickly getting dressed for school
>Spotting some packed sandwiches on the kitchen counter, you smile "Still treating me like a kid, jeez.."
>You take them and stuff them into your bag before opening the front door and heading to the next bus stop
>As you wait for the bus you notice a familiar hyena coming up
>God damn it
>She catches your eyes and looks at you, seemingly surprised, before looking away
>Well, suits you well. Maybe you dont have to watch out for trouble from here anymore, atleast
>You take your phone out of your pocket and check the news for a bit
>Looking at the notifications you realize you missed a couple messages from the guys you met yesterday
>Couple of messages from Drake, one from another guy by the name of Frank and that tanned girl Amy, asking if you wanted to hang out at the park
>You didnt expect them to actually message you so quick and a smile forms at your face
>Before you reply back you notice the hyena looking at you from the corner of your eye
>after seeing you notice she looks away again feigning disinterest
>Is she looking for a way to attack you? That would be pretty dumb, this area is highly populated and shes standing at a bus stop
>Plus its her ass on the line once the school would find out
>It had to be a coincidence and with that thought you take your phone back out
>’sorry, didnt look at my phone yesterday, wanna hang out during the breaks?’
>Messages send you again notice the hyena staring at you
>Okay now you were feeling both annoyed and freaked out
>"What do you want?" you say, turning to her
>She blinks in surprise and manages a "What?"
>you cross your arms and stare right back at her
>"I saw you looking at me twice now. Soo, what do you want?"
>Her expression seemed angry now, and you feared she might wanna go, causing you to clench your first in response
>"I can like look at who I want when I want! S-So you better shut your trap!"
>You can already feel whatever mental energy you stored up with that jog evaporating with each word leaving her mouth
>Great, you figure you have to get up even earlier just to avoid running into her at the busstop
>"Fine, do what you want," you sigh tiredly
>"I will!"
>God was she annoying to deal with. On the other hand, you didnt feel that anxious to be around her anymore
>The bus arrives and you both get in, she moving to the back of the bus and you taking a free seat somewhere in the middle
>You can already feel her staring holes into the back of your head
>Looks like this day might be just as exhausting like the last one
