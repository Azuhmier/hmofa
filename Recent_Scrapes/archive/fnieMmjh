Ɛ>~Heart of the Shark 2~<3
A BNA inspired sequel
By HierophantHerp
(If you haven't read the first part you probably should)

>The car trip wasn't unbearable, only taking a few hours to reach the coast before Anima City from Kuwana
>It didn't matter, though
>You would drive any distance to see the love of your life again
>Mako Selachi, a shark beastman you had been dating but unfortunately had to say your goodbyes to to protect her safety from humans
>Humans are seldom allowed to enter their tiny ethnostate, but recently, following a scandal involving the Sylvasta Pharmaceutical Conglomerate, a cult known as the Silver Wolf Order, and the Prime Minister of Japan, Mayor Rose has opened up the city to human tourists to construct the cultural bridge between the two species
>As soon as you heard the news, you jumped to the first opportunity you could to visit her
>The memories of her dark silver, medium lengthed hair, Prussian blue eyes, tall stature, and toned body resonated deeper within you with every kilometer you drove
>As you drove you sang along with the music playing
>"The smell of a rose, like no words can say, the sound of a stream, that's well outta sway, with currents of touch, of sights and bliss, the sound of the birds, the taste of a kiss"
>Man, you loved that song, even if it was in English
>Your singing almost distracted you from seeing Anima City rising over the horizon
>It looked largely the same as it did when you were there months ago, but this time there was more construction going on
>Structureally it was no different than a city like Tokyo or New York City, but something about it just made it seem more natural to you
>As you drive, you pass a billboard advertising Anima City that featured a pink fox on it
>Following it was one that promoted the math rock band Tricot
>Going to a concert of their's was always something the two of you wanted to do
>You drive along the side of the cliff whose base you two had fought against hunters
>It feels like that was forever ago now
>You wonder where the two of them are now
>You eventually reach the checkpoint leading into the Beastman Special Zone
>At the gate was a capybara beastman whose nametag read "Alexa Isa"
>She had long, black hair and brown eyes
>She wore a black and white blazer and had a necklace with a tiki on it
>"Hello and welcome to Anima City. Humans are required to give ID before entering," she kindly tells you
>"You can tell just like that?" you ask as you hand over your driver's license
>"Never underestimate our noses" she answers as she hands back your license. "You can go ahead now. Enjoy your stay!"
>You drive off and enter the tunnel leading into the city; a much different entrance than how you came previously
>After a long stretch of concrete, you emerge on the vibrant, other side
>Before heading over, the two of you discussed where you would meet up, which was now made easier due to the firewall shutting down following the allowance of humans
>The conclusion ended up being at the beach

>You continued to drive closer to the meeting spot
>Even buildings you saw only once your previous time here had a sense of familiarity to you
>A few turns later and you finally found the beach, which offered a view of the human world on the other side, and was surrounded by villas
>You park your car, hop out, and head for the golden sands in front of you
>Luckily, you drove into the city already wearing a bathing suit and t-shirt
>The warm sands feel nice on your feet as the grains seep through your sandals
>You begin surveying the area for Mako
>You see a couple of beastmen lounging on beach chairs and towels, including but not limited to a chameleon, ape, and canary
>You feel a bit worried for a second, thinking maybe you got the time or location wrong, but then you look in the water
>A gray fin can be seen swiftly swimming above the surface
>It's her
>You quickly run towards the ocean
>Then, the rest of her emerges
>Her silver hair is now darker after being soaked in the water
>Her rough, grey skin is complemented by a new red bathing suit
>Her long tail splashes the water below her as she begins to run towards you
>Her toothy smile gets bigger and bigger and she gets closer and closer
>Before you can properly prepare yourself, she jumps as you, knocking you in the wet sand, and gives you a giant hug
>You had forgotten how strong her hugs can be, so at first, it sort of hurt, but you didn't really mind
>"Ohhhh you're finally here!! I've missed you soooo much!" Mako exclaims loudly
>Before you can say anything back to her, she kisses you right on the lips for what seems like forever
>In human society a long kiss like this would seem kind of weird and awkward in public, but in the beastman world, showing off how much of an alpha you are like that is not only acceptable, but pretty much the rule
>Your tongue feels her sharp teeth, but after years of kissing, nothing can cut it
>Finally, she lets go of you
>"I forgot how great that felt," is all you can sheepishly muster out
>You stare at each other before you simultaneously say "I love you."
>The two of you sit down in the sand like normal people and begin talking about what has happened since you last saw each other
>As you rest your head on her shoulder you could feel her tail bump up against you every once in a while as you two talked
>"As you can probably tell by the bathing suit, I became a lifeguard here," she tells you. "They were short on aquatic beastmen, so I came in at the perfect time. Currently, they're also having me train a young dolphin girl named Nina. I'm off duty right now though, so we can have the rest of the day to ourselves."
>She winked as she said that
>Hell yeah, that means some nice cuddling later tonight hopefully
>"Well, guess what I have in store for us tonight," you ask her
>"Ooo, what?"
>"I got us tickets to see Tricot in concert tonight! They're playing in Anima City to kick off their tour!"
>Her eyes widened and ears perked up with excitement as she jumped on you to hug you again
>"Oh my God, thank you thank you thank you soo much I've been dying to see them for forever!"
>She tightens her grip on you, making you lose your breath slightly
>She notices and loosens up a bit
>"Well, that starts at eight tonight, and we'll probably get dinner before that, so we still got plenty of time left to ourselves until then. What should we do until then?" you ask.
>She looks at you and asks, "want to go swimming?"
>Without hesitation, you nod your head
>She grabs your hand and lifts you up to head to the water

>"Back in Kuwana it would usually be difficult to swim in the ocean, but here, pretty much any time I get the itch to, I can swim to my heart's content!"
>The two of you walk into the water
>It's cold at first, but you got used to it pretty quickly
>Once it gets deep enough, about waist level, you stop
>Mako begins floating chest down in the water and tells you to hop on
>You position your hands around her sides, careful not to block her gills, and climb on her back like you have many times before
>If you were any taller or she was any shorter you wouldn't have been able to fit, but luckily you are just the right size
>Before you can tell Mako you're ready, she darts off
>She's definitely gotten faster since the last time you were together
>Effortlessly, she glides through the water at blazing speeds, with a slight swaying motion similar to that of a ribbon in the air, occasionally jumping a bit out of the water
>She uses her tail to accelerate while her fins assist in a clean glide
>She was like a bullet that was shot underwater
>If you weren't riding on her back she could also spin around to make quick turns
>You pass by a boat that read "Animaru" on the side that had a few passengers on it that looked a bit familiar for some reason
>After a few minutes, you were about a kilometer away from where you started so she slowed down and came to a stop
>She stopped about halfway between the human shores and the beastman shores, and in the middle sat you and Mako
>You turned around in place as you treaded and noticed a bit of a difference between the styles of buildings, but you couldn't tell what it was
>You turned back to Mako, who was smiling as always
>She readjusted her wet hair to get out of her face
>You lean in for another kiss
>She accepts
>As your mouths latch on to each other, she takes you underwater for the rest of your kiss
>At first you are a bit scared, as she had never tried doing something like this before, but you decide to just go with the flow
>Once the two of you are submerged, you try opening your eyes to see her
>It stings a bit, but it's worth it
>She stares right back at you, with eyes that are unaffected by the water
>Your kiss lasts a lot longer than you ever thought it could underwater
>You feel around her back, making sure to rub her in the direction that wouldn't hurt you
>She seems to enjoy that
>After what seems like hours, you resurface
>You clear the water from your eyes, look right at her, and say "I love you so much, Mako."
>"I love you too"
>You climb back on to her back and start swimming to the beach where you parked your car
>The splashes of water on your body feel good
>Swimming with a beastman like her is an entirely unique experience that very few people will ever get to experience
>Eventually, you arrive back at the shore
>One set of footprints and a curving line in the sand eventually turns into two pairs as she morphs back into her human form for the first time today in front of you
>She's still just as beautiful

>You hop into your car and she gives you directions on how to get to her place as "Midnight Rendezvous" Casiopea plays over the speakers
>You pass by the Beastman Co-op, where Jem and Melissa helped get both of you to safety months ago
>A strange statue was on top of the building next to it
>You should probably head back there one day to thank them again for everything
>After a few blocks, you reach her apartment
>She lived on the third floor, but the elevator wasn't working, so you ended up taking the stairs
>Didn't matter, more time with Mako
>"So, what was that whole thing with Sylvasta that happened a bit ago?" you ask her
>"Oh that, it was really scary," she answered. "There was this pink girl claiming to be Silver Wolf, the guardian of the beastmen, and she was hosting a concert to decrease the stress of the city, but it turns out she was human, which I don't understand how, but then I guess it angered most of the people, then they all got angry and turned big and savage, something called Nirvasyl Syndrome?"
>You reached her apartment
>She releases her hand from yours and begins talking again
>"Anyways, I started running to save my self, but I ended up getting cornered in an alley. I felt like I was going to go savage as well, but then that pink girl from earlier came in was able to get me to safety at the mayor's office."
>Must be that same girl you saw on the billboards earlier, you think
>You step into her apartment and take your shoes off, putting them on the rack in front of the door
>A small hallway greeted you that led into the living room
>The living room was pretty spacious, containing a nice navy blue couch, large tv, and a dining table to the side with a few wooden chairs aligning it
>The kitchen was on the left, bedroom on the right, and the balcony overlooking the city at the very end
>You recognized some furniture and posters from her old house
>"Hey, how'd you manage to get so much of your furniture in here? You didn't sneak out to get them did you??" you worryingly ask
>"A new business started up here that is able to bring over old furniture to beastmen who had to run away without much of their own stuff. Really helped me out there since I was barely able to bring anything of my own with me."
>You gave a small sigh of relief hearing that
>You put your bags on the ground and grab a change of clothes from them
>Don't want to wear an uncomfortable bathing suit for the rest of the day
>As Mako puts her stuff away you go into the other room and change
>When you come back she's not in the living room anymore 
>You assume she's changing in her room, so you proceed to plop down onto the couch
>You turn on the TV, and Impractical Jokers is playing
>Mako then reenters the room, sporting a nice short sleeve floral dress
>She is definitely upstaging you in the fashion department
>Sal is currently the joker up
>Joe grabs the mic and says, "Ok Sal, go up to that wolf and call him a dirty beast nig-"
>You change the channel before he could finish that sentence
>Mako looks at you and says "oh, you could have left that on if you wanted. That doesn't really bother me."
>You turn back the channel, but now it was just playing commercials, so you just turned the TV off instead
>No point in just listening to advertisements
>Mako sits down on the couch next to you, and you lay your head down on her lap
>She begins stroking your hair
>It feels really nice
>The simple things like that make life great
>From the hallway you can hear someone whistling
>"So what do you want to do now?" you ask her. "We still got plenty of time until the concert starts."
>Suddenly, the apartment buzzer goes off

>Unfortunately, Mako forgot to lock the door when you two came in
>Three girls come in
>"Heyyyy Mako, sorry to intrude, but-" the one in the middle begins to say
>Then they see you
>All three of them morph at once
>The one on the left turns into a deer
>She had brown fur, short hair that was a shade darker of brown, and grey eyes
>She wore a white bohemian style tunic dress with hints of red around the neck, sleeves, and bottom
>The one in the middle turns into a frog
>She has light green skin, long red hair, and blue eyes
>She wore a black tank top and white shorts that revealed that not only was she a frog, but a glass frog
>The one on the right turns into a crow
>She has black feathers, medium-length black hair with white accents in a messy updo, and brown eyes
>She wore a white shirt with a rose on it and denim shorts
>All three of them just stared at you
>You were worried that they were scared of humans
>You notice that they were also all sort of blushing
>"Well, I'm glad you can finally meet my friends," Mako cheerfully says. "Well, here we have Fauna, Hiyaku, and Hiromi"
>She points from left to right as she introduces them
>Hiyaku tries to regain her composure, but still stutters a bit as she speaks
>"Hi there. You must be this Mako's b-boyfriend that we've heard so much about"
>Fauna straightens herself up and says "um...Mako, you didn't tell us he would be here today. If we had known we would have-"
>"No, no this is fine," Hiyaku interrupts her. "We would love to get to know him a bit."
>"Sure, go ahead," Mako replies. "We're not too busy at the moment. Make yourself at home."
>You sit up as the three girls gather around and morph back to their human forms
>Hiromi takes the seat next to you on the couch while the other two bring chairs over
>At least they don't seem to hate you
>They begin asking a bit about your life and you answer them
>Hiyaku is the most talkative of the bunch, while Hiromi speaks very little
>"We just wanted to know if Mako wanted to hang out with us," explains Fauna, "but it seems that she's busy at the moment."
>"So, do the two of you have any plans for tonight?" asks Hiyaku
>"We're going to see Tricot perform here in Anima City tonight," you answer
>Hiromi perks her head up
>"Oh, I've always wanted to see them in concert, but I didn't have the money to see them tonight, so I'm not going," Hiromi mentions
>"That's a shame," you tell her
>"Want me to get something back for you?" Mako asks
>"No...you don't have to"
>"I think a t-shirt will be nice"
>You look at the clock and notice the time
>"It's getting kinda late now. We should probably head out to get dinner first," you tell the girls
>"Well, we'll be on our way then," says Hiyaku. "If you need us we'll all be at my place tonight."
>"Bye," you say to all of them
>"See ya later!" Mako says
>The three of them head out single file and Mako closes the door behind them
>When she reenters the living room you ask her a question
>"So when they saw me, how come they all acted the way they did?"
>"Oh, that. Don't tell them I said this, but they all have a thing for humans"
>You give her a weird look
>"They've been dying to meet you, but they had no idea that today would be the day. Guess that caught them off guard"
>"Huh," was all you could manage
>"Well, let's get going then, don't want to be late," she says as she grabs a bag
>You get off of the couch, put your shoes back on, and head back into the heart of the city
>Tonight is going to be a great night

>It's now a bit darker outside as you start walking
>"I know a great place around here that you will love," Mako tells you
>Guess you're following her now
>On the side of the street you see a leopard beastman busking with his bari sax
>He wore a pink suit and danced as he played
>You dropped a couple of dollars into his case on the ground
>As you traverse the city you wonder if anyone thought it was weird that a human and beastman were together
>You remember what the capybara said to you
>"Never underestimate our noses"
>You feel a bit of paranoid that the beastmen surrounding you are weirded out by the two of you holding hands
>However, you take a second look and see that everyone is just going about there day, ignoring you; a stark contrast to how the humans you live by view you as weird for dating a beastman
>The giant towers loom over you as you venture further into the heart of the city
>"Ok, we're here!" Mako excitedly exclaims
>The words "Kumadzuri Sushi" stood above you in red, green, and white neon characters
>Next to name was a glowing cartoon of a bear biting a salmon from a river
>"No one else makes sushi as well as Juoku here," she tells you
>You enter the restaurant and sit at the bar in front of you
>Mako puts her bag down beside the stool
>You wonder what's inside of it
>Behind the counter is a big, burly man with a black bun who you assume to be Juoku
>It's against health code violations to prepare food while morphed except in very specific situations, so you couldn't tell what he was
>"The Kumadzuri family is a family of bear beastmen who have been making sushi for generations," Mako explains. "They previously prepared it in isolation from others due to the conflicts between humans, but ever since Anima City was established they've been working here"
>"That's right," Juoku says, not taking his eyes off of his work. "In fact, this was the first official business to open up in the city. I know my ancestors are smiling at me right now, knowing that our family business would become as big as it is now"
>"Plus, they also don't sell fins, which is nice," Mako adds
>Juoku hands a plate of Ebi Nigiri to the person next to you then turns over to you two
>He briefly sniffs the air
>"You're a human aren't you?" he asks
>Shivers go down your spine
>"Don't be so scared, my friend," he reassures you. "If Mako here brought you in you must be good. Welcome to Anima City. I assume the two of you are dating?"
>"Yes," you tell him
>"I never thought I would see the day that beastmen and humans could put aside their differences in a way like this!" he says as he slams his fist on the counter and tears up a little. "It's beautiful!"
>What a passionate man
>A woman who bared similarities to Juoku poured the two of you a glass of tea then left to attend a different table
>She must be his sister or something, you think
>"So, what can I get you two?" he asks before you know what it is that you want
>You didn't even get a menu yet
>"We'll have the Love Deluxe," Mako answers
>Juoku nods and gets straight to work
>Guess she had this planned out, you think
>You take a sip of the tea given to you
>It was some of the best tea you've ever had
>Before you know it, Juoku hands over a large wooden plate and places it in the middle of you two
>Salmon rolls lined the outside in the shape of a heart surrounded by a heart of edamame
>The inside contained a slab of wasabi in the shape of a heart as well as two rolls you have never seen before
>"What are those in the middle?" you ask Mako
>"It's the restaurant's specialty, known as the True Love Roll. It contains eel tempura, tuna, crab, and topped with roe"
>You grab one with your chopsticks and she does the same
>You tap them together, say "to true love!", then dig in
>A barrage of flavors and sensations cover your taste buds like nothing ever had before
>It was like the edible version of a dopamine rush
>Even the edamame beans taste better than what you are used to
>Before you know it, there's nothing but a plate of edamame shells left
>She was right, no one makes sushi as well as Juoku
>You pay for the meal, even after she insisted on paying for it herself, and you head off in a rush
>Afterall, you don't want to miss the concert

>It's much darker out now
>Good thing you two were holding hands so you wouldn't lose each other
>You always feel a sense of comfort when your fingers are intertwined
>The lamps that don the sides of the roads all illuminate those who walk down these paths
>The leopard from earlier is still jamming out on the sidewalk
>It's only a short walk from Kumadzuri Sushi to the concert venue
>Posters align the nearby buildings showing off Ikkyu, Motifour, Hirohiro, and their special beastman guest as the drummer for the tour: Iwaya the wolf
>A small group of protestors against the human band stood around talking to people
>Hopefully they wouldn't get in the way of your enjoyment
>You always think to yourself that it's just the humans who don't want to get along, but beastmen too, but at least you can see where both sides of the opposition are coming from
>You showed the bouncers your tickets and they let you in
>One of them gave you a bit of a glare as you walked in
>At the entrances to the viewing area were lines of vendors selling food and merchandise
>"Don't forget to buy Hiromi a shirt," you remind Mako
>"Thanks," she replies as she heads over to one of the stalls
>She picks out a black one that had the name Tricot blend into a mountain with a radiating moon in the background
>"That's just her style," she says as she hands the cashier more money than a t-shirt anywhere else would cost
>The two of you walk into the middle of the stadium as Mako puts the shirt in her bag
>Almost everyone that was there was morphed
>You saw sheep, snakes, servals, salamanders
>And those were just the ones that started with the letter "s"
>Many different bird beastmen were getting aerial views of the event
>Avian security guards guarded the air to make sure they all had tickets
>In a place where some people can easily fly, a measure like that is really necessary
>It always amazes you the different kinds of species that inhabit the beastman population
>Mako morphs to fit in with the crowd
>Her grey skin compliments her floral dress very nicely
>You felt a bit out of place being the only one there that looked like a human, but you tried to ignore that feeling
>The stadium was packed, but luckily you were able to get a great view of the stage from around the middle of the floor
>Then, the lights go out
>Fog emerges from the stage as the spotlights engulf it in light
>The crowd is going crazy as Ikkyu, Motifour, Hirohiro, and Iwaya walk onto the stage 
>They all get to their instruments as the crowd continues to shout their lungs out
>You join in on the excitement
>"Alright Anima City, are you ready?!" Ikkyu shouts into the crowd
>The crowd uproars in a loud "yeah!"
>Without any hesitation they start playing "To a City that is Not Dangerous"
>The two guitarists, bassist, and drummer all play their hearts out on stage
>Ikkyu's singing voice is beautiful as it reverberates in your ears
>You look over to Mako to see that she is having just as good of a time as you are
>Any worries you had previously melt away
>During the intermission the two of you go and grab some snacks and a Fire Bull
>Unfortunately, just as they started playing "Good Night", some larger beastmen walk in front of you, blocking your view of the concert
>Mako sees this and instantly knows what to do
>She picks you up with her strength and carries you on her shoulders
>"Oh, you don't have to do this," you try to tell her
>"You know I'll do anything to make our time together as great as possible," she replies
>You stare down at her and say your three favorite words to say to her
>"I love you"
>"I love you too"
>After nearly two hours, they begin their final song on the setlist: "You"
>You feel pretty pooped, even after drinking the tall cup of Fire Bull, but everyone else seems to still have tons of energy left in them
>Guess that's one of the differences between humans and beastmen
>"Thank you fans, and thank you Anima City!" the four of them shout as they bow and then exit the stage
>Nearly two hours of seemingly endless math-rock finally came to an end
>Mako picks you up to bring you back to the ground
>"Are your shoulders okay?" you ask her worryingly
>"I'm perfectly fine," she confidently answers, giving a thumbs up along with it
>You just want to make sure you never hurt her
>The guards try to have everyone leave in an orderly fashion
>Of course, that does not work as well as they thought it would
>Your legs feel like they're about to give out after standing for so long, but you don't say anything to ruin the mood
>However, Mako notices, and lifts you up with her strong arms
>"Well, let's go," she says while cradling you
>While carrying you, she runs home in the moonlight like electricity through a cable
>But, she's not going in the correct direction?

>"Where are you taking me?" you ask her
>"Well, after all that you've done for me, I thought I would treat you to my own surprise," she answered while continuing to run in the dark streets
>She was holding on to you, so there was nothing you could really do other than wait and see what happens next
>She makes a turn and all of a sudden you're on the coast of the city, right next to the beach
>She hops over the fence and puts you down in the sand along with her bag
>"So what are we doing here?" you ask
>Mako just continues to smile as she goes through her bag
>Then, she pulls out her bathing suit as well as one of yours
>So that's why she brought that bag with her
>"Let's go for a night swim," she finally answers
>You have no objection to that, other than how you two would change
>"What if someone sees us changing?" you worriedly ask
>"No one's here, it's fine"
>She pulls off her dress and bra, revealing her lighter colored, toned front, as well as a set of firm breasts
>They seemed fairly average-sized, at least from what you knew about female anatomy
>Not average, however, was the fact that they were gray to match the rest of her beast skin
>"Why are you looking like that?" she asks. "You've seen them before"
>You nod and begin changing yourself
>Eventually, the two of you are both in your bathing suits, ready for your swim beneath the moon
>This time, hers is black with long, lime green accents along the sides in a seemingly random pattern
>Hand in hand, you walk to the water
>Like you did earlier, you hop on her back as she swims to deeper waters
>Good thing you didn't have to do any swimming yourself, you're still too tired to do that
>After about a minute of swimming, she finally stops
>"So, what now?" you ask her
>She grabs into her cleavage and takes out a phone in a waterproof case
>The screen gets tapped a few times before she turns it off and puts it back where it came from
>After a few seconds, "Fly Me to the Moon", sung by Claire Littley, begins playing
>"Let's dance," was all she said before grabbing on to you and pulling you beneath the surface
>You're not all too good at dancing, but hopefully, Mako will make the best out of your limited skills
>You ignore the stinging in your eyes to the best of your ability as you open them
>She grabs your right hand and puts her left around your side
>You copy her, being careful not to cover up her gills
>"Just move with the music," she says, her voice distorted from the water
>Everything else seems to come naturally to you
>You sway and spin to the time of the music
>Your ears are caressed by the music while your eyes behold the sight of the love of your life
>Her eyes gleamed like diamonds
>Her hair floats and ripples around her head like a wave in the ocean
>Her body pressed against yours warmed you up greater than the water could chill you
>The moonlight beams down on you like a spotlight, and normally, the stars would be the dancers
>Tonight, you were those dancers
>You lean in for a kiss, and she complies
>Her sharp teeth feel extra nice against your own mouth
>You can feel her tail rub around your legs as they dangle above the abyss
>You cry tears of joy that dissipate with the water surrounding you
>It's all pure ecstasy
>You never want this moment to end
>It's a good thing you have all week to spend together
>The record for a human holding his breath is about eleven minutes
>You feel like you will squash that record through the sheer love for her
>Her
>Mako Selachi
