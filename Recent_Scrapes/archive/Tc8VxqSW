>you are anon and you may have just made of the worst mistake of your life
>as you drive home you remember how it was that this fate befell you
>you heard one of the local anthro shelters was going bust and was shutting down
>normally you wouldn't consider this any of your business but many of the other shelters they could've sent their anthros to were already overcrowded
>the sad fact being that many of the anthros would have to be put down
>apparently many other people also considered it sad because when you went over there to save an anthro or 2 the place was already crawling with adopters
>of course since you were late to the party all the even mildly interesting anthros had already been adopted
>that still left plenty of cats and dogs still looking for a home tho
>you realized when you were told how much the adoption process cost that it would probably be smart to only adopt one pet
>then the decision only came down to whether to save a cat or a dog
>the fact that both a cat and a dog currently sat in the backseat of your car showed how much of an indecisive faggot you are
>directly behind you sat a very energetic and happy dog girl named coco while opposite of her sat a cat girl named bailey desperately trying to keep her cool
>you were constantly glancing in you rear-view mirror to make sure your poor bailey was okay
>most of her fur was hodgepodge of greys, browns and blacks haphazardly strewn about except for her belly and paws which were a solid creamy white
>she had the face of a kitten with big green cat eyes and a cute button nose and perky alert ears
>her hair was cut short and the same hodgepodge color scheme as her fur
>she had a relaxed demeanor about her, legs spread out, back slouched and her head tilted to watch the scenery outside her window go by
>but you could easily it was all an act by how tightly she held her armrests and how many claw-marks she had put into them from the tiny bumps along the road
>she hardly spoke a word the entire trip
>coco on the other hand couldn't be happier taking a ride in the car and you constantly had to tell her to sit still in her seat
>she was some sort of border collie mix but they weren't sure what she had been mixed with
>her fur was a solid dark brown in the back and a solid white in the front continuing along her underarms and inner thighs
>she had a short muzzle with big droopy ears and big brown puppy dog eyes
>her hair was long, down to her shoulder, and the same dark brown as her back
>she could barely contain her energy, when she was making an attempt to behave she sat with her legs pressed tightly together and her back straight nearly vibrating in her seat
>but when she wasn't she was either trying to hug or lick you around the front seat or sticking her head out the window 
>and always there was the incessant thumping of her wagging tail against the seat and her commentary about the all the sights she was seeing
>you tell yourself the reason you just ruined your finances and threw away 90% of your free time was because saving lives is the right thing to do
>but the truth is that you have an ulterior motive you refuse to admit even to yourself
>as you look over the bodies of your new pets your ulterior motive makes itself known
>with how much coco is bouncing around back there you couldn't help but notice her huge bouncy tits
>all 8 of them
>well the biggest pair were also the highest, you'd say they measured around a D or maybe an E, with each lower pair smaller than the the one above it
>C, B and her lowest being A's just above her crotch
>as your eyes trail there you thank god she kept her legs closed or else you might have a problem on your hands
>you eyes continue down to her thick thighs and back up to her sizable ass
>it's only now you realize how buxom she is
>you look over to baileys breasts and find them much less impressive
>she only has 6 and her top pair are only A's 
>her lower 4 are completely flat against her stomach 
>speaking of her stomach you are impressed by how trim and athletic is 
>as your eyes continue down between her legs you nearly slam on your brakes at what you see there
>but then you realize it's just her tail
>it's a good thing she has her tail between her legs or else you'd be able to see everything since she has them spread wide
>and oh boy her legs are definitely her best feature
>long and luxurious, her legs have just the right amount of tight muscle and fat to make you want to worship every inch of them  
>her ass has the same quality to it, trim and athletic
>you tear your eyes away from them as your problem begins to show itself
>as coco begins to put her arms around the seat again you sigh and say to yourself
"It's gonna be a long drive home."
