>it's 9 pm
>you've been up for 2 days working on learning code to make you very own game
>the game in question not being one many would play of course, since it's a rather niche genre
>that genre being horror erotic games, you wanted to make a game that combined your fetishes into a playable state, and you had to actually learn how to make one, so here you are
>the game's name? Stakeout 
>You are a creature tasked with stalking mens rooms and waiting for them to fall asleep, then to steal their life force via any means "possible"
>sounds like your generic succubus but the twist being you are a horrifying monstrosity that upon first look would send them blasting you back to hell with a 12 gauage
>So you needed to employ stealth to sneak up on them and "drain" them of their energy
>You're almost done with the first section of the game, the closet, the home space for the playable monster, but you really need to sleep, so bad you're starting to see shadows move out of the corner of your eyes
>you know this is the point of no return and decide to save your progress, and lay down in bed, you can't complete your game if you die of sleep deprivation
>To dreams you go, and you have very nice dreams of many monsters giving you smoochs and hugs, to most would seem lunacy, to you a paradise.

In the underworld lay one demon, specializing in terrifying those who wake up by paralyzing them, so much so a "medical disorder" has been attributed to her species to help them cope and not go completely insane, that what they see when they visit is just a hallucination.
But she was very real, and she was very bored.
For them to manifest in the real world somebody had to be deprived of sleep for an extended amount of time, she didn't make the rules, that's just how it was, something about plausible denyability if somebody were to question seeing such a thing above ground.
When suddenly a rift appeared to a man who had been up for 2+ days, and had just woken
>Sunlight breaks through your window as you wake up, it must be early morning, you look over to your PC and see it's 6 am, you got a good 10 hours of sleep it seems
>You think about what you're gonna wear for today and look over to your closet when suddenly your head seems to lock, uh oh
>What the hell's going on? you wonder
>A mist seems to be pouring out of the closet
>Oh god, is the house on fire?
>No this mist is a deep black of some kind, darker then any smoke, and it seems to be moving upwards in an almost body like shape
>The mist stops, and breaks in all directions, as if glass was shattering, and in its place lay what you can only describe as inhuman
>It's figure slim and bipedal, but with no eyes to speak of, but only slim "vents" where the eyes should be
>The nose gone, instead a a small hole placed upon there, almost as if someone ripped their nose right off and that was a botched surgery
>The mouth full of dagger like teeth poking in odd directions, almost as if mocking any sense of conventional design, looking like they were made with the intent to cause pain, instead of processing food for nutrition
> A tongue lay flapped out of said mouth reaching downwards at least a foot, long enough to be a flesh scarf if such a thing was possible.
>You had no idea what was happening, but you felt your life was in danger
Hello there....anon, it seems you've neglected your duty to sleep haven't you?
There's why i come in, i materialize on young boys and men who fail to properly sleep, and am able to significantly weaken their mental state enough to shut down control of their body..
Your kind has dubbed it "Sleep paralysis" and claims what i'm about to do will be a hallucination
But make no mistake anon, it will be very real, and painful
I can read your thoughts, so if you have any last things to say, i will let you say them now
>Searching upon possible things to say, realizing you're moments away from death, you say
"You're what i look for in a woman"
