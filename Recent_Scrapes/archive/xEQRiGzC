>Be Mary, the Maned Wolf
>Its the first day of a new semester at high school, and its a lovely sunny day.
>Recently moved to area, so only know your brothers at the school. They have different class times being a couples grades above you, so they aren't with you right now.
>Walk up towards the school across a well kept lawn, passed various groups of students mixed between anthros and humans.
>The sound of a soccer ball getting kicked distracts you
>YFW something gets between your legs as you're walking, and you falling to the ground, arse over tit.
>Squeek in surprise as you fall.
>Hit the ground, hard. Muzzle feels like it took the brunt of your lanky weight.
>Try not to burst into tears.
"Hey arsehole, whats your problem?!"
>You can't tell if that was the person who tripped you.
>Suddenly hear sound of a soccer ball hitting a surface really hard, immediately accompanied by a males' voice shouting in pain and surprise.
>Start pulling yourself up from the ground, a couple girls who can only be described as nerdy are in a small semi circle ahead of you. They look like they want to help but are glancing behind you.
>Turn around, and see two boys glaring each other down. One has a bloody nose, but he has half a foot in height about half as much extra mass compared to the young man.
"Fuck you Anon, why you gotta ruin my fun?!"
>The jock-ish boy puffs up his chest and looks like he's about to raise a fist.
>Anon-boy gives a shit-eating grin
"Why'd your face have to get in the way of my fun? You should probably go to the nurse with your nose like that, wouldn't want mister jock strap to lose his sex appeal now do we?"
>Jock-boy huffs a little, glancing at the crowd that had formed at down to you.
"Prick"
>Jock-boy walks away, wordlessly commanding his posse to leave with him.
>Anon-boy leans down and offers a hand to you
"Don't worry about him, he barks loud, but his bite is weaker than a chihuahua's"
>Anon-boy smiles warmly
>YFW you think you're in love
