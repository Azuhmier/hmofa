Ursa Major [Bear; Cuddling, Hibernation, Minor Weight Gain (Bear)]: When it's time for hibernation, Anon helps his roommate prepare for her extended slumber.

>You are anon
>Your roommate is a bear
>No, not THAT kind of bear
>An honest-to-god Kodiak brown bear
>Your slightly-more-than-a-friend roommate, Chyanne
>The two of you met early in the year through mutual friends and really hit it off
>You were both looking for a new place, and soon you were signing the lease together
>At first things felt as natural as they could be for a human/anthro pairing
>She may be female, but the species divide kept things from being too complicated, somehow
>You were just an anon and a bear sharing a two-bed place in the city
>Also sharing similar tastes in typical nondescript interests
>After about a month, however, you began noticing just how compatible you two actually are
>You’ve grown accustomed to her earthly scent
>You love the way her fur looks after bathing
>She has the kindest voice in spite of her imposing size
>She’s a damn fine cook as well, always offering you some of whatever she makes
>Needless to say, the girl can definitely put it away
>You’ve tried your hand at making meals to reciprocate, but it’s a lot harder (and expensive) to prepare serving sizes for a bear
>But Chyanne always appreciates the gesture
>And she won’t take your money when you offer it
>Chyanne works for some kind of decoration and design company, focusing on the spring, summer, and fall holidays
>She’s paid well for the incredible effort she puts in, and in turn the company provides decent benefits
>One of them being “Hibernation Leave”
>You see, many anthros possess instincts from their primal heritages
>Bears who live climates with harsh winters or drastic seasonal weather changes often get lethargic around certain times of the year, even if they don’t actually go outside much
>This can be dangerous for bears who work in physically laborious jobs, and so laws were made to ensure job security during their absence
>Think maternity leave, but for hibernating
>To compensate, many bears are extremely hard workers the rest of the year
>Chyanne is definitely no exception
>Still, with autumn already in full swing she seems stressed about something
>Neither of you have ever had to pull the “roommate intervention” card for disputes
>You’ve gotten along together almost perfectly together
>But today, she’s sitting on the oversized, mega-reinforced couch you two share for movie nights
>She pats the empty space beside her for you to sit
>”Anon,” she says, “You’ve been an amazing friend since we moved in, and I feel bad for leaving you alone all winter.”
>Her huge paw reaches over to your lap, and you clutch it with both your hands
>”I have enough paid time off to get an early start to my ‘vacation’ over these next couple of weeks, and I’d like to spend them with you as much as I can.”
>You don’t have a lot of work ahead of you either, and you tell her you can probably call in a few favors to be with her longer
>A brief fantasy passes through you mind of you and Chyanne as your bear wife
>Employers are encouraged by the law to give a non-hibernating employee an ample amount of time off as well, so that they can safely acclimate their partner to a pre-hibernation condition
>You regret not booking your time off sooner, but Chyanne understands
>”You deserve to live your life,” she says. “Besides, I’m going to have to spend a few days just sitting here binging anyway.”
>She’s fairly lean for a bear, likely from her active lifestyle, but there’s still an ursine amount of adipose to her frame already
>She pats her stomach mournfully with her other paw
>”I’m going to get so fat….”
>You give her a reassuring pat
>”There’s one more thing I wanted to tell you,” she continues.
>”I’ve already paid my rent for the whole hibernation, but I also paid yours off as well.”
>Wait, rent-free for the whole winter?
>You tell her she definitely didn’t have to do that
>She just smiles
>”I would feel much safer knowing you’re close by. I don’t want anything to happen where you might leave or get evicted.”
>The two of you embrace in a tight hug
>The softness is heavenly, as is the gentle massage of her claws on your back

>You and Chyanne are all but inseparable the next few weeks
>When you’re available, you’re going out to virtually every fair and festival in the area
>Pretty much wherever there’s a lot of food
>She always has a snack close by, but she never fails to offer a bite
>When you’re not around, she waits for you to return like a lonely pet
>You can almost always find her sitting on the couch chowing down on lunch when you get back, ready to spring to her feet when you open the door
>After about a month, though, she doesn’t really “spring” much anymore
>When she rises from her seat it takes her some momentum to get going
>Her paunch sticks out from under her shirt, making her pull it down constantly
>She already had a weighty pair of breasts, but now they’re almost too mesmerizingly large to ignore
>Apart from a little extra fluff around the neck, though, she fills out rather uniformly and subtle
>Well, subtle until she stops fitting through most doors easily
>For the most part she’s unbothered by the weight
>Obviously she’s gone through this a few times before
>Being around you seems to make her flustered more than anything
>She’s self-conscious about every burp, everything she bumps into, and every broken seam or button
>But you’re always there to cheer her up
>Plus, she’s only looking cuter being puffed up like a teddy bear
>Eventually she slides back to being comfortable with you
>Comfortable enough to bring out her “hibernation clothes” and unpack them out in the open
>Giant sweaters, enormous sweatpants…
>When she gets to the bottom of the box she lets out a soft whine
>”Oh no,” she says, “I forgot I trashed all my old nightgowns. I don’t have anything to wear to sleep.”
>You have some curiosity about why a bear who naps through the winter would care about nighttime apparel
>Then again, you’ve always been told not to poke a sleeping bear
>”I tend to wake up occasionally for some ‘midnight snacks’,” she says with her little round ears folded back
>”I’m usually not too worried about the mess I make, so my stuff is really dirty when the spring comes.”
>You ask if there’s something difficult about buying bear-appropriate nightgowns
>Is it a money thing?
>Is it a supply thing?
>She taps her black nails together sheepishly
>”I just…I’m a little unsure about it,” she says. “I want to spend ALL my time with you, but that means I’d have to drag you through some embarrassing clothes stores.”
>Come on, like your mother never did that to you
>You tell her you’re going to be there for her, and she nearly breaks you in her hug

>There’s a bear-centric department store not far out of the city
>It’s unsurprisingly colossal in size
>Not just in surface area, but even the ceiling seems to have its own atmosphere
>Bears of all types are shopping here, not all of them preparing for hibernation
>Those are the lucky ones
>Or the ones who are hopped up on enough meds to power through their instincts
>Sadly, a few openly mock those who wander over to the heavily advertised “Hibernation Station”
>Chyanne is unfazed by the taunting, instead more concerned about finding the perfect nightgown
>It catches you off guard how much input she wants you to have on the matter
>What colors do you like?
>Does this feel soft enough?
>Is this too revealing?
>She doesn’t wait for an answer for the last one before shoving the slip back on the rack
>When she holds another one up you get a view of just how massive the things are
>One by itself is like a whole bed sheet
>She looks a little guilty for forcing you to come along
>You reassure her again, and offer to pay for one of her nightgowns in sincerity
>”Oh, Anon, I wouldn’t make you do that,” she says, actually laughing about it
>Why not?
>She pinches the price tag with her claws and holds it to your face
>Holy
>Shit
>She just smiles and folds the nightgown over her arm, patting you on the head
>”I appreciate it, though,” she says. “You’re a real gentleman.”
>Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, here
>You’re definitely imagining what she’ll look like in that dainty little number

>Hibernation approaches fast
>Chyanne is already looking more and more tired throughout the day
>She’s also gained an impressive amount of weight
>So much so that when you finally get to see her walk out of her room wearing the rosy pink nightgown she’s practically stretching it out already
>It’s almost the weekend, and she announces the start of her “pre-all-nighter”
>Basically, she wants you to join her in a sleepless sleepover party
>She tries to stave off her fatigue as long as possible, afraid the next time she nods off it’ll be for the winter
>You’re chugging coffees and blasting music right along with her
>It goes on for well over twenty-four hours, and you’re starting to really feel it catch up to you the next midnight
>She lets out a massive yawn and does her best to stand up
>Pulling you with her
>”Anon, I think it’s time,” she says
>She points to the countertop where an envelope sits
>”There’s enough in there to cover our utilities for the winter, but…”
>Her dreamy eyes take an unexpected seductive shape, as she looks into your own
>”We’ll save a lot of money on heat if you turn it down and cuddle up with me.”
>Your body fights over where to send all the blood to; your pounding ears, or someplace down south?
>Is she delirious from the lack of sleep?
>”Anon,” she says in a hushed voice. “I want you to be here with me for at least the first night. It would put me at ease to be close to you.”
>”You can come in and sleep with me whenever you want. Don’t worry about disturbing me when you leave in the morning.”
>She doesn’t have to ask you twice
>You undress down to your own sleepwear and follow her to her room
>You’ve seen it in passing a few times, but unfortunately you see even less of it now
>All electronics are unplugged and all the lamps are shut off save for a small night light that turns on when it senses heavy movement
> Her bed sheets are pulled back and ready for the two of you
>The mattress is remarkably spacious, even holding Chyanne in her full hibernation weight
>She climbs in first, and pats the vacant spot next to her
>You’re the little spoon, obviously
>The night light dims to darkness as she wraps an arm around you
>It’s not the smothering, crushing weight you feared, but an enveloping plushness like the world’s largest pillow
>You can hear her exhale, her heartbeat, and every gentle shift of her body
>Her paw clutches you close to her as though you were her favorite doll
>You can’t help but feel a little aroused by having your head settled into her chest
>She doesn’t fall asleep immediately despite her haggard state, fending off her hibernation for just a little while longer
>You reach behind yourself, trying to touch and stroke as much of her as you can
>She chuckles deeply in her throat
>It’s finally time 
>”Good night, Anon,” she whispers. “See you in the spring.”
>Goodnight, Chyanne

>You sleep much longer than you usually do
>It’s already the afternoon when you wake up
>You would have gotten up sooner, but your first attempt was stopped by a whimper and a tightening hold on you
>She’s deep in sleep, for sure, but that won’t stop her from trying to hold on to you
>You manage to worm your way out of her grasp some time later
>You’re beaming at the beautiful creature and go about the rest of your day
>Every so often you can hear a snore or the sound of creaking springs from her bedroom
>By the time night rolls back around, you’re ready to dive back in
>She doesn’t stir one bit as you lift her arm and drape it back over yourself
>It’s undoubtedly colder with the heat turned down, and the warmth from her body makes you wish you could hibernate with her
>But at the same time be completely awake, so you can savor every moment with her
>There are some nights when you have to sleep in your own bed
>Usually from sickness, or when you need “alone time”
>Still, more often than not you’re slumbering with your roommate, some of the most serene rest you’ve had in your life
>You even put aside your whole day’s schedule just to stay with her a while longer
>After a couple of weeks you’re startled by heavy movement sometime during the morning
>It’s Chyanne, wandering around the place in complete torpor
>She’s basically sleepwalking, raiding the fridge for a hearty snack or sometimes making a run (or rather, a lumber) to the bathroom
>It’s something you’ve heard ancient bears didn’t have to do much during their hibernations, but the evolution of anthros must have downplayed their instincts
>Eventually, you hatch a plan to help her 
>You measure and time her brief moments of “awakeness” and prepare a meal shortly before she enters the kitchen
>It’s a tuna casserole, one of her favorites
>She looks down at the dish in her drowsiness and begins to dig in
>Almost an instant later and she’s licking the dish clean
>But it’s enough to send her back to bed without much mess or destruction of the kitchen
>You keep this up for a few weeks, feeling much less lonely around the place even though she’s practically unconscious most of the time
>After a while, you start to notice some changes
>She’s burning through the stored fat, and you can see a gradual decline in her overall girth
>Her nightgown seems to fit better, but the fit of her body around yours during the cold nights is no less pleasurable

>Spring is on the horizon, and Chyanne’s weight loss is much more apparent
>So much so that her nightgown has become ill fitting even for her
>You’re on the couch one morning when she makes her rounds, and you’re struck with a second round of morning wood
>One of her gown straps had slipped from her shoulder, exposing a plump, pendulous breast
>Her shaggy, overgrown fur is not enough to hide the dark nipple poking out
>It jiggles as she consumes the meal you’ve made for her, catching some of the debris in her pelt as it falls from her mouth
>You’re afraid to approach and fix it for her, but you’re also afraid to be caught staring should she prematurely snap out of her grogginess
>You decide to slide it back on later that night
>Around the same time, you notice changes in her sleepwalking behavior as well
>She has a dreamy smile sometimes, and every so often you think she’s looking in your direction
>Her trips to the bathroom become more frequent, now becoming daily occurrences
>You also have to prepare food more often
>But even then she’s still shedding the pounds
>One morning, you awaken literally on top of Chyanne, splayed out trying to cover as much surface area as you can
>Both her arms are covering you, and they almost seem to be stroking your back
>She lets out a guttural sigh and tightens her hold
>”Mhhhmmm,” she coos
>You lift your head in surprise
>You say her name softly
>”Mhhhmmm…Ahhmmomm,” she moans
>Did she just try to say “Anon”?
>”Mmmaaahhh…Ahmmom…mm-I…hhhuuvvhh yooohhh.”
>It’s slurred and breathy, but the message is clear
>You clench tufts of her fur and nuzzle into her chest
>And you return her confession in earnest

>The day comes at last, and she actually beats you to the buzzer
>A literal one, too
>The girl had a hibernation alarm all set and everything
>But she’s awake even before it goes off
>When it rouses you from your own sleep, she’s ready to greet you with a smile
>”Good morning, sleepyhead.”
>Good morning, Chyanne
>The two of you get dressed and enjoy the company of one another around breakfast
>She’s close to her original size, but a little post-winter chub still remains
>”I’ve got some time left before I have to get back to work,” she says as she pinches the excess adipose, “so I hope we can have some more time together. I really want to get some exercise in.”
>You let her know you think she’s perfect as she is
>”You’re so sweet, Anon, but I’ve been out cold for months now. I’m ready to go out and be active again!”
>She really does hit the ground running, that girl
>But her hibernation is still on her mind
>”I hope I was a good roommate all that time. I didn’t cause you any trouble, did I?”
>Not at all
>”How was I…in bed?” she says coyly
>You tell her she talks in her sleep sometimes
>”Do I?” she giggles. “What kinds of things do I say?”
>You are silent for a bit, and she reads your face like an open book
>”No…did I? Oh, no…”
>She’s a little flustered
>Now a LOT flustered
>”I-I thought that was just a dream…I MEAN…A-anon, I didn’t …”
>You’re nervous of what she’s trying to say, but also disappointed by what she’s trying not to say
>”Anon…I don’t want to complicate things…unless,” she says
>There’s something adorable about a giant brown bear tapping her nails together sheepishly
>”Unless you feel the same way.”
>You tell her you do
>And you’re pulled over the kitchen table into her embrace
>You’re ready to move things forward with Chyanne as you two share a deep kiss
>But some part of you also can’t wait for the next winter
