Chapter 1: Slow and steady
>You are Anon
>Hiking through the woods and to the top of mountains has always been a passion of you
>You love the feel of fresh air in your hair and the sounds of nature in your ears
>Trading the noise of cars for the relaxing chirping of birds is your version of a spa treatment
>You can feel the weight of your backpack, stuffed with rations, water, a survival kit and your tent
>With a big step you arrive on top of the first small hill and look upwards to the mountains just waiting for you
>Of course you don't take this hike alone
>There always is a big group of like-minded people around you
>Together no mountain is to big and no forest to dark
>Normally you would be in the front of the group, pulling them with you, until you arrive at a campground to pitch your tents for the night
>Normally...but not this time
>This time you drew the short straw and have to accompany Grace
>She is a really nice girl, always friendly and with her knowledge about plants a indispensable help
>You stop and turn around to wait for her again
>Grace is currently nearly 200 meters behind you, staring into the valley below
>"Grace, come on. The others are nearly on the campground and we still have to travel nearly 5 Kilometers"
>Her head is slowly starting to turn towards you while she slowly raises a hand with the big claws to wave in your direction
>It takes her nearly a minute to do so and start walking again
>"Yeah.....sorry.......Anon"
>Grace is a sloth
>Literally
>You are not angry at her, she can't change who she is
>You are, however, starting to get frustrated with her
>Why did this girl, that takes nearly twice as long as all other species, choose to take a hike into the mountains ?

2 hours later

>You managed it to travel nearly half the way to the camp when you suddenly get a message on your phone
>There is a thunderstorm alert from the mountain rescue service
>Dammit
>"Hey Grace, we have to camp right here, there is a storm coming"
>You quickly send a text to the rest of your group and look for a suitable place for the tent
>There is a small cavity in the mountainside, only 3 meters in depth
>Not perfect, but there is no way you can place your tent in a way that trees could fall on top of it
>It will also protect you from falling rocks
>With practiced hand you place the tent inside of the cavity and prepare everything for the storm
>At this height in the mountains there is always the danger of a cold snap and sudden snowfall
>Combined with strong winds and lightning it can get dangerous really fast
>You stand in front of your tent and store the canned food inside as the first snowflakes come down
>Danger aside, you really love these situations
>Sitting in your tent, wrapped in a warm blanket while it's snowing outside
>Ahhh....wonderful
>The temperature takes a sudden plunge as the snowfall picks up
>You take a look to the free space in the cavity and nearly get a heart attack as you spot Grace still walking towards you, snow starting to pile on top of her
>You quickly run towards her, grab her arm and drag her into your tent
>As you drag the zipper up and close the flap to your tent there is already nothing but snow outside
>Looks like the two of you will spend a night together in your one-man-tent

End of Chapter 1

Slow and Steady: Chapter 2
>The storm outside the tent has picked up in intensity and is now howling like crazy
>The thin walls are waving back and forth, the coldness is creeping through the zipper
>Besides the fact, that this is one of the worst situations you ever found yourself in you are not upset
>Grace is just finishing her sentence she started three minutes ago about her university and why she choose plant biology as her major
>”And...my...mother...used...to...grow...these...berries...in...our...garden. I...liked...them. They...never...ran...away.”
>You never spend much time with Grace, something you regret now.
>She is very self-aware about her speed and likes to make fun of her slowness
>By now you are even used to her speech pattern
>You check your backpack again and pull out a big pack of instant food, something soja based and self heating
>You pull the little flap on the package and fell how it starts to heat up
>After a few seconds you offer the strips to Grace who slowly bows over
>Soon her long claws, which you now notice are polished, reach into the bag
>Grace is using them almost like chopstick to pull out some strips and slowly starts chewing on them
>”So, your mother was a florist in the city. Sounds nice”
>”It...was. She...sometimes...even...grew...them...on...her...back”
>You look up from the bag and swallow, the soja tastes like strawberries
>Who thought that was a good idea ?
>”Yeah...our...fur...is...so...dense...that...plants...can...grow...in...it”
>”You too ?”
>She is slowly shaking her head
>”No...too...much...work...and...it's....dirty”
>Yeah, thats what you thought
>You take s look at your phone and once again check the weather forecast
>Snow, snow and snow
>”Well Grace, looks like we will be stuck here for some time. How about we turn in for the night ?”
>While she is slowly nodding you prepare the electric thermometer and set the hypothermia alert
>Having two sleeping backs in your tent is a little cramped but it's not as bad as you expected
>With the taste of soja and strawberry and the thought of flowers you drift of to sleep
…...
>A loud beeping is tearing you from your dreams and you immediately notice how cold it is in the tent
>The thermometer is showing – 10°C inside of the tent, a cold wave must have hit you
>You have to prepare for this, without a heat source this will not end well
>Your hand finds Grace and you try to shake her awake
>No effect, she is not responding
>You take a look at her and notice how her body is rigid, her breaths are even slower than normal
>With horror you remember your biology class again, sloths can not shiver, they do not have enough muscle mass for that
>If you don’t act fast Grace could freeze
>You immediately start the small electric heater and set it to maximal temperature before you lift Grace from her bedroll
>She is stiff as a piece of wood
>You stuff her into your own sleeping back and grab every self heating pack you can find
>Your survival instincts take over and before you can stop yourself you stripped down
>Soon Grace clothes are gone too and the both of you are stuffed inside the bedroll, covered in warm instant food
>This is not how you imagined this trip

End of Chapter 2

Chapter 3: Too fast
>You once again run your fingers through Grace fur and try to ignore the warmth spreading through your body
>It started as a simple way to make sure that she is still breathing but now, nearly two hours later, you can't get enough of the softness
>The instant food and your own body were enough to prevent Grace from freezing
>While your thoughts wander your hand does to
>Your fingers close around Grace ass and you give her fluffy cheek a good squeeze
>Seems like your dry spell has effected you more than you thought
>You don't want to be this needy but you simply can't stop
>Fur is running through your fingers as you continue your assault
>Your finger slips closer to her nether region and you can feel how the thick fur makes way for sensitive skin
>Dammit, this is wrong
>You swallow hard and position your fingers again
>The fingertips part her folds and you slowly slip into her
>Wonderful Anon, only 6 months without a female touch and you start raping the first girl you find
>Your fingers slowly circle inside of her, your thumb is searching for her clit
>She is not wet, which means you have to slow down, her insides are wonderful warm
>You find the small marble of concentrated pleasure and give it a small pinch
>While you explore the sleeping sloth you can feel her breast rubbing against your chest, her nipples start to harden
>As you notice this change you withdraw your fingers from her, dragging her outer labia a small distance with you
>The lack of lubrication makes them stick to you
>Grace slowly starts to open her eyes and you place your hands next to your sides
>Her eyes focus on you and the shy smile on your face
>”Hey Grace.....sorry about this but you were kind of hypothermic and I had to warm you up”
>Grace eyes “dart” through the tent, from the thermometer to the warm food all around you
>”Yeahhh....tha..anks.....for....that”
>Her speech is both slower and a little more shaky than normal
>”Well since you are now awake how about we both try to sleep again ? Hehe..”
>You desperately try to cover up your own tension and hope that the sudden change is distracting her enough so that she does not notice your erection
>Anon little is rising directly between Grace legs and does not show any indices for a quick shrinkage
>You quickly close your eyes and mimic sleeping sounds
>Any other living being would not be fooled by this but thanks to the slow nerve system of sloths it works on Grace
>While you concentrate on your breathing to make it sound like you are sleeping Grace is shifting atop of you
>Her claws slide over your belly, down to your hips and scratch your skin
>Soon she has reached your....ohh

Grace POV

>You were torn from your slumber by a strange feeling in your nethers
>You are lying naked on Anon, covered by warm packages of food
>”HeyGracesorryaboutthisbutyouwerekindofhypothermicandIhadtowarmyouup”
>And he is asleep again
>You have no idea how all other species can act this fast
>You let your eyes wander around the tent and over to the thermometer
>This hike really was a mistake
>Not only did you once again slow everyone down and now you nearly froze
>Sometimes you wonder if you should simply stop
>At least you can get a good look at Anon now
>The thought of being stripped by him is really arousing, even though it would be a little to fast for you
>You enjoy the slow and steady peeling away of clothing, while his eyes would wander over your body and...
>What is wrong with you ?
>The burning in your pussy is growing stronger, you have to act
>You slide your hand down your body, your claws slide between your and Anons body
>The heat is unbelievable strong now, your breathing is accelerating
>Before your fingers can reach your burning nethers a sudden jolt of pleasure is running through your body
>Your clit feels like something is pressing down on it, sending pleasure down your spine, directly into your brain
>You try to stop it but can't help yourself
>Squirming and squeaking you orgasm on top of Anon

Anon POV

>Your hold your breath as Grace claws nudge your erection
>This is the end, she found out and is now going to geld you
>Suddenly Grace is starting to squirm on top of you, slowly rolling on top of you
>You open your eyes and stare directly into hers
>Her eyes have rolled back into her skull, her mouth is hanging open
>Warm breaths are hitting your face and something warm starts to flow down your leg
>Grace is holding this position for nearly 3 minutes before she starts to respond to you again
>For a few moments both of you simply stare at each other
>Grace is breaking the silence by screaming a high pitched screech directly in your face

20 minutes later

>”Ohh...god....Anon....slow....down...pleaahahaaaseee”
>You did not touch her for nearly 5 minute now
>Before that however you got a good feel of her body
>Squeezing her ample breasts and rubbing her clit, faster and harder than any sloth ever could
>This is now her fifth climax
>”Anon....stop....thats....the....wrong....holeeeaaaa”
>Wow, she has just reached the start of your anal fingering
>That was ten minutes ago
>The next time you will by some energy drinks for her
