Crash course
>You whined, tucking your legs to your chest.
>Why god? Just why? What did you ever do?
>Jane, your best friend, put you in the worst situation ever. Worse then an entire firing squad.
>She stumbled upon your preference for humans and set you up for a date with some boy…
>Most girls would be excited for such a thing, thankful even… but you…
>This will just end bad.
>You hum though, thinking about it.
>Maybe he’s into Anthro’s? Maybe he likes armadillos? Maybe he plays games and likes movies instead of a run in the park?
>Uncurling and standing up, you turned to your mirror.
>Giving a winning smile, you looked at yourself.
>Black bra holding your DD breasts up, plump and squeezy.~
>Tong, sexy and matching colour. And…
>You turned, smiling still, but faltering.
>A good size and huggable armadillo girl! Not in too bad of shape at all!
>…
>A plump girl!
>You can feel the falter more, sucking your belly in.
>Thicc?
>…
>You looked away form the reflection, whining again and feeling your tail between your legs.
>This is going to be a disaster!
>You hear your phone, looking to your bed.
>Damnit Jane…
>You look at your texts, seeing the messages of encouragement and reminders for the date.
>Sighing, you ball up again, just wanting to get away form the world.
>… Maybe it could be okay, it can’t just to try…
>Come on… it could be as good as those double ninja drops form the last raid.
>Sitting again, you grab the jeans on the ground.
>it can’t be too bad… Jane probably told you what he was getting into!
>YEAH! He probably knows what you are like and look like!
>This won’t be so bad~
>You get your hoddie and go out of your room, going up the stairs.
>Living with your parents at 25 is not bad right?
>You were in school for graphic design and paid rent… kinda.
>No! focus on the date! The date with… with…
>Uhhh…
>UHHH.
>You rip your phone from your pocket as you ride the bus, going back through your texts
>Name… name…
>HA memes.
>FUCK NO. FOCUS.
>Namenamenamename?
>Looking up, you gasp.
>You’re at the mall already? How?
>”Hey.”
>You feel like you went streaking outside after a bath in the middle of winter, turning.
>A human man stands in front of you and… he’s…
>OH GOD HE’S HOT
>He’s shaven… but he must grown a beard like wolverine!
>…Oh shit! He was waiting here for you!
>Fuckfuckfuckfuck.
>”Nora, right?”
>You inhale slightly, squeaking.
“U-uhh, yes? A-and you are… uhh.”
>FUCK.
>He smiles, looking you over
>”Anon. Nice to meet you.”
>… maybe this will be okay?
------------
>Maybe you should visit /diy/ and learn how to tie a noose!
>You pouted, unable to ball up any tighter.
>”NORA! Supper! Pizza with pineapple!”
“Okay mom! Thanks!”
>gowaypls.
>You super fucked up the date.
>You stuttered, you slipped and fell, you hardly gave him any attention….
>Sniffing, you swallow the lump in your throat.
>You just want to die.
>The phone goes off again, making your dread the messages.
>You just want out of here…
>Today is Wednesday…
>Opening up, you peak out, looking to your computer.
>…Maybe a raid will help… for now.
>You reached out, turning on the tower and closing back up.
>Pizza too… mmm~ pineapple.
>Unballing again, you move to the door and go upstairs, getting a plate and pizza.
“Thanks mom.”
>”You’re welcome. You went out today! Did you have fun?
>Shit.
“U-uuhh, yeah, totally. I’m… gonna… yeah.”
>You dart back downstairs, hearing your father and stopping.
>”This girl…”
>”Oh she’s fine. She’s enjoying her time away from school.”
>”Yeah… but she can do a little more outside.”
>Outside sucks though… there are no dragons.
>Going all the way down and sitting at your desk, you smile, opening up the game.
>It’s seconds before you join a bunch on ran-dumbs and get on the god of lies raid.
>You sighed still, the pizza not helping.
>You super fucked up… he was a hot guy too.
>Handsome, offered to pay for food, said he drove for a living.
>Uber is pretty good pay…
>HA, get shirked brawler.
>You smiled at the chat, seeing “Troll ninja.”
>Your smile goes as you get hit with a crit, the squad wiping as they take agro.
>Sighing again, you wait a moment for the healer.
“Come on… just LV3 and…”
>You gasp, seeing the other area with the boss shine brightly.
>LOL
>EPIC FAIL
>sorryguis
>Healer fail
“HE JUST LV3’ED ON THE OTHER PLATFROM! AHHHHH!”
>Fucking Final Fantasy.
>You sighed, grabbing your phone on instinct and flinching.
>…Right, you super fucked up.
>Opening your phone, you read the messages… what?
>’Good going girl! He loves you!’
>you look at the sent picture, seeing that Anon wrote to Jane about you.
>’Yeah, super shy… but she’s cute, good looking. Maybe once I get past her skittish attitude, she’ll open up more.’
>…
>AGUYLIKESYOU!
>You ball up, squeeing as you fall out of the chair and roll a little bit.
>Texting Jane, you grin as you ask what to do.
>’Don’t worry, he wants to hand out again. He also said he want’s so show something off to you before you two go out for a late night!’
>You cover your face, smiling.
>He wants a second date! He must like you!
>Maybe he will kiss you!
>You never got a kiss before… or a second date…
>AND HE’S A HUMAN!
>You had a hotspot for humans… anthros were… ew.
>Dogs, cats… just ew. Some were hot, but not your kind of thing… Their dicks were even worse.
>Humans were just nice and smooth, no bad things to annoy or hurt in the moment.
>…You were a /bred/ addict… and with good reason.
>… maybe Anon has a smooth chest?
>Maybe one with hair?~
>looking at your phone again, you see more messages.
>You smile, saying yes to Jane giving your number to him.
>…Oh god, what if her really likes you? Like, wants to have sex?
>no, no… oh god, he might…
>He might look and see that you’re not so good under the clothes…
>No! happy things! Guys wants a second date! You are having fun raiding!
>Looking up, you growl, seeing you lost connection for inactivity.
----------
>You couldn’t help but beam, being dropped off at the college by the bus.
>Okay, maybe you were also scared shitless to even text Anon whenever you looked at a message from him, but still!
>Things were looking better! And not one thing could bring you down!
>You rounded the corner to your locker your smile plummeting into an open mouth gasp of shock.
>Your locker is… oh no.
OH NO! NONONONONNONO!
>You ripped at the papers, seeing what they said.
>Human fucker, Breed bitch freak, mega- oh no fuck that one.
>You tore it all down, even the pictures of you and…
>HOW? HOW DID THESE GET HERE?!
>A too good for the world laugh fills the air before you get shoved into the steel locker, dropping everything and your books.
>”Oops, sorry ya freak.”
>You grunt, feeling a lump in your throat as you look up.
>The black mare flashes a knowing grin, tail flicking you in the face before she walks away.
>You want to scream at Ashley… but…
>You whine instead, crumpling up before a pair of shoes are at your side.
>Looking up, Jane is there, the lioness frowning as she helps you up.
>”You okay? I tried to stop her, but…
“…This is supposed to be college, not highschool…”
>”We both know Ashley is just a bitch, through and through. I’m sorry, you know that she’s got those knuckles, and even then…”
>You nodded, feeling queasy at the thought of the two horses, Ashley and Tom.
>Lovers through and through, ready to break noses and push people around at any moment.
>How either of them were not kicked out of here was beyond you, save for the fact that the odds are that the fight happens outside of the campus.
“H-how did she?”
>”She spotted you in public, told me everything when I tried to confront her.”
>You nod, frowning and wanting to cry.
>”Hey, girl… it’s okay.”
>Jane smiles, patting your head.
>”Anon’s wanting to talk again, he said he was right about breaking through that shell of yours.”
>You smile, nodding.
“Yeah… thank you again… it’s just so…”
>Stressfullembarasssingamazingstupidawsomefu-
>”There ya go. Just think, your next date will be great! Tomorrow, right?~”
>You smile more, face burning slightly.
>”Come on Nora, let’s get going. Fuck Ashley.”
>Yeah, fuckin’ bitch.
>School thankfully goes so quickly that you barely think of any of it, getting off the bus and getting home
>Opening the door, immediately you get called out.
>”Nora!”
>You tense up, peeking around the corner.
>You took all the dished from your room back up… didn’t leave any downloads running… sure as hell knew your mother wouldn’t find any of your… “items”.
“Y-yes?”
>Your mother smiles, waving as she cooks.
>”No trouble! Quit looking so nervous! We are going on a little fun trip tomorrow, so I figure I could get a notice in.~”
>Your heart plummets, your mother’s expression changing with yours.
>”Nora…”
“I… u-um… had some plans with friends….”
>Your mother sighs, nodding.
>”You are an adult now… but remember, your father’s birthday tomorrow would be a good way to get him to ease up on you. We are going on a little fun outing to watch a race.”
>You groan, smacking your head.
>You forgot… again…
>Not that you really cared… but your father was odd… every time you joined in on outside stuff of family thing he got less… wordy with the things you liked.
>It’s not exactly fair that you can’t say anything back whenever he sees you and sighs, complaining about you playing games…
“Okay…”
>Your mother smiles, nodding.
>”I’m sorry, Nora.”
“It’s fine…”
>No.
>It’s not.
>You sigh, listening to your mother talk about the event before going to your room and closing the door.
>You growled, throwing your books before flopping on the bed.
>Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
>You whine… getting things together and texting Anon.
>Damn it all…
>You swap messages, booting up your computer as you explain and answer things to him.
>The next message puzzles you, making you hum.
“Go to the race… this works out perfectly… what?”
>Works out perfectly…
>Oh! Maybe he looked up the event and lives close! He cold get you from the race!
>Typing up “okay”, you pause before you press send, biting your lip and humming.
>but… your parents…
>You gasp as you accidently press send, your fate sealed.
>tensing up, you groan, hanging over your bed.
>Fuck your life sometimes…
----------
>You hummed, looking at the gathering crowds.
>School was done in a flash leaving you to join your mother and father at this race…
>A rally apparently, off-road-ish racing…
>So…. Boring RocketLeague where cars go around a few times instead of playing soccer.
>…Okay… it was kind of cool… just not you.
>You could hear engines revving, your father smiling.
>He had an odd obsession with cars, even more with racing.
>You honestly just don’t get it.
>All of you had arrived early, getting food and seated way before anything started.
>Your mother just humored your father, mostly, as he blabbered about cars.
>Not that you care, it’s just noise to you.
>…You know what? This isn’t so bad. The air is nice, the food is good, and it’s kinda fun to watch the cars once they get going.
>”Ohhhh.~ Hey there, Nora! Fancy meeting you here!”
>And ruined…
>You winced, looking up to see Ashley.
>The mare grineed, patting you on the head.
>”Oh, is that one of your friends?”
“n-“
>”Oh yeah! Damn near besties! Pardon the language, just a habit. Right, Friendo?”
>She punches you, pretty hard, making you nod.
>”U-uhhh yeah.”
>Ashley sits right next to you, sneering our of your parents view.
>”Human fucking cunt.” She whispers.
>God damnit…
>You turn away, just trying to focus on the cars.
>Thankfully, she leaves you alone, her boyfriend coming along and the two of them getting close.
>HOW the hell does no one notice his hands in her pants?
>…Damnit… why can’t that be you?
>Maybe Anon would… Ohhh.~
>You can feel your face heat up, smiling at the thought.
>You’d almost want him to do bad things to you, even if a little forcefully...
>”GO!”
>You jump, watching the cars take off and leave dirt in the air.
>Looking to the screen, you watch, smiling.
>”Comeon 85! You sexy beast! Win!” Ashley yells.
>You watch the giant screen, listening to the cheers and boos.
>Ashley aside… whit is kinda fun. Not super fun, but fun!
>And better yet! Anon still is somewhere.~
>What is he doing right now?
>You wander and ponder, thinking of Anon and only pausing when you feel a certain moistness and fire in your legs.
>You are so dirty… guy you just met and you can’t help but think of how you want him to do anything to you.
>It would be so amazing though, like a doujin~
>…God, you need to bust out the dildo again.
>”GOoooo!”
>”Come on!”
>You look up, seeing the cars in the home stretch.
>One tears through, well ahead of the rest.
>”YES!” Ashley yells.
>You flinch back, watching her jump up ad down.
>The car spins in victory, doing dohnuts before the driver gets out, waving with his helmet on.
>He dashes to another man, the other man turning.
>”Our winner is asking someone in seat 85-B to come on down!”
>Oh, cool.
>”OH god damnit!”
>You look, seing Ashly scowl as she looks as her seat.
>86-B…
>Oh fuck!
>You look to your seat, seeing 85-B.
>It’s you!?
>”Go on, sweetie!”
>You look around, seeing the crowd all look at you and cheer.
>It’s super odd, all the others clearing a path for you to make your way to the field.
>Sure enough, you get there and approach the announcer, seeing the driver next to him.
“U-uh. Hey?”
>The announcer looks to the driver, smiling.
>The driver rips his helmet off, reavealing..!
“Anon?!”
>”Hey there Nora.~ surprise.”
>He grabs you, pulling you into a kiss.
>You freeze up, eyes wide.
>First: why? Second:
>OHMUHGAWDHEIKISSINYOUTHISISLIKETHETIMEINUYASHAANDKIGO-
>You can hear the crowd cheer as you close your eyes, feeling like fireworks are going off or something.
>Anon breaks the kiss, turning and waving at the crowd.
>”I know it’s super sudden and a little much… but you’re surprised, right? Wave!”
>You look around, seeing yourself on the screen and waving with a smile.
>This is so embarrassing… you are too fat for this…
>Why can’t you stop smiling?
>You look around, at the cars, the crowd, the screen.
>You spot a zoom in of the crowd, catching your parents and their shock.
>”Lucky girl!~ your own little trophy?”
>”Jusy maybe!”Anon says into the microphone.
>You catch Ashley, the mare scowling angrly.
>Best. Day. Ever. …of all time.
