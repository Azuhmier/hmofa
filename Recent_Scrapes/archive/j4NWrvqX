by Teether

>you sit alone at a bench on the edge high school playground
>Everyone else is broken off into their various cliques, all playing with the newest toys and games
>But you.....your all alone
>You never really fit in with any of the other classmates
>An outcast...an poor to boot
>Suddenly you feel a sharp, weighty, object slam you in the back of the head
>You drop forward off the bench, your fingers brushing through your wet hair
>You bring your fingers in front of your face
>Blood
>Lots of it
>You pick up a small, blood stained, chunk of concrete from the playground mulch infront of you
"Ok? Who-" you say stammering to your feet as you turn around
>Its the biggest bully in Big Town
>Syd the rhino
>face like a slab of quarry granite and muscles of a bodybuilder
>Its almost like he was born to bulley
>"Hey faggot, where's my usual cut? D'you forget our little agreement? You leave your lunch money on your desk after sixth period and I don't cave your little monkey face in" said Syd while cracking his boulder-like knuckles
>Your vision wavers a bit as you feel a warm trickle on the back of your neck
>"You g'nnah answer me or am I g'nnah hav'tah break it out of y'ah" said Syd taking a couple steps closer to you
"I-i d-don't have the money" you say in a wavery voice, your fist clenching around the bloody piece of concrete
>"Whatt was that little B?" said Syd leaning towards you and cupping his ear mockingly
"I-i said I don't have it, m-my mom said that she'd have to skip th-" you quiver before Syd picks you up by the front of your t-shirt and slams you full force onto the mulch
>"Well little B, thats not g'nna cut it. Now I'll ask again. Where's my money?" said Syd before placing a giant foot on your chest
>You could feel all the air being crushed from your lungs as you let out a couple whiny sputters
>The image of Syd ugly grey mug wavers from your blackening sight
>You feel a rush of air and two loud, heavy, thumps as Syd's weight leaves your chest
>You prop yourself up as you gasp for air
>You look over to see a hyena girl in ratty clothing on top of Syd, now laying on his back
>The hyena girl has Syd's arms pinned to the ground while she snaps her jaws in his face, "Fuck off Syd! Leave the skin alone!"
>*"skin?" you think running a hand over your arm as you get to your feet
>Syd quickly throws the hyena off of him and gets to his feet, "Fuck off Kyrah, this is between men"
>Kyrah recovers on her feet, fists clenched in front, "No, your shaking down the skins again for easy lunch money. Go take y'er show somewhere else and fuck off"
>Syd glared silently for a couple seconds before lunging at Kyrah
>In a snap of the moment, you throw the piece of bloody concrete as hard as you can at the side of Syd's head
>It makes contact, stammering Syd to the side just in time to come full face to Kyrah's fist
>An audible crunch could be heard as Syd plowed backwards onto his ass
>You run over to Kyrah and ask if she's ok
>"Yeah skins I am fine, just got a little spit on my hand" said Kyrah brushing her hands
>Syd spits out a wad of blood and a couple teeth before getting to his feet
>Side by side you and Kyrah put your fists out, ready for the behemoth to come charging again
>Instead Syd turns around and mumbles, "faggot" under his breath as he walks away
>You both put your fists down as the adrenaline dies
"Whelp....guess I got quite the ass-whoopin ahead of me tomorrow when that talking rock comes back for a little revenge....thanks though" you say to Kyrah as she straightens her jacket collar
>"He's not gonna bother any of you skins anymore. I've seen how the teachers treat the handful of you we got at this school. Letting bullys off the hook, it makes me sick" said Kyrah looking down at you
>You feel a slight flutter in your throat, "R-really, like you mean it?"
>Kyrah nods, "Yup. I keep my word, even to skins"
"So....Are you going to create so sort of "skin-protection squad" or something like that?"
>Kyrah lets out a nerve shattering yeen laugh as you stand unsure of what will happen next
>"You, know hehehe, that's not such a bad idea." says Kyrah through a couple of yeen giggles
"What? You mean for real?"
>"Yeah! No seriously, It'll give me something to do and a reason to pummel Syd's fat ass somemore. So...What'dah say? Wanna be my first recruit to Big Town's 'Skins-Protection Squad'?"
"B-but, Iam no fighter....I don't even know how to keep myself from getting beaten, less dole out some beatings" you say looking down into your scrawny hands
>You see two large paws gently grab them
>You look up into Kyrah's dirt-smudged and beautifully disheleved, furry face
>"Look, my mah was in the military and she taught me everything I know about self-defense. You could come over to my house and I could teach you" said Kyrah with an overly eager face
>Your hearts racing a million miles a second and you feel the warmth of blood rush to your face
"Y-yeah that would be great, I-I'd love to" you spill out as the butterflies grow restless in the pit of your gut
>"Really!? I mean, you'd be the first person I've had over in like...in like forever. Just lemme tell my mah and we can start your first lesson after school" said Kyrah, her smile completely exposing two giant rows of sharp teeth
>Everything is going so fast that you only manage out a couple of accepting grunts
>Kyrah forces a slip of paper with her name and number into your hand before giving you a couple, hearty, pats on the back
>"Got all that? Good! I'll see you at six" said Kyrah waving good bye to you as the bell for the next class period rang
>You wave her goodbye as you look down into the note in your hand
*"This was written before her fight with Syd"
*"........"
*"Did I just get asked on a date?..."
>A large smile crosses your face as you kiss the note, Kyrah's scent purposely swabbed all over the piece of scrap paper
>You fold it up and place in your breast pocket, safe and close to your heart as you slowly walk off to your next set of classes
