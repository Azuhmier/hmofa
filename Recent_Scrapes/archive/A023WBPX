>anon had his heartbroken by his hummie girlfriend
>his anthro childhood friend, Sarah, invites him over to talk about it
>at her apartment he lets everything out
>the lying, the manipulation, the cheating
>and how she had an excuse to blame him for all of her behavior
>he was going to propose
>how could he be so stupid?
>the wolf girls white fur absorbed his tears
>she always knew human males were sensitive and needed protection
>she decided to go and get them some take-out so they could stay in and talk some more
>he thanked her as she promised to be right back
>unbeknownst to both of them her sister and roommate had been waiting for such a moment
>she came into the living room
>"heard about the break up, so you're unattached now huh?" 
>anon was uneasy, Rebecca, the black furred wolf always seemed indifferent to him in the past
>now she was leering down at him with her yellow eyes from the end of the couch
>she crawled over the armrest and shoved him on his back
>"I assumed Sarah would take you in time."
>she put one strong paw on his shoulder and pulled at his shirt
>"but she's too romantic. I'm going to have to claim you like she should have years ago."
>"no no no" anon whispered softly as his shirt was ripped away
>beginning at his naval she took a long lick up his body covering his face with her tongue
>"you taste better than I thought you would"
>a claw stroked his tear soaked cheek 
>he couldn't handle anymore and tried to roll out from under her
>weirdly, she let him up, but as he went for the door her foot reached out to trip him
>she practically pounced on the human
>"such easy prey, you can't even run five steps" 
>with a knee in his back and a paw holding his head down she started to rip off his pants
>"please don't" he pleaded, his voice surprisingly hoarse from the crying earlier
>she rolled him over and his erection flopped into view
>"see I knew you wanted this. that's what every hummie wants, right?"
>he shook his head
>"yeah, you want to be taken by an alpha bitch like me"
>"you don't want to wait around for anthros like my sister to make a move."
>she stood up, her one foot on his chest enough to hold him down
>anon struggled but all he succeeded in doing was lightly scratching himself with her claws
>she pulled her sundress over her head and threw it aside
>her delicate panties were literally ripped away in a gratuitous display of strength
>her pussy was dripping and as hungry as the look on her face
>she practically fell onto anons dick
>the pain from her full weight pressing him down made him remember his voice
>he tried to yell for help but a powerful paw covered his mouth
>"shut up and fuck me" she commanded as she roughly slammed herself into him over and over
>he couldn't breath and weakly struggled to move her arm away
>instead she grabbed one of his arms and twisted it above his head
>she was so strong, his wrist was bruising, and his face hurt from her grip
>he could do nothing but lay there and cry as she did whatever she wanted
>soon she clamped down on him like a vice and shuddered
>a low howl came out of her as she orgasmed
>she looked down "you didn't come" she said accusingly
>"we're not done here til you mark me, so get with the program"
>anon closed his eyes, unsure of how much more he could endure
>they both looked up as the front door unlocked
>Sarah walked in with some plastic bags of food
>it took her a moment to process the scene on the floor
>she dropped the take-out and rushed the pair growling at her sister
>anon felt some relief as his rapist stood to confront her
>"calm down" Rebecca said casually "he didn't mark me yet"
>"YET?" yelled Sarah in outrage
>Sarah rarely won scraps with her sister when they were pups
>but Sarah had never been this mad before
>still her sister dodged her wild swipes as she talked
>"yeah. yet. so he can mark you first if you want"
>"what" Sarah said throwing her ears back in shock at the suggestion
>"how many more dumb relationships are you going to let him have before you take him?" Rebecca asked
>Anon's thrill at seeing his friend began to wane as she looked down at him
>he had seen that look from other anthros before, but never Sarah
>"I don't know why, but you care about this one"
>"you can protect him from himself if you mark him" 
>Rebecca's words were like honey in Sarah's ear. 
>"I couldn't..." Sarah said her anger suddenly disarmed by her secret desire heard out loud
>"You can take him and we can share. You know, whenever I need to relieve my heat"
>anon had sat up as the two wolves talked over him
>Sarah leaned down to comfort him
>Anon reflexively pulled away from her touch
>he felt vulnerable in his nakedness and pain
>"I need to leave" was all he could think to say, unable to hold his tears back
>"No" Sarah said stroking his head and gently shushing him
>she stood up, bringing him to a standing position with her
>she pulled him into a hug, though he recoiled from it at first before surrendering
>"you don't need to leave" she said softly to calm him
>"you're right where you need to be"
>Rebecca had already opened up the take-out to dig in
>she watched as her sister pulled the human down the hall to her bedroom
>he seemed to know what was coming and was now trying to pull away from her
>anon's weak protests were punctuated by new sobs
>the last thing she heard before the door closing was her sister telling him
>"this is for your own good"

>Sarah closed the door behind her
>Anon sat on the bed rubbing his sore wrist
>his friend loomed over him as he feared the worst
>"I'm not going to take you against your will" she said softly
>Anon let out a sob of relief
>"I just had to get you away from Rebecca."
>"I don't think I can fight her off"
>"But she won't take you if she thinks I will."
>he had no response for her
>"Can I... Is it alright if I sit next to you?"
>Anon nodded wordlessly
>Sarah rubbed his back and tried to comfort him
>"Why?" was all Anon could ask after a while
>"I think it's my fault" Sarah said
>"I told her how I've wanted us to be more than friends"
>"She insisted I just.. Well she wanted me to be more forward"
>"She thought she was helping I guess"
>Anon held up his bruised wrist
>"Does this look like help?"
>"I thought she was going to kill me..."
>Sarah was aghast "Rebecca would never do that..."
>"taking a mate is just different for us than humans..."
>"she doesn't understand humans like I do"
>Anon shook his head "I just want to go home"
>"you can't" Sarah sighed
>"If you try to leave without a mark on you, shes going to start again"
>Anon finally raised his voice "then call the police so I can leave"
>Sarah tried rubbing his head to calm him down but he pulled away
>"Anthro police won't do much about a domestic dispute"
>"You came here voluntarily and you are unmarked... it's... it's complicated"
>Anon finally looked at her "So we just wait here and then pretend nothing happened?"
>Sarah shrugged "I can't stop you doing anything once you leave"
>"But you probably can't come back, once shes got her mind set to something, well you know"
>Anon looked at her disgusted
>"So we cant be friends now because your sister is a predator?"
>He hung his head "first my girlfriend, now I'm loosing my best friend?"
>Sarah couldn't help herself, she had to leap at the chance
>"You could... trade one for the other..." she said meekly
>Anon just stared at her
>"You can't be suggesting that I just become your boyfriend?"
>"Like she wanted. Like you wanted this whole time!?"
>Sarah stood up and anon scrambled away from her
>"I really like you, no, I love you" she said
>Anon stopped backing away
>"You can't be serious, we're just friends"
>Sarah uncharacteristically asserted herself
>"I don't want to just be friends"
>"and after tonight we're either not friends anymore or we're something else"
>"I hate that my sister forced this. But that's all we're left with"
>Anon felt like he was at an emotional breaking point for the third time that night
>"Can we just lie down?"
>"I just need quiet and time to think"
>Sarah's tail fluttered "Yeah sure, lets just lay down here"
>She wrapped Anon up in her arms and pulled him to her
>Sarah must have been very contented to have Anon so close
>because soon she was asleep
>Anon carefully lifted her arm
>he approached the door as quietly as possible
>his heart was pounding in his ears but he heard nothing outside
>he just had to get to the living room to grab his clothes and phone
>then out the front door and down the hall to the stairwell
>get dressed, call a cab, just run
>he played his plan in his head over and over
>he hesitantly opened the door
>across the hall stood Rebecca in the door frame of her room
>"Going somewhere?" she said sniffing the air heavily
>"Not like that you aren't..."
>she smiled wickedly "I'll give you a sporting chance..."
>"If you can make it to the front door before I get my claws on you, then you're free to go"
>Anon looked at her gold eyes, his vision already blurring from fear induced tears
>he broke away from her stare and began to close the door
>"That's what I fucking thought" Rebecca said with derisive laugh
>the sound of the door shutting caused Sarah to stir
>Anon went to her side and gently woke her
>"Anon?" she asked sleepily "Oh, how long did I sleep for?"
>"Just a few minutes" he said
>"I thought about it and I want to give this a try"
>Sarah suddenly woke up at that
>"You mean, give 'us' a try?"
>"Yes" said Anon seeing no other way out of his situation
>Sarah jumped up to him and held him tight, her tail wagging wildly
>"I know this isn't how either of us wanted this to happen..."
>"So I won't say I'm glad, I just hope you can forgive me..."
>"And I'll do everything I can to make it up to you"
>Sarah removed her clothes and invited Anon to the bed
>Anon, despite himself, couldn't help but feel attracted to his friend
>as conflicted as he was currently, he had always seen her as beautiful
>such that her lack of boyfriends never made sense to him, until tonight
>Sarah licked at his face and gently embraced him
>she smelled so good and her fur was so soft
>his body had the natural response
>she laid onto her back
>as much as she wanted to mount him she held back
>she knew he was in far too delicate a state to overwhelm him like that
>Anon climbed onto her and entered her
>he was getting flashbacks to earlier as he tried to please her
>the smell and feel of wolf fur, the sound of her panting, her pads on his arms
>it was all too much and he collapsed on her
>Sarah was too excited to let him stop
>her normally empathetic self was giving into lust and her long unfulfilled desire for Anon
>she rolled over him and started gyrating her hips
>"Don't worry Anon, I'll take care of you" she said
>"here" she said taking his hands into hers and placing them on her tits
>"I'm not her, I love you Anon. I want you to love me too"
>she leaned down and licked his face
>her voice was helping Anon come back to the moment
>he moved his hand to her hips and began to participate
>that was more than enough to get Sarah panting
>"Please, Anon, please mark me, for us..."
>her sweet voice was enough for Anon to let go
>as he filled Sarah up she came as well
>that warmth spread through her and filled her lungs with a howl
>she wrapped her legs around him as she rolled to her side
>she milked Anon for every last drop and licked his face happily
>Anon, exhausted as he was, fell asleep immediately
>Sarah couldn't help but be pleased as she twirled his hair and stared at his sleeping face.
