>Get violently pulled out of the nightmare that is cryo-sleep

>have people you cant even see or hear properly yet ,thanks to the ice crystals,frost and cocktail of cryogenic chems your body has currently been marinating in for god knows how long, asking a dozen things in some bizarre language

>one of them seems to grasp the fact that you cant percieve a damn thing and waves their hand in front your eyes, one of them reaches 
over and snaps their fingers next to your ear

>you cant hear it, you only hear the throbbing in your brain

>The one snapping its figners gets pulled away by the other, retreating outside your field of view to the other side of the room


>you begin clenching up, the post-cryo calm is wearing off
>being ejected from cryo was at first like you hadnt woke up at all, your brain hadnt barely turned on enough to let you do more than breathe and think

>once that wore off though, oh boy

>it starts with shivering, shallow breathing before proceeding quickly to spasming and a sensation of burning

>without the right drugs, pullling someone out of cryo too quick is like dunking a guy in a frozen lake then setting him on fire.

>the people come back into view and seem to panic, oddly proportioned shapes flailing around and shouting

>you however are doubling clutching at yourself with gaunt, frosted hands

>it hurts

>the people are really starting to panic now

>one of the shouts something in that incomprehensible gibber

>the other replies panicked and stammering

>then something thrusts forward and grabs at you, shrinking back immediately as it touches you before boldly pushing forward and wrapping its arms around you

>you feel yourself lift up and bobbing up and down slightly as whoever grabbed you is running, somewhere.

>you were rapildy progressing to stage 3 cryo-sickness, extreme hypothermia

>your already dim vision was clouding, darkening

>But then whatever was holding you lets you go, dropping you like a sack of bricks down

>your vision snaps clearer as soon as you make contact with what it dropped you into

>the sensation is immediate and banishing of the cold, Warmth.

>like the cold before it its everywhere and coiling around you, melting away the ice and purging the frost, searing away the cold that clung to every part of you.

>you sink into the heat, staring up at 2 dark shapes staring down at you through a window of flickering lights and wispy motes of warmth

>you hit the bottom, the heat easing all aches and pains

>then as suddenly as you awoke before your eyes widen and the andrenaline kicks in

>You burst through the surface of the water

>Your lungs are burning as you guzzzle down as much air as your lungs can fit

>The lights are searingly bright and leave spots across your vision

>you push against the side of the pool, bath or tub, whatever you were in, clawing for the rim

>something from behind you grabs you and pulls you against the edge, keeping you from sinking back down

>where there was once nothing but cold and quiet theres now a flood of sensation. heat,light,sound, pressure and memory all rushing through you

>your head tilts back against something or rather, someone, staring up exhaustedly into a pair of emerald pools, looking down into you with concern

>you think its saying something

>its a person, you reach up and touch it

>its soft

>your hand moves across whatever the person is wearing, its soft and warm

>they stammer something and another person comes into view, grabbing your hand, moving it away from the soft,warm thing

>whoever grabbed you was soft too, smooth hands that gripped yours lightly

>the rush of sensation couple with the nightmare of waking is too much and you pass out, these two people who awoke you still holding you

>....

>you awake eyes bleary and foggy, limbs throbbing and head swimming.you're staring up again, at another plain ceiling, this one however was a much more pleasent shade of dull green rather than dull grey

>a tiny series of beeps draws your attention, unwilling and probably unable to move you neck much, you sideeye the source of the noise

>its a small monitory affixed to the wall, a green line peaking before sharply dipping then peaking again a few moments later, the beeping coming each time the line rises

>you look away from the monitor around the room, the room is sparse save for the monitor yourself, the bed you're on and an empty chair in the corner

>everything is slightly clearer now, the lights and sounds of the room arent an imperceptible mist like they were before

>everything still aches fiercly though, a dull persistent pain across your entire body

>if you were more alert you would of flinched when a face came into view

>a face was generous a description

>whoever they were, they were unfortunately, very ugly

>wide nostrils, scraggly hair framing patchy grey-brown skin

>dull yellow eyes framed by a pair of spectacles gave you a concerned look, a pair of fingers gently rest on your face, pulling one of your eyes open further to shine a small light in

>they give you another look, a toothy smile revealing far too much of their gums burts onto their face, they beam down at you for a moment before moving out of view

>sometime later that same ugly doctor or nurse comes back in with another person

>the two come into view, the new person grips your face lightly, shining that light into your eye again

>their fingers are oddly soft, fuzzy even

>the light flicks off and the new person leans down

>hallucinations werent part of cryo-sickness you remembered that much at least

>so what the hell was going on

>the doctor, you presume, had a very hairy face,furry even.

>pink nose, slit-pupiled eyes, two pointy ears poking up and out. it was a cat. some kind at the >very least, but off somehow, it simultaneously looked like every cat you knew and none of them, if you can trust your refridgerate memory that is

>the cat-doctor said something to you softly and slowly, golden eyes staring into your own

>you dont say anything, nothing really works right, not even your mind apparently

>the doctor says it again slower, you dont reply, agauin. she frowns and rises back up, speaking to the ugly nurse

>you can hear the words but with everything the way it is you cant make it out. they sound distant and warped
