>Charlie never really had a normal childhood
>from age 6 he was taken from his abusive household and put into foster care
>He moved from family to family
>Sometimes the families were human, other times they were Anthros
>He typically stayed with human families longer than the anthro ones, possibly due to tension between the races
>except for one place
>For some time during his late teens, Charlie lived with an aristocratic vixen whom took a keen liking to the human child
>He would go on remembering those times as the best in his childhood

>It was late October when the fox walked in to the foster center to apply for an adoption
>Charlie didn't pay any mind, believing she was there for one of the other foxes
>But he was soon disproved when the caretaker introduced Charlie is new mom, the fox
>"Charlie I'd like you to meet... erm, what was it you said your name was?"
>"Ms. Rostinna Golver Concordia."
>Concordia was about 5 feet tall. She looked like she's a winter fox. She's wearing a dark grey, tight fitting dress accompanied by equally grey high heels and hat 
>"Right. Well Charlie, Ms. Concordia has filed the paper for your adoption. So say hello to your new mom!"
>Charlie wonders if she has to say that every time an adoption is made because it lost its meaning to him
>Charlie went to the boys room and packed what little clothes and personal effects he had
>He had maybe 4 change of clothes and an old laptop he got when he was 14
>Soon Charlie and Concordia left the foster center in a rather luxurious sports car
>He wondered how much it must of cost for the vixen
>he also wondered why Concordia adopted him
>"Hey" the human boy muttered
>"Yes what is it?"
>"Why did you adopt me? there were plenty of fox kids there so why me?"
>"Because of three reasons:"
>"one, I need work done around the house since i'm going back to work
>two, I like being the only fox in my household
>and three is because i've been feeling lonely

>Charlie and Concordia have been in the car for a good part of an hour into the country side
>The sports car pulls into a massive driveway that lays before a large, white mansion
>in the drive way there are other similar looking sports cars
>why a hot fox lady needs 4 different sports cars is beyond Charlie
>The car is parked at end of the other cars and the two step out
>only now does Charlie realize how big this place is
>He stands there, marveling at the massive residence
>Charlie didn't see Concordia chuckle at his gawking
>"You like it huh?"
>"How did you afford this place?"
>"My husband was a wealthy human. When he dies everything that was under his name went straight to me."
>the two started to approach the front entrance
>There were two Fox maids standing there waiting for their mistress and her new son
>The maids opened the door for their masters and greeted them
>The first this Charlie noticed was the lack of furniture
>there's just two armchairs on a rug in the middle of the parlor with a small table between them
>no paintings
>no vases
>there's a flight of stairs on the left side of the parlor that ascends to a balcony
>"The rooms upstairs aren't in use. our rooms are to the right of the of the parlor."
>"Oh, why isn't the upstairs used?"
>"I never found a need to use them after my husband died."
>A human butler greeted Concordia
>"Shall I show the young master his room?"
>"Yes Daniel. Charlie, this is Daniel. He's going to show you you're room."
>without saying anything Charlie followed the butler to his room. 

>Charlie and the butler reach the end of the right wing corridor
>To their left is a pine door, maybe?
>"Here is your room."
>Charlie thanks Daniel and dismisses him
>Charlie opens the door and steps into the equally barren room
>There's a queen sized bed to the right with a night stand on the left
>a sliding door that leads to a bathroom sits on the left side of the room
>the room is covered with a light brown carpet
>"Sorry for the lack of furniture dear."
>Finnthehumanscream.mp3
>Concordia steps into the room
>"I didn't exactly inherit everything when my husband died. You see, my in laws wanted the furniture. I still don't know where they stored it all."
>The Artic fox turns back around and approaches Charlies
>"Maybe some time this week we can go look at some furniture, together. What do you say?"
>"sure?"
>"Great, dinner will be ready in an hour."
>the fox left the room leaving Charlie to get familiar with is new life

>At first Charlie wasn't so optimistic
>He thought it was going just other place with abusive people
>He barely spoke to Concordia and harbored a little distain towards her
>But as time went on he began open up more to his adoptive fox mother and even to some of the servents
>he would talk about what his friends and himself would do for fun
>sometimes the boy would cry, remembering all the horrible things in his life
>During those times he had no one to go to
>But now he has a caring anthro fox mother to go to in those times of distress
>Concordia would do her best to comfort her human son when he was upset or angry
>She would have him lay down in her lap and rub is head, singing some old songs she heard while growing up in a soft spoken tone
>to Charlie this was heaven
>finally he had a home where he wasn't seen as a just a pet, but as a living being

>at some point in time Charlie began developing feelings towards his vixen mother
>it started when he was being homeschooled
>Concordia tought the boy herself, having majored in general studies
>Charlie started noticing her features much more
>She was slim all around but she did have curves
>She had petite breasts, possibly only b cup in size
>Her ass wasn't plump but it's probably firm and round
>Charlie thought that Concordia noticed him checking her out because she would tease him whenever it looked he was looking at her
>most of the time it's just playful talk
>other times she used her tail
>it was like that for a few months
>it never escalated to anything physical before
>until one cold January day

>it's new years ever
>Concordia didn't have anything planned for it
>The servents took the day off
>it was just the boy and the fox
>oh and the furnace for the heat is busted
>there was suppose to be a guy to come and fix it but they never showed up
>Concordia wasn't really bothered by the cold but Charlie doesn't have a coat of fur
>The fox had the briliant idea of snuggling together wrapped in a blanket
>so the fox mother and her human son got close together in an embrace to warm themselves up
>it took awhile for the warmth to take affect on Charlie
>He closed his eyes as he sat there in the lap of his Vixen mom with a blanket draped over them
>"See dear isn't this nice?"
>"mhmm."
>Concordia took pleasure in petting her son's hair
>Something about the feeling his hair against her fur felt nice
>after some time they decided to watch the new years ball drop
>they watched it on a new tv that was bought couple of weeks ago
>the tv roared with the sound of millions cheering as the ball finally dropped
>"Happy new years, Charlie."
>"Happy new years, Mom."

>Concordia's mind started racing
>did Charlie just call her 'mom'?
>he never called her mom before
>he always calls her by her last name
>but this is new
>what made him say it now she wondered
>her thinking was interupted by soft snores coming from the now sleeping Charlie
>He looks so peaceful as he sleeps
>"....mom..."
>aw he's dreaming about Concordia-
>"...please...don't hit me..."
>what
>Hit him? Why would she hit him?
>"no please no no no stop please."
>Charlie is starting to thrash
>"NO STOP STOP PLEASE IM SORRY!"
>"Charlie! Charlie!"
>the fox is shaking her son, trying free him from what ever is tormenting him
>Charlie wakes up, giving a small scream
>tears are going down is face
>his eyes are red and raw
>"Ch-Charlie?"
>The boy breaks down crying
>Concordia immediately tries to calm her distraught son
>after a good 10 minutes Charlie calms down

 >>11660888
>Concordia decides that it's about time to get ready for bed
>the fox tells Charlie to follow her
>They arrive at a similar looking door to Charlie's
>Obviously it's Concordia's room
>the two enter the larger, spacious, equally empty room
>Charlie and Concordia never did go out to get new furniture yet
>The room is much bigger than Charlie's
>A king size bed lays centered to the far wall with a Flat screen mounted to the opposite wall
>A closet occupies the right wall and A much larger bathroom entrance to the left

>"Alright Mom."
>There it is again
>He just called her 'Mom'
>Concordia starts wondering if Charlie really had such a hard life that he considered her is first real 'Mom'

>She step towards the shower and opens the glass door
>Charlie looks at Concordia with a surprised expression
>"w-what a-are you d-doing?!'
>"What? It's only a shower. Plus you have seen me naked."
>It was an unusual thought to her
>The boy who sees her as a mother is seeing her in her most natural self 
>"Charlie could you wash my back for me? I'll get my front."
>Charlie helped her wash her back
>Charlie can't explain why this feels weird
>It's true he has seen her naked before while showering in the past
>It wasn't strange for them to take showers together since Concordia needs help washing her fur
>But this time it's, different
>Charlie feels hot and flustered when near the vixen like this
>Running his hands through her soft wet fur
>feeling her
>Exploring her beautiful fox body

>They were soft, squishy albeit small
>Concordia took sharp breaths as the boy began to play with her breasts
>She was enjoying this

>"Charlie, lower."
>Charlie moved his hands down her body till they reach her slit
>Charlie started run his fingers along the entrance of her snatch
>Sometimes he would rub her clit, garnering a moan from the fox

Author notes:
Charlie and Concordia did eventually get furniture at one point.
Of course Concordia's new In-laws got the furniture too
