>The orca gracefully slides above the surface
>she smiles warmly at you and runs her mechanical fingers through your hair
>she says “looks like I caught a cute one”
>you just laugh and put your hand on her hip
>you rub in circles, savoring the firmness of her muscles and smoothness of her skin
>”so,” you ask, staring into her eyes, “what’s your name?”
Last green says it already, what's her name? General personality trait suggestions for her would be helpful as well.

Coral. Essentially an overeager whore giving blow jobs in hopes of netting a fulltime mate than one-night stands

>”Coral, how about you?” she responds
>Coral, huh?
>stare deeper into her blue eyes
>you imagine seeing her gracefully swimming in a coral reef, the water the same beautiful blue you’re looking at now
>”Coral’s a beautiful name” you say before finally zoning back in “oh yeah, my name’s Anon”
>the two of you stare at eachother for a second before you realize something
>if you want this to not just be a one-time encounter, you should probably be taking some initiative
>”do you want to go get something to eat?” you ask
>her face lights up & she hugs you
>”I’d love to, let’s go”
>the two of you head back to the land and you get a better look at her metal arm
>the black prosthetic blends in with the dark blue of her skin, and you notice that her entire arm is prosthetic.
>it’d definitely be interesting to hear how she lost her arm, even if that was a story for when you two knew eachother better.
>you both get to land and walk with one another to a little beach bar
>you think you see her hand up towards you, like she wants to grab your hand but isn’t
>you quickly take her hand and give it a little squeeze
>this gets a smile from her
>you two get to eating and get to talking
>”So Coral, where you from?”
>”Oh, I’m from up north. Like really far up north”
How about some conversation topics?

So... are you alone? do you know someone in this region?

>The two of you have seated yourself down at a little table, and already ordered your food

>"So... are you alone? do you know someone in this region?" you ask

>"Oh! I moved here a couple years ago. The beaches and sun's a lot nicer than the cold"

>She pats her stomach a few times

>"I've even lost some blubber"

>Friends though..." she thinks for a few seconds. "Yeah, I've got a few."

>She leans forward, giving you a nice view of her cleavage.

>"So what about you? where are you from?"

>"I'm from around here" you say before glancing down at her boobs. "The view around here is definitely really nice"

>She leans even farther forward but the friction of the table holds her bikini back, making it so her nipples are just barely staying covered

>She grins before leaning back into her seat

>"Oh is it now? I'd hope so."

——————————————————————————————————

>You two chat over your late lunch for a while longer

>After lunch is over the two of you head out of the bar and over to her car

>It's a fairly short walk to her car, but that won't stop you from putting your hand on her hip the entire way there

>"So, want to keep this going at your house?" You ask when you reach the car, bringing her in a little closer

>She gives you a quick kiss on the cheek

>"It was nice to meet you Anon, but my place isn't really clean right now"

>"Oh ok, if you don't want to that's fine"

>She stares at you and smiles, as if she were expecting you to keep talking

>Oh yeah

>You take out your phone and go into your contacts

>"Hey Coral, What's your phone number?"

>You hand her your phone

>She goes from smiling to beaming before quickly typing it down.

>She hands your phone back and says "Could you go ahead and send me a text?"

>She seems almost overjoyed when the text goes through

>She hugs you before getting in her car and driving off

>You get in yours and head home as well

>By the time you get home it's nearly evening

>You laze around the house for the evening, today was good

>Eventually catch yourself thinking about Coral

What's your (Anon's) opinion on her?
