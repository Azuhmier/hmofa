>The rolling green hills of Vermont pass by your windows. 
>The cold mountain air forming banks of fog that conceal the snow capped tops of the mountains that frame your vision as you drive down the lonely mountain road
>A thermos of hot black coffee sits in the center console as the faint rumble of your truck's engine slows down
>A unmarked dirt road that leads off into the woods
>Your father had shown you this place
>You can hear the crunching of gravel under your tires as you start down the trail 
>Many of your best memories were made down here
>The first buck you had ever tagged, your first beer
>This road was like a portal back in time.
>As you rolled down the road you never had the radio on
>The smell of crisp cold mountain air, and the sound of the wind rustling the leaves was the only soundtrack you could ever ask for
>As you drove over a small creek you saw the ancient, by your terms, cabin
>A simple three room cabin with a single brick chimney on the side of it.
>As you put the truck in park and stepped outside you stood in silence. 
>This is what you went through your boring nine to five for.
>Dealing with that obstinate asshole of a boss
>Weekends like this made it all worth it. 
>From back in the bushes however a pair of bright yellow eyes stared on in silence. 
>They watched this creature walk into the cabin and close the door behind him
>She crept out of the bushes
>her steps measured and careful
>She looked over the strange device that had carried him out here
>It was warm and smelled bad but her natural curiosity was overwhelming her. 
>She climbed into the back part of its body and began to quietly rummage through its strange contents
>A few pieces of rope, a metal chest of some kind
>And most interesting of all Some kind of cloth sack
>She untied the string holding one end closed and pulled out its contents
> A strange device made of wood and steel, Its metal end long and slender

>She ran her hands over its form.
>Her mind racing with possibilities. 
>What was this? Was it magical? Some kind of human ritual stick?
>Her fingers touched every detail of the device, Flicking a switch near the wooden part of the device
>A metallic click filling her ears
>She paid that no mind however
>It hadn't hurt her so far right?
>What reason did she have to fear this devi-
>her fingers brushed over a hook shaped piece of metal. 
>The rifle erupted with noise 
>A huge boom echoed inside the truck bed and smoke from its blast kicked up dust in the bed
>She bolted back to the safety of the woods
>Her ears ringing with pain and shock
>Tears streamed down her white furred cheeks as she ran past all manners of trees
>Fleeing as fast as she could back to the safety of the forest
>Not even attempting to pay attention as she fled.
>Back in the cabin you stoked the fire in the cabin's hearth
>A small flame slowly growing into a warm blaze as you simply sat in an old wooden chair
>Looking over the walls at the time faded pictures and trophies that decorated the walls
>Some of them dating back to your grandfather's time. 
>His twirled mustache and plaid jackets his trademark woodsman look. 
>Others depicting a dorky looking young man with his father.
>You smiled at the pleasant memories of your past But as you stood to grab a few more logs to add to the fire you were jolted out of your memories by the report of a rifle. 
>You whipped around to face your vehicle
>"What the hell is going on?"
>You threw open the front door to try to figure out what the hell was happening. 
>All you saw was the tip of a white tail scurrying into the woods
>"What?"
>You jogged over to the bed of your pickup
>A fresh hole punched in the side of your bed
>You cursed under your breath and pursed your lips as you surveyed the damage
>Grabbing the rifle and chambering a fresh round you headed off into the woods

>You pushed through the thick brush. 
>Your boots snapping twigs as you traveled ever further into the woods of your Childhood
>There was no real threat of getting lost out here.
>Every tree may as well be a striking landmark to you.
>You could hear the faint sounds of the stream you passed by before when you drove up here
>The only thing allowing you to track whatever it was that had set off your rifle was a few strands of white fur that had stuck to branches
>A lingering annoyance driving you on to find what had blown a hole in the side of your truck. 
>As you walked on you started to hear the faint sounds of struggle. 
>Panicked breathing and claws scraping against stone. 
>As you walked on the sounds got louder and louder 
>A canine whine piercing the otherwise quiet environment. 
>You slung the weapon over your shoulder and pushed aside a larger fallen tree limb 
>A smaller fox. 
>But with human form. 
>Two legs and two arms
>All covered in thick white fur. 
>The tip of her tail and ears fading to black. 
>Her hind leg matted down with blood as a wire snare dug ever further into her flesh. 
>She struggled against it mightily as she could muster. 
>Every time she pulled against it it dug into her ankle 
>You stook one more step forwards and her ears and head swiveled to meet you
>Hey pupils shrinking to pinpricks as she looked at you with nothing but fear in her eyes. 
>Her struggles ceasing for a few seconds
>That was until she spotted the rifle on your shoulder
>When she saw that he struggles redoubled. 
>Blood beginning to pour from her injured leg as she cast aside her pain in a desperate attempt to get away. 
>You as a hunter had always hated traps
>They never felt very sportsmanlike in your opinion. 
>You stepped closer to her as she grasped at rocks and stones in order to get away. 
>When you tried to reach out to grab her ankle she struck out at you.
>Her claws digging into your jacket and carving a deep gouge in the fabric.

>You fell backwards
>Your ass landing hard on the dirt floor as your rifle fell from your shoulder and clattered against a stump
>Your hand flew to your chest to make sure you hadn't been cut too badly. 
>But as your hands passed over the now ruined jacket you felt no pain. 
>Just indignation over the fact that this little fox had ruined your favorite jacket. 
>you huffed and pushed yourself back up onto your feet.
>The fox's leg was bleeding pretty badly at this point. 
>If she struggled any harder for any longer you weren't sure if she was going to be able to keep the leg.
>But you were a woodsman god damnit 
>You removed your jacket
>You held it out in front of you while the fox was trying to catch her breath. 
>Her chest heaved rapidly as she rested for just a brief moment 
>Her eyes locked on you as you walked forwards so slowly you thought you may as well have been standing still. 
>But once you felt you were in range. You quickly threw the jacket over her head. 
>Using your weight you held her in place. 
>For such a little thing she sure put up a fight. 
>You kept her eyes covered until you felt her struggles subside. 
>Her rapid breath slow down. 
>Using the sleeves you tied the jacket around her head. 
>After that she seemed to calm slightly. 
>Her whines still persisted though most likely due to the pain. 
>You hauled her up into your lap
>Letting her sit there while you got to work on her leg. 
>You pulled a hunting knife from your pocket 
>Slipping the blade between the wire snare and her bloodied ankle. 
>With a quick flick the snare was undone and she pulled it up back to herself. 
>You were about to just let the vixen go when a small noise from the blacket stopped you in your tracks. 
>She was sleeping?
>You quickly resheathed your knife and considered your options.

>She must have tuckered herself right out fighting the trap for that long. 
>Or literally just passed out from sheer fear of what was going on around her. 
>Well shit this was your problem now. 
>As you stood back up you hefted her up with you
>She couldn't be more than half of your height. 
>But as you moved through the trees back towards your cabin you could feel the warm blood start to creep through your undershirt. 
>This wasn't something you could ignore. 
>As you reemerged into the clearing you saw your cabin
>A column of smoke rising from the stone chimney. 
>"Well at least it'll be warm." You thought to yourself.
>You pushed open the door with an elbow
>Walking past the fireplace to the back room where the bed was. 
>This room used to have two bunkbeds
>you your father and your grandpa would sleep back here on weekend trips
>But now that you were the only user of this house it had been reduced down to one king sized mattress and a few pieces of furniture
>You gently set her down onto the bed. 
>Quickly turning about and closing the door behind you as you went back out to the truck. 
>The door opened with a creek and you reached under the bench seat 
>your fingers quickly finding the red metal aid kit that had seen next to no use from you save for the odd papercut or busted knuckle from working on your vehicle. 
>As you went inside you grabbed a rag from a shelf and got it wet with water. 
>As you made it back inside to find her still sleeping on your bed
>And with a disappointed sigh you remember that she was bleeding... All over your bed...
>Adding that the now much longer list of things to do you flip open the bex and set to work. 
>You started dabbing the blood away from the wound. Trying to get an idea of just how deep this was going to be. 
>She shuffled in her sleep sometime twitching away from you slightly but for the most part she simply laid there and let you work in peace. 
>Inside the jacket it was another story however

>She had come back to about half way back to the cabin
>Not quite realizing where she was after her world had gone dark she decided to remain calm. 
>Maybe one of her packmates had driven the Jager off. 
>Maybe she was safe in the arms of one of her own. 
>this reality began to crumble the very second she heard the sound of your boots grinding over gravel as you walked back towards the house. 
>The same smells from before.
>Smoke, Sweat, Blood. 
>Oh god she was going to die here. 
>She let out a silent sob at her predicament. 
>She had never seen one of her own survive an encounter with Jagers 
>every time they came into those woods with those sticks they killed her own
>All they would see and hear was a deafening thunderclap 
>A spray of blood and viscera 
>Then one of her home's inhabitants would fall 
>Dead 
>They had never escaped when one of them was found
>So her kind had avoided them at all costs
>But as she sat there in his overpowering arms she waited for the thunder that would come
>When her life would be snuffed out by a Jager
>But her terror turned to confusion when she was set down
>On a soft matt of some kind
>Its texture was alien to her
>Not like the fur blankets and plant mats they were used to sleeping on
>But softer, and more springy than anything she had felt before. 
>She sat there in silence as she heard and felt footsteps walking away. 
>Had he let her go?
>Were there more of them around her waiting to pounce on her?
>She decided to wait it out
>He hadn't killed her yet
>Maybe she was going to be a slave to him?
>Surely that would be a more acceptable fate than to simply be killed. 
>Then she heard him return 
>Grumbling as he opened the door to where she was being kept
>When rival tribes of her kind were captured if they were male they were given the choice to live as a slave or to simply be killed. 
>But if a female was captured.
>They were forced to bear their new chief's children as a show of domination

>She shuddered at the thought.
>Waiting for his unyielding strength to pin her to his bad and ravage her
>A single shudder of fear and disgust washing over her as she felt the last few flickers of hope fade from her world 
>But once again she was caught completely by surprise. 
>His touch was gentle 
>Like one of her pack's healers
>His fingers traced over her wound Checking it to ensure it wasn't infected
>She felt a warm rag dab over her ankle
>The siting of cloth on her leg as she felt him begin to clean her injuries. 
>You winced slightly as you realized just how deep the snare had cut into her. 
>She must have fallen into a rabbit snare or something of the like. 
>This was by no means leathal of its own accord but it would have been incapacitating if it wasn't treated with some rapidity. 
>He continued to dab away at the blood. 
>Ensuring nothing was in the wound before he started to really treat it. 
>He grabbed a paper packet and ripped the end off with his teeth. 
>The smell of alcohol filled his nostrils for a second. 
>the small cloth hovering just above the cut. 
"I don't know if you're awake but this is gonna hurt..."
>With as gentle a touch as he could muster he dabbed at the wound. 
>Her legs shot out away from the towelette with a surprising speed. 
>A high pitched yelp emanating from inside the jacket. 
>"That hurts!"
>she shouted from inside the blanket
>She wanted to clamp her paws over her mouth.
>He knew she was awake now. 
>You placed a hand on her shivering back. 
"It's fine. I'm not gonna hurt ya."
>I'm gonna let you out of that blanket. That alright?"
>The covered head of the vixen nodded simply after hesitating for a few seconds. 
>With a few deft movements the sleeves were untied and the jacket was pulled away from her head. 
>Her eyes were red with tears, and her fur under her eyes were matted down with the same. 
"I'm not gonna hurt ya. So calm down. But if you want me to fix that leg of yours. You're gonna have ta trust me."

>Her mind raced as the Jager spoke
>None of this made sense to her!
>These Jagers were bloodthirsty predators
>Killing anything that crossed their path!
>So how was the specter of death sitting on a mat next to her and mending her wounds
>While she was still alive nonetheless!
>At that moment the only other option in her head became an absolute
>He was going to take her as his own slave...
>Her ears drooped at the realization. 
>She was his now.
>Nothing but a slave.
>Tears welled in her eyes as she looked back up at the Jager. 
>"I will not fight you."
>he nodded at that and soon too that small white cloth and began to dab again at her wound. 
>She quickly snatched up his clothing
>Camling her jaws around the fabric to keep from screaming as he touched the cloth to her leg again. 
>The pain shot up her leg like a lance.
>It was all she could do to keep from jerking her leg away from him as he set to work again. 
>The stinging cloth seemed to burn wherever he touched around her ankle. 
>The first one was soon red with her own blood. 
>He tossed it into a metal bin across the room from them before retrieving another from a different red box. 
>After another few dabs he tossed that one away as well. 
"There we go. That's the worst of it."
>He looked up to her. 
>His deep brown eyes looking at her
>She simply whimpered trying to ready herself for what she thought was inevitable. 
>The Jager routed around in the box a foe more seconds pulling out a small bundle of "Gauze"?
>She wondered what that was. 
>Some kind of binding?
>With a gentleness that surprised her he began to wrap the cloth around her leg. 
>A slight red tinge showing through before the second wrap. 
>But as he wrapped this "gauze" around her leg the bleeding seemed to slow.
>"What is that?"
>You looked back up to the vixen with her ears splayed back against her skull. 
"Some gauze. Keeps ya from bleeding all over my bed... More."

>You sighed as you looked down at the mess near her ankle on your bed. 
>While by no means was this just a small stain it wasn't like she had been hemorrhaging blood all over the place. 
>She hurt herself because you didn't keep the damn gun in the truck. 
>You stood up and spoke again. 
"Well that should do you for now."
>You motioned for her to get up off the bed
>She stood slowly 
>Almost falling when she put weight on her bad ankle. 
"Easy does it."
>You caught her by the shoulder when she stumbled. 
"Still a little sore huh?"
>She stood shakily as you walked past her
>You half expected her to bolt out the door behind you and hightail it into the woods as soon as she got the chance. 
>But you pulled up the dirtied cloth and bundled it up under your arm. 
>But she stood there still and silent
>As he cast a glance out the window he watched as clouds started to roll in over the peaks of the green mountains that surrounded them. 
>He turned back to face her. 
>Looking down at her splayed back ears he spoke up again. 
"So... You were the one who shot my rifle hmm?"
>She looked up at him.
>"Rifle?"
>She said with some fear still in her voice. 
"Yeah. The metal thing that went bang." 
>She sulked slightly as if she were preparing for a punishment of some kind. 
>"Yes. I touched your "rifle"
>She looked up at your face
>"Please don't hurt me! I didn't know what it was!"
>You put a hand on her head and sighed again. 
"Don't worry 'bout it."
>You don't know why you were being so nice to this one.
>Maybe lingering guilt?
>You decided it really didn't matter. 
"Just don't go touching it again. Okay?"
>She nodded quickly
"Good."
>He walked back towards the door and opened it.
>The now healthy fire had spread a comfortable warmness throughout the cabin. 
>The light of the flame casting deep shadows against the worn walls of his home away from home.


>As you stepped into the warm light of the fire the vixen followed suit
>Limping with every other step. 
>It was already getting late. 
>Between your truck through the woods, finding this little fox and mending her ankle you had burned away most of your first day out here. 
>And as you looked out the window your gut started to grumble. 
>All you had brought out in in terms of ready to eat food was the thermos of coffee
>you turned back towards the vixen that stood demurely in the middle of the room. 
"Hungry?"
>She looked at you with wide eyes again.
"No... I'm fine."
>Sure you are you though to yourself. 
>You reached out and put an hand on the door to the outside. 
"Stay here."
>You opened the door and walked back to your truck leaving the fox inside.
>She stood there for a few seconds
>Still trying to wrap her head around what was going on.
>She might be the first of her kind to ever set foot inside a Jager's home and live to tell about it. 
>So being the curious little fox she was she limped around the interior. 
>Strange art littered the walls of the place. 
>Everything from trophies from hunts long past to little scraps of paper hung in wooden frames. 
>She had never seen anything like this. 
>Their artwork was so realistic it looked like they had taken reality and put it in a box. 
>She found another. 
>the jager that had rescued her? Captured her?
>It didn't matter right now. 
>He was standing in the box, along side two other Jagers. The others looking much older.
>They were all smiling here. 
>She reached out with a delicate touch to see if she could feel them. 
>But when she touched them she only felt the cold surface of glass. 
>She brought her hand back to her chest.
>She wondered where the females were in these pictures?
>Did Jagers look different from male to female?
>She could tell the one who took her in had been male. 
>She could smell it on him. 
>Before she could ponder further, You pushed open the door again.
>As you stepped inside you looked over at the vixen. 
>Her eyes wide with fear again as your sudden intrusion must have scared her again
>You set down a cooler on the counter
>She stood there like she was awaiting a punishment 
>You cocked an eyebrow at her
>It was going to be awkward if she just stood there like a scolded puppy for the whole weekend
>So you turned to her and spoke again. 
"So how's that ankle of yours feeling?"
>Her gaze rose to meet your own
>"It's not as bad as it was before..."
>her tail tucked down between her legs and her ears laid back again as she spoke
>"Thank you..."
>You smiled as she seemed to finally be warming up to you a little bit
"Good to hear."
>you pulled out a brown paper bag
>Unwrapping them would reveal two nice cuts of salmon
>You had caught these earlier last week and had saved them for just this weekend. 
>Her eyes and ears seemed to be locked on you as you laid the cuts out on the counter. 
>You laughed as you noticed her sudden interest
"Sure you're not hungry."
>You laughed
>She seemed to sheepishly agree and stood quietly in the center of the room as you started your prep work. 
>After a few minutes you had two nice cuts of fish sizzling away on the fire. 
>She had watched you intently as you prepped your food. 
>You Sat there in a chair watching your food cook. 
>your gaze going from the food to her leg
>She stood on it shakily
>That had to be starting to hurt 
>Even if she wouldn't admit it. 
"Hey. What's your name? You have one right?"
>She turned to face you. eyes down at the floor.
>"I had a name... But now... It's whatever you choose."
>You shook your head
"Let's say I'm bad with names. what was it before?"

>Her voice was just audible
>"My name was Lisica..."
>You smiled and spoke again after her
>Not wanting to put up with some strange fox culture that he was in no way going to understand the first night he met her
"Then I guess your name will be Lisica."
>She seemed to perk up a little at that
>You walked a little closer to your fish and poked it a little with a fork
>There was no substituting the taste of a fish you caught, and cleaned yourself. 
>As you poked it you deemed it to be cooked and ready to eat
>You took two plates and slid a nice slab of salmon onto each of them.
>You offered the plate to the vixen as she stood there looking at the fish 
"Here take a plate. It's hot though so watch out."
>she seemed to look at you fearfully for a second. 
>Like you were offering her a priceless painting
"Can't have you starving after I fixed your leg now can I?"
>She took the plate in both hands and looked at the plate then back to you
>She poked a claw at the meat and smelled it
>Her eyes widening as she looked at it then back to you before taking a testing nibble out of the fish. 
>As she chewed it her eyes went wide
>She picked up the fork you had on the plate awkwardly and began to eat her fish
>You noted that at least she was eating. 
>Which was always a good thing for an injured animals. 
>It meant that they were on the road to recovery
>So with that in mind you went back into your bedroom and picked up the bloodied blanket 
>you took it outside and hung it up on a rung
>The rain would wash out most of the blood and then it should be dry by the morning or midday. 
>As you walked back inside you noticed how clean the plate in front of her was.
"Really weren't hungry were you?" 
>You laughed
>You were happy to see that. 
>She was just as confused as when she was first brought here. 
>Slaves in her pack were NEVER treated this well
>Much less fed this well
>So why was he taking such good care of her?

>It all came to a head as she connected the dots in her mind
>No pictures of a female
>Living alone in the woods with no pack of his own. 
>Keeping her well fed and healthy
>...
>Oh sweet gods above.
>He was going to start a pack with her! 
>Her eyes widened and looked down at the floor.
>That had to be it!
>She considered her options quietly as he ate
>If she ran she wasn't sure if her pack would accept her again. 
>The scent of a Jager all over her would not exactly go over very well with her alpha. 
>So she was stuck between a rock and a hard place. 
>Her curiosity began to overwhelm her though.
>A pack between her and a Jager would be incredibly powerful 
>Their kits being half Jager would mean they'd never be in danger. 
>So in that moment she decided
>She'd stay with him. 
>Be his and his alone
>Her train of thought was derailed when he spoke again. 
"Hey let me see that leg again."
>He put his plate down on the table next to him
>She walked over to him slowly
>Still very much afraid of what Jagers were supposed to be capable of. 
>She lifted her leg up to his hand
>She watched as he peeled back the gauze he had wrapped around her ankle
>It had still bled through quite a few layers of the cloth
>But as he pulled more and more away she realized that her bleeding had already stopped
>What kind of other things did Jagers have?
>She looked up at his face as he worked
>He had a gentleness around him that she would have never imagined a Jager to have. 
>You looked over her wound. Even in just a few hours it had gotten much better. 
>Grabbing a towel from the cabinet again he wiped off some of the dried blood from her otherwise white fur. 
>There was no jerkiness to her when he worked on her leg this time. 
>Did she finally trust you now?
>You took great care with her ankle
>Doing your best not to disturb the cut so she wouldn't start bleeding again.

>As he finished wrapping up her leg he let her go
>But strangely as you let her go this time she didn't slink away from you
>She stood there for a little while
>Looking you over
>Her nose and eyes looking you over as you turned to simply stare at the fire.
>You decided to let her take her fill
>It was all you could to to not be rude and stare at her chest or legs when she turned about to look for a place to sit. 
>Every now and then you stood to put another log on the fire
>The fire reigniting for a short while before that log too was consumed by the blaze. 
>Eventually you looked down at your watch
>Eyes widening as you took in the time
>If you were gonna do half the things you wanted to do tomorrow you needed to get some sleep in tonight. 
>So when you stood up you were surprised when she stood and followed you. 
"There's only one bed in here."
>You said with a flat expression
>Her ears went flat and she looked sheepishly at the ground as she spoke. 
>"Well I ruined your blanket..." 
>She was right about that in a way. 
>It was gonna be a cold night for sure but he knew he could take it if he just slept in his first day's clothes. 
>"But if I slept with you. I could keep you warm."
>She let out a sigh and gathered herself. 
>"It's the least I can do for you."
>You sighed as you thought over the options in your head
>Sleep miserably for a night and let the little hurt fox also sleep out in the cold
>Or Let that same fox sleep next to him to keep them warm
"Alright"
>You said opening the door for her
>She moved past you and limped towards the bed waiting for you to climb in.
>She sheepishly avoided your form as you stepped out of your clothes 
>You pulled back the sheet on the bed and sat down
>Holding the cover open for her to climb in beside you
>Her much smaller body still emanated a great deal of warmth
>Probably from sitting next to the fire for so long.

>Every past though of Jagers screamed at her as she climbed up to where he was
>Every story her parents and grandparents had told her
>How vicious they were
>How they could and would kill without a second thought
>So when she pushed herself up next to him she felt a chill of primal fear run up her spine. 
>She faced away from him
>Not wanting to have second thoughts now. 
>She was in the lion's den
>But as the moments crept by in the silence of night she began to relax more and more. 
>Even going to far as to almost fall asleep herself
>Only catching herself when she felt the Jager next to her shift in his sleep. 
>Her tail was curled around her own leg
>But as she heard his breath deepen she wanted to make sure he was sleeping before she made her next move. 
>She craned her neck around to look at him
>His mouth hung open as he slept
>Snoring gently on every breath
>Any other creature to her would have looked funny but this was a Jager sleeping next to her
>But she mustered her courage and began to turn about 
>Doing her best to not disturb him 
>She snuck her head down below the single sheet that covered both of them. 
>His musculature was intense
>Not like some of the others she had heard about
>His body was streamlined 
>Purpose built for the outdoors
>But what caught her attention for the most part was lower down on her body
>She had never even heard of a Jager mating
>Could they even mate in the first place?
>What if he had two?
>She steeled her mind and reached down to his boxers. 
>Her fingers trembling as her claw hooked under his waistband. 
>Her breath caught in her throat as she caught just a glance at what he was packing down there.
>It shouldn't have surprised her how big it was in comparison to other males in her pack. 
>He was almost twice as tall as she was. 
>But it just was laid out in the open just how different the two of them were.

>But she was yanked out of her thoughts by his rumbling in his sleep
>Her head darting upwards to ensure he was actually asleep
>As he grumbled in his slumber she set his waistband back down 
>Keeping still where she was so as to not disturb him further
>She watched as he fell back into a deeper sleep
>Despite the inherent fear of him
>Everything she had been told
>Her mind eventually wandered into what life would be like with him
>Surely she'd be safe
>But she might miss the freedom
>Maybe she was overthinking this
>But as the night went on she felt herself slipping ever closer to the calming embrace of sleep. 
>Eventually falling asleep listening to the deep sounds of his breathing 

>As you woke in the morning you felt a comfortable warmth enveloping your chest
>You looked out the window of your cabin to see the sun just beginning to creep over the trees.
>wondering what that warmth was you pulled the sheet covering the both of you up
>What you saw was fairly shocking considering her attitude of you yesterday
>That white vixen lying on your chest
>Her features relaxed and at ease this close to you.
>You did start to feel something though. 
>Some slight twitches as she slept
>She must have been having a dream of some kind
>You reached down carefully with a delicate hand
>Stroking the back of her head and neck. 
>Your touch seemed to calm Lisica
>Going from a twitchy and disturbed slumber to calm
>A small smile forming across her face
>You found yourself growing a similar smirk as you watched her lying across you. 
>As you continued to pet her something interesting was made apparent to you
>Every breath brought this fact more and more into focus
>Her breasts through concealed by a substantial amount of fluff on her chest 
>Were pressing directly on you
>A huge blush forming on your face as it was made clear to you a naked female was laying across you
>In a bed

>You sat there for what felt like hours
>Each moment you felt her breasts push into your chest
>And each moment you found it was more and more difficult to restrain your friend down below with a mind of his own. 
>You tried everything
>Holding your breath
>Thinking non sexy things
>You thought for sure that your grandfather's twirled mustache would do the trick
>But there was no match for the foxy boobs pressing against you. 
>Eventually you felt her shifting against you
>Oh thank god you thought to yourself
>This sexual frustration wasn't going to last much longer before you were just going to push her off you 
>But as she was roused from her sleep she blinked a few times checking where she was again before she met your eyes
>They went wide with surprise for a second before she pushed away from you
>"I am sorry for waking you."
>You found yourself smiling trying to comfort her
"Don't worry about it. Been up for a while."
>She seemed to relax a bit at that
>But there was still the elephant in the room
>You didn't want to be an asshole to her
>But as you sat up you were glad that she wasn't facing you at the moment
>You tried to quickly flip your manhood up into your waistband
>At least temporarily disguising your inadvertent arousal. 
>It seemed as though it was a success
>You pushed the single sheet off of your bed and began to dress yourself
>Pulling on a fresh pair of jeans, shirt and jacket
>As you were pulling on your boots you heard Lisica pipe up again. 
>"Why do you Jagers wear those garments?"
>You stood up and considered that question for a moment
"Well to be honest we aren't as built for the woods as you are."
>You considered her question for a few more seconds
"What did you call me again?"
>she seemed to shrink from the question
"Don't worry, I'm not offended or anything. Just curious."
>she turned about
>Her tail and ears back 
"A Jager... The term we have for you."

>You pondered her statement for a while
>Wondering what exactly that term would mean coming from her
>Jager was a german word wasn't it?
>If you remembered right it roughly meant hunter. 
>Well technically she wasn't wrong but you wanted to know more
"Is that an insult or a compliment?"
>She seemed to shrink away from that question even further
>Taking a few steps away from you
>Like at any moment you were going to strike out and rip out her throat
>"It's definitely not a compliment."
>She looked like she really didn't want to talk about that any further.
>Maybe you could try talking about that later
"Don't worry about it. We can talk about that later."
>She seemed to relax a bit after you dismissed your own questions
>As you looked at her you remembered your own observations earlier and quickly averted your vision.

>She watched as you shied away from her 
>Why in the world would a Jager ever be shy of someone like her. 
>He had never shown anything like this yesterday
>Was sleeping in the same bed some kind of ritual to Jagers?
>She had so much to learn about him if she was going to be his mate
>So with another welling up of all the courage she had she began to speak again 
>"So what is it you do out here?"
>That question seemed to bring him back around
>He stood up taller and looked around his den
"I come out here now and then to relax."
>he laughed 
"Not been doing a hell of alot of that since you came into the picture"
>But he seemed to get lost in thought looking around the old wooden walls of this place
"Place means alot to me."
>"Was this your birthplace?"
>He smiled again and sighed
"Oh no. Mom always hated this place. She never was an outdoorsy type."
>Then he looked back to the bed and his smile faded slightly
"Least I hope not."

>You silently hoped that your parents had not conceived you in that bed. 
>Not that you could ask them anymore but maybe it was time to retire that old mattress
>You added yet another thing to your mental list and began to walk to the front section of the cabin
"C'mon let's get some breakfast."
>She followed suit as you walked into the main living room of the cabin
>Walking over to your cooler you retrieved another package
>This one fairly rectangular and wrapped in plastic 
>This is what you were looking forward to
>You opened a wooden door to a cabinet under the counter
>You pulled out a cast iron skillet
>Laying each slice next to the other you managed to get enough inside to feed the both of you. 
>You called back to the vixen and
"Can you start a fire?"
>She shook her head
>"I never learned how to."
>Well there's a place to start you thought again
"Alright then."
>You set the pan on the counter and walked over to the stone hearth beckoning her over towards you with a finger
>You could only barely hear her footfalls on the wooden floor
>you took a few strands of tinder as well as a bundle of twigs you had stashed near the logs
>Placing a nest of tinder and twigs near the base of the old fire
>You took a lighter from your pocket and flipped open the lid
>The fox next to you looked on in wonder at what kind of device you just produced
>When you struck the flint a healthy flame was produced. 
>you heard a gasp and she took a step back 
>"What is that?"
>You set the tinder aflame before flicking the lid closed again with its iconic metal *clink*
>The small fire slowly consuming the small twigs before it grear into a healthy flame again
"It's a lighter"
>You turned about still on a knee
>Letting her get a good look at the silver lighter
>You offered the device to her
>She looked at you then at the small trinket
"Go ahead. You can have it."

>She looked at the tiny device with wide eyes
>the silver surface tarnished by scratches and weathered by time itself
>She took it into her hands like she was holding a glass bauble
>Her heart was pounding in her chest as she held it in her delicate fingers
>You watched as her eyes began to glisten slightly 
>You were concerned for a second as she let out a small whine
"I mean if you don't like it I can ke-"
>You were cut off as she wrapped her arms around you
>"Thank you."
>Your shock at her reaction to it was short lived however
>You could feel those fur covered breasts push into your chest again
>You felt your face heat up slightly as you tried to divert the situation
>You gave her a slight squeeze and she pulled back away from you
>She turned about and began to look for something
>You decided it was best to just let her do her own thing for a bit as you went back to tending to your fire
>Adding sticks and twigs to let the small flame grow
>Eventually you had a nice healthy bed of coals that would be perfect for cooking
>You went back to your pan and the smell of bacon soon had filled the room
>eventually you watched Lisica walk back into the room
>A large grin painted on her face
>You saw the little lighter hanging from a string on her neck
>You smiled at her as you spoke to her again
"Looks good on you."
>But as you finished the sentence another thought occurred to you
"Where'd you get the string?"
>She seemed to shrink at that slightly
>"There were a few strands coming off of your bed sheet."
>You wanted to complain but as it stood there wasn't much harm in that.
>So you turned back to your breakfast and moved the thick slices of bacon around
>Letting them cook and enjoying the sizzle of your food and the slow crackle of your fire. 
>Sooner rather than later you pulled your food from the fire
>A smile crept its way across your face as you handed Lisica her plate
"I think you're gonna like this."

>She sniffed the plate cautiously.
>You thought for a moment that she would have learned to trust your cooking after the last time she ate with you but you supposed it was understandable
>Half the things in this cabin she had never seen, let alone ate
>So you watched with a smile on your face as her face lit up at the smell
>Her hands quickly reaching out to take the plate from you
>Her claws snapping up the strips
>Well if nothing else at least she appreciates your cooking. 
>You took your own plate and you decided to simply take a seat in your old chair as she at her food
>As you mopped up the last bit of eggs with your fork you looked over at her 
>She had long since fished off her food and she simply sat there looking over the silver lighter she wore around her neck
>A pleasant smile warming her face
>She flicked open the top with a gentle flick
>Her thumb awkwardly trying to replicate what you had done before to produce a flame. 
>She struck the flint and once again a healthy flame sprouted from the wick
>She looked at it with amazement
>The flickering light reflecting off of her blue eyes
>Before long you felt a warmth developing in your gut
>Like something that you thought was beyond you had been struck with a spark 
>Before you knew it she had looked back at you 
>Her piercing eyes looking at you with concern
>Her voice shook you out of your trance
>"Are you alright?"
>You shook your head and stood up
>Taking both of your empty plates over towards the sink
"I'm fine"

>She looked over at you as you walked tot he counter
>Her tail swishing slightly as she played with he silver bauble hanging around her neck
>The thing that had solidified all her assumptions
>he had given her a beautiful gift
>One that not only was precious to him, but one freely given.
>A device that could provide the gift of fire but she had given it to her asking nothing in return

>She watched him as he pulled open a small trunk
>Listening as he moved a few things around before pulling out a green metal box
>the insides rattling slightly as he set it on the floor
>She watched him intently as he moved
>For such a large male she expected his motions to be rough, and unrefined
>But every time she watched him she was suprised just how gentle he could be
>He gently he had held her in the night
>How he had mended her wounds
>He was...
>Special
>She jumped slightly when he had called out to her
"I'm going fishing."
>He picked up his pole and tackle box
"If you want to stay here you can."
>She stood quickly flinching slightly at the pain in her ankle
>"Oh. No I'll go with you."
>He smiled at that. 
"Then we better get going."

>You walked along the forest trail quietly
>The only noises you heard were the leaves under your feet, and the slight ruffling of soft fur against you pants leg
>She was by your side the whole time
>You had offered to carry her at one point but she had declined. 
>Her presence here was a welcome one
>Her body rubbing up against you from time to time prevented you from getting lost in thought
>But soon you heard and smelt the river nearby 
>Pushing through a hedgerow you saw the lake you had been walking towards
>Its surface was like a mirror
>There was no wind to disturb it
>You found a nice log that had been washed ashore and set your tackle box down next to it. 
>You assembled the pole and soon set about tying your lure
>Lisica sat next to you watching everything you were doing
>"How do you fish with that?"
>You held up the pole 
>It was an old wooden thing, by no means was this the kind of thing one would find in a store anymore
>But you had always had an eye for the classic things
>They always felt like they had been made with human hands. 
>Like some of the soul of the man that had made this till dwelt somewhere within.

>You showed her how each part of the pole worked
>The line how to tie knots for different lures, and the reel
>She seemed very interested in the mechanical parts but she seemed to dismiss it
>"You don't need to use that you know?"
>You raised an eyebrow at that statement
"And how do you think I would go about that?"
>She laughed
>That giggle warmed your soul every time you heard it. 
>It was so pure and lighthearted. 
>But you watched as she approached the clear water. 
>Squating next to the surface of the water and sticking a single finger in the cold clear lake.
>You watched her with interest as her tail twitched behind her
>Balancing her body as she used her finger as a lure
>She was completely still
>Her view focused intently on the surface of the lake
>Your eyes widened slightly as you watched a small mouth bass swim slowly at her finger 
>You couldn't believe her method was actually working. 
>But with small motions and twitches of its tail the fish ventured ever closer to the shore
>You watched as she poised herself to strike
>Her muscles tensing, and leaning forwards slightly
>With a rush of motion she launched herself into the water
>You sprang up from your seat as she disapeared into the cold water
>Her white furred body thrashing for a few seconds under the water
>Her face burst back up out of the water
>Her soaked body clambering up the rock where she had been sitting
>You reached out to grab a hold of her as she scrambled for a handhold. 
>Eventually you felt you had a good hold on her hand
>With some effort you pulled her up and out of the water
>She leaned against you
>Her soaked white fur was slowly soaking into your own pants and clothing
>But what you saw in her mouth made you start laughing hysterically 
>A HUGE small mouth bass wriggled in vain in her mouth
"Holy shit that really worked!"


>She grabbed the fish as it still wriggled trying to escape her grasp
>Spitting out the nasty taste in her mouth she smiled up at you as you laughed
>Her sodden fur revealing just how small she really was
>But some areas didn't slim down that much
>Her hips and... chest for the most part
>You felt your face heat up as you looked down at the twin mounds
>You felt your grip on her tighten slightly as thoughts ran through your mind
>But as you held her for a few more seconds you felt her wriggle in your grip slightly
"Oh sorry!" 
>You opened your arms to allow her to stand up
>She stood up and spoke again
>"I don't want your clothes getting more we than they already are."
>She shook herself off as you stood up
>Her fur fluffing out slightly as most of the excess water was flung out of her white coat
>A small mist was cast off of her as she shook like a dog
>You watched on as her still damp coat clung together in some areas
>The both of you walked over to where you were planning on sitting
>You cast your reel as she leaned against you
>The fish she had caught was strung up on a gill line
>Your bobber sat out in the water every now and then ripples being sent out by fish beneath taking nibbles at the bait
>You looked over when you felt her shiver slightly
>She was doing an excellent job trying to hide the fact she was cold but you had noticed anyway
>she leaned up against you trying to siphon any heat she could from your body
>But you had a better idea
>You set your pole down against the log for a moment
>Reaching up to the zipper on your jacket you opened it up
>You patted your lap and spoke
"Get on up here. Cant have you catching a cold."
>She looked up at you with some surprise but obeyed nonetheless 
>Her back pushing into your chest and abs the little white fox was snug against your body
>You zipped up the jacket so that only her head was poking out
>You felt her wiggle into you slightly
>Her damp fur was cold against your skin but as time went on and the warmth from your little campfire bled into the both of you you started to really enjoy yourselves
>the crackle of burning wood accompanied by the steady sizzle of fish was a wonderful thing
>All these niceties place in front of a placid lake
>Only a few times before in your life had you been this at peace
>And the shifting fluff you felt against your chest was the icing on the veritable cake.
>She had already torn through her half of the fish she had caught
>You still nibbled at your half
>Enjoying the wondrously fresh fish 
>You felt her move again. 
>Pressing the top of her head under your chin as she very carefully rubbed her fur against your stubble. 
>As she stretched her neck out to continue the touch you felt your heart skip a beat. 
>The second seemed to stretch out as she shifted from facing away from you with her back pressed into you
>And nuzzling her head against your neck her body now facing your own
>So you decided to do the only thing that felt right at the time. 
>Reaching inside your jacket you felt your fingers touch her soft white fur
>Her body jumping a bit at the unexpected touch. 
>But she eventually relaxed into the motions
>Your soft petting causing the little vixen to coo slightly
>Your hand running from the back of her neck all the way down to her tail
>This was amazing
>And before long you felt her breathing start to lengthen
>Her ears twitching slightly
>Had she?
>As you looked down you saw her closed eyes
>A blissful smile on her face
>Your own face began to mimic hers
>A warm feeling working its way through your core
>Your smile soon matching hers

>You extended a leg gently as to not wake her up
>Kicking over a fire bucket and dousing the flame
>Steam poured out from the quenched flame as you stood back up
>Cradling Lisica's sleeping form. 
>As you walked you were enamored with just how at peace she seemed
>How she had come to trust you entirely with just a few small but meaningful gestures. 
>What you didn't see was the rustling bush just off the path
>Grey fur and gleaming yellow eyes following you as you walked. 
>Its steps measured and silent as it skulked through the trees
>You didn't notice how they attempted to bore into your very soul
>The sheer hatred that boiled out from he trees that surrounded you. 
>You were too enraptured with what you carried in your arms
>Maybe she'd want to come back with you?
>Would she want too?
>All in due time you thought to yourself
>For now you just wanted to enjoy the gift that fate had bequeathed to you. 
>So as you pushed open the door to your cabin you set her down in your chair
>Her body stirring slightly before you draped your jacket around her
>She curled up into it
>Inhaling deeply into the down filled fabric and snuggling up with it
>You stood back and watched her for just a few moments before turning about
>Walking towards the door and picking up your axe
>*May as well chop this up while she was sleeping* you thought to yourself
>Walking back behind the cabin where a pile of logs nearly as tall as you were waited. 
>You grabbed one and set it on an ironwood stump
>twisting your hands around the grip and readying your body you swung down
>The wood splintering apart as it was cleaved in two. 
>You heard an extra sound of broken wood as the twin pieced fell
>Sounded like a branch snapping
>You paused for a moment 
>Taking a few seconds to listen to the woods silent song that surrounded you
>Deciding it was probably nothing more than a deer you turned back to your pile of logs.

>Your hand never reached the pile
>As you reached out you heard the sounds of leaves being crushed under footsteps
>At first you assumed the absolute worst 
>A bear was something you had seen around these woods but they had never come after you this far out of the way
>But all you saw was a glint of yellow eyes and the sheen of ivory claws
>At first you felt nothing but the wind being driven from your core
>Your body tumbling end over end as you came to grips with what exactly was happening. 
>Your chest began to feel warm
>Like you had splashed warm water against your chest
>But as the seconds drug on you started to feel a sharp pain cutting into your chest
>Your heart began to pound furriously
>Something was terribally wrong here
>Your eyes started to scan around as the more bestial side of your brain kicked in 
>Looking for the threat so you could get a better idea of what you needed to do. 
>eventually you found it
>A figure stood just a few yards away from you
>Its form much larger that Lisica's 
>It's teeth bared in a rage you'd not seen before
>Its yellow eyes burning with rage
>You felt a pang of panic as you fully came to grips with what you were facing down
>This wasn't a fox. 
>This was a wolf
>Your mind instantly went to your rifle
>Reflexively grabbing for the sling only to find it gone from your shoulder
>It was leaning nicely against the door frame of the cabin. 
>You felt that warmth spreading down your chest as your mind was wrenched back to your situation
>Pressing a hand to your chest if felt wet
>You dared to look down for a second
>Crimson blood was slowly but surely spreading down your chest from three rather nasty looking gashes. 
>And it was at that moment when the pain would fully hit you
>It was almost crippling
>The only thing keeping you from dropping to the ground was the sheer amount of adrenaline running through your system
>As you looked back up at your opponent you saw him take a few tentative steps towards you


>His voice was low, and menacing
>"That bitch is not your pupwhore Jager"
>Your mind instantly went to Lisica
>You felt a rage build up in you that you'd never thought yourself capable
>All thoughts of running away had been eradicated from your mind
>Now the only thing that filled your thought was protecting the slumbering fox inside
>Its fanged maw twisted into a kind of smile
>"She was supposed to be betrothed to me."
>his shoulder sinking low into a striking stance
>"A bartering chip to secure a pact between our packs."
>Your hand slowly went down to your belt as he spoke to you
>"But since that little bitch chose to give herself to a soulless monster she's better of dead that to live on as a disgrace to her and my own packs."
>Every moment that went on your fingers inched closer to the wooden handle of the blade on your belt
>Eventually you felt the reassuring weight of the handle in your grasp. 
>It was along way away from your rifle
>If you had had that you would have killed him already
>But this is what you had to work with
>And you would rather die than let this bastard get to Lisica
>So as he sprung forwards you flicked the leather snap on the scabbard
>The glinting steel seeming to spring up into a wide arc
>The bowie knife seemed to sing as you swung it through empty air. 
>You watched as he ducked to the side
>Missing the keen edge of your knife by just inches
>As to turned to face him his muzzle had lost its cocky grin
>Replaced by a display of shock
>Maybe he knew about your gun like Lisica and figuring that without it the Jager was harmless. 
>You brought the knife up in-front of you again
>Ready for the wolf's next lunge.

>Your eyes were locked to his as he moved
>Your own brown eyes narrow with a avalanche of emotions
>Fear of what would happen to Lisica if you failed her
>Rage at this interloper for ruining your peaceful weekend in the woods and threatening someone who trusted you. 
>Pain at the ever burning slashes that stained your clothing more and more every second
>All these things you felt at once
>your chest heaved as the pain began to set in
>You knew how much long you could hold out for. 
>And this threat was, while arrogant, experienced. 
>He was waiting for you to succumb to your wounds. 
>You needed to goad him into attacking again
>So you steeled yourself for what this insane plan was about to entail
>You forced a calm over your pained expression
>Speaking with as much calm as you could muster. 
"How does it feel to know she chose a monster over you?"
>If his face was anything to go by. 
>That seemed to do the trick
>A feral growl escaped his throat as he leveled himself at you
>His teeth bared and his stained claws at the ready
>You leaned back against the wall of the cabin as he sprang forwards
>The next few seconds went by in slow motion 
>You saw his body leap at you
>his mouth filled with razor sharp fangs bearing down at your neck
>His claws open and ready to slash at your flesh
>But as he was nearly upon you your arm rushed up to greet him
>You felt his teeth sink deep into the flesh of your arm
>You shouted out in pain and anger as you brought your other arm around
>The mirrored steel rapidly approaching his exposed neck
>He tried to bring his arm up to block you but by the time he realized what was about to happen it was already far to late to stop it. 
>The blade seemed to simply disappear into his neck 
>His eyes going wide with pain and shock
>The knife plunging deep into his throat.


>He tried to yowl out in pain
>But the only thing that escaped his mouth was a disgusting gurgle
>Blood flowing both from his mouth as he tried to shout, and from his ruined neck
>A grimace had stained you face as you felt his warm blood roll over your hand. 
>With a rough motion you twisted the knife in his neck
>His eye's shooting open as the pain he felt was multiplied a hundred fold.
>His body pushing off of yours as you kept your back against the wooden wall of your cabin. 
>You watched him stumble a few feet before he dropped to his knees. 
>His hand now stained with more of his blood that your own gripped at his neck
>Trying desperately to keep his life intact as he rapidly bled out. 
>You felt the knife drop with your hand
>Its gleaming blade dyed a bright crimson.
>The pain in your arm and in your chest began to overwhelm your senses now
>The pulsing pain that assaulted your brain was almost too much as you pushed yourself up with your uninjured hand
>You watched as the wolf tried to crawl away from you
>A trail of blood pooling around him as he tried to escape
>But with one last struggling gurgle he fell silent
>His corpse twitching in death
>You didn't even give him a second look as you walked slowly back to the front door of your cabin
>Blood running in rivulets over your fingers ad you pushed open the door. 
>You didn't even dare look at the damage at this point.

>Every step felt heavy
>Like your shoes had been filled with concrete
>Your chest heaved with each breath
>At the very least at least you knew you didn't have a punctured lung
>When you held your breath you didn't feel anything
>One less thing to worry about you suppose
>You could see your stained shirt as you looked down to find the door knob
>The formerly bright red blood that coated you now turning a dark crimson
>The shredded shirt giving you a view you wished you hadn't actually seen
>The bright red flesh that was flayed open before you was a terrifying sight
>Just how close he had been to killing you in a single swipe
>But you could worry about that later
>right now you had one goal in mind
>Stop the bleeding
>Everything after that was a secondary
>You reached forwards with your left hand 
>But as you held it out you saw what had been done to that one as well
>Twin sets of fangs had punctured your forearm
>The holes leaking blood in a steady fashion 
>You grimaced at this sight as well. 
>But you steeled your resolve and pushed open the door>

>She slept comfortably in her chair
>The now familiar smells of his home were comforting in a way she had not experienced before
>The smell of wet wood and the slight hanging scent of campfire smoke
>But in her slumber she was happy
>Her Jager holding her close
>His bare skin caressing her soft fur
>His warm body held in close to hers
>She could almost smell him. 
>But her sleep was not to last as her ears twitched
>The sound of the door opening caused her to raise her head
>Her sleep blurred eyes only saw his form standing in the doorway for a moment before she blinked 
>What she saw then caused her breath to catch in her throat
>She felt her blood run cold as she saw him in his state
>His skin soaked in blood
>His arm damaged
>And he simply leaned back against the counter as he spoke a single word to her
"Help"
>He collapsed then
>His shirt leaving a bloody trail across the wooden wall as he fell

>Her eyes were wide with horror
>What could have done this to a Jager
>She had barely even considered her own disheveled state as she sprung out from under the warmth of her makeshift blanket
>Her claws digging into the wood as she sprinted towards his slumped form
>He was still moving slightly
>His arms trying to push himself back up the wall to stand
>But in just a few bounds she was on him
>Her hands hovering over his wounds her body trembling with fear
>She had no idea of what she needed to do
>she had never cared for wounds like this
>She felt so useless
>Was she doomed to just sit there like a child
>Watching his life slowly slip from his body to stain the floor
>But just before she began to cry she remembered 
>How he had cared for her 
>What he had done to mend her wounds
>So she moved with a passion
>Running back to the bedroom
>Her head swiveling about the room as she searched for that red metal box
>Her eyes locked onto it quickly
>Slipping both hands into the handle she yanked back and tried to pick it up
>But the large metal case was heavier than it looked at first
>The case scratching a few feet in the wood before she took a breath
>At this point her adrenaline was pumping through her veins
>Her body nor her mind cared about any limits she thought she might have
>So with a strength she didn't think she had she hauled the box up and waddled back into the main room
>Letting the box down with a loud clang
>He was still breathing 
>Holding his undamaged hand to his chest
>Rivulets of red blood leaking through his fingers
>His eyes swiveled over to you and he seemed to gather his strength

>He spoke with a gruff tone
>Clearly not having the strength of place of mind to talk in a calm tone
"Bottom drawer... Quick clot. And grab me a piece of wood. This is gonna hurt..."
>Her fingers fumbled with the lock on the bottom 
>As she pulled it open she looked over the contents
>She grabbed the twin white bags and set them next to her downed Jager
>As she looked over the packets she remembered the second part of his request
>She ran over to the fireplace
>Grabbing a sizable chunk of firewood
>Handing it to him as she began to use her claw to slice through the shirt
>The fabric rending under her touch and soon his chest was laid bare to her for the first time
>Not nearly in the way she wanted it to be however
>She took up the packet in her hand and tore at the edge with her teeth
>He took the wood and placed it in his mouth
>His teeth bared as he breathed heavily
"Don't worry about what I say or do."
>He looked her in the eyes
>His own betraying the amount of pain he was about to experience
>She nodded and held the packet over his wounds
>He breathed heavily a few times and nodded 
>And with that she poured the white powder on his slashes


>A lightning bolt of pain shot through you
>The wood in your mouth the only thing stopping you from shattering your teeth as your jaw locked up
"rrrrrrRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHH"
>It felt like she had slammed a red hot knife into the wounds
>she stopped pouring the powder on your chest 
>Looking up at you with deep worry in her bright eyes
>She looked like she was about to burst into tears
>You needed her to stay calm
>If nothing else but for your sake she needed to stay calm
>So you reached out to her
>Your shaking hand clasping hers 
>She looked between your eyes, your chest, and you hand
>You nodded at her still breathing hard through your teeth and wood
>She looked down at the wounds on your chest and nodded with a renewed look of determination on her chest

>She looked down at the wounds on your chest and nodded with a renewed look of determination on her face
>She tipped the packet over again 
>Another lance of pain shot through your chest as fresh powder landed on open wounds
>The stinging sensation not letting up 
>You groaned in pain again
>Your teeth digging into the wood at you tried to bear the pain
>But as you went to squeeze down on your hand you cracked an eye open
>Her worried face, How her hand shook as she poured the last of the packet on your chest
>But your grip never crushed her hand
>You needed to stay calm for her sake
>Your hand held hers 
>Her soft fur was so comforting 
>Such a contrast to the agony you were going through
>You felt a sense of calm pass over you
>Breaking from her face you dared to look down at your wounds 
>A white and red crust forming over the lacerations
>The flow of your blow slowing to an almost nonexistent trickle
>She had done it
>YOU felt pride swell up in your chest
>Not just your own for surviving that
>But for her
>She had saved your life
>She broke your train of thought as she spoke to you
>"What happened to you?"
>You thought for a moment
>You hadn't even considered for a moment what the fuck that wolf was talking about
>You were too busy trying to not let him kill you to be worried about that
>But even now you didn't want to think about that
>you still had other things to worry about
>You spit out the wooden plank
>The piece clattering on the floor
>You saw the imprints your teeth had made in it
>Deep gouges in the piece illustrated just how hard you had bitten down in it
>You still held her hand all this while
>You other hand was still in a bad spot
>the numerous punctures in your flesh seemed to be calming down all on their own
>You'd still need more than a few band-aids through.


>They looked much worse than they were as it turned out
>Extremedy wounds were always like that though
>Lots of blood flow to those areas and whatnot. 
>But as you looked up into her eyes you couldn't bring yourself to tell her what you had done
>You didn't want to bring her down
"You saved my life."
>She folded her ears back and looked back towards your chest
>Grabbing the large pads of gauze and placing them on your chest
>Pain pain pain!
>But you suppressed that pain through force of will
>Not wanting to look away from the white vixen.
>"I only did what you would have done."
>You smiled at her response
>Reaching up you let your hand rest on the back of her head
>Petting her gently as she visibly relaxed
>Her tail swishing back and fourth in response to your petting
>You considered what to do for a few moments
>While you were perfectly content sitting there feeling her soft fur in your hands you felt something stir in your chest 
>Aside from the piercing pain. 
>It wasn't something you could accurately describe with words but nonetheless you felt compelled to act. 
>You left your hand on the back of her head
>Summoning your strength you leaned forwards
>Her eyes going wide at your movement
>Turning her muzzle towards you
>But her eyes went even wide her when you made it clear what you were doing
>You felt your lips touch her own
>How her breath stopped in her throat
>The warmth of her skin and fur against your lips
>You felt the small cinder that had developed in your chest burst into a healthy flame
>It was a kiss of passion
>Not one of lust, or leciduous means 
>But one that mean the world to one who gave and received it
>This was pure.

>You felt her soft body squirm slightly as you kept up the soft embrace
>Her muzzle was slightly awkward to kiss being that you had never done it before but you were very quickly getting used to the sensation
>Her cold black nose pressing against your own
>But this was offset by her delicate fingers as she braced herself against your body
>You were about to make another move 
>A spur of the moment decision that could change how you saw her every day
>You hooked a hand around to her side
>Your hand landing on the small of her back 
>She jumped at that slightly before she cooed into your touch
>As your hand passed over her immaculate body she began to move to facilitate your forwardness
>She swung her leg over you 
>Effectively sitting on your exposed abs
>the both of you were thoroughly caught up in the moment
>A single moment in time when the world around the two of you ceased to exist
>But as she pushed down to creep her hips towards your own she readjusted her grip 
>Planting her hand firmly on your chest to slide herself down
>Your eyes shot open the very second her hands began to push on you
>Another lance of pain shot though you
>Through nothing short of a herculean effort you managed to suppress an extremely unmanly scream
>But you were no herculese
>And you still let out a pained grunt 
>Her own eyes opened as you sounded your reaction 
>Lidded with desire for only a moment as she quickly realized what she had just done
>Her hands shot from your body as she recoiled off of you
>"I'm so sorry!"
>She looked over you again from a foot away
>Seemingly gun-shy of even touching you for a few seconds
"I'm... Fine..."
>You were most certainly not fine
>But you didn't want to make her feel any worse than she probably already did
>She held the lighter around her neck in a death grip 
>your eyes met with hers as she spoke again
"Its fine. I'm alright."
>The pain began to subside again
>The sharp throbbing pain fading into a dull ache.
>As you looked over her face she was blushing
>Even through all that white fur her embarrassment bled through
>Her hands still tightly clasped that lighter of yours
>You stood slowly
>Using the wall to bolster your efforts
>But ignoring the pain in your arm and your chest you do eventually manage to stand. 
>Turning towards your diminutive vixen you extend an arm. 
"Maybe when I'm less torn up we can talk about that huh?"
>She walks towards to slowly
>Eventually pushing up under your arm and side
>Curling her soft tail around your leg
>You smiled down at her
>"What did this to you? A bear?"
>That sentence brought a moment of realization to you 
>You had killed another anthro
>It had to have been a wolf and not a really big fox right?
>Did you want to lie to her
>But then she had a much keener nose than you
>If she smelt a wolfs blood outside surely she could put two and two together
>After a few seconds of deliberations you sighed deeply and prepared to speak
"A wolf came after me."
>She looked up at you with wide eyes
"An anthro. Like you..."
>You waited for a few seconds
>For the pain of her claws or a punch to impact you
>For her to panic
>The illusion of you being nothing but a gentle giant being shattered by none other than the one she trusted ultimately. 
>You couldn't even bear to look at her.
>The silent rejection and rage you feared would twist her visage into something you never wanted to see. 
>But as the seconds ticked away
>That moment never came
>You dared to look down at her
>Her eyes were still wide
>But her face bore no discernible emotion
 
>Her head was buzzing with thought
>There was no way her Jager had killed him without his rifle
>She was certain that these Jagers were fierce in fighting with their tools
>But without them
>They had no claws
>Not fangs save for his relatively tiny canines. 
>Nothing but muscle and bone 
>But if what he was telling her was true 
>Then he had killed a wolf on his own
>Her legs shook slightly from the predator prey instinct that tried to take hold of her
>But she shook those thoughts from her mind
>She knew damn well she could trust him
>But she had to be certain 
>If it was THAT wolf
>"Where is he"
>She looked directly into his eyes
>A look of determination 
>He motioned towards the back of the cabin
"If he died he's still back there"
>He shrugged
"Wasn't really interested in making sure he was dead." 
>She jogged towards the door
>Her body not wanting to waste a single second when the possibility of him getting away was that close
>But as she rounded the corner she stopped suddenly
>The stench of dried blood filled her nose
>She gasped in shock as she saw the wolf
>Face down in the dirt
>A pool of deep crimson blood soaking into his fur around him
>Utterly motionless 
>She walked with slow tentative steps
>Trying not to make a sound as she approached 
>But as she drew near she began to confirm her suspicions. 
>The marks on his coat
>The chunk missing from his left ear
>And what sealed the deal with the necklace tied around his neck
>Many shiny baubles dangling from his neck
>And the one that had set her off that fateful morning
>The piece of stained wood in the shape of a fox's face
>The piece her father had given to this wolf
>She hooked a claw under the string and ripped it away from his ruined neck
>The string and most of the other trinkets soaked in his own lifeblood
>She held it up in front of her
>Her eyes transfixed on the wooden fox. 
>A part of her wanted to hurl it into the woods 
>Never to see it again
>Another wanted to give it back to her father
>But they would shun her for befriending a Jager
>then a third idea popped into her mind
>And she took the trinket in her hands
>looking over the features it possessed
>The dark red stain the wood had taken on
>She silently wondered to herself if he would even accept something like this
>He had given her something amazing
>How could she hope to compare to that
>But she had put her fair in him before and it had been the best decision she had ever made
>Now it was time for her to put her faith in herself
>She nodded and began to walk back towards the quaint cabin
>Wrapping the twine around it so that she could more easily keep it hidden in her hand
>She began to walk slowly back to the front of the cabin every now and then taking a few moments to make sure that this was going to be her plan
>As she stood before the door she took one last look at her charm
>And with a confidence she hadn't felt in a long time she pushed open the door to where her Jager awaited her.

>With the wooden idol in her hand she pushed open the wooden door to the cabin
>Her head held high and with a smile on her face
>Like the things that happened just a few short moments ago had been years ago
>He had, even if unintentional, freed her again from a bond she wanted nothing to do with
>To be a pawn in the games her pack's chief and the chief of the wolf pack had been playing since before she was born
>So as she opened the door she was taken aback for a moment to see him sitting in his chair
>Tending to the last few wounds left unattended too. 
>A bloody rag hung on his knee as he placed the last of his bandages across his forearm
>His gaze lifting up to her as she stood in the door frame
"What was it?"
>He looked like he held shame
>Like he thought what he had done was wrong
>She stepped forwards again towards him
"You must be so mad at me."
>She knew he couldn't be so wrong 
>But she walked towards his reclined spot
"I didn't want to kill him."
>She stood in-front of him. 
>He held his head low
>His eyes couldn't bear to look into the vixens own and see the sadness in them he had brought to them
>She knew if she simply spoke to him that he would simply dismiss them
>Filing them away to hollow comfort
>So she did what she knew couldn't be misinterpreted
>What would show him just how she felt

>You kept your head low
>Like a puppy that had pissed on the rug
>She probably hated you for killing another anthro
>What if she knew him
>What if it was someone she liked
>Or worse than that a lover?
>So you sat there wallowing in shame
>You didn't even think about trying to scare him off or sparing him
>You had devolved into a beast and simply killed him
>But you had to right?
>Your mind raced as you waited for a slap across the face
>Or for her claws to rake across your chest
>But it never came
>The only thing you felt was warm fur on your head

>As you sat there like a complete loser you felt her warm fur on your forehead
>Her arms wrapped around your neck as she pulled you into a hug
>What had inspired this?
>This was one of the least likely responses from Lisica you had considered 
>To show you affection for what you had done
>You had killed one of her kind
>How could she possibly be grateful? 
>But she squeezed you tighter as she spoke again
>"Thank you."
>You wanted to push her off and ask why?
>But you weren't about to look a gift horse in the mouth
>For reasons that you didn't know she was happy about this
>And you decided to just go with it
>You wrapped your arms around her and pulled her in closer
"I'm sorry Lisica."
>You felt her hand rest on your head 
>Petting you as you sat there in her embrace
>You breathed deeply simply deciding to enjoy her warmth
>She hooked a finger under your chin to bring your gaze to her eyes
>They held no anger for you 
>The happy wistful eyes of the vixen looked at you with nothing but happiness
>You felt her fiddling with something behind your head but you chose to ignore it when you looked over her once pristine fur
>Splotches of blood matting down her fur on some places
>Her chest and her hands were stained with blood from that wolf 
>But as she pulled away from you you felt something hanging from your neck
>Looking down you took the bauble in your hand
>A wooden fox
>Stained red on the tip of its ear
>You looked between your new necklace and her face 
>She looked like she was waiting for you to speak
>and after a few moments considering how you would respond to her you spoke
"Thank you."
>Another heartbeat past before you spoke again
"I love it."

>This was something that must have mean alot to her
>She had reacted so joyfully when you had given her that lighter so maybe these kinds of actions had quite a bit of significance to her kind
>So you stood slowly again
>Pulling her in close to you and speaking gently to her
"Thank you."
>You tipped her white muzzle up towards you 
>and kissed her again
>It felt the same as the first time 
>No lust behind it
>It was a display of pure affection
>You felt her press herself against you gently as you let your mind wander 
>Eventually the two of you seperated
>You felt a smile work its way back onto your face
"C'mere lets get you cleaned up. Cant have my Lisica looking like that"
>So the two of you walked over to the sink
>Shedding your shirt, or at least what remained of it
>And using a clean washrag to get the most of the blood out of her coat
>You reached under the counter looking for the brush your father had stashed here for his hunting dogs
>Having found it you made your way back towards the crackling fire
>You sat cross legged with her sitting nicely in your lap
>The comb gliding through her fur
>Every stroke seemed to elicit a reaction from her
>Her back arching slightly as you brought in down the center of her back
>Or as her tail flicked about when you drug it down the lithe apendage
>Her happy little noises only encouraging you to continue
>every now and then the teeth of the comb would snag on a knot and she would jump slightly 
>But with deft and gentle movements you managed to work out the rough spots 
>She simply melted into you as you worked
>"You should do this more often. I've never felt anything like this before..."
>She closed her eyes as she leaned back into you 
"You wont have to ask me twice"
>You continued to groom her
>Her coat looking its best since you had first laid eyes on the vixen
>The warm glow of the fire, and the brush strokes serving to fluff out her coat even more so

>As the day turned to evening you felt her breathing soften. 
>Her body going lax in your arms as you continued to groom her
>She seemed so happy in your arms
>A world of difference from when you first found her just a few short days ago
>But this little vixen had turned your world on its head. 
>You continued to comb her fur
>Its pure sheen reflecting some of the firelight and giving off an aura that words could not accurately describe
>It was like the morning sun reflecting off of a fresh winter snow
>You knew she was sleeping
>But he just couldn't bring himself to move yet
>The risk of rousing her from her sleep was too great 
>You could sit like this for days with her
>Just enjoying her presence and you could tell she felt the same for you.
>But he felt a yawn coming on and he decided now was the best time to move with her
>You hooked a hand under her and lifted her sleeping body up into his arms
>Smiling as she pushed her head and neck into the crook of his neck and tried to find a more comfortable spot for herself
>Carrying her gently you pushed your way into the bedroom
>You laid back into the bed
>Pulling back the sheets you fell back
>Her fire warmed body laid against you as you pulled the sheet over the two of you
>You had never felt more comfortable in your life. 
>Her silver lighter hanging around her neck reflecting the moonlight
>And your own wooden necklace cold against your skin
>You wrapped an arm around her and pulled her closer
>Letting the sweet embrace of sleep overwhelm you as it had her
>Your wounds all but forgotten
>Warm and comfortable in each others arms.

>The cold night air has no effect on you
>The warm bundle of fur and fluff that lay next to you was more than enough to keep the cold at bay 
>But as you were roused from your sleep you felt her stir slightly
>You looked down to see her face nestled against you
>Her ears and tail twitching in her sleep
>You could only imagine what she was dreaming of
>But her face was not the peaceful one you had fallen asleep to 
>So you did the only thing you thought would help
>You ran a hand down her back
>Petting her soft white fur gently 
>Trying to lull her back to a peaceful sleep
>Leaning in you kissed the top of her head
"Shhhh its okay."
>You spoke in a gentle whisper
"I'm here."
>You continued to pet her gently
>It was at times like this when you really appreciated her happiness
>How she looked at you when you were brushing her hair last night
>But as the moments went on you felt her calming down 
>Her twitches and murmurs in her sleep calming back down 
>Her face returning to that happy smile that you so loved. 
>And as she slept you to found yourself slipping back into the sweet embrace of sleep. 
>Wondering what she was dreaming about

>As the sun crept into the window above a single beam of light struck her right in the face 
>Her features contorting until she could no longer ignore that cursed sun
>His back was to the window and as a result he had not woken up yet. 
>She shifted slightly not wanting to abandon the warmth of their bed yet
>She giggled softly as she looked up 
>He had a line of drool running out of the corner of his mouth
>This was her fearsome Jager 
>The Jager that had killed a wolfpack alpha in single combat.
>She decided it was best to let him be
>He could wake up when he wanted to
>But as she shifted she felt something poking her hip

>Her curiosity overwhelming her she snuck a look down under the sheets
>And what she saw made her blush harder than she could ever remember
>Her Jager's manhood was pitching one hell of a tent in his boxers
>Her brain locked up 
>Should she just ignore it?
>But when would she get another opportunity to see him at his *ahem* fullest.
>the temptation to slink down beneath the covers and peel back the cloth prison holding him back was great
>Her hips shifting with need 
>But as she moved to release herself from his grasp and duck down below to explore her Jager
>He moved
>Pulling her closer to him with one of his arms
>She could feel her breasts pressing against his pecs. 
>And worse yet she felt his arousal pressing hard against her thigh
>She felt her body heating up
>Every nerve was honed to a razor's edge. 
>She felt his heartbeat 
>The heat his body was giving off
>His rhythmic breathing 
>Even his nearly silent whispers
>Her ears perking up as she tried to listen in to him
"Lisica...I need you"
>She didn't think she could blush any harder
>Was this the moment
>Where she would become his vixen
>Thoughts raced though her head
>Would she take advantage of his unconscious lust?
>No that would be wrong of her
>It was the male's place to initiate her becoming his
>So she sat there in silence for a few minuets
>Trying her best to block out her animal instincts
>But she could only do so much
>Her body was reacting despite her minds best efforts to resist
>She could feel herself getting hotter and hotter
>Her ears folding back as she let out a pathetic whine
>Her tail whipping against the mattress
>She watched as her writhing in his grip seemed to rouse him from his slumber
>His eyes tightening before they opened slightly

>You hadn't slept that well in a long time
>Even your first night with her hadn't been this good
>But as reality invaded your senses you remembered how you had fallen asleep
>With Lisica in your arms 
>As you looked down you smiled 
>Her ears were splayed back against her head 
>And you could see her blush even through her thick white fur
>Was something wrong?
>You tried to think for a few seconds
>Did you do anything wrong?
>But as you thought you felt her shimmy slightly against you
>The reality of your situation crashing down on you like a ton of bricks
>Yours eyes shot open and every fiber of your being wanted to push off of her and apologize until you were blue in the face
>But there was something about this moment
>Something special about how her eyes were still locked with yours
>Maybe this was the moment
>You pulled her closer to you as you ducked your head down
>You felt her lips touch your again
>There was something feral behind this kiss though
>While it was not as pure as your first kiss it was no less special to you 
>It was one of desire
>You wanted to give her all of you and you wanted to experience all of her
>You felt her push her hips into you 
>Her delicate moan of desire
>You felt her hand drift down from your chest to your boxers
>Pushing them down gently
>You felt your manhood spring free 
>Her hands roaming over it as she explored her mate to be
>You let your own hands wander over her body
>Your hand gliding over her hips up to her own chest
>Squeezing gently you heard her sigh at your touch
>While you wanted nothing more in your heart of hearts to simply flip her onto her front and ravage her
>You wanted to be gentle with her
>So you kept up your oral dance
>Your lips pressing against hers only breaking to come up for air
>You looked into her eyes 
>They bore the same joy as when you had given her your lighter

>She shifted next to you
>Pushing herself onto her front as she flipped her tail up. 
>You grinned as she presented herself to you
>As much as your inner man wanted to pounce on her
>You wanted to make this special for her
>even more so than you assumed it already was to her
"Lets do it my way."
>She craned her neck to look back at you letting out a needy whine
>"But this is how all the vixens back in my pack had taught me"
>You smiled as you flipped her over onto her back
>Her tail swaying under her as she brought her legs up slightly
"This is how Jagers make love."
>You pushed yourself between her legs
>Your turgid manhood pressing lightly against her slit
>You leaned in towards her face as you pressed gently against her
>"I've never had a mate before..."
>You stopped your advance
>Looking up at her she seemed almost ashamed
"Don't worry Lisca. I've got you."
>You kissed her again 
>She seemed to calm down with your touch
>You started to push into her again
>She shifted under you her fingers digging into the mattress
>Her moans were intoxicating and drove you to try ever harder to slide into her. 
>But just as you thought you were about to slide inside her you slipped
>Your shaft laying against her hips
>"Maybe I'm just not enough for you"
>She turned away from you 
>She looked like she was on the verge of tears 
>You were not going to let her first time end like this
>So you did the only thing you knew to do. 
>You ducked down to kiss her again
>She seemed to relax back into you
>Seemingly content in just enjoying your embrace
>But with a free hand you aimed your manhood again
>Pressing slightly against her flower
>And with one deft motion you bucked your hips forwards. 
>And you felt your cock delve into her
>Her eyes widening with shock as she let out a feral moan
>"God above!"
>You drank in her reactions like a fine wine. 
>Each twitch and moan serving to drive you forwards

>You waited a few moments to let her get used to you
>She was a good bit smaller than you after all and the last thing you wanted was to hurt her.
>You spoke to her again to make sure she was okay
"You say the word and I'll stop. I don't want to hurt you."
>You wanted her first time with you to be amazing. 
>And you'd be damned if through your own arrogance and lust you ruined this for her
>But when she nodded you knew you were ready to keep going 
>She was astoundingly tight
>Her walls massaging you with every flex and twitch
>You drove forwards in at an agonizingly slow pace. 
>Each inch you pushed into her elicited another reaction
>High pitched moans and hitches in her breath making you want to throw caution to the wind
>Her claws digging into the mattress as her tail whipped about. 
>Eventually her eyes shot open as you felt yourself hit a barrier
>"Oh!"
>You looked down to her and saw there was only a few inches of yourself left outside her
>But you knew she had her limits
>You drew back out of her
>Pulling out almost as slowly as you had driven into her
>Until only your tip remained inside her
>Then you drove back in
>Remembering to stop short of where you had gotten on your first attempt. 
>Creating a strong and steady rhythm as you well and truly made love to that beautiful white vixen. 
>Your groans creating a harmony with her own as you made her your vixen
>You could tell she was having the time of her life
>Sharing one of her most intimate experiences with you was something you'd cherish for the rest of your life. 
>The two of you lit by the morning sun moved in harmony
>Her hips starting to push up towards your own as you found your pace. 
>Each moment that went by saw your pace increase. 
>You movements becoming faster and harder as she shouted with pure pleasure.

>you wanted to make this last longer and if it weren't for her body's incredible tightness you would. 
>But at the very least you wanted to see her climax before you did. 
>"Oh gods above. Yes!"
>You felt her body beginning to twitch
>If you had to guess you knew what was coming for her
>You felt your own climax rushing towards you only a few errant motions from rushing over that precipice. 
>You leaned down and embraced her
>Your lips meeting hers as you felt yourself cum
>Her muffled shouts of please mixed with your own body's primal pleasure
>You felt each spasm of muscle as you rode out the last few waning moments of your climax
>You wanted to simply collapse but Lisica pulled away from her kiss
>Stopping you from pulling out
>"No. Leave it in. Just for a little while?"
>You smiled down on her
>Her panting smiling face was impossible to deny. 
>You rolled over pulling her in close to you
>Her chest rising and falling against your own as you closed your eyes and tried to simply enjoy the moment
>Her hand draped across your chest 
>"Thank you."

>You turned your head down to face her
>Pressing your lips together for a moment before you responded
"That was amazing. You're amazing Lisica"
>You simply basked in the afterglow of your first time with Lisica
>There was a slight sting on your chest where she laid but you could honestly care less
>Her soft fur rubbed on you as she rested on you
>This truly was a beautiful moment
>Alone in a wood cabin with a beautiful woman 
>You felt her move slightly against you 
>Her head resting on your chest as your arms wrapped around her
>You just wanted her to be even closer to you 
>But a thought filtered through your brain
>One that you hadn't really considered through this whole weekend getaway
>This was the last day you could spend out here
>And you had to get back to your home
>That thought wiped the grin off of your face
>Your hand that had been idly stroking her back stopped suddenly 
>She apparently took notice of your attitude change as she looked up at you
>"Whats wrong?"
>Her voice was charged with legitimate concern
>You continued to stare up at the ceiling as you tried to think of a way to stay out here just a day longer
>But nothing came to you
>There were a few anthros in the city but they were few and far between
>Most of them having been brought up as glorified servants or help staff 
>You weren't sure how people would react to you being in such an intimate relationship with an anthro
>But as your gaze drifted back down you locked eyes with her
>Those piercing eyes that seemed to stare deep into your very soul
>And your heart was charged with passion again
>Those other people could rightly go fuck themselves
>You were happy with her as she was with you
>What more could you ask for?
"Nothing's wrong Lisica"
>She seemed to relax slightly
>Her tail swishing with content
>"I love you."
>Those words 
>Those three words carried with them such weight
>And your reply was genuine 
"I love you too."
