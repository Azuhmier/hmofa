STUDENT OF THE SULTRY TOME

BY LAZ BRIAR


>The duties of the Librarius Sola are particularly burdensome this week
>You've noticed, over the past few days, a series of older, human-written tomes have been transported to the 
private sanctum of Ofelia
>As one of the only dutiful scribes available, it is you under pain of responsibility to find these scripts and 
deliver them to her
>This is usually not a concern, yet, some of these texts linger in corners of the Librarius that you're 
surprised still exist
>Even more surprising is their content - or perhaps lack of; you do not recognize ANY of the authors, and they 
seem to be musings of personal affairs
>How strange, you think

>Indeed, you are an apprentice scribe to Ofelia, Matriarch of Words
>Or was it, Keeper of Grand Syntax?
>No, no, perhaps Priestess of the Pale Scroll
>Ah well, grand titles are common amongst the high-beasts in the capital of Solaria
>It is befitting, you figure - she is, after all, a Pegasarii, one of the noble high servants Empress Eternal 

Karletta Frampt
>She is a pegasarii and you but a human, caught in the grand white halls of service, specifically the 

Librarius, a massive codex of written works stretching throughout the Empire, perhaps farther
>From this, you attend and nurture each book like a child, given the proper time
>And make no mistake, this is a task fit not for everyone
>Some of these books are massive; some inscribed in stone!
>You move them, examine them, collect them, and store them
>All under the whim of Ofelia

>Despite the labors, you don't mind it
>In fact, you find it quite exhilarating!
>Some days you sneak a small book about the "high-beasts," the noble blooded anthropoids who serve and guard 
the capital
>In it are luxurious tales spun in grand epics; indeed, the pegasarii who fly on wings of fire, or the ember-
tailed vixens with burning lances, or the pale lions whose cries invoke the wrath of the sun itself
>When you're lucky, sometimes there are personal accounts, and those accounts come with sketches
>Ahh, you are always amazed - the high beasts are clad in intricate armor and weapons befitting only the 
strongest of warriors
>You admit, you often look at the pegasarii a bit too long
>It's hard not to
>Ofelia is one, though retired from her noble services
>To the eye she is an unassuming anthropoid mare at first glance
>But upon second, the wielder of the gaze is treated to a lovely figure of snowy white horsehair crowned with a mane of strange reds
>You say strange, because Ofelia's mane seems to shimmer like fire
>Of course she is often in noble habit of gold and scarlet
>And her wings, ahh! Mighty and lofty, fit for such a mythical creature
>How she came upon the service of the Librarius Sola you aren't sure, but you don't complain

>It's a new day, and after your morning sup of bread and cheese, you return to a task picked by Ofelia
>She's requested one last book, somewhere in the aged columns of human indexes
>You note she's been fascinated with them as of late, though you don't question it
>Likely she is just conducting research; after all, there's more to Solaria than just low-beasts
>At any rate, you go to the section of the Librarius, a lonely corner at one of the low levels
>In it are tomes left unattended, mainly because they are loose patchworks of scribbles, random notes, poor 

attempts at novella, and you think a child's portrait of a knight
>You are methodic, however, and finding the sum of Ofelia's intrigue is a task you are happy to comply with
>After some sifting, you indeed catch the small thing, a dainty book wrapped in red
>The title is worn beyond recognition - you only make out some of it
>All you can compile is "utra," and that appears to be in Low-Anglic
>But, it fits Ofelia's definitions perfectly, and your careful eye confirms the rest
>With tender care, you hoist the thing and return to the elevator mechanisms, heading to Ofelia's private 
quarters

>The quarters are in the highest part of the indexes, a large circular room, filled with ornamentations and 
devices mysterious to you
>A grand telescope sits on one side for the dissection of star-paths, while a center table is where Ofelia 
rests her current object of fancy
>You enter with polite diligence, careful with your prize
>"Grand Mistress, I've retrieved the tome, as you asked," you say, not quite seeing her
>For a moment, you wonder if she isn't there; usually, she's occupied with something, and it's hard to miss the 
wings
>You decided to place the book on her center desk - you're sure she'll find it
>As you approach, you notice there are several tomes open, pages flicked through, bookmarked, read
>It's not your business to mind the affairs of a pegasarii, but you are curious
>Setting the book on the table, you take a gander, and. . .
>Oh my
>These are certainly the earlier passages you retrieved, but they're not what you expected
>They're. . . adult in nature, to put it bluntly
>The books have scribbled sketches and images, and in particular, of very 'compromising' positions
>To be blunt, they're quite erotic in nature
>You hear a laugh
>"Finding the indexes interesting, student?"
>You jump, as Ofelia approaches from the side, wings fluttering as her hoofs click against the stone floor
>"Er, well. . ."
>You try to muster some words, but anything you might say paints a lie against your expression
>Ofelia waives you off, amused
>"You needn't lie, student. I find them fascinating. Humans ponder such lustful things."
>You clear your throat, stepping back
>"I suppose we do," you say
>You attempt to shift the subject - "I've brought the passage you asked f-"
>Ofelia struts up to you, a smirk pulling at her lips
>You forget how much larger she is than you, several hands by estimate, and her wings certainly make her 

daunting
>"I know what you brought, student."
>She holds out her hand, expecting
>At proximity, you can't help but notice her scarlet habit is more. . . exposed than usual
>In fact, the split of her massive cleavage looms over you, her gentle breaths send the weighty breasts 

wobbling ever so gently
>You try not to mind this, handing over the worn book
>"Ahem, well, it uh. Appears to have sustained some. . . damage. . ."
>She takes the piece and immediately begins flipping through it
>Her scarlet eyes dance over the pages and you can see her smirk widen to a sinister smile
>The white fur blossoms with blush as her cheeks flush
>"Yes, just what I was hoping to see. . ." she says
>You can only imagine what lingers on those pages, but, remembering yourself, you attempt to bow and leave
>You don't know why, you feel you'd rather stay and. . . look
>"If nothing else, Grand Mistress, I will uh, take my-"
>Her gaze snaps to you
>"Leave? Oh no, you'll do no such thing, student."
>You're taken aback; what else could she need?
>Setting the book aside, she looks you over with a grin most wicked
>Her hands trail behind her, unfastening, and at once, her habit robes fall away
>"I need a plaything to sate my curiosity, after all."

>"Mistress! I-if the scarlet clerics happen upon me, surely I'll be flayed!"
>Ofelia has decided today, of all things, you are suited to a different task than just shuffling books
>Keeper of pages she might be, the pegasarii is still imbued with strange magics
>She's used them to, well, bind you, having clamped you to a bed
>You've been stripped and, to your embarrassment, exposed for her
>Her nake, curvaceous figure sends wild thoughts through your mind
>The fat rump and hefty bust are like something out of a dream, causing your malehood to spring up like a 
newborn tree
>"The scarlet clerics have better things to do."
>It's clear Ofelia cares little for the regiments and routines of the Solarian orders; what terrible mischief!
>Clamped on her large, luxurious bed, she approaches you, eyes tossing over your figure
>"Now then, what use can I get from you, I wonder. . . we'll need to do something with this, I think."
>You grunt, frightened yet quite aroused, as she crawls over you, her finger coming to tap at the tip of your 
flank
>"I. . ." You cannot find any words for this "predicament," though, you feel yourself less interested in 
combatting the situation
>A new sensation comes over you, however, like liquid warmth
>Tendrils of gold wrap around your shaft, and to your immediate shock, you seem to be "growing" larger
>It feels astounding, really, the whole of your loins trembling
>Until, as soon as this 'enchantment' began, your flesh is like that of a stallion
>You now, quite literally, have a cock of glowing light
>That's. . . different
>The pegasarri seems pleased, taking her hand and immediately stroking the reforged mast
>An amazed breath escapes you, as you squirm against the magical behinds, soft silky palm caressing your groin
>"This will do quite nicely, student. It's so hard finding any males with the strength to please me. So many 
broken, old men. But you. . ."
>Her face is wild, and now, her soft, moist lips come to your tip
>Oh by Sol Solarius! Is she doing what you think she is?
>Yes, she applies warm, mirthful kisses against the sides of your fiery cock, mumbling in adoration as she does
>A tongue leaps to lap at the side, then the tip, watching you for reactions
>You, of course, are beside yourself with pleasure
>Not only is this strange, enchanted flesh larger, it's far more sensitive too, sending fields of tingling heat 
throughout its length every time Ofelia touches it
>"Gagggh! Grand Mi-"
>She scoffs, "Oh, student, enough of the titles. They're such laborious things."
>She practically hugs your length with her face, smothering the flesh into her cheek, her other palm carefully 
squeezing your testes
>What wild sights! You can't believe what you're seeing; even the way your luminous shaft dimples her visage is 
such a strangely pleasing vision
>You groan, practically humping the air, though the bindings on your wrists and ankles make things difficult
>"Ohh? You like that? Fascinating. There were so many pictorials of this act, student. Humans are such a 
creative, lustful bunch."
>Laughing, she proceeds to wrap her lips about the tip, and here you practically buck
>Her giggles are muffled, pinning you down as her maw begins to suckle and serve the bright inches, slurping 
against them
>"Ngnn! By the angels of Sol!"
>What else can you say, really? This is not what you could ever imagine
>You watched with astounded enthuse as the pegasarii mare engulfs your flank, a sloppy chorus of muffled moans 
and mouth strokes filling the private chamber
>Ofelia is staring at you with those blood red eyes, clearly amused, her throat bulging as the lance of light 
dives into her
>Even her plump, white haunches sway and wiggle with her motions, like some bizarre conductor overseeing a 
sexual orchestra
>Her nose flares as her mouth drapes over your enchanted flesh, down to the threshold, gulps and sloppy trails 
of saliva escaping her
>"Nnnf, b-by the golden hammer of Frampt!"
>Worse (or perhaps better) yet, you cannot seem to reach peak
>Your cock is utterly sieged with the intense heat of an orgasm, yet you cannot seem to reach out
>What torment! Is it the magic preventing you from doing so?
>Perhaps Ofelia knows this, continuing to milk and toy with your flesh, her lips stroking every veiny inch with 
a craftsman's care
>Finally, she slows her motions, releasing you with an audible pop, the luminous malehood drizzled with saliva
>"Agh, Ofelia, this is too much!" you plead, the whole of your flesh trembling
>She regards you with an amused grin
>"Oh? I think it can be much more, student."
>You aren't sure what she means, but you don't know if you can take anymore!
>"W-what do you mean?"
>For a moment, she rises, sitting on you, her plump, soft rump resting just before the axis of your malehood
>The weight is immense, but not overly so, though you are forced to gaze at her large, heavy tits
>"Ahh, it's a shame you are bound, otherwise, you could play with me."
>She laughs a bit, taking her palms and tossing her immense bosom together
>"Perhaps for another time. . ."
>You groan, clenching your teeth; that's not fair! 
>The pegasarri seems quite happy to torment you, rubbing her bottom against the immense light-cock
>Her cheeks sandwich your loins a moment, and you can feel the sodden, moist warmth of her nether lips barely 
touch you
>Agh! By the Bright Heavens! If you don't find release soon you may perish, you're sure of it!
>Again, you try to hump, but the shimmering, magical coils holding you in place allow for no such thing
>Bah! Damned magics
>Worse, Ofelia has seen fit to lean just so, that her wobbling mantle and perky nips are but an inch from your 
face
>What sins have you committed to possible deserve such a terrible torment?
>"Ofelia! Please! If you don't grant me release I'll die! I can't stand this!"
>For a moment, the winged mare ignores you, continuing to wiggle against your shaft
>"Ahh, I'm only warming up, student."
>She sighs, exchanging position once again (much to your chagrin, you were enjoying the view of her hefty tits)
>"But I suppose you should be rewarded for your labors. You at least have the stamina I desire. . ."
>Now, the grand mare has shifted to where her backside is visible
>The immensity of her rump is quite easy to appreciate from the angle, as is the majestic splendor of her wings
>She rises, only just so, that her adequately soft, plump pussy spreads into view
>The nether lips now fondle the crown of your enchanced cock, sending small springs of aroused pleasure through 
you
>"By SOL!"
>Ofelia nickers, profoundly amused
>It has only now dawned on you what is about to happen; a confidant of the Empress Eternal, a great warrior on 
wings of fire is about to mount you like some primal mate
>Oh gods! There isn't a tome in all the Librarius which could've prepared you for this!
>"Nnmmf. . . think I made you a bit large. . ." mutters Ofelia
>Her hips dance again, and her suckling snatch parts, the wet warmth of her tunnel now enveloping you
>In one smooth, fluid motion, her bottom comes crashing upon your loins, and you're enveloped by her
>"Gah!"
>Oh by all the fields of Isarius, you wish you could reach out and grope those splendid hills of mare rump
>Alas, you are at the mercy of her actions
>Indeed, Ofelia begins to bounce her hips against your immense shaft of light
>Each rise suckles your length while each crash sends a clap of impact which echoes throughout the bedroom 

chamber
>"Ohnff. . . student. . . it feels marvelous. . ."
>Ofelia's wings begin to flap, adding momentum to her falls and rises
>Ah, and what's this? You hear her moan
>Oh it's a sound greater than all the songs sung by the clerical priests
>Though you are restrained, you fidget and squirm, doing your best to hump into the immense backside
>Each motion causes healthy, jubilant jiggles to cascade through her bottom, yet another exciting vision
>The pegasarii looks back to you, face flushed, exhaling with hot, whet groans as her hips dance against you
>"Ofelia! Agh!"
>Despite your vocation, you are truly at a loss for words
>What an animal you are, nothing but a low-beast, despite your human heritage
>The winged-mare enhances her pace, now bouncing wildly atop your luminescent cock
>Her melodic moans are something out of a dream; to think, this powerful creature is pleased by you!
>Oh, by Sol!
>She's tossing her self like a rambunctious storm now, milking you dry
>Agh! You can't take it anymore! Your enchanted flesh is roaring with an intensity like no other
>It is so overwhelmingly good it actually *hurts*
>You weren't meant to feel such incredible sensations!
>"Nnnff! student! Your lance. . . stronger than a hundred stallions!"
>Ofelia seems lost in her own estate of orgasmic delight; after all, you don't figure yourself an equine 
soldier

>By all the fires!
>It seems whatever 'lock' was in place, were there such a thing, has released
>And by proxy, so do you!
>"HNNGG!"
>Oh, heavens
>You can feel the rivers of hot white utterly bursting from you
>The emission is an utter deluge, Ofelia shouting with surprise as you drown her mare cunt with an excess of 
enchanted seed
>That's certainly not you! You can hardly believe it yourself
>And each dollop that escapes you, each 'wave' creates tremors of tingling intensity bringing you over the edge
>Again, the physical, pleasing intensity is so profound you are in a splendid agony
>You can barely see yourself as Ofelia slams her lips against you, accepting every bit of seed you eject
>Once you are spent, you breathe as though just hefting one of the ancient stone scriptures
>"B-by Sol above. . ."
>Ofelia has also ceased her motions, suckling cunny keeping you in place
>Eventually, she does shift, her damp, pink pussy slipping from you, along with a trail of hot white
>Oh heavens, thank goodness, it's over now
>You don't think you can match the stamina of anything further
>Ofelia stands now, turning to you
>She's grinning
>"A good warm up, student."
>Oh. . . no. . .

>Ofelia spends the rest of the evening toying with you and the enchanted cock
>It's a tormenting bliss
>You're freed from your shackles, but only just so, allowed to fornicate with strange new positions she locates 
from the tomes you brought
>She binds your neck with light, forcing you to fuck her while you push her ankles to her neck
>Or, she has you mount her from behind, bouncing into her soft pucker
>Your coated with sweat, and each time you think you're spent, she forces magic into the pulp of your essence 
and grants you renewed vigor
>This goes on for. . . well, frankly, you can't even keep track of time
>You think, eventually, you're allowed to rest
>The private chamber is a mess of ejaculate and Sol knows what else
>You hope Ofelia can speak on your behalf, because the other Librarius Sola attendants won't find your absence 
amusing
>Well, perhaps it would be worth it
>To have mated with a pegasarii - ah, be damned, it would be worth a flaying from the clerics
>You fall asleep again

>At some point, Ofelia wakes you
>To your relief, you are allowed to feed and bathe, along with the assurance no one will disturb you
>You go to clean in her water-room, thankful for the hot water
>You return, only to find Ofelia in the main chamber, nake once more, bending over
>You notice something, however
>This time, it's HER ankles and wrists which are bound by magical light
>"Your turn," she announces with a devilish smirk

>Oh, by the sun
