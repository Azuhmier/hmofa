Special agent anon arrives in the Red wood pines: it's a quiet out of the way town hidden away in the hills with tree's a tall as giants with the sky wrapped in a blanket of rain filled clouds, the air is cold and the roads are damp from recent rain with only the sound of your car around as if there's no life form.
