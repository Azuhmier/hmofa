>A pair of almost comical sized ears sit atop her head
>She's a mouse...person...thing?
>You give a little yelp as you jump out of bed
>She gives a little stretch and yawns before looking over at you
>"What do I have bad bedhead or something?" she asks as she ruffles her hair

>She's not surprised at all unlike you
>You throw open the door and make a mad dash to the nearest bathroom
>You catch a glimpse of her looking confused before you leave
>Breathe in...breathe out...breathe in...breathe out
>Surely there has to be some simple reason why your gf is a mouse
>Costume?

>You're just about to bring up the phone when you notice your background
>That's the picture you took with your gf on that hike last summer
>She's wearing that same outfit with the stupid hat you bought at a gas station
>The only thing different is that she looks like a mouse

>You don't remember anything about her being a mouse
>A slight breeze slips under the window frame
>Brr that's cold

>with her

>You hear a soft knock at the door
>"Hey babe, you alright? You're worrying me a little"

>You manage to mumble out a response,"I j-just had t-to take a p-piss"
>"Okay, but remember to come back soon. You want to keep the bed warm, right~"
>You swear you could hear her sexy smile on the last word
>You've got to get your shit together, and fast
>It has to be a dream, just go to bed and in the morning everything will be perfect

>She's laying there giving you those bedroom eyes
>And dat ass, unf
>Fake confidence will get you through this
>"Nah, just enjoying the feeling for a sec" you lie as you get into bed
