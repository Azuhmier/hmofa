Lovely Wings [Kingfisher; Recovery, Hugs]: When Anon takes a spill at the workplace, the quick-to-worry kingfisher responsible tries to make it up to him with a little motherly care.

>Otto Barker’s Air and Water Show
>One of the biggest tourist destinations in the city, second only to Flood Frontier Waterpark
>An amphitheater rests on the edge of a grand lake
>Empty now, but soon to be packed with visitors from across the country
>Ramps, rings, and other obstacles float on the water’s surface, while perches and even more rings stand tall for the aerial stunts
>You’re Anon, the part-time stagehand
>You’re up on the scaffolding helping to set up the lights and speakers in preparation for the show
>Many of the performers are also here, doing their rehearsals
>One bird in particular has been distracting you from work for the last hour
>She’s a gorgeous teal and gold kingfisher, lean and dexterous with a cute, narrow beak
>Needless to say, she’s part of the sky team
>She’s been doing swoops and corkscrews through the series of rings with unbelievable precision
>She eventually lands on a roost to take a break, and a stumpy muskrat calls out to her on a megaphone
>”Nice job, Perchia. When you’re ready we’ll get the fire going.”
>You don’t need eagle eyes to see Perchia’s hesitation
>She stares at the obstacle course glumly for a while, with the muskrat tapping his foot as time crawls on
>Not a second passes after she gives the A-OK are the rings ignited
>You can feel the heat even from your spot
>”Ready?”
>The music starts again, with Perchia waiting for her cue
>You stop your work completely to watch her practice
>The music swells, and Perchia dives through the first ring
>But unlike the previous runs, her rotations and speed aren’t as stellar
>Halfway through the course she’s missing some rings completely
>Skipping whole segments…
>Banking her turns too widely…
>Uh oh
>You barely have time to brace yourself before Perchia crashes into the scaffolding
>A chunk of the support breaks, and your walkway turns into a slope
>You’re thrown down the incline, trying to grab hold of something as best as you can
>A shooting pain goes through your arm as your grip is jerked away by gravity
>You’re banged up even more as you tumble downward
>Then the scaffolding ends, and you’re in a free fall to the lake below
>Your back slams against the water’s surface, immobilizing you with the shock
>With your arm useless and your spine numb, you start sinking
>You hold on to what little breath you had before it was beaten out of you
>Getting…lightheaded…
>You begin to black out
>The last thing you see is a teal missile plunging into the water toward you

>You come to your sense lying down with paramedics circling you
>Just over their shoulders is Perchia, weeping heavily
>She’s bandaged up a bit, but nothing too series
>Still, you’re a bit worried about the crash she took
>You aren’t given a chance to move much before you’re loaded into the ambulance
>Perchia is still sobbing as she tries to get one last look at you before the doors close

>A few examinations and a day of rest later you’re released with a small arm brace and little fanfare
>There’s a sprain in your arm, but nothing that won’t heal eventually
>You’re called in by management early in the morning to file an accident report 
>Liabilities and insurance stuff…
>Luckily, you get some time off with the promise of a little injury compensation for the incident
>Emphasis on “little”
>What troubles you most is what you overhear from the muskrat in the next room
>And broken hiccupping from Perchia
>”…Again, we’re not firing you, alright? Don’t worry about it. Just take a break for a few days and we’ll give it another shot, deal?”
>It’s heartbreaking to imagine the bird so stressed out like this
>The casualties weren’t even too severe, and you’re more concerned over the nasty collision she took
>You’re leaving the offices when you hear your name
>”Anon, wait!”
>For how choked up she is, Perchia definitely has a beautiful voice to match her stunning plumage
>”A-Anon, I’m so, so sorry! I didn’t mean for you to get hurt!”
>That part’s a given; it WAS an accident, after all
>You tell her you’re glad she’s okay, and apparently still has her job
>”Oh, you heard that?”’
>She sounds pained more from that than any injury
>”Well, we’re going live in a few weeks, and it’s too late to train someone totally new. But…”
>She sniffles and wipes her eyes
>”I think they considered it. Between the accident and flubbing those rings, they weren’t too happy with me. I think I’d be out the door by now if they weren’t so impressed with how I dove in after you.”
>That’s right, you remember that
>It was a pretty nice dive (from what you could see), and she probably saved your life
>”Thank you,” she chuckles, rubbing her neck
>”I’m better with water than I am with fire, I guess.”
>There’s a long, awkward pause
>You thank Perchia for her help and concern
>”Wait! Look, I want to make things right, and since we both have some time off I was hoping you’d…let me…take care of you?””
>She hides her face in her wings
>Either she’s embarrassed or already expecting rejection
>You don’t want to crush the poor girl’s spirits, but she really doesn’t need to do THAT much for you
>”It’s really no trouble, honest! I’d feel really bad if you got hurt again because of your arm.”
>Her eyes well up with tears
>You give in, if nothing else than just to keep her from crying again

>Not far from the showground is an apartment tower where Perchia lives
>It’s available to both humans and anthros, and you can a see a few other birds flying up to the balconies of their homes
>Unsurprisingly, her place is one of the highest up
>”It’s not often I have to use the elevator,” she says. “This is kind of exciting!”
>You’ve never paid much attention to how the bird anthros go about their daily lives
>So it’s a surprise to you when Perchia has to unlock her place with her feet, using a keyhole in the floor
>Immediately it feels like walking into an oversized nest
>Fabrics and cloths of all shapes and sizes are hung around the place for no particular rhyme or reason
>A few lamps are visible through the open spots in the crisscrossing decoration, making beams of light pour in
>Egg-like beanbags litter the floor, most of them untouched
>It’s a cozy space no doubt, and there’s a deliberate sort of “lived in” feeling adding to the comfort
>”I’m sorry for the mess,” Perchia says. I didn’t have much time to clean up.”
>You don’t see a bed anywhere, just chairs with blankets and sheets draped over them
>Perchia walks over to one and drops the back into a reclining position
>”I knew this would come in handy someday!”
>Doesn’t look like she shares the space with anyone, so it can’t be seeing much use
>”Yeah, it’s just me,” she says. “I don’t…have a lot of friends.”
>She rubs her shoulder with her wing, which is more of a fanning motion that makes a slight breeze
>”Don’t get me wrong, a lot of the people in the show are nice, but the other birds can be a little snobbish. I had to get in really good shape just so they’d stop looking down on me.”
>She lets out a sigh that sounds like a whistle
>”And it’s just not easy making friends with mammals sometimes.”
>You don’t see how it’s NOT easy for her
>She seems so sweet and her performance so far is wonderful
>Perchia covers her face, her beak poking through her feathers
>”Well, m-make yourself at home!”

>Perchia is like a doting mother
>Any time you move to reach something, even with your good arm, she rushes over to help
>You’re not even allowed to stand without her trying to hold you down
>You futility try convincing her your only injury is in your arm, and even then it’s not that bad
>When she needs to go to the store, you worry she might strap you down so you won’t get in trouble
>”I’ll be right back! Don’t…right back!”
>She heads out to the balcony and locks the sliding door behind her
>The beautiful kingfisher gives one quick peek to you before making a graceful dive off the ledge
>She’s definitely not heading in the direction of any store at first, as she circles back into full view
>Checking up on you already?
>Maybe showing off a little bit?
>True to her word though, she has a satchel of groceries with her in minutes of leaving
>A lot of chopped veggies, grains, noodles, and very lean slices of fish and meat
>Guess birds don’t like to carry a lot of canned foods or heavy bags when they make these kinds of trips
>Perchia sings as she cooks
>She’s shockingly good at it to boot
>”Oh, hehe, you’re too kind, Anon.”
>Why wouldn’t she go into a musical field with that kind of voice?
>”Every bird thinks she can sing, unfortunately, and there’s a lot of competition out there. You can’t even get work unless you join some kind of agency.”
>Not many birds go into performing, then?
>”Theater and movies? Of course! But just the kind of stuff that’s safe and shows off their plumage. Not many want to be flying through rings of fire.”
>All the more reason you think Perchia is such a talented one
>She covers her face yet again, flinging soup splatter off her spoon everywhere
>Perchia is pretty fond of noodle dishes, and she serves you ramen for lunch
>Well, it IS the food of choice for a young bachelor(ette)
>It’s pretty damn good ramen as well
>Perchia waits until you’re practically done with your bowl before even making a dent in her own
>When you’re finished she tries to get you to take some of hers
>Not like there isn’t more in the pot…
>Eventually you have to get some blood flowing in your legs, putting Perchia on edge
>”You’re not leaving already, are you?”
>You don’t think she’s the type who cries to manipulate people, but man is she easy to upset at times
>You tell her you just want to go for a walk and stretch a bit
>”Oh, great! I’ll come with you!”
>She hurries to clean up a bit, noticing the blankets covering the reclining chair
>”You know, you’re welcome to stay a few nights.”
>Things are moving pretty quickly now
>Maybe a little too much
>But Perchia seems to sense this, and she waits for your answer without the tears or pushing you too hard
>Well the place is cozy, the food’s good, and she seems like a really cool friend 
>Sure, you’d be hap-
>”EEEEEEAAAAA! Great! We can swing by your place if you need anything!”
>So, you end up stopping at home, having to take a bus part of the way to get there
>You don’t want to impose, so you ask how long she’s comfortable having you
>”Just take everything you can pack!”
>That’s the greatest, creepiest non-answer you could get
>You return from the excursion a few hours later carrying several bags of your stuff
>You’re a little worried how much space your things are going to take up in such a cramped little abode
>You stack your belongings neatly into a corner
>Perchia immediately spreads them around on the floor casually and waves dismissively
>”What I have is even too big for me. Besides, I don’t like to spend much time here anyway.”
>You would have never guessed that from how shut in she kept you today
>By now it’s getting late in the evening
>Perchia at least gives you enough privacy to get ready for sleep
>”Goodnight, Anon,” she says
>The bird sits up in one of the other chairs, as though meditating
>She must sleep like this, because you never see her change positions even in the middle of the night
>Even if she accepted you into her home with open wings, you don’t want to burden the poor girl to exhaustion

>She’s already awake before you
>Breakfast is waiting as well
>Hash browns, waffle sticks, fruit…
>”Sorry, I didn’t cook any eggs.”
>Yeah, that might have been a bit of a problem for her
>”Tell me about it. They’re so hard to carry safely from the store when you’re flying.”
>Oh
>”Hehe, you haven’t met a lot of birds, huh?”
>Guess not, or at least enough to know about their egg-laying culture
>It’s another meal where you’re offered part of her food on top of your own, giving her more time to plan the day’s events
>”So, anything you’d like to do? Did you still want to go over to the waterpark?”
>Wait, “still”?
>”O-oh? I guess that conversation must have been part of my dream last night.”
>Freak-out in 3…2…1…
>”I-I-I MEAN, uh, you were in the dream, but I wasn’t, we didn’t, ngghh…”
>She’s hard to console with just words, so you try a different approach
>You hold out your arms for a hug
>This actually works, as Perchia creeps closer to you
>”Careful, your arm…”
>It feels much better already thanks to her
>Even though it might be a few days before you can go to the waterpark, what with the brace and all
>”So you won’t need me soon, then?”
>If she’s happily offering her home to you, you’re not going to spurn her help for a bit longer
>Plus, you need to make it up to her for her hospitality
>”No! I was repaying YOU. I don’t feel like I’ve done enough….”
>Maybe being a friend would be a good start?
>Honestly, you never knew just how much you liked birds before holding one in your arms
>Everything is soft, but in a different way than a “furry” anthro is
>She has an incredibly athletic physique, yet she feels much lighter than you’d expect
>There’s a remarkable warmth radiating from her body, especially with her wings folded over you like a cape
>Perchia laughs nervously
>”I-I don’t want to sound like I’m blaming you or anything but…when I miss a cue or don’t fly fast enough, it’s because I get distracted by you, Anon.”
>The last thing you’d believe is that a beautiful performer has the same feelings for you as you do her
>”I’d feel bad if anyone got hurt or…worse…because of me, but it was even harder to watch it happen to YOU.”
>You ask if it was because of you that she had trouble with the fire rings
>”No! Well, no, I mean…a little bit. I just didn’t want you to see me mess up, and I ended up doing it anyway. The heat only makes it worse when you’re already a bit flustered….”
>There’s a bit of guilt in her eyes
>But it could be a reflection of your own
>You were holding her back, technically speaking
>Would she even be able to perform if she knew you were watching?
>”Actually….”
>Her voice has a budding speck of confidence you haven’t seen much so far
>”Knowing a good friend is watching would put me at ease. I was afraid you’d judge me before, but….”
>You give her a tight squeeze, patting her on the back
>You have enough time off to see all of her opening shows, if she wants you there
>She responds with a giggling tweet

>There’s a fair amount to do around the city apart from the water shows and Flood Frontier
>You spend most of the day with Perchia just milling about the streets, checking out the shops, and getting to do things unfit for a loner or too intimate to do with a large group
>Like taking scenic pedicab rides, or getting cheesy pictures at photo booths
>The bird obviously spends much more time than you do here when she’s not practicing for performances, but still rarely gets to experience everything the city can offer
>Between the excitement and caring for you at her place, she’s absolutely spent when it starts getting late
>You’re preparing for bed while she sits on her chair, fidgeting to get comfortable
>You ask if she always sleeps like that
>”Well, I don’t HAVE to, but it’s just natural to me.”
>It could be the fatigue talking, or it could just be her way of warming up to you
>But Perchia’s certainly getting bolder when her wings spread open and she scoots back into her seat
>”Would you…like to try it?”
>You sit on her lap, and her wings wrap around you like a cloak
>”You can lean back, if you want.”
>Her chest, shoulder, and neck are downy touches better than any pillow you’ve ever felt
>Her breathing is slow and hypnotic, gently rocking you into relaxation
>She coos a soft lullaby, barely passing out of her beak and into your ear
>You can only imagine this is what it feels like to be a bird’s young chick, encased in a feathery protection
>”I’d love for you to stay here with me,” Perchia says
>She’s clever, you’ll give her that
>She waited until you were too tired to say “no”
>And now she’s swaying you to sleep with the idea planted into your dreams
>It’s definitely the most refreshing rest you’ve had in years

>A cloudless day over the lake
>The amphitheater is jammed with humans and anthros of all kinds
>There are a surprising number of them in bathing suits, whether they’re just coming back from the waterpark or expecting to get drenched here
>The show has it all: water skiers and paragliders, watercraft pulling synchronized pyramids of balancers, high divers and even stuntmen shot from cannons
>It’s not too long before the “air and water show” introduces some heat
>Lanes of flame streak across the lake surface and a fiery curtain rises close to the front row, drawing everyone’s attention skyward
>Intense drumming sounds from the speakers, and Perchia appears on her perch
>With a proud flourish, the kingfisher leaps from her tower and soars through the flaming rings
>Each one she flies through is snuffed out in her wake
>She moves with an ethereal precision even more awe-inspiring than her rehearsals
>Finally comes the “tunnel” of shrinking rings aimed at the audience
>She told you there was a surprise added on at the last minute, inspired by the day the two of you were brought together
>Coming through the final ring she sails at the water right before the amphitheater
>Some of the crowd recoils in fear of the incoming bird
>Perchia plunges under the surface like a dart
>The higher seats lean forward to try to find her, while those in the front keep their distance from the screen of fire
>Before the ripples have a chance to settle, a teal-and-gold missile shoots back into the air
>She twirls above the audience, tossing glistening droplets in every direction
>The crowd screams and cheers as they’re sprinkled
>That’s the cue for the fire curtain to recede, as if doused by the graceful kingfisher
>Perchia climbs higher and out of sight, getting the biggest applause you’ve heard in the show
>Especially from you, clapping with two good arms until they both become sore
>She doesn’t show up again until after the performance is over, where a line of entertained guests are getting pictures and her autograph
>You expect this will go on for quite some time, every day of the show
>But you patiently wait for her to finish with a smile on your face
>After all, she’s your ride back home
