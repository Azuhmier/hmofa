>Be Anon. 
>You’re currently standing buck ass naked in front of your bathroom mirror, fresh out of the shower and shaving your face. 
>Though earlier on you were feeling pretty shit, the shower helped you relax and calm down after today’s events. 
>On the counter beside you is your cell phone, which suddenly chirps loudly, startling you and causing you to nick your upper lip. 
>You rinse the cream off your face, your shave done anyways by now, and put a small piece of toilet paper over the cut to stop the bleeding before checking your phone. 
>It’s a text from May. She’s a red panda you’re somewhat close with. 

>”hey” 

>You leave the text on read for a moment so you can put on your clothes. Then you respond. 

“What’s up May?” 

>”i heard what happened with u and Arlene. U ok?” 

>She was referring to your breakup with your now ex-girlfriend, Arlene. 
>It wasn’t particularly nasty or dramatic. The both of you just realized you weren’t fit for each other, and ended it peacefully. 
>You’d be lying if you weren’t still a little sad over it, though. 
>You leave this message on read for a minute as you head back to your room and finish getting your stuff on for the day. 
>As you slip on your necklace and put your wallet and portable charger in your pocket, your phone chirps again. 

>”Anon?... ;^;” 

>You respond. 

“Sorry, was getting dressed. I’m fine though.” 

>For some reason the difference between your texting style and hers catches your eye. Hers irks you a little bit, for whatever reason. 

>”U sure?” 

“Yeah, I’m sure.” 

>“Okai. do u wanna come over later?” she sends, before sending another. ”We can smash ;D” 

>You roll your eyes at the message. 
>This girl was probably the best person you knew at Smash Brothers, which you admittedly never played much. She always won when it was you she was up against. 
>You go ahead and text back. 

“Not even on your birthday, sport.” 

>”Nonny, come onnnnnnn…” 

“I might be down. Depends on if I get overtime again or not tonight.” 

>”oh, okai. if u wanna just text mi first.” 

“K. I gotta head to work now. ” 

>”byyyyeeeeeee c: “ 

>You put your phone in your pocket, throw on your jacket, and grab your keys before heading out to your car. 
>You’re not sure if you’ll take up May’s offer. 
>The girl was sweet and all, but honestly you weren’t sure how up to it you were tonight. 
>Then again, maybe you could use some vidya and booze… 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>You did end up getting overtime, not that it really surprised you.
>The shift was painfully dull too, and you were beat. Beat, and sad from earlier. 
>It’s close to midnight when you finally clock out. 
>You make it to your car and finally power your phone back up. 
>Two missed calls from May around 10. No texts. 
>You go ahead and call her. 
>She picks up after four rings. 

>”There you are, asshole! I thought you were ignoring me,” she giggles. 

>You chuckle. 

“Sorry about that, May. My phone was off.” 

>”Did your boss hold you over again?” 

“Yep.” 

>”God, what a dick!” 

“At least it’s money. You still down to Smash?” 

>You smile as you say that last part and hear her giggle again. 

>”Of course I am, Nonny~” She says in that seductive voice she used on her video livestreams. “I’ve been waiting for you all night~.” 

>You’re certain she can tell you’re blushing, as she begins giggling once more. 

>”I’m just teasing, Nonny. Don’t go potato on me.” 

“God you’re a bitch.” 

>”But you looooove me!” 

“Sure I do, kiddo. I’ll be over in twenty minutes or so.” 

>”Heh, okay. See you then!” 

>She hangs up, and you put your phone in your cup holder. 
>You could already tell tonight was gonna be interesting. 


>May simply calls for you to come in when you knock on the door. 
>Her apartment is dark save for the television illuminating the living room. 
>She’s laying on the couch, headset on and controller in hand, intensely focused on some shooter game you can’t name. 
>You’d stopped by the gas station and gotten some junk food earlier, and you go ahead and toss a bag of chips at her. 
>She jumps when it hits her, making her forget to release the grenade she was cooking and it go off in her characters hand. 
>The red panda lets out a huff of annoyance and chucks the bag back at you. She misses. “You dick! I nearly had that checkpoint!”

“Was this so important you couldn’t answer the door?” 

>”Yes!” 

“You’re a terrible host.” 

>You nudge her legs. 

“Scoot.” 

>She crosses her arms and spreads out on the couch more. “No.” 

“Okay then.” 

>You go to sit on her legs, which gets her to quickly move them. 
>With a smirk you put an arm over the back of the couch. 

“The fuck are you playing this for anyways? I thought you wanted to Smash.” 

>”Aww, are you eager, Nonny?” She teases, her fluffy tail waving in your face. 
>You bat it away.

“You wish.” 

>Dodging a little swish of her tail, you grab the plastic bag holding your food and lay it out on the small coffee table that’s cluttered with her other shit. 
>You see the girl at least already got the booze out. 
>May goes ahead and starts up Smash Brothers. 

“I’m not letting you win this time.” 

>You try to sound determined but she merely smiles. “We’ll see.” 

>You spend a solid hour trying to destroy her at Smash Brothers, but you just can’t beat her. Not once. 
>She even tries going easy by using Dr. Mario, and you still lose. 
>Next you go against in her CoD. That you fare somewhat better at, though she is still pretty hard to pin down and kill at times. 
>It eventually devolves to a mere game where every time one of you dies, the loser has to take a shot. 
>Around 3 am, the both of you have grown tired of games and are pretty buzzed. 
>She sets down her controller and you suddenly feel her lean against you, her head on your shoulder. 

>”Nonny?” She asks, her voice soft now as opposed to the happy, loud way it usually is. 
>You let your controller slip from your hands as you feel one of her hands rest on your chest. 
>Your face lights up and you turn your head to look at her. 
>As soon as her eyes meet yours, her hand comes up to cup your cheek and she kisses you. 
>You’re a little startled but eagerly return it. 
>God, she’s a great kisser…you knew those lips of hers would be nice, but damn. 
>When she finally breaks the kiss, you know your blush has to be visible, even in the dark. 

“Well then…” 

>She giggles softly, before shifting and crawling onto your lap. 
>She kisses you again, her hands coming around your neck, one threading through your hair. 
>Her claws tease your scalp until she finds the sensitive spot at the nape of your neck, making you shiver. Then she begins focusing her scratches there. 
>You break the kiss and meet her sultry eyes. 

“May, I-I…” 

>You what? What do you even need to say? Or want to? It’s not like you didn’t want this. Hell, you could use the attention right now. 
>The red panda merely smiles and works her claws with a little more pressure, getting you to take a sharp breath as your shudder. 

>”Shhh…” she shushes you, before giving you another little kiss. “You’ve had a bad day, Nonny. I want to help you relax is all~.” 

>You smile a bit as well before going in to kiss her this time. 
>The kissing begins getting more and more heated over the next few minutes. The both of you are edged on by the alcohol, feeling up each other’s bodies. 
>It doesn’t take much to get you hard during all of this, and she certainly felt it.
>One of her hands slides down your pants and starts teasing you with her claws.
>Finally, may pulls back from a deep kiss and whispers in your ear. “Just relax and enjoy this, okay?” 

>You nod and she shifts off of you, sliding to her knees in front of the couch. 
>Her hands undo your pants and slide your cock out from the slit in your underwear. 
>Her warm, furry hand wraps around it while the other rests on your stomach, and she begins to stroke it. 
>God, it feels good…
>A moment later, she shifts up a bit and takes you into her mouth. 
>Thankfully she isn’t one to tease. She gets right into it, suckling down hard on your length while her hand starts doing little strokes at the base. 
>Her tongue swirls around your cock as she works it, letting out a soft moan. 
>You let out a shaky breath, your hands clenching into firsts. 
>She grins ever so slightly from this reaction of yours and tilts her head before taking your entire length down her throat. 
>You gasp softly. 

“Damn, May…” 

>She holds it for a few seconds before coming back off of it and begins to jerk your spit covered cock. “Are you getting close, Nonny?~” 

>Oh lord, that voice…it made the hair on your neck stand on end. 
>You were getting close though. Each stroke made the pressure at the base of your cock grow more and more. 
>You nod, your face alight with blush. 
“Y-yeah..” 

>May’s smile grows and she takes you back into her mouth, now sucking harder and going faster, taking most of your length with each suck. 
>Your toes curl from the pleasure. You won’t last long like this. 
>And you don’t. 
>As you go over the edge and your cock goes rigid in her mouth, she suddenly takes it all down her throat. 
>You cum hard, and it shoots down the back of her throat. 
>Once your orgasm dies down she licks your cock clean before coming off of it and wiping at her mouth. 

>”Gosh…you came a lot…” 

>You give a shy laugh. 

“Heh…Arlene was never…she never was that good at giving head.” 

>May climbs back up on the couch next to you, and turns your head. 

>”Poor Nonny…” she teases, before giving you a deep kiss. “Don’t worry…I’ll make sure you don’t get so pent up again~.” 

>Her words make your heart race a little. 
>You could definitely get used to this.
