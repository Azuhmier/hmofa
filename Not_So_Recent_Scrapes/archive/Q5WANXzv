>July 10th
>it's the annual summer festival at your village
>Unlike most places your village doesn't hold a festival to celebrate the changing of season or whatever
>No, they celebrate the festival in celebration of a folklore beast called the Elkrak
>Why?
>It is believed that if you do not give her offerings and appeasement she will go into the village and steal a young male for her consumption.
>So they have the festival because they'd rather give away some food and party then find a dead man
>You of course don't really give a shit because you know it's bogus made up by some old man who wanted an excuse to drink and eat fried food and probably throw away the leftovers onto a stump
>The food DOES disappear over night but that's probably due to people just taking it when the festival is over
>Honestly, you hate the festival, you're forced to come because those that don't come are frowned upon as "non believers" and are shunned in the village
>It's genuinely disturbing how cult like the behavior is, but at least nobody is getting killed and sacrificed
>You move about the various attractions, including people dressing up in monster heads and costumes of what they think the special one actually looks like
>No one actually knows of course, but the different designs are nice
>You decide to take a sit on a bench and maybe just snooze, nobody will bother you back here away from the crowds, and if anybody asks you can say you were on the lookout for the beast
>yeah right
>Your eyes grow weary even with the smell of food and the sounds of merriment
>Eventually you fall asleep... 
>Silence
>Your hear nothing besides the sound of the wind
>You open your eyes, wondering where all the festivities went when you realize, everyone is gone, the tents are abandoned, there are no lights on besides a few dying torches, barely bright enough to see the surroundings with, but enough to ward away complete darkness
>You check your phone, it's 3 am, you must have slept far longer then you thought you would, you were hoping someone would come check on you and wake you up, but apparently you were so far off and close to the forest people didn't come near, either out of fear, or laziness to walk that far, possibly both
>You shiver, your shirt is certainly not enough for the freezing temperatures of the night.
>You think of going home, but knowing your parents coming home at this time they would think you were drinking, or doing drugs, or some other form of debauchery.
>So you decide to stick around until the sunrise at least, that way you can claim you woke up early and went out for a walk.
>You walk towards the tent and grab some paper towels and a barely lit torch, you cobble some stones together and return back to the bench you awoke from, putting them together along with some nearby twigs you make a shanty fire.
>It's not the greatest, but it'll keep you warm and that's what matters
>You reach your hands out, heat has never felt so good.
>Your stomach grumbles, you realize you haven't eaten since you arrived to this damn place.
>You walk around the few tents you can see hoping to find some food that went uneaten
>Nothing, the place is barren.
>Suppose the drunks and others took it all.
>Or maybe the beast took their offerings meant for them and is scarfing them down, haha, yeah right.
>Yet still your stomach grumbles, you suppose you'll just have to deal with it, grabbing some half drunk bottle of water and filling yourself with that.
>All in all, a comfy way to spend the morning, or night, whichever you prefer
>That is until you heard breathing from behind you
>>You fear the fire may have attracted some sort of wild life, perhaps a raccoon or a deer or something
>You flail your arm about without looking at it in hopes of scaring it away
>No luck, clearly this thing was bigger then a raccoon or deer, now you begin to swear in fear, what if it's a bear?
>But you've never seen bears in these woods, that doesn't mean they don't exist though, right?
>You decide to use your phones camera to look behind you without turning around
>As you slowly move away from your face...
>Nothing
>You breathe a sigh of relief, putting your phone down, only to have a near heart attack
>on all fours in front of you, is a creature you have never seen before, with the head of a deer, but with bone on it's face, long white bone antlers, large spiked feet, fur as black as night, and claws surely long enough to make you bleed for a while, if not to death.
>But that's not the weirdest thing, this creature seems to have two sagging lumps from it's chest, a cancerous growth perhaps, maybe this is some sort of mutated animal
>You say nothing until you realize your stomach grumbles, you curse your biological needs as it very well may have just signed your death warrant
>You close your eyes, waiting for the inevitable
>........Yet nothing happens
>You open again, you see it staring you in the face, or more apt, your gut, it runs away at lightning speed
>As soon as you attempt to get up and flee, it is back in front of you before you can even fully stretch your legs, prompting you to sit back down
>it has bags in its mouth
>You recognize those bags, they're the bags that the townsfolk set out for the beast as offerings
>Wait...could this be the beast?
>No, that makes no sense, this is just some sort of diseased animal with weird proportions
>Your doubts begin to diminish when her "growths" flash a bright pink when it sways its head towards you
>Those are not growths
>Those are breasts, big breasts
>And that beast, is very female.
>It shakes its head at you with the bag still in its mouth, grunting
>It eyes a hollow white, yet you can tell it's growing impatient
>you grab the bag from its mouth, and open it
>there's some really nice food in here,albeit some of its already eaten
>Not one to look a gift horse,err,legendary creature woman in the mouth, you start to eat what you can
>It feels amazing, after having not eaten for so long digesting food feels orgasmic
>Albeit it's a bit hard to eat with her staring at you, you make do and eventually focus on the food
>you finish eating, the bag is empty, you are stuffed
>You burp, you swear you can hear what sounds like a chuckle from her
>Or maybe that's her trying to scare you from running away as her prey
>Your eyes fall upon her breasts, with the pink tips shining out due to the cold.
>You have no idea why, perhaps it's the good in you, you gesture to the fire
>It settles near the fire, gazing with a grin upon the heat, a misty mirage of its face appearing between you and the flame
>Your eyes still locked upon its breasts, you notice an erection growing in your pants
>You hate yourself right now with every fiber of your being, your body sees the breasts and assumes it's time to start mating, when all you want to do is get the fuck out of there when it's back is turned
>You realize calling it the "beast' probably isn't the nicest thing to do in your mind, so you refer to it by it's actual name from now on
>The Elkrak, or Ms. elkrak, you think to yourself with a smile as your dick gets harder.
>You cover yourself in shame with the empty bag she gave you
>But her gaze is too fast, she already saw your erection, one of her eyes going from white to black, with a pink spiral in it
>You notice this and believe you are about to be taken to hell  in a giant blazing sinkhole that will open up from the ground
>you pray to whatever god is listening to save you, hearing a faint chuckle in the back of your mind when you do so
>Are you losing your mind?
>Her mouth opens and out pours a pink mist, obscuring your surroundings until all you can see is you and her
>You knew it, this must be how she takes sacrifices
>Your body feels like it's on fire, you have an overwhelming urge to take off all your clothes to get rid of the pain
>You do your best to resist the pain, thinking it's just an illusion and if you hold out you'll be able to make it back home
>As you look at the beast spewing pink fog, you can see it starting to heave, possibly in pain
>Are you hurting it by not giving into it's mind tricks?
>You're not exactly going to willingly let yourself burn, but you don't want to see a girl in pain either
>You start to take your shirt off, and a satisfying growl is heard from her
>First time you've ever been hooted at, and by a forest deity of some sorts no less
>you take your pants off now, only having boxers on underneath, her pink eye glowing even brighter and spiraling even harder, as if it's about to open up a portal from its eye
>You refuse to move beyond this, you may have taken off your shirt and pants to appease it, but you draw the line here
>Nothing could have prepared you for what happened next, it moved closer to you and dragged its head across your chest, licking you
>You feel disgusted yet aroused
>It's long tongue slithering around your chest and back, before finally digging into your boxers
>it becomes apparent when the wet feeling hits your cock that she's interested in eating you in an entirely different way
>Your dick is stroked up and down by her long wavy tongue, your erection nearly breaking through your boxers
>You finally get that it's pointless to resist, and take off your boxers, your cock springing into the air, hard as hell at a modest 6.5 inches
>She starts drooling
