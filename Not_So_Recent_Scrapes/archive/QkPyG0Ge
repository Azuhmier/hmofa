How many hours have passed my love,
On what day did the last leaf of summer fall in my garden of Eden,
oh how I wish the gentle winter wind that caresses my body was your warming touch once again,
It seemed as if time itself stood still for us 
How the sands of time would be fought back that lay under my aching feet digging into the earth
To feel the cool breeze of summer love again
How we danced and played under the motherly oak tree
And danced in the stars at nightfall falling asleep to the rhythm of our singular hearts.
How you held me in your strong arms
the feel of your soft exotic skin protecting me as your fingers danced and explored my body.
How different we are yet our bodies made music of burning desire as we made passionate love in the tall grass,
But that grass before lays dead apon my feet
And the Oak tree once filled with familiarity feels like a stranger
How I curse the day the divines rejected our love
Was it too pure for this world to be,to keep.
And so you were taken away from me
From the jealous powers that be
To be sent away and ostracised from my kind
How cruel can someone be to take away something so pure
their hearts, frozen like stone
With the only the feeling of hating what they do not understand
How love between a beast and man can bloom defying their odds
So they douse they youthful flame of our love
How brave you fought them but subdued when the thought of harm would come to me if you didn't obey
But you could never simply comply with people who hurt the thing you love
Defiant as you were, you gave a symbol of your love
A pendant of Phoenix red
It glistening sliver shinned like it was made of stars
Is that were you are my love, hiding behind that blanket of stars once more
But fools they are, our love cannot be stopped by distance
It will echo though the worlds and one day back to you
And when that echo of a past life comes back to you
You'll find my love burned as true as the first summer sun we slept under
And now I wait under the old oak tree
The thought of warming memories keeping my chill at bay
I hold your token of love in my arms and never letting go
Holding close like a newborn child
And so my eyes grow weary
And the chill blankets my soul
How many hours have passed my love?
I'll be waiting right here for you...
