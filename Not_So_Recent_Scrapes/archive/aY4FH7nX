What does it mean
To make love?
Passion filled nights
With moans and whispers of sweet nothings?
Carnal pleasures and sweaty romps?


No…


What about…
Breakfast in bed?
Slow walks in the garden?
Shared smiles on the living room sofa?
The inaudible clink of wedding bands
As you hold her hand and wheel her around the mall. 


…


The best time to make love
Is in the evenings 
As you gently massage her rail-thin legs. 
No words are needed 
As she hums with appreciation.


She gives you strength 
Through those wasting muscles. 
She is your foundation 
Your life. Your soul. 
And while the inevitable creeps closer
You make love to her every day.
