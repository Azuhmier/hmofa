>You really, REALLY needed this.
>And by this, you meant this vacation.
>You had gone ahead and rented a room at one of those hot spring resorts, to get away from it all and relax.
>Work was interesting and paid well, but everyone needs a vacation once and awhile; so you saved up enough time and money to not have to worry about it.
>Presently, you sit in a booth at the Resort restaurant/bar, reading the 5th book of the Dresden files.
>Yes, you were reading a book in a bar like a nerd.
>Of course, you were alone, no girlfriend or significant other to share this with.
>As sad as it sounds, work and life had just gotten in the way of dating.
>Sure, you had had a few hookups now and then but they never went anywhere sadly.
>Right as you read about Dresden getting told his nemesis is there to kill in you feel someone slide into the seat opposite you.
>You look up calmly to see a Cow Anthro with a wide fake smile.
>"Honey! thanks for getting a booth for us!" she says in an awkward happy tone.
>You are about to correct her when you notice a disappointed and frustrated bull anthro looking from you to her; double fisting glasses of some kind of beverage.
>His face goes through a range of emotions as you look at him.
>Confusion to annoyance to sheer anger all within a few moments.
>The cow looks at you with an almost pleading smile.
>You can't say no to the sad look.
>"Ohhh there you are dear! what took so long?" You ask in a fake happy tone, reaching a hand to her and grabbing one of her hands (Paws?) gently.
>The bull looks more annoyed than furious, to the point you think you can see a blood vessel under his fur; and you briefly think about what to do.
>Honestly, what did this (admittedly beautiful) Anthro think you would to do deter him?
>T-pose at him to assert dominance?
>he's built enough that he looks like he could yeet you into next Tuesday with no effort.
>Luckily, you don't have to do anything of the sort because he downs one of the drinks before stomping off angrily.
>You give a sigh of relief and look at the cow anthro for some kind of explanation.
>She gives a halfhearted smile as she pulls her hand (not paws or hooves so hand you decided) away from your weak grasp.
>"S-sorry... that guy wouldn't take no for an answer" she explains as you calmly look her over.
>She looks maybe in her late 30s to early 40s and is very.... curvaceous to say the least.
>You don't linger on her form though for politeness sake.
>"You were alone, so I figured I could.... use you to get him to leave me alone, I'm sorry" she explains.
>As you give her a warm smile, you set aside your book and push your appetizer of cheesy garlic bread towards her.
>"No need to be sorry, nobody likes a creep" you say with a smile.
>"Try some, it's good"
>She gives an almost tearful laugh with a deep smile.
>"T-thank you" 
>You grab a nibble of a piece of garlic bread yourself as you study her.
>God damn, no wonder that bull wouldn't leave her alone.
>As you noticed before, she's a cow anthro with light cream colored fur and deep auburn colored hair.
>She's got the biggest breasts you've ever seen in person, the size that made models looks like boards.
>About the size the size of medium sized watermelons?
>The table limits your view but from what you've seen she is just your type.
>But you don't push it.
>"So what brings you out here...and uh...what's your name "Dear"" you ask calmly.
>She nearly chokes on a piece of bread as she laughs at your question, then gives you a warm smile like nothing happened.
>"Ha uh... My name is Flora... and I'm here because my kid thought I needed a vacation." she answers with a sad smile.
>You sip your drink and lean towards her, elbows resting on the table.
>"Nice to meet you Flora, call me Anon" you respond, sliding your book aside.
>You calmly extend a hand to her over the table so it looks like you were trying to hold her hand gently.
>She takes your hand softly, giving you a reserved yet happy smile.
>"Hi Anon, nice to meet you" She says with a pleasant smile.
>You're taken aback at her beauty for a moment; just a moment, but still.
>Her Auburn colored hair is well past her shoulders,a smile that could light up a room and...something... a warmth exuding from her.
>Like summer's warmth after springs last frost.
>You feel yourself drawn to her like a moth to a flame.
>Your waitress appears beyond the dim of the bar with a notepad.
>"Oh, I didn't know you had company mr. Anon" the wolfess waitress says blandly, looking annoyed, "What would you and your.. guest like??"
>This specific waitress had been hitting on you non stop since you started going to that restaurant.
>You flounder for a bit, looking desperately from your menu to Flora then back to the menu.
>You never were good at picking up ladies; and suddenly you're forced to somehow navigate between a Milf and a wanting server.
>Luckily, Flora is able to bail you out.
>"Oh thank you for the extra bread" Flora states as the wolfess; whose name you never learned, sets a tray of bread and butter down.
>The wolfess seems surprised at the politeness and you give her a smile.
>"We'll take a few extra minutes to order, thank you so much" you say with what you hope is a pleasant smile.
>The wolfess seems taken aback for a moment, then smiles, albeit coldly, then takes her leave.
>"So "dear" since we are having a nice meal together, why don't we get to know each other a bit?" you ask before sipping some water.
>Flora eyes you warily for a moment before answering.
>"Already trying to get in my pants?" she huffs annoyed
>You raise your hands, and give a small frown.
>"Not at all, but when a pretty lady sits down with me for dinner, I'm gonna try to talk to her" you say defensively.
>"I mean, you sat down at my table and interrupted my reading" you say, tapping the spine of your paper back against the table softly.
>Flora gives a small cringe looking at the book than back to you.
>"Sorry...just... I get a lot of creeps like that bull" she finally says with a frown.
>"I'm just a guy who wants to know about the lady who just plopped down in front of him" you say, smooshing your book against the table when you say "plopped" so the book makes a similar sound.
>Flora gives a short chuckle at that then looks you in the eyes.
>"You mean it don't you? You're just curious about me?"
>"Not everyday you get thrown into a relationship, besides, I'm here alone on vacation; I could use some good conversation" you answer with a smile, absentmindedly rubbing a thumb on your books pages.
>Flora ears perk a bit when you say that.
>"Alone? No girlfriend or family?" she says, leaning forward, resting her head in her hands with her elbows on the table.
>"No family left, no girlfriend for a while; focused on work too much" you answer reluctantly.
>What harm is there sharing with a stranger who you will never meet again?
>"Ooooh; You're anonymous then? one of those people pulled from another world?" Flora says with some amazement and pity in her voice.
>You nod and give a quick sad smile.
>One of her hands covers her mouth while the other reaches to you in a motherly sort of way.
>"Oh my god...I... I can't imagine what you went through trying to rebuild a whole life" she says with pity in her voice.
>A pity you were used to.
>You shrug it away.
>"I was a teenager when it happened, and to be honest" 
>You give her hand a gentle squeeze.
>"I don't even remember what they looked like, so that's a plus"
>Flora looks confused for a moment.
>"They? who?" 
>My parents, my siblings, my...Everyone" you answer.
>You can see tears welling in Floras eyes, so you quickly change the subject.
>"SO! I've told you about me! now it's your turn" you state calmly, still holding Flora's fur covered hand.
>Before she answers, the wolfess returns bringing glasses of water.
>"Have you decided on what you would like to eat?" she asks pensively, eyeing your hand intertwined with Flora's.
>"Uh...I'll have the seafood Alfredo and a pitcher of voodoo ranger IPA" you respond, then look to Flora.
>"I'll have the largest salad you have" she answers, looking to the large canine with a smile.
>The wolfess (Emily, Based on her nametag) give a short nod then strides off.
>"IPA? getting me all liquored up?” she says with a cute grin.
>"Psssh, I doubt a pitcher could get you that drunk" you answer before you can catch yourself.
>"UHHH I mean, I doubt it strong enough to uh-" you flounder helplessly. 
>The rest of your explanation is drowned out by Flora's laughs.
>It's a deep motherly laugh that fills you with... something you had missed for a long time.
>That motherly warmth one would feel when they did something silly for thier mom.
>"Ohh dear, you must be a hit with the ladies" she chortels out with a wide grin, wiping a tear from one of her eyes.
>You shrug sheepishly, still embarrassed.
>"Here alone" you remind her.
>She nods a bit, still quaking a bit from laughter.
>Her fingers hold your hand a bit tighter, and she smiles at you once the laughs die down.
>"Well since you shared AND made a fool of yourself, I guess I can tell you a bit about myself" she says with laughter in her eyes.
>You smile at her at your own expense, but that smile quickly fades when Flora's happy expression turns to stone.
>"I...I got pregnant when I was 17...my boyfriend; my highschool sweetheart, took responsibility and we got married while we were in high school" she starts, looking at the table.
>Her hand closes tighter around yours.
>"He joined the military to provide for me and my daughter, then he went overseas and....Never came back" she whispers, just loud enough for you to hear over the other bar patrons.
>You feel your heart sink at that.
>To be so young...To have the one you love snatched away in an instant.
>Your clench your jaw shut for a moment as you look at her.
>She squeezes your hand once more.
>"Don't feel bad for me, I only remember what he looks like because of pictures and besides, I still have our daughter" she says with a sad smile.
>"I know how it feels to lose everything" you say with a sad smile holding her hand tight.
>She nods.
>"You know better than anyone I've ever met"
>"I'm sorry for your loss" you whisper to her alone and her alone.
>She gives a smile and whispers back.
>"I'm sorry for yours"
>You both sit in silence for a bit, just staring at each other.
>It's an odd connection with her.
>You lost everything by no one else's choice.
>She lost someone important to their own choice.
>For a moment, you try to recall the faces of everyone you left behind.
>Instead of a face, you get a generic human; a mock-up of who they were.
>More than a decade will do that.
>So instead of that, you focus on the woman in front of you.
>The only person who you had met who might have an idea of what you have gone through.
>Well the only female, the Anonymous forums were full of men who lost everything.
>As you think about it all, a human male appears carrying plates of food and a pitcher of beer.
>"Your meals are here" he says with a slight accent you can't quite place.
>Italian? french? one of those romance languages.
>You nod to him in thanks and Flora gives a full hearty smile.
>"Thank you" you say in response to the meal delivery.
>He gives a curt bow then disappears like magic, leaving you with Flora.
>The two of you eat silently, yet you feel your heels and calves intertwine with hers a few times.
>You didn't mean to suggest anything but she was just like you in a sense.
>For a full 20 minutes the two of you just eat and drink.
>Throughout the meal you are silently refilling her beer and her refilling yours.
>But the two of you are almost always in contact with each other.
>Even if it's just a fingertip or your shoe meeting her hooves.
>After you both finish eating you motion to the waitress and ask for the check.
>Flora looks at you in annoyance and protest.
>"Let me pay for my part, well let my daughter" she says as you hide the check away from her until the waiter can come by to take it away.
>You give her a stoic smile.
>"What kind of gentleman would I be if I made a lady and a guest pay for a meal" you say in defiance to her.
>She looks both impressed at you and annoyed.
>"I...I've never had someone do this for me" she says awkwardly, looking at the table.
>You reach a hand to her and silently grasp her furred hand.
>"I've never had someone to do this with" you respond with a stone face.
>Her look of shock and pity hurts a bit, but her response made it worth it.
>"How about... How about we make the most of this? The hot springs are co-ed and I...I want to feel and see more of you" she whispers, more to herself than to you.
>You smile and hold her lightly furred hand as the waiter takes your card along with the check.
>"So...How about 20 minutes and we meet back in the resort lobby" you say with a calm smile.
>She nods slightly and squeezes your hand slightly, then pulls away; leaving your hand feeling somewhat...Empty.
>Flora then stands and walks away quietly.
>You notice her for what seems like the first time, well this is the first time you've been able to see her entire body.
>she's taller than you, probably nearly 7 ft tall, and her dark auburn hair is nearly down to her waist.
>She gives you a full smile, then moves away from your table; albeit somewhat reluctantly.
>You watch her go in utter amazement.
>Her body is....for lack of a better word; amazing.
>Wide hips and a bust that would leave most men (including you) drooling after her.
>You shake yourself out from the trance she leaves you in and depart from the table yourself after the waiter returns your card.
>Slowly, you walk out of the resort restaurant to the elevators.
>"She is probably just going to go to bed" you think to yourself as you ride the elevator to your floor.
>Regardless, you walk to your room and change into your bathing suit, keeping track of the time so you could meet Flora in the lobby.
>It shouldn't matter to you so much.
>But the feeling of being wanted for the first time in SO long; the allure was too much.
>As such you were ready quickly, leaving behind everything beyond your room key, dressed in a resort provided bath robe and a bathing suit.
>No need for a cell phone because no one was there to contact you anyways.
>The feeling of being a specter hits you hard as you wait for the elevator down to the hot springs
>You were literally no one, no family, no friends.
>Hoping to mean something to someone again.
>You sigh and disregard those feelings.
>The elevator rumbles then dings; letting you off into the lobby.
>Feeling somewhat awkward to be there in public in just a bathrobe, you try to maintain an air of confidence.
>After all other resort patrons are here doing the same.
>But no Fora.
>You wait apprehensively, earning odd looks from the staff as you sit on a bench, just waiting.
>Thirty five minutes pass and the idea finally sinks into your skull.
>She stood you up.
>You sigh in both disappointment at her not showing; but also at your eagerness to believe she would really take an interest in you.
>She probably went to bed....
>You stand and walk to the elevators once more, feeling lower than you had in awhile.
>This shouldn't be so disappointing...You barely know her...
>But it hurts regardless.
>The elevator doors open, and as you prepare to walk in; Flora stands before you, looking flustered and annoyed, wrapped tight in a bathrobe.
>Her foothooves click softly on the floor as she tries to hurry past you, only to stop and look at you.
>"Anon?.. OH Anon! You stuck around! I'm So SO sorry I took so long!" she says wrapping her arms around you in a tight hug, your face pressed against her chest right above those heavenly breasts.
>You're immobilized, feeling her body press against yours; but you still keep some presence of mind.
>"I figured you just ran into something, not that you were standing me up or anything" you respond to her shakily.
>Smooth dude.
>Totally convincing.
>Regardless she holds you tight and you respond in kind, wrapping your arms gently around her generous waist.
>"I'm glad you waited, my daughter packed a swimsuit that is.... well you'll see in a bit" she says awkwardly, releasing you from the best hug you had ever received.
>She grabs your hand and almost drags you to the doors to the hot springs, her tail flitting and kicking up her bathrobe a bit.
>All you see from it is a little bit of smooth cream colored fur and shapely thighs.
>You let her take the lead and just follow her to the resort hot springs.
>The springs are divided, partially inside in an odd greenhouse, the other side exposed to the cold winter air as snow falls.
>Flora directs you to the outside portion, and as the door open you shiver slightly.
>Steam makes the air a cloudy mist and you can see only a few feet in front of you.
>But you can still see most patrons have left due to the lateness.
>Not that you mind the privacy.
>You strip down to your swimsuit, then wait for Flora to do the same.
>She looks away awkwardly for a moment or two, then looks directly at you.
>"Don't tease me ok?" she says finally.
>The bathrobe falls off at that exact moment, revealing Flora in a "itty bitty teeny weeny yellow polka dot bikini" that strains to hold her...tracts of land back.
>Your jaw nearly hits the floor from the spectacle of it.
>Seriously, you would have to thank her daughter later for the view...
>You don't have time to respond because within a second Flora disappears below the hot water,hiding her beautiful assets from view.
>She moves through the water with a feminine grace reserved for goddesses and other fictional characters
>"I guess my daughter thought it would be funny to give me a...bad looking swimsuit" she says as she slides onto a seat in the water, the bubbles obscuring her body just enough to let your mind wander.
>You sink into the water and wade over, looking her in the eyes with a placid smile
>"Bad looking? According to who? You're absolutely gorgeous Flora." you say as you make your way over to her and sink into the water next to her.
>The warm water relaxes your worn muscles, telling you just how much you had needed a break from work.
>She looks at you with consternation for a few long moments; then looks away, her eyes closed.
>When they open again, she looks into your eyes with a somewhat pressured gaze.
>Her eyes are the color of faded american dollars, and there is a fire burning in them; plus a sadness.
>You only notice it because you've felt it and seen it before.
>A lack of positive reinforcement over the years and now the inability to take it well.
>"You don't get complimented often do you Flora?" you ask calmly, sneaking your hand to hers under the hot water.
>Her fingers wrap around yours softly.
>"I get them all the time but... Those are usually cat calls and creepy co-workers" she says with a sad squeeze to your hand with hers.
>"It's different when you meet someone genuine" she mumbles just barely audible above the bubbling water around you both.
>You give her hand a squeeze and scoot a little closer to her.
>"I'm sorry for that" you respond, looking away from her and at the bubbling water.
>"All I want is for you to have a good time, weird coming from someone you just met, I know; but still" you continue, not looking at her, but instead focusing on the steam in front of you.
>"It's rare that I meet someone out of the blue that I get along with so well; not to mention one as gorgeous as you. I'm not trying to be creepy but..." you trail off softly.
>You look at her and find those gorgeous eyes focusing at you.
>"It's just the truth"
>Those beautiful eyes twinkle slightly as she looks down, meeting your gaze.
>The height difference is much more noticeable when she's right next to you.
>"Such a romantic, making me feel like a beautiful young girl again"
>Deadpanned, you stare into her eyes.
>"You are beautiful, age has nothing to do with it"
>She looks stunned for a moment, then draws back a bit, her hand drawing away a bit.
>"My body then?"
>You shake your head at that.
>"No one else has understood what it's like to lose everything in a moment like you. sure, some anonymous members have similar stories but...it's hard to connect with people who lost everything AFTER they grew up" you say calmly as you look away and focus on the steam.
>"But..." she starts.
>"You were 18 when you lost your husband, to you THAT was all that mattered, I lost everyone at 16" you continue, ignoring her interruption.
>You look back to her, unwinding your hand from hers and putting it around her waist to pull her closer to you.
>"No one understands like you, and that's what truly makes you beautiful; sure it might sound cheesy but...Someone who understands what it's like to lose everything as a teenager means a whole WHOLE lot"
>Flora looks shocked for a moment, studying you for a moment before you look away.
>You can feel the alcohol affecting you as you focus back on the steam of the hot tub.
>However, Flora's hand wraps tighter around your waist in turn, as you focus on anything else.
"I understand" She responds softly.
>Loss is something few truly understand.
>How can they?
>Most people have friends or family to fall back on.
>You had no one beyond the BHA, they in turn put you up for adoption.
>And Flora had no one because of her pregnancy.
>It's like a match made in dysfunctional heaven
>An orphan who by no one's choice matched with someone flung into single parenthood because "fate" and "choice"
>But you stopped believing in fate and all that a long time ago.
>Instead you focus on what is before you, a beautiful woman who was fed up with creeps who never learned anything about her.
>And you suspect you were the only one to try to get to know her.
>And you wanted to know everything about her.
>So you talked with her, learning everything you could about the beautiful bovine anthro, and her everything about you.
>She is 39, works in real estate and lives one town over from you; her daughter is 22 and goes to college for law and did one of those "gofundme" things to get her a vacation here.
>In turn, she learns about your prior life in the other world.
>How you woke up in an old abandoned building, surrounded by cops demanding why you were there.
>The confusion, the tears...The...How do you explain the feeling of waking up and realizing everyone you knew was gone?
>Flora seemed to understand somewhat.
>She told you how when she was 8 months pregnant there was a knock at the door, and a soldier was there to tell her that her husband died in an IED blast.
>You would be lying if you said you hadn’t teared about a bit talking about your past and listening to hers.
>But you could see some tears from her too, partially obscured by the steam.
>The moments, the connection between you and Flora are cut short though.
>"Yooo bro! You makin' this lady cry?" comes an arrogant, annoying voice.
>the bull from earlier is slowly wading towards you and flora, a look of determined satisfaction on his face.
>Slowly, he wades towards you, partially stumbling; guess he must have had a few too many drinks
>He thinks he can play the part of hero, swooping in to save Flora from the mean mean boyfriend.
>You're about to answer when Flora; in a beautiful movement of grace and dexterity,moves through the water deftly to straddle you, leaving you speechless.
>Looking over her shoulder, she chastises the bull in a very motherly and condescending way.
>"Oooh someone's jealous"
>You can't even see the bull beyond Flora's "Tracts of land", which are pressed against your face.
>What you can do is hear.
>"W-what does that puny human have that I don't! He can't satisfy you like I can!"
>Flora wiggles her hips on you, making the more primal part of your brain take over for a moment.
>Your erection pokes at her as she continues to wiggle her hips at the bull.
>"He has everything you lack, including politeness, so tonight when you're alone, think of him railing me!" she says with a defiant slap of her ass, splashing some water up as she does so.
>Your base desires are being driven into overdrive as you feel the reverberations from that slap.
>Before you can do anything else, you feel Flora's hands wrap around your face to pull you into a deep kiss.
>Her tongue invades your mouth with a fiery desire you had never felt from any partner before.
>Overcoming your surprise, you wrap one arm around her, feeling the base of her tail on your forearm as you pull her to you; your spare hand grips her wide hip.
>Her tongue is thick and wraps around yours as it explores your mouth.
>Your tongue invades her mouth with a bit more softness.
>It feels her flat teeth, the base of her tongue and everything in between.
>She moans into your mouth as you grip her ass and pull her to you out of sheer primal reflex.
>Oh god, you wanted this woman. 
>You wanted to explore every inch of her, give her the kisses she deserved and hold her hand at every social event ever.
>SO much hand holding.
>Flora breaks the kiss from you, staring into your eyes with a deep longing, then she looks back at the bull.
>"Ohhh you wanna watch this human give me what you can't?" She teases, grinding her shapely ass against you.
>You can see the fury in his face as he looks from you to her and you briefly contemplate what to do again if he gets hostile.
>It's a bit sad when the best option you have is T pose.
>But against him... you would literally have no other choice.
>But this resort must have had issues in the past because you see a few security personnel through the steam.
>Just barely.
>They must have been trained to be as non intrusive as possible.
>They appeared like spectres when the bull started showing aggression.
>Holy fuck, you would leave them a tip.
>Soft wet fur pulls you away from the bull and security
>Flora is still straddling you, leaned back slightly and looking down at you.
>"D-do you like what you see.....?" she asks bit bashfully after that display of confidence, her thighs on either side of yours.
>You nod numbly as she pushes your face between her breasts once more, Smothering you in hot wet fur and agonizing softness
>She's like a sculpture of beauty never seen before or since.
>Your fingers run over damp fur,feeling her body and hips.
>Your erection is barely contained as she continues grinding against you.
>Her arms wrap around your head as she giggles, purposefully pressing against you and teasing you.
>"Uh...Excuse me?" you hear a meek voice from behind you.
>You can't quite turn your head because of the wonderful smothering you're being subjected too.
>"Hmm? What?" Flora asks, looking up and past you.
>"Uh... While we do encourage intimacy, we would like to request that you continue somewhere more...Private please" comes an awkward voice full of consternation from over your left shoulder.
>"Hear that honey? We have to go somewhere...Private" Flora moans to you ,intentionally sliding her wide ass down the length of your shaft.
>You wiggle your face out of its beautiful fleshy prison.
>"Then let's go?" you ask with the smallest bit of questioning inflection.
>She nods and smiles "Lets go"
>Flora pulls herself off you,  leaving you feeling cold and naked despite the hot water.
>She beckons you to follow her, and you see her look to a side and wink at the bull who glowers at her.
>You're nearly shocked at how confidently she strides through the water, which she used to conceal herself with earlier.
>Now she strides with her body on full display, shoulders back a bit to pop her breasts out even further.
>You get up and follow her, your erection like an arrow pointed towards its final destination.
>That destination being Flora.
>Confidence wells inside you as you wade through the water.
>You look over to the bull; the bull you owe this whole night to , and smile.
>He scowls at you in response.
>Hurrying a bit, you catch up with Flora and put and arm around her waist.
>"So, did you mean what you said back there?" you ask apprehensively.
>"What part?"
>The two of you walk together through the resort lobby, your erection pitching a very obvious tent.
>What do you care at this point?
>"The “somewhere private” and the "railing" I'm gonna give you" you ask.
>At this point you notice 2 things though.
>First, her nipples are pressing HARD against the fabric of her bikini.
>Second, her hand has snaked its way around you, pulling you to her.
>"Every word"
>The two of you make it to the elevator and you find yourself smirking at the stares.
>As soon as the Elevator doors close, Flora is on you and you on her.
>Your hands creep up her sides as she kisses you.
>Her hands slip past the elastic of your waistband, gently stroking your member.
>Your hands slide under her bikini and gently massage her breasts, feeling her hard nipples press against your fingers.
>Gently you pull away from the kiss.
>"My place or yours?"
>No hesitation.
>"yours" she says before pulling you back into a kiss.
>You pull a hand away and look around her briefly to hit the button to your floor, then go back to right in front of her, looking up at her.
>As much as you want to take charge, Flora doesn't quite let you, pushing you with the mass of her body until she has you pinned in a corner of the elevator, her breasts once again pushing against your face.
>"Don't think I haven't noticed you staring all night Anon~" she cooes sweetly, shaking her shoulders side to side, causing ripples of jiggles through her breasts against you.
>You don't respond, well you can't really well this her pressed against you like that, so instead you opt to simply grab her plump ass and squeeze it, pulling her to you even more.
>She moans with soft desire and she lets you slide your shaft between her thighs, albeit still in your swimsuit.
>She keeps her hands firmly planted against the elevator walls as she presses against you and softly wiggles side to side.
>You had always figured torture to be some kind of pain.
>This was worse than that.
>Keeping yourself restrained against your desire that wanted nothing more than to bend Flora over right here in the elevator and have your way with her.
>And you're sure she wouldn't even object.
>The side of you that wanted more than just a fling popped up. 
>"Slow down, tease her, LOVE her, it's what she REALLY wants"
>Sound advice from yourself to yourself, if you do say so yourself.
>Gently, you pull your shaft out from between Floras THICC thighs and pulls your face out from between her glorious breasts.
>"W-what's wrong?" Flora asks pulling away, slightly panicked.
>"Nothing is wrong; I just want to savor this with you" you respond as the elevator dings and opens.
>She looks confused and steps away from you, only to have you reach a hand forwards to her.
>Delicately, she takes your hand and leads you out of the elevator.
>"Follow me" you say with a smile.
>She doesn't respond, instead squeezes your hand softly, then you guide her through the halls to your room.
>These hotel hallways always look the same, and you note how bland they look compared to Flora.
>You also recognize you both left your towels and robes back at the hot spring.
>Eh, a small price to pay.
>Eventually, you stand in front of your room and pull your key out of the little inside pouch of your swimsuit..
>Men's swimsuits have a little interior pocket... do ladies?
>You don't question it for long because as soon as the door closes behind you, Flora has pulled you into a kiss once more.
>You rub your hand on her cheeks this time, gently stroking and massaging.
>When she breaks the kiss you realize just how cold you are; water plus winter weather equals cold.
>"We should dry off" you say up to her, and she gives a short nod.
>Flora looks to you with a bit of consternation and you see her tongue gently lick her rosey lips.
>"Are you sure you're ok with someone like me? I mean, I'm older than you and-" 
>You cut her off with a quick kiss, You hands intertwining between her fingers to hold them softly.
>As your kiss breaks you look deep into her eyes.
>"I'm more than ok with you Flora, you're gorgeous and fun to talk to and just...good to spend time with" you respond.
>She gives a warm smile and then shivers a bit.
>"Right, lets dry off!" she says pulling you into the bathroom.
>This world, this wonderful, anthro filled world has some unique things in bathrooms.
>A shower with multiple nozzles the point into the center to wash fur for starters. 
>And a Full hair (fur) dryer, that looks like one of those "wind simulators" some malls have.
>Flora guides you into it and you look about it cluelessly.
>You had never really used one before so you just let Flora do her thing.
>A moment later, Jets of warm air push against you from all directions
>Flora, in that moment pulls you to her.
>"You've made me feel Amazing tonight Anon" She says with a content smile, her ears wiggling slightly from the warm air
>You feel the warm air whip around you, feel her soft fur gently being dried; you see her green eyes gazing at you while she nervously bites her lower lip softly.
>"You've made me feel amazing too Flora" you respond, gently rubbing your fingers through her fur.
>"But we can't get really dry with our swimsuits on" you point out.
>Flora's smile turned from happiness to deviousness, and she turns from you.
>"Untie this for me please?" she asks as wind whips around her, pointing to the string on her back, holding the bikini on.
>You oblige her and untie it quickly; those wonderful fleshy orbs have tempted you all night.
>Flora slides out of the Bikini top, still facing away from you.
>"And now this last piece!" She says happily, bending over as she pulls off her bikini bottom, giving you a wonder view.
>You in turn follow suit, kicking your swimsuit off right as the warm air cycle of the dryer turns off.
>Flora stays turned, her arms wrapped around herself.
>"Anon... I have something to confess" She says timidly, in stark contrast to how she was acting just a moment before.
>"what's that Flora?" you ask apprehensively, fearing the worst.
>What even is the worst at this point?
>"You...Are the first man I've been with since my daughter was born" she whispers softly, just barely audible over the bathrooms fan.
>You cock your head to the side questioningly.
>"So?"
>"S-so my body isn't what it used to be!" she says, turning to you slowly.
>Her large breasts sag slightly due to their sheer size and her tummy has a comfortable amount of plumpness.
>She instinctively covers her large light pink areolas and nipples with both arms, squishing her breasts to her, looking away with a frown.
>You don't even realize what you're doing until you have your arms around Flora in a hug.
>"Flora, you're the most beautiful woman I've ever had the pleasure of meeting" you state calmly, savoring the brisk warm fur.
>Flora stops looking away and stares at you for a moment, her eyes studying your face, her arms still wrapped around herself defensively.
>"You...you mean it don't you? which means either you've been with some very ugly girls or I'm Aphrodite reincarnated" she says with a doubtful smile.
>"I mean every word, you are beautiful beyond belief; and forget reincarnated, you put Aphrodite to shame" you respond hugging her and giving her a quick squeeze.
>She studies you for a quick moment, then wraps her arms around you gently.
>"Thank you Anon"
>You pull her closer to you,savoring the feeling of warm fur against your bare skin.
>"You don't need to thank me, I'm just telling the truth" you respond with a gentle nuzzle.
>Flora pulls away to look at you with watery eyes.
>"You Snake charmer, You must get all the girls like this" she says with a tearful, yet happy smile.
>You shrug and give an awkward smile.
>"uhhh sure, totally! I get all the ladies" You say with a pained smile.
>"That's why I'm here alone on vacation"
>As you attempt to shift away from Flora in sheer embarrassment and shame, she pulls you further to her.
>Flora's motherly cooes send shivers up your spine.
>"You poor man, thrust into a new world all alone at such a young age" she cooes softly.
>To be honest , you're a bit annoyed to be the loser, the guy who lost everything.
>You just wanted to LIVE.
>Just to be here with these anthros and humans, living a life that is all about being better than you COULD have been.
>There is a theory in the anonymous circles going around.
>A rumor that anonymous members got pulled into this world to help someone who needed it.
>Think a guardian angel pulling someone from another universe to protect you.
>The stories made sense.
>A human, lost and strung out on drugs, saving an anthro gal who was attacked; a man confused, helping a BHA member become her true self, a man helping a young helpless anthro overcome her past and the rape the came with it.
>Does your current situation give that theory any grounds to stand on?
>Eh, maybe, maybe not.
>What truly matters is that you stand with Flora, the beautiful bovine anthro.
>"It's ok" you answer with a smile "It only means I got to meet you"
>Flora sucks in a breath and looks at you questioningly.
>You smile in response.
>"It's ok, I've had a long time to get over it" you say, waving the feelings aside mentally.
>Soft warm fur engulfs your face and the feeling of warm fur pressing against you is almost oppressive.
>Unf to the utmost degree.
>Huge and soft breasts wrapped around you, a beautiful woman caring about you.
>A dream come true.
>You slide your hands up her sides and begin to gently squeeze her bosom, earning soft moans from Flora and you explore her body
as she feels yours.
>Flora shifts slightly, causing your erection to slide between her thighs once more.
>"Mmmm I can feel it throbbing" She moans, softly grinding her thigh side to side.
>The soft fur of her inner thighs feels amazing, like rubbing your sensitive member with silk.
>For a moment, you pull your head out of Flora's cleavage and massage her breasts around the nipple, then take one into your mouth and suck on it gently.
>Flora gasps at the sudden change in sensations and redoubles her grinding while a growing wetness begins to form.
>Flora's hands glide along your body as she moans and gasps while you play with her large breasts and suckle on one of her nipples.
>Feeling lust course through you, you let Flora's nipple free of your mouth with a sharp *pop* that makes Flora moan gasp in shock.
>"Mmmm i want more~" she cooes to you, her eyes half closed woozily, pressing her breasts around your face once more with her upper arms.
>You Feel flora Guiding you, but don't fight it as she leads you from the bathroom to the bed, your face still engulfed in her cleavage.
>She gazes down at you, her eyes full of lust and want.
>"No man has made me feel so beautiful before" she half moans, half whispers.
>You wriggle free of her embrace, your body landing on the bed with a soft "whomp".
>"Flora, you are more than beautiful. You're fun and charming and so many more things" you say with an inviting smile.
>Flora looks pensive, then simply falls onto you.
>She cushions most of her weight to her elbows and hips, but you're still hit with a weight of heavy breasts and thighs.
>Flora, has effectively pinned you, granted your arms and legs are free and you could squirm free from her if you wanted.
>But the warm cream colored fur, the soft smell of jasmine flowers and her eager look make you decide otherwise.
>Again she smothers you with her huge breasts, a soft but uneasy confidence from her as she presses against you.
>"You stare so much at me, but...You seem so sincere and; trying to tell me it isn't JUST about me body" she states with a huff.
>Your hands reach up and pull her breasts from your face
>"Flora. If i just wanted sex , I Wouldn't have tried for someone like you." you start, rubbing her sides and thighs.
>"I would have just gone for the waitress; who just about threw herself onto me, or maybe one of the many ladies who was celebrating their 40th birthday with a party" you say with a calm smile.
>"40th birthday? what does that?-" she starts.
>Middle aged woman always get try to get with a younger guy when they turn 40 for some reason
>"Let's just say i've been hit on a lot by ladies celebrating their birthdays" you say, gazing into Flora's eyes and rubbing her soft fur gently.
>Flora smiles and gives her hips a gentle wiggle, then sits upright; her pelvis pressed against yours.
>Your hard manhood rubs against Flora wet slit and she takes a moment to gently rub it with her soft hands.
>"Bigger than I expected to be honest" she moans, running her fingers over the sensitive tip, sending shivers down your body.
>She lifts herself slightly and positions your member against her as you gently run your hands along her thick thighs.
>"Ready?" she asks, more to herself than to you.
>You place your hands squarely on her hips and slide her down without any resistance or protest.
>Hot silken wetness envelops your manhood as Flora gasps and runs a hand down your chest.
>"S-so good" she moans as you begin rotating her hips on you, stirring up her tight insides.
>She plants both of her hands on your chest and you get to watch her large heavy breasts start to bounce a jiggle as she begins slapping her pelvis to yours.
>A soft *plap* sound fills the air as she does so, filling the air just about the ragged moaning breaths and your static enjoyment of the view.
>Your hands, still planted firmly on her hips, grasp her dense fur and help guide her.
>You feel her tail swishing back and forth each time she slams her hips to yours, left to right each time.
>Her green eyes are locked onto yours but unfocused, her attention being drawn to other sensations.
>Each time she pounds her hips to yours, she tightens sharply around you member, sending spasms of heat and pleasure through you.
>One of your hands slides upwards to grab a large jiggling breast and she rides you with fervor.
>After a bit of missing her nipples due to the very distracting jiggling, you're able to grab a nipple and tease it gently eliciting louder moans from Flora.
>Without warning, she falls on top of you, leaving your face buried in beautiful, silken, flower smelling tits.
>She angles herself sharply, forcing one of her breasts squarely onto your face.
>You take the hint and take her nipple into your mouth once mouth, sucking gently.
>Your other hand gets a good grip of soft hip fur as you help Flora keep a good rhythm.
>She moans softly and with a face full of lust looks you in the eyes.
>"Bite it...Hard" she directs right has her hips meet yours heavily.
>You happily oblige and bite down on her nipple,earning a sharp gasp.
>Flora's inner walls tighten suddenly, and you focus on the soft, slightly salty taste in you mouth.
>Flora's nipples were soft, softer than most human skin.
>It was obvious they were sensitive based on the awkward attempts you made to try to get as much of the nipple and areola in your mouth as possible.
>You probably looked like a weird shark trying to chomp as much meat as possible.
>But each chomp made Flora gasp and moan.
>You feel her legs intertwine around yours and she moans happily.
>Tightness engulfs your member as she moans into your ear with a panicked yet lust filled voice.
>"ohhhhhh..oh god anon i-i-i-i-I'm gonnaaaa CUUUUU"
>She doesn't finish her though as she heavily slams her hips to yours, while at the same time wrapping an arm around your head to pull your face completely to her breast.
>You can barely breathe, but you continue biting and thrusting into her, driven completely by want and lust.
>Is she on some kind of birth control? 
>The thought is just a brief concern as you bring her fully down on yours while you suck one of her massive breasts and squeeze her elegant ass.
>She gives a short "Aaaaaahhhhh" as you fill her with your seed, no time to tell her as your mouth is fully preoccupied.
>You feel your legs spasm slightly as Flora's insides clench around your member,milking you for all you're worth.
>"Ohhhh I needed that" she moans, with her head rubbing against the side of your face and neck.
>You feel her ears flicking against your head as you hold her close
>you let go of her nipple with your mouth and let it squish against your upper chest and neck as Flora relaxes onto you.
>Imnotevenmad.jpg
>Big tits smooshed against you? No complaints here.
>"Me too Flora" You whisper to her.
>She doesn't respond, but snuggles against you,one of her hands grabbing blankets to pull over you both.
>After she absently struggles for a bit, the blankets are pulled within your reach to pull over the two of you.
>Flora does a quick shimmy against you.
>She never bothered to let you pull out of her; and it looks like she has NO problem of you staying in her overnight.
>"Flora?" you ask apprehensively, only to get a bovine finger pressed to your lips in a sweet motherly way.
>"Shush, let's enjoy this" she barely whispers, her large breasts pressed to you and her body on top of yours.
>You nod and settle into her cleavage.
>Together, in the gentle afterglow of love making, the two of you drift off to sleep.

>You wake up to sunlight streaming through your hotel room window.
>Barely awake, you feel for Flora, only to find the spot in the bed next to you empty.
>Sigh.
>Suppose you should have seen that coming.
>Still you thought you and her had connected well and you wanted to try to make something more of it.
>But you don't know her phone number
>Hell you don't even know her last name.
>Smooth Anon, real real smooth
>You sit up and look around the room, looking for any sign of her.
>Nothing.
>As you frown, looking around for Anything, be it a note or even her bikini, you hear you door lock click and swing open.
>You're about to yell for the cleaning lady to get lost when Flora appears from the short hallway, carrying two plates of steaming breakfast food from the hotels complimentary breakfast.
>She's wearing (and stretching) one of your t-shirts and has on a pair of your running shorts.
>They don't fit her very well but god, did she make them look good.
>"Oh! You're awake! I brought us food!" she says cheerfully, setting the plates on the table along with your room key she must have grabbed.
>You're dumbfounded for a moment then smile happily.
>Sliding out of the bed you grab a pair of boxers, slide into them, then sit at the table with her. 
>"Thanks Flora, listen....I would love to see you more if that's ok" you quickly say before you can reason yourself out of saying it.
>She smiles, and takes you hand in hers.
>"It's more than ok Anon, and I still have 3 days here, what about you?" she replies happily.
>"four" you respond with a wide smile.
>"Then let's make those days count, Then we'll take it from there" she says squeezing your hand.
>You nod and give a happy sigh.
>3 days together huh? 
>And you can think of a lot you can do in those few days. 
>But for now here comes the sun to start this one.
