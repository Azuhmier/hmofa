>As you clean up the kitchen after a nice dinner, you hear her voice calling out from the living room.
>"Hurry, hurry!  It's about to start, Anon!"
>You chuckle as you make your way to the couch, knowing full well you've got time.
>She's already waiting, smiling excitedly.
>"Can you believe it, Anon?  70 years since the last episode aired.  Feels like only yesterday..."
>Your wife sighs nostalgically, clasping her hands together and going heart-pupiled again.
>The Lena Lynx Show was an old black-n-white toon that aired back when you were barely old enough to know what a cartoon was.  The final episode aired 70 years ago tonight, and you've been celebrating that anniversary all day...
>Not so coincidentally, it's also your wedding anniversary.  1 year of wedded bliss to the love of your life...
>Her grey fur seems to almost glow in the light of the TV, her ears twitching in time with the clock.  She pats your spot on the couch, and you take a seat just in time.
>As she cheers, the title card pops up onscreen.
>LENA LYNX IN: Last Train to Toontown!
>You smile warmly as your wife whistles along to the music merrily.
>She beams as the singers call out that name...
>Her name.

>As the toon starts, you reminisce on the last couple of years...
>You've always had a fascination with animation, particularly the classics.  One day last year, you found an old VHS tape of the final episode of The Lena Lynx Show; an episode thought lost when the original film burnt in a tragic fire.
>It was a fascinating slice of the inkblot era of animation, but nothing particularly spectacular...
>Until you watched it on a stormy night.  There wasn't anything better to watch; satellite signal was spotty at best.
>Just as the titular Lynx took a bow for the last time, a streak of lightning struck your house.  Thankfully nothing was hurt...
>But you still remember how your heart skipped a beat when you realized you were no longer alone in your house.
>Somehow, someway, an honest-to-god toon stepped out of your TV and into your life. 
>It's taken some getting used to.  
>Her expressions are quite a bit more animated then most women.  Nothing like knowing exactly when she's literally looking daggers at someone.
>Her sense of humor is a bit... outdated.  She sometimes lets out a little whimper when she cracks a joke you don't get, and more topical wisecracks tend to sail right over her head.
>Perhaps the strangest thing, though was getting used to her... body.
>She's unnaturally flexible thanks to her nature; on top of that, she's blessed with nice curves and long, slender legs.  You smile discretely when you recall how well she filled out a red dress when she went as Jessica Rabbit for last Halloween.
>You once heard someone compare her to Minerva Mink in terms of shape; of course, that name didn't ring a bell for her, but you honestly felt it was an apt comparison.

>As you continue to daydream, Lena elbows you with a playful grin.
>"Ain'tcha gonna watch me, sweetheart?  It's my anniversary~!"
>She bats her eyelashes audibly, and you can't help but laugh.
>She returns the favor and wraps an arm around you.  Her thick, soft fur gently caresses your skin, tickling a bit.  She pulls you close and plants a kiss on your cheeks, then goes back to watching her show play out.
>Even though you watch this episode every night, she still laughs at every single gag, every time.
>Tonight, though, is different.
>She offers a sort of behind the scenes commentary, as if she were an actress rather than ink on paper when these were filmed.
>"Y'see that?  All me.  I did my own stunts, rarer than ya think in this business.  That ol' Mouse had tons'a stunt doubles!"
>You note that same old bitterness in that last sentence.  She's never been a fan of Disney stuff.
>As she continues to commentate, she casually scoots you over into her lap.  Not too difficult considering you're more than willing to help her.
>She gently rubs her fingers down your side, toning her excited babble down to a more mellow, soothing voice.
>"Y'know, they were THIS close ta givin' me a boyfriend in these toons.  Boy, am I glad they nixed that."
>She hugs you tightly, resting her chin atop your head with a purr.  Her long tail snakes out from beneath her and wraps lovingly around your waist.
>"If they hadn't, I'da never met you, sweetheart."
>She drops her brisk, cartoonish tone altogether now, staring adoringly into your eyes with a much less exaggerated grin than usual.
>"Anon, I love you.  I hope you never doubt that for a minute."
>She pulls you into a passionate kiss before you can respond.

>When she finally relents and lets the kiss end, you answer.
>"Lena, I love you with all my heart, and I want you to never forget that."
>Before your eyes, her pupils become perfect little hearts again.  Then, a tiny stream of the little things floats up from her head, between her pointed ears.
>Even when she's actively toning it down, her toon nature seeps through.  At first it was a little grating...
>But you've grown to love her quirks, and wouldn't change a thing about her.
>She purrs louder and hugs you tighter, burying your face in the thick tuft of fluff at the base of her neck.  The faint smell of her fur has always brought to mind the word "nostalgic".  You don't know any other way to describe it.
>She pats your back affectionately, her purring nearly drowning out the cartoon entirely.  Her tail gently squeezes your middle playfully.
>You simply sit there, cuddled close, for the rest of the nightly viewing, listening to her commentary grow increasingly nostalgic.
>Once you hear the last few lines of the toon, you feel her grip loosen.  You pull away from her a bit when you hear sniffling.
>She smiles warmly as inky black tears run down her face, vanishing when they touch anything but her fur.  She silently mouths the closing lines, then goes uncharacteristically silent as the ending jingle plays.
>The VHS comes to a stop.
>She continues to sit in silence, smile lingering and tears still flowing.  Eventually, without a word, she pulls herself close, burying her face in your shoulder.
>"...thank you.  For everything, Anon.  You found the lost episode.  You welcomed me into your house, into your life.  I-into your heart..."
>You smile and gently run a hand along her back.
>"Lena, I did it all because I love you.  If I could do it all again, I would in a heartbeat."
>She pulls away from you and smiles, more tears of joy dripping off her whiskers.  Rather than speak, she simply kisses you again, embracing you as tightly as she can.

>Eventually, she composes herself enough to speak.
>"Well... as that ol' side of bacon used to say: that's all, folks."
>A little sadness tinges her voice as she stares at the TV behind you.
>"...actually... do... do you mind if we watch it again, Anon?  It IS the anniversary..."
>Lena has always been a bit heartbroken by the fact that her show fell into obscurity.  Remembering those toons that came out in the same era and achieved household name status... often brought out this side of her.
>Again, black tears start flowing.  You silently restart the tape, hugging her closely as her smile slowly returns.
>"...thank you, Anon."
>As soon as the theme song starts up, the infectious happiness overwhelms her sadness.  She soon begins humming along, swaying to the rhythm and letting her ears whimsically tick back and forth like twin metronomes.
>Lena's smile returns in earnest when the singers again call out her name.  This time, you joined in as well, causing her purring to reach new levels of volume.
>This time, she remains entirely silent for the entire toon, simply swaying back and forth with her arms around you.  Every now and again, she kisses you lovingly or pulls you closer.
>You quickly lose count of the times she's buried your face in her fluff.
>But, you don't mind at all.
>Once the time comes for the Lena onscreen to again take her final bow, your beloved lynx again mouths her farewell lines, eyes literally sparkling with nostalgic tears.
>The toon irises out, and the ending jingle starts up once more.
>Lena doesn't hum along.  Instead, she simply buries her face in your shoulder again, purring and whispering.
>"I love you.  I love you so, so much.  Thank you."

>Without waiting for her to ask, you silently rewind the tape once more.  Lena keeps her face buried, but can't help but hum along to the theme song when it strikes up again.
>This time, you sing along to every word.  As soon as she hears you, she sits up with an ecstatic smile.
>She gazes into your eyes lovingly and matches you, the two of you harmonizing beautifully with the old recording.
>Eventually, you come to her two favorite words in the song.
>"...Lena Lynx~!"
>Once you finish singing, she continues to stare in adoration, more tiny black hearts hovering up from her head.
>She purrs and again wraps her tail around you.
>"...I... I thought you didn't sing?"
>"For you?  I'd do anything."
>She lets out a purring chuckle and again pulls you into a kiss.
>"Thank you so much."
>Rather than respond, you simply run a hand through her long, flowing black hair.
>The two of you share an embrace for the rest of the screening, only breaking it off to sing along with the ending tune.
>Once you reach the last line, her voice gives way to an adoring purr, allowing you to finish the song alone as inky tears of joy run down her whiskers once again.
>Once the last note finishes ringing out, the air is knocked out of you as she squeezes you incredibly tightly.
>"...I love you, Anon."
>"Love you too, Lena."
>The tape ends with a mechanical click.

>The two of you sit in relative silence, the only sounds being the ticking of the clock and Lena's happy purring.
>She lets out a little gasp as the clock strikes midnight.
>"Oh!  It's getting late... you have work tomorrow, don't you?  Let's head to bed."
>You begrudgingly rise from her lap, then start changing into your bedclothes.
>Lena simply steps behind her privacy screen, then steps out in a pair of pajamas.  You can't help but chuckle at how easily some things come to her thanks to her tooniness.
>The two of you quickly pile into bed, snuggling as close as possible.
>Lena yawns and wraps her tail around you drowsily.  You cuddle up so your head brushes against that heavenly fluff around her neck.
>She smiles lovingly, with no goofy exaggerations, and hugs you close.
>"Goodnight, Anon. Thank you for the best anniversary ever.  Love you..."
>"Love you too, Lena."
>She closes her eyes just as they take on heart shapes once more, and is soon fast asleep.
>Little black Z's bob above her head as she seems to snore silently.  As you do every night, you reach up and grab these letters and hug them close to your chest.
>You sigh happily and fall asleep with your beloved wife, already hearing her morning joke tickling your ears.
>"Looks like you caught some Z's last night!"
>Smiling, you cuddle closer to her, hearing her sweet laughter echoing in your dreams.
