>Heat
>You are surrounded by heat
>Its almost unbearable.
>But the familiar sound of air moving through a small tube as you breathe and the fact that it is significantly cooler than the air outside the angular face mask and helmet you wore reminded you of your purpose here.
>You are Anon, and you have a job to do.
>Your outfit is a black and orange heavy jacket, lined with fire retardant oils or fabric.
>Things you knew about but didn't care to go over.
>This wasn't the time to worry about your equipment.
>You had your Fire Axe in hand, its red paint harboring a few scratches here and there.
>Gripping it tight you moved within the corridors of the building ahead. You had to move fast. Fire waits for no one.
>Ahead was a door, wooden, scuffed and slightly charred from the heat. Beyond was the last room you need to check.
>Wasting no time, you approach the door and raise up your axe and swing to the door.
>A satisfying THUNK comes from the door, you strike true. You strike again, swapping the sides of the axe to get into the door.
>Not today Door. You think to yourself, and you barge in.
>Inside the dimly lit room, you see it.
>A body, prone on the floor. You can't make it out but you know that humanoid shape all too well.
>Almost discarding the axe entirely, you reach down to pick up the body and heft it over your shoulder. Yeah, time to ditch the axe.
>Your moving faster now, being careful not to drop your precious cargo. The exit was down three corridors, and you don't know how much time you have left.
>As you round the corner, you see light ahead. The exit.
>Dashing forward, a loud sound echos through the entire structure. A loud buzzer. It forces you to slow down and then stop mere feet from the exit.
>The heat around you dies down slowly, and with a metallic thunk, like a large switch being pushed, lights fill the area, highlighting the object in your arms
>A test dummy
"Congratulations Anon." A feminine voice. Familiar. Your thoughts return to you.
>Your in a testing facility for your Fire Department. You just ran one of the courses designed to test your speed and efficiency.
>As you put down the test dummy down onto a nearby bench you move outside the door into a much cooler area
>Outdoors
>To your right is another part of the building, the control room.
>You can see inside through a reinforced glass window.
>Probably also protected with fireproofing, just in case.
>Inside was your partner and the owner of the voice over the speaker.
>An anthro Dalmatian woman. 
>She stood at about Five Feet Eight inches, but her height can be useful in your line of work.
>Muscular with a healthy chest on her. You know better than to ask her size but you could guess she was a comfortable C cup.
>She's also thrown you over her shoulder once or twice during training.
>She was wearing the helmet of your Fire Department, 58034. 
>As well as a open firefighter jumpsuit that revealed a somewhat sweaty white shirt underneath.
>You swore you could see her spots through it, but you stared at her face immediately upon realizing what you've done.
>"What was my time?" You asked
>"Eighteen-Fourty."
>Not a bad time, considering hers was Seventeen Even.
>You gave her a thumbs up and reached up to grip off that helmet and bring it under your arm.
>Man that fresh air feels good.
>How are you Sun?
>"You up for another set?" You hear her ask and you look over at her again with a smile.
>"Nah. Let the next guy take their chance." You were exausted. This was the third set today.
>She smiles and nods, turning to the computer console and hits a few switches before heading to the door on the other end of the control room.
>She comes around the building and approaches you
>Wait, something about her walk is off.
>"You want to get some drinks, big boy?"
>"Sure. Let me get cleaned up first, Don't think we want to walk into "The Drink" smelling like fire.
>She laughed at that and moved close to you and wrapped an arm around your waist.
>"Come on then."
>You grin and then make your way with your lovable companion off towards the Firehouse across the courtyard.
>You can almost hear her sniffing her nose as you walk together.
>Something definitely off about this.
>You were okay with it though. You always had the hots for her.
>It did not take either of you long to enter the showers, the only thing that was really off is, she didn't drift off towards the woman's showers.
>"Wait. What if we get caught?" You ask immediately staring down at her.
>"Then we better make it quick, think we can beat both our times?"
>You mentally hear the buzzer again, and the timer starts as you feel her start to remove your jumpsuit.
