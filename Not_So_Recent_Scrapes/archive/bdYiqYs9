>be living innawoods, off the grid and away from civilization in some crappy tiny cabin you built for yourself over the months
>get back from collecting wood for your fireplace
>the sun is setting and a fuckhuge winter storm is approaching
>cheap poke-walmart solar cells are only able to power a handful of electronics at once so getting an actual heater is a no-go
>fucking chinese imports
>heaters are for pussies anyway
>as you're dumping the wood into the fireplace, you hear what sounds like a scratching sound coming from outside your door
>oh shit
>fucking skinwalkers and bigfoot trying to steal muh vodka
>praying to god, odin, zeus, allah, hitler, arceus, and bob ross, you grab your nugget and proceed to breach the door only to be greeted by...
>nothing
>what
>it was now nighttime, the snow is beginning to fall, and it's cold as fuck
>just as you're about to turn around to go back inside you notice some very faint tracks in the snow, ending just beside your front door
>they were large, and vaguely reptilian judging from the three sharp looking claws on the end of them
>as you're investigating, you're suddenly knocked to the floor by the weight of something landing on you from atop the roof, knocking your nugget out of your hands with a beastly hiss
>welp time to die
>as you gaze upwards at your attacker, you are greeted with a pair of piercing yellow eyes staring back at you, it's clawed hand pinning you by the shoulder and it's other bladed forearm hovering dangerously close to your neck
>in a raspy, yet distinctly feminine voice it finally spoke to you
>"Ssssso, you're the human that's been living on my property..."
 
>a scyther
>a fucking scyther
>yep, you were fucked
>you knew that monsters tended to segregate themselves to their own communities, and never really bothered humans unless it was for fighting in the league
>some bullshit about "interspecies cooperation" and "strengthening diplomatic relations"
>but you had never seen one in person, and now one was staring you down ready to tear your throat out for what it thought was an intrusion on it's property
>upon closer inspection, you notice that "it" was actually a she, judging from the overall feminine figure and the pair of decently sized breasts that sat on her chest
>this made her no less terrifying however, as the threat of having your throat slashed open was still very real
>"W-what?" was all you manage to choke out, nearly pissing yourself from fear
>"I've lived here for years, and then one day you show up and build this ugly monstrosity on my land" she hisses, her grip tightening and her blade now touching your throat
>despite the fear of imminent death quite literally hovering over you, you attempt to explain yourself
>you quickly blurt out something along the lines of "I didn't know you lived here, I wouldn't have settled in this place to begin with if I knew you did." and hope for the best
>ohgodpleasedontkillme
>with a hiss, she slowly takes her blade away from your neck, releasing you and allowing for you to finally stand again
>the snow is really beginning to fall, and the cold is now unbearable
>as you begin to wordlessly walk back inside, you notice the scyther shivering
>despite the fact that not five minutes ago she attempted to slash your neck open, you can't help but feel bad for her
>with scyther being a strange hybrid of reptiles and insects you figure she's cold-blooded, so the threat of her dying from this was a very real concern, and the last thing you needed on your conscience was causing someone's death after you squatted on her land
>"Hey" you begin to say "Why don't you come inside?"
 
>she looks at you, her angry expression having faltered but still present
>"Why would I want to come with you, human?"
>"Because it's colder than the fucking Russian winter and you're going to die if you don't come in" you say "Besides, I figure letting you stay at my place would be fair if you think I stole from you."
>her face contorts to a frown, a sigh escaping her mouth as she steps towards you "Fine..."
>you beckon her into the house and shut the door behind you, locking it as you remove your jacket and set it on the handmade rack beside you
>"So this is your house? Disssgusting..." she spat, staring around the cabin you worked your ass off to build
>well fuck you too, you ungrateful bitch
>after looking around, the scyther spots the fire you had started earlier, and her eyes immediately appear to light up in response
>"What's your name?" you ask, sitting on the crappy couch you had set up facing the TV, not that you could get the damn thing to work
>once again, fuck chinese import solar cells
>"Sandra" she says, kneeling in front of the fire in an attempt to warm up, covering herself in the process
>"So, Sandra... how did you find out where I lived?"
>the scyther turned her head to you "Idiot, it doesn't take a genius to hear someone who's chopping down half a forest for firewood"
>oh, right
>you wonder how she didn't find you earlier with all the noise you had been making trying to build this place, but would it have really made a difference as the end result would still have been her trying to kill you
>granted things worked out well in the end, but the point still stands
>well enough, at least...
>you had a fucking velociraptor-mantis monster with swords on her arms living with you
>but compared to how boring your old life was and how lonely things can get out here, having some contact was the best thing to happen
>"What's your name, human?" she asks, breaking the silence
>"Anon." you reply
 
>sandra stood up, begrudgingly extending her clawed hand towards you
>"Well, anon." she begins "It's nice to meet you."
>you stand up and shake her hand, trying to avert your gaze from her uh...
>indecency
>you really should get her some clothes
>with a yawn, sandra stretches her arms
>"Where's the bedroom, anon?" she asks, her eyes appearing heavy as she struggles to keep them open "I haven't been able to sleep in days because of you"
>ignoring her snide comment, you point her to the bedroom door, which she promptly heads off to
>come to think of it, you could use some sleep too
>after taking a minute to shut off the lights and take a well-needed piss after nearly doing so earlier, you head off to the bedroom, quietly entering and shutting the door behind you
>it just occurred to you that you forgot to bring your nugget back, which you usually sleep with
>fuck
>you take off everything save for your boxer briefs, tossing the soaked clothing into a nearby bin to wash later
>sandra is already in bed, lying on her side with the blankets over her, trying her best to keep warm in the cold winter air
>you climb into the bed, trying your best not to disturb her as you pull the covers over you
>after around a minute of lying there, you feel the bed shifting as you feel sandra wrap her arms around you, her body pressed tightly against your back, careful not to cut you with her scythes
>"Sandra, what are you doing?"
>"I'm cold. You're warm. Now be still, I'm trying to sleep" she coldly says, burying her face into your neck
>right...
>her soft, scaly breasts are pressed into your back
>no boner, bad boy, shoo
>you can feel her breathing gently slowing with each passing second
>not gonna lie, she was kinda cute
>as you both drift off to sleep, you're glad she seems happy that you're able to keep her warm for the night

>the next morning, you wake up to the sound of sandra snoring next to you
>god damn she's loud
>taking a quick glance to your side, you see the scyther laying on her back, the now-torn covers draped over her chest with one of her arms
>great, fixing those is going to be fun
>you slowly climb out of bed and make your way to the bathroom, because fuck sleeping
>it snowed pretty hard last night, considering you can't see shit but pure white covering every surface outside the window
>guess you're gonna have to wait to get your nugget back
>after taking a well-needed hot shower thanks to your gas-powered heater that was a pain in the ass to set up, you wrap a towel around your waist and make your way to the dresser
>as you're rifling through your clothes you decide to pick out some for sandra, too
>a thick wool sweater, some pants, and a pair of underwear will do fine for now
>you cut some holes to allow for her wings and scythes to fit through, just in case
>you glance back at sandra, who had in the meantime thrown the covers off of her and was now sprawled on the bed in her naked glory
>at least she wasn't snoring anymore
>you're able to get a better look at her now with the daylight pouring in
>her body was rather slim, and her unarmored breasts, which were a rather decent size in proportion, ended in a pair of dark green nipples that had adorably hardened from the cold
>you always thought it was weird that scyther tits weren't covered in armor 
>but you'd be lying if you said she wasn't beautiful
>no boner now's not the time for this shit, you have to get dressed
>quickly getting dressed, you quietly put sandra's clothes on the bed before stepping out of the room and out into the hall 
>besides, you don't want to get caught ogling her, god knows what she'll do to you
>sigh
>today was going to be a long one

>sandra walks out into the kitchen as you're making breakfast, her insect wings twitching as she adjusts the new clothing you gave her with a yawn
>well, provided an electric hot plate, mini fridge, and sink could count as a kitchen
>bulk rice and beans, breakfast of fucking champions
>"Good morning, Sandra" you turn to greet her as you're finishing up cooking
>she mumbles something along the lines of "Morning, anon" as she groggily sits down at the table, her eyes squinting ever so slightly
>considering what a heavy sleeper she was, you'd think that she would be more active
>oh well
>you set your plates down on the table, pulling out a chair and sitting down with her
>"Here, dig in. Get it while it's hot." you chuckle
>you can almost hear her stomach growling as her eyes locked on the fresh food sitting before her, her eyes widening in awe
>she remains silent for a moment "Is... is this for me?"
>"Of course, since you're living here I guess-"
>before you can finish the sentence sandra proceeds to hungrily devour her breakfast like someone who hadn't eaten in days
>jesus fucking christ how long has she gone without food?
>quietly, you begin to eat as well, occasionally looking up from your plate to see her continue to quickly eat the food you prepared without pause
>as the scyther finally finished her plate you finally decided to break the ice in the most autistic spaghetti-spilling way imaginable
>"Never knew you were such a big eater, it's a wonder you've managed to stay so slim" you joke, if you could even call it that
>"It's been a while since I've had something to eat, anon..." she replies, crossing her arms over her chest with a pout
>looks like you offended her
>no shit, dumbass
>"It was a joke, Sandra"
>without a word sandra stands up and begins to walk away, heading for the front door
>"Oh come on Sandra, I wasn't trying to-"
>before you could say another word sandra had already shut the door behind her "Asshole"
>fuck
>good job fucktard, you just made her leave
>you slowly stand up and take your empty plates to the sink, dropping them in the water before making your way to the living room, sitting on the couch and staring at the lifeless TV screen in the corner
>you just hope you didn't piss sandra off too much
>the sound of a tree falling and metal impacting wood snaps you out of your thoughts
>looking out the window, you see her outside chopping a tree into various forearm sized logs of firewood
>her attacks are so fast she almost looks like a blur
>you definitely don't want to get on her bad side
>sitting up from the couch you grab your coat and axe, you just had an idea pop into your head

>as you step outside into the cool winter air, sandra practically stops her wood chopping mid-swing and looks at you
>if looks could kill, you'd look like you were just shoved through a fucking jet engine
>"What do you want?" she hisses, her eyes narrowing as they lock onto yours, baring her teeth
>"Look," you sigh "I came out to apologize. I know I'm not exactly your favorite person to be around, that much is obvious to anyone, and to have me insult you like that even if that wasn't my intention wasn't exactly doing any wonders for our relationship. But for what it's worth, I'm sorry, Sandra." 
>sandra remains silent for a moment, her eyes examining your face for a moment. you can almost hear the gears turning in her head as she decides what to say next
>she scoffs, going back to hacking away "Just don't do it again, you idiot"
>apology... accepted?
>"Since you're out here chopping down a tree, I had an idea. How about a contest?" you say, attempting to change the subject
>"A contest?" she asks, the scyther cocking an eyebrow "That's stupid." 
>you wonder if she's incapable of being snarky
>"You haven't even heard what it's about."
>sandra rolls her eyes
>"You like chopping things up, right? So why don't we see who can chop up this tree the fastest?"
>oddly enough, that seemed to get her interest, as her eyes immediately lit up upon mentioning chopping something up
>"Ugh, fine..." she grumbles, grabbing the pieces of wood and begrudgingly placing them on the stumps in front of you
>with everything now set up, you begin
>as you raise your axe, sandra had already swiftly chopped the first log in two before moving onto the next one
>holy shit she's fast
>by the time you've finally swung she's sliced that one perfectly down the middle and has used her foot to kick the third into the path of her blades 
>the way she so elegantly performs this makes her almost look like a machine
>a beautiful, agile machine capable of murdering you in the blink of an eye before you could even register what was happening
>but she wasn't, and that's what both amazes and frightens you more than anything
>for the next hour or so you and sandra continue to hack apart every log she had set up
>by the end of it you were exhausted, and as you were sitting flat on your ass from said exhaustion you take a quick glance at sandra you notice that she hasn't even broken a sweat
>how in the fuck
>could scyther even sweat?
>you notice a sly smile begin to form on her face "So anon. I take it I won this little contest of yours?" 
>"Yeah..." you pant, trying to catch your breath "Yeah, you did."
>all in all, you'd say you two had made enough firewood to last you for the rest of the year
>granted she made most of it, but still
>her smug grin fading, sandra stretches her arms and buzzes her wings "Good, then let's go back inside, the cold's starting to get to me again."
>"That sounds like a good idea" you wheeze, trying painfully to stand up
>jesus christ your arms hurt, this contest wasn't such a good idea in hindsight
>as you two head back inside and shut the door sandra peered one of her yellow eyes towards you and spoke "Oh, and anon. As stupid as it sounded at first, I had fun with you."
>if you had been drinking something you would've spit it out, did she really just say that?
>"T-thanks?" was all you could say
>"Don't mention it." she replies coldly as usual before walking off in the direction of the living room
>it was faint, but you could almost see the spark of a friendship within her, as hard as she was on the exterior
>lost in thought you begin to smile, but the returning pain in your arms causes you to return to reality
>as you set the axe down you begin to limp off to the bedroom
>you figure you could use a bath, hopefully by then you'll stop feeling like your arms were fed through a woodchipper
