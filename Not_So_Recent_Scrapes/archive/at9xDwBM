>Morning faggots.
>You are Anon, professional P.I.M.P.
>It’s been a long day of back-slappin’ hoes and selling ass.
>Nah, you are independently wealthy. You only have a job to break up the monotony that is life.
>It’s not glamorous work but it’s a job that allows you to pick and choose your own work. Good for holidays and stuff.
>The fact that you never need to worry about money makes things doubly good.
>You have a girlfriend, by the way.
>Her name is Sarah and she’s a Wolf.
>Beautiful grey and white coat with golden eyes, like pools of honey with golden flecks.
>The best part? Her and you are madly in love. Not even the normie kind, either. You would actually die for eachother.
>She fell for you long before she found out that you had money.
>Anyway, coming home from a day at *Insert job here* you are coming home, back to soft fur and hard liquor.
>Pulling into your driveway, you shut off your car, savoring the warmth for a moment longer.
>You open the door- MOTHERFUCKERIT’SFUCKINGCOLD!!!
>CanadianWeather.webm
>Fuck it.
>Door open.
>Stand up.
>Immediately encrusted with snow.
>Fuck around for 5 minutes because you dropped your keys.
>More cold.


>“Hi honey!” you heard Sarah from the living room.
>You shuck your boots and coat, dropping your gloves and hat on the ground next to them.
>“Hurry up~” She whines, as you hear shifting and shuffling around.
>You, finally, get rid of most of the snow on you and walk though your house.
>It’s spacious. Nothing too extravagant but it was definitely a house.
>Nice hardwood floors, a big kitchen and a living room filled with soft sofas and comfy chairs.
>Rugs dotted the floor under the seats and a nice big fluffy one was in front of the fireplace.
>What you see next nearly makes you choke.
>You see your Lupine girlfriend lying by the fireplace, stretched out on her back with the fire >rolling peacefully behind her. The soft yellow flames sent out beames of bright, yet soft light >that gently caressed and licked at her body. Her firm, D-cup breasts, her muscled stomach >and her toned thighs were accentuated in the darkened room, making her all the more sexy to you.
>She lazily rolled her head on the carpet, looking at you with those huge golden eyes.
>“Finally. I thought you’d never get here.” She grumbles, softly.
>The fire crackles and pops, almost in agreement.
>You tell her sorry babe, the snow had to come off.
>Wood floors and all that.
>“Well, waiting is not something that I’m good at, as you know. Come here, dear. Let me warm you.” She coos, reaching out her arm.
>There’s a disheveled blanket on the rug, next to her and another one folded beside it.
>You move toward her, stripping off your clothing along the way, until your in your boxer-briefs (Fuck off, it’s comfy), standing above her.

>“Not to say that I don’t like the view, because I do.” She inches forward and inhales deeply. “Hmm~. I most certainly do… But… I’d like to cuddle a little first.”
>How scandalous. I bet she wants to hold hands, too.
>You get down on a knee and she tackle-glomps you the rest of the way down.
>Now you’re on your back, in front of a warm fire with an… ample… wolf snugging you, hard-core, while burying her nose in your hair and inhaling your scent like it was a line of ~REALLY GOOD~ cocaine.
>You laugh at her antics and eagerness.
>She laughs along with you before planting a kiss on your lips.
>Her black muzzled lips forming themselves to your own.
>“Now that’s a proper hello.” She says, rather triumphantly.
>She goes back in for another kiss, this one more passionate and lingering.
>She rests her body onto yours, keeping your lips locked.
>She wraps a hand around the back of your neck and another under your arm to hold you as close as possible as she snuggle/mouthrapes you.
>You wrap your arms around her in reciprocation, holding her equally as close.
>You run your left hand down her arm, the one behind your head, cupping her wrist, you pull it out from behind you and intertwine your fingers with hers.

>The kiss was passionate and full of fire.
>Sarah was so full of life with everything that she did.
>So full of passion.
>Passion that she was about to show you.
>She separated from you with a gasp and looked over to your hands.
>“Ohhh. Hand-holding… Huff. How lewd… I like it.”
>Thank Allah this anthro browses the chanz.
>You ask her how in the fuck did you get so lucky.
>“Because you deserve it. You deserve everything good that happens to you this year.”
>She brushes a clawed hand over your brow and back though your hair, petting you gently and with tender care.
>“You deserve everything good that happens every year.”
>She sits up and pulls you up with her.
>She crosses her legs behind you and holds your face in her softly padded hands.
>Her breasts are smushed up against your chest as well as the entire front of her body.
>“I love you. I love you so much.”
>She kisses your forehead.
>“I.”
>She kisses your left eye.
>“Love.”
>Right eye.
>“You.”
>On your nose.
>“So.”
>Finally, she places a kiss directly on your lips, letting it linger for a few seconds.
>“Much. I’ve told you that I love you. Do you think that I would be here if I didn’t love you?”


>You guess not.
>“There… That’s what I’m talking about. Now, perk up.”
>You tell her, alright and give her another quick smooch.
>“Good. Now, you must be freezing. I’m doing my best to warm you up but I think that the fire >could do a better job.”
>You agree and untangle yourselves.
>“Now. Sit by the fire. I’ll make some tea for my big strong human. Now, relax by the fire, cuddle >up in that blanket and I’ll take care of you so you can… take care of me…” Her voice drops an octave as she says the last line.
>That was a good thought.
>You love when she uses that voice.
>Gravely and full of power.
>She saunters out of the room, into the kitchen, hips swaying, giving you a great view of her thigh-gap and a glance at her smooth, slightly puffed, vagina.
>She turns a corner and you can see her flash a toothy grin over her shoulder at you.
>With a flick of her floofy tail, she was out of sight.
>She knew damn well what she was doing.
>So did your underwear, now a size too small.
>You mutter to yourself about the damn sexy anthros.

>Sitting in front of the fire, you were already warm but the extra heat is more than welcome.
>You hear the clicking of a boiled kettle in the kitchen and then the sound of water being moved into cups.
>You hear several more small clinks and tapping before you hear your love padding back over to you.
>”Shuffle over, hon.”
>You do and are handed a white mug with a design of a grey wolf on each side of the mug.
>Cute, she remembers your favorite.
>She sits down next to you.
>You notice a slight musk that you hadn’t before.
>Sarah’s mug is blue with gold stripes, in a swirl, all around the mug.
>She gives you a small kiss on the cheek and takes a sip from her drink.
>You do the same and are very pleased with the flavor.
>You ask her if there’s ginger in this.
>”Mmhmm. I know how much you like it. Camomile and ginger. Sweet and spicy. Like you!”
>You thank her and pull her close with an arm around her waist.
>”Careful! You’ll spill everything! Make sure to drink all of that, too. I want you at your best.”

>You ask her why.
>”Well… Remember how my heat is soon, right?”
>You remember.
>”And, remember how I said that I was going to go to the doctor next week, right? My heat hadn’t come in yet and I was worried.”
>You were worried too.
>You try and comfort your girl as best as you can.
>”Not that I don’t appreciate your doting on me but… I seem to recall that I was telling YOU something, right?”
>You cannot seem to recall that.
>”Silly human.”
>You tell her she’s a cute wolf.
>”I’m not cute. I’m fierce!”
>You girr at her and start nibbling on an ear.
>”HAHAHAHA! Oh my god, I did not expect that!”
>You tell her, around the ear in your mouth, that you can stop.
>”Nah. Feels good and I can get back to what I was saying.
>You mouth kay and she shivers a little.
>”S-So, remember about the appointment? So, it was about the heat and it being late… Well…”
>She took the empty mug from your hand and set her’s, along with yours, beside the fireplace.
>”You left so early that I couldn’t tell you.”
>The fire crackles and pops, the light dying down.
>”Oh, shit. Hold on, babe.”
>She pushes the blanket off her and rolls forward, onto her knees.
>She reaches for another log out of the wood rack (that you built and lacquered and it looks fucking good)


>Your eyes trail from her hand, up her arm, over her fluffy tits and down her side to her voluptuous ass, shaped in a heart.
>It’s like it was all for you.
>They your gaze descends.
>There it is.
>The best thing in the world.
>Her plump black lips, thick at the top with a gentle curve, slightly parted, allowing you to see a touch of pink inside her.
>The puffy lips trailed down, thinner and thinner, until they met and curved upward, hiding something special.
>Right there, in front of you, on full display, is your girlfriends triangular, tasty, pussy.
>Your eyes locking with it and with every shake of her hips, every twist of her body and every movement from her body, manipulating the wood in the fire, your gaze does not waver.
>You drink in the sight of her lips gently squishing as she shifts her legs to get better access to whatever she was doing.
>”Enjoying the view?”
>You are snapped out of your enjoyment by Sarah’s voice, bringing your eyes up from her pussy and back to her face.
>She’s looking over her shoulder back at you with a grin that showed every one of her beautiful teeth.
>”See anything you like?”
>You tell her that it’s her.
>She sits back down.
>”Keep talking like that and I’ll show you just how fierce this cute little wolf can be.”


>As she sits down another wave of light musk washes over you.
>”Mmmm. So, as I have been trying to tell you. Since you left so early and everything.”
>She swung an arm over your shoulders and pressed her muzzle up to your ear.
>”I canceled the appointment this morning.”
>You ask her if she means what you think that she means.
>”This morning I woke up and all I could think about was you.”
>She puts her other arm around you.
>”You and your hair.”
>She runs a hand though your hair.
>”Your face.”
>Sarah gently caresses your cheek.
>”Those lips that can work wonders.”
>A kiss pushes you back but you remain sitting up.
>”Your body. Your big strong body.”
>She runs a hand down your chest and over your stomach.
>”That big caring heart of yours. It makes me cry every time that I think of how generous you are. How caring you are. How sweet and loving and patient you are.”
>She puts her hand over your chest.
>”I know that I already told you but you deserve everything good. Including me.”


>With that, she presses her lips to yours, only this time, her tongue is gently licking your lips.
>You open them for her and she begins to lick your teeth, almost like she’s counting them.
>She blows hot breath into your mouth and you can taste the tea that she just had, along with mint and spice from her fur.
>She sucks in a breath of air from the side of her mouth while her long tongue wrestles with your own.
>You have no chance but you put up a good fight, pinning her’s down once or twice but she’s just too good.
>Eventually she breaks it off with a sigh and, panting heavily, swings her leg over your lap, now straddling you.
>Your underwear is now gone and you have no idea how it got off… Oh well.
>”As I was saying, I canceled the appointment this morning.”
>”It first, I called because I felt hot. Like, uncomfortably hot. I called them to see if I could have an appointment earlier and I was describing my symptoms and everything to Janet.”
>”You remember her, right?”
>You do remember Janet.
>She was an old flame of yours.
>She was a black and white Border Collie Anthro that just adored you. Sadly, she loved everyone and you broke it off after she cheated on you.
>”Now, she said that she was having the same thing. A late heat and all but, according to her, the later the heat, the more intense it is.”
>You look at your girl.
>”That’s right”
>Sarah giggles softly.
>”She’s been looking for a little help with that particular problem recently and would be quite… open… to the idea of a… sharing. Anyway, while that’s in your mind, after we had our little chat, I started, just aching.”
>”Aching for you to fill me, ot ravish me and to make me yours.”
>She presses her lips to your ears.
>”I’ve been waiting all day for you to get home. I want you to breed me.”
>You nod dumbly.
>She laughs. “I knew you’d say that. First, though. You have to earn it.”

>”She’s gently grinding on top of you, shifting left and right, carefully keeping away from your shaft.
>”Let me tell you, it’s been a stressful morning. First, I woke up and I had this itch. You know the one. The one I tell you about?”
>She leans in real close.
>”The one that only you can scratch? Reaching deep inside me to rub at that place that just aches when you’re not there?”
>”Oh, I could barely get out of bed, my whole body warmed up when I thought of you. Almost… Almost like a heat but so much more intense.”
>You smile and trail a hand gently over her lower back, trailing down to her butt.
>”Oh, that’s the stuff.”
>”Please, k-keep going.”
>She’s really sensitive.
>Almost like her whole body is an erogenous zone.
>Well she is in heat.
>She whispers into your ear.
>”When I made breakfast, all I could think about is you bending me over the counter and fucking me so hard that my feet leave the floor.”
>”I couldn’t stop my hands from shaking as I thought about you fucking a litter of your pups into me.”
>”I could feel my juice running down my legs and my pussy kept trying to grab you. Hear that baby? My pussy missed you.”
>”It missed that big, long, smooth, hard, human cock.”

>You can’t stand it anymore.
>You grab her ass and squeeze.
>She yips in surprise and clutches your shoulders.
>You can feel the heat radiating out of her crotch.
>It’s insanely warm.
>She was not fucking around when she said it was more intense.
>Poor darling.
>You tell her that she must have been going crazy.
>She growls.
>”Crazy does now even begin to describe how much I want your cock.”
>”I want it inside me. Right… Fucking… Now… Understand?”
>You tell her that you need clearer instruction.
>She pushes you down and climbs up your chest until she’s resting right on top of you.
>”You might have noticed that touch of musk. I know that you love that smell.”
>“I’m going into heat tomorrow but~... I don’t see why we can’t start a little early, do you?”
>You tell her no.
>”Good!”
>She sits on your crotch, carefully avoiding your turged todger.

>You tell her that those boobs look heavy and might you hold them for her.
>”Hehehe. You always know how to make make me smile. Sure.”
>No sooner are the words out of her mouth than you are on her breasts.
>You heft them gently and roll them gently around in your hands.
>”It’s alright dear. You know how I like it.”
>You run your hands on the outside of her mounds, slowly circling in on the slightly puffy nipples.
>Sarah’s breathing became faster and she let out a small moan.
>You gently brushed her nips with your thumbs causing them to harden to diamonds.
>Then you trail you hands off her tits and down to her toned belly.
>You can feel the muscle under the soft, grey/white fur.
>You dig your nails in and begin to scratch.
>Her eyes lock with yours as she gets out a soft, shuttering moan.
>”Oh fuuuuck~. That's the shit, right there.”
>You rub a little lower, feeling the rest of her teats, just as hard as the top two, pressing into your palms as you run your hands over her belly.
>You could feel the warmth of her pussy through her body.
>She's shifting and shuttering on top of you and you decide to end it.
>You whisper into her ear that she's a good girl.
>”You know that's not as effective on me. I'm not a dog. But.. huff. I must admit… Mmmm. Theres- there's something special about you calling me that.”
>Her body tenses.
>”Keep scratching and kiss me.”

>You do.
>You wrestle her tongue for another few minutes before she pulls away.
>”Alright, fuck this. I need you inside me. I need you to fuck me. Right fucking now.”
>She lifts her hips up.
>You dart a hand underneath her body and rub her triangular doggy cunt.
>Her cunny is absolutely soaking wet.
>There are droplite of juice dripping onto your palm, so hot they almost burn.
>She jumps at the touch.
>“HAW! Oh fuck! Yes, right there! Rub my clit!”
>You pull your hand back, pulling the hood along and exposing the button that you are looking for.
>You gently press it and she nearly explodes.
>She’s twisting left and right, mewling and moaning, bucking and thrusting her hips.
>After another press she lifts herself off your hand.
>”You’ve got great hands but now I need your cock. I need you to breed me.
>You tell her that you will.
>You gently shift so that you’re on top with Sarah on her back, legs splayed and arms out.
>”Please darling. Take me.”
>With pleasure.
>You align your penis with her puffed out cookie.
>You could feel the staggering heat radiating out of it.
>It was most and warm and inviting.
>You gently prodded her with the tip, sending an jolt of electricity up Sara’s spine.
>“Ha~! Oh yes, please, keep going…”
>Soft, puffy, triangular lips were pulled aside, enveloping you in a wave of soft, gooey warmth and silk-wrapped iron walls.
>As you pushed into her, you felt like you were going to melt.
>You could feel the waves and ripples in her canal as you slid more and more of your length into >your sweetheart, spearing her in the best way possible.
>Her moans and gasps deamnded that you speed up but you were determined to take it slow.
>Suddenly, halfway down, you stopped.
>“No. Haaaa…. Haaaa. Don’t… Huuu… Don’t stop. Why? Why did you stop?” She pants and moans at you, full of lust.

>You tell her that it wasn’t very nice of her to drag you to the ground and make you fuck her. She >should apologize.
>“Are you, Haaa~, kidding? You’re… You’re going to make me apologize for going into heat?”
>You tell her that if she doesn’t want to, that’s fine.
>You begin to slide your cock out of her, until just the tip is left inside her.
>“No, no, no, no! Wait. I… I, uh… I mean…”
>You could be mean…
>“Mean? What do you- HAAAA~!!!”
>You slam your cock into her in one stroke, slamming your hips into hers with the force and fury of a thousand burning suns.
>She constricts around you like a vice and milks your cock in pulses, running from your base to your tip. It feels like she’s swallowing you with her pulsing pussy.
>Again and again, her walls roll over you, soaking your dick in her juice and heating up your rod so hot, you were afraid of melting.
>You held on to your will to not cum, despite all the rolling, massaging, sucking, swallowing and >squeezing going on downstairs.
>Girl fluids can’t melt steel boners.
>“Oh god, oh god, oh god~!” Sarah moans again and again as she rides out her sudden orgasim.
>She’s panting heavily as she comes down and looks at you with those big golden eyes and a wicked grin on her face.
>It was at this moment that you realise… You fucked up…
