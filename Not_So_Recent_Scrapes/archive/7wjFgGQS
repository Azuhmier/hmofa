>Ah.  Couldn't be a more pleasant day.
>The sun's playfully peeking out from behind a few clouds, the wind is blowing merrily, the waves gently crash against the sand...
>It's the perfect day to hang out on the beach.  Especially since nobody's here today.  
>Apparently there's some new amusement park open in town.  Or something like that.  Whatever, you'll take a relaxing day at the beach over wading through kids any day.
>A seagull flies overhead, nearly dropping a payload right on your head.  Maybe next time, little guy.  
>You reach the perfect spot, then unfold your beach blanket.  You unpack your stuff, then plop down onto the blanket with a contented sigh.
>Smell that sea breeze a-blowing... listen to the ocean lapping away at the sand...
>Yep, can't get much better than this.
>Another gull flies by, and you flip him a cheese puff from your snack supply.  The little fella lands nearby, only to get mobbed by his buddies.
>Heheh, stupid birds.
>The gulls tumble and roll across the sand as you watch, chuckling, when something catches your eye...
>Huh.  Someone made a pretty nice sandcastle tower, and just left it?
>...where's the rest of the castle?  Can't have a castle with just one tower!
>You stand, stretch, and walk over to the sand tower.  Might as well build onto it, right?
>Bending down, you plunge your hand into the ground and grab a handful of densely packed, wet sand.  It... almost feels like it's already rounded.
>Before you can pull your finding out of the ground, there's a shout.
>"WHOA!  Can't a gal just enjoy a seaside nap without gettin' groped?"

>Before you can react, a ton of sand is kicked up as something rises out of the ground.  Coughing and rubbing your eyes, you frantically apologize, confused.
>"Sorry, sorry!  I was just-"
>You trail off as you get a look at the woman standing in front of you.  She's stunning, almost statuesque, with a toned beach body... but that's not what catches your eye.
>No, the biggest thing you notice is that she seems to be made of sand.
>Indeed, her whole body seems to be composed of the very beach you're standing on.  Compared to the rest of the sand surrounding you, she seems much denser, and considerably damp.
>Two large seashells cover her rather sizable chest, one of the two being askew.  A noticeable hand-shaped indent mars her left tit, and you blush a bit when realization strikes.
>A garish, lime green bikini bottom hides her modesty, if she indeed has any.  An indentation marks where you suppose a belly button would be.
>As you scan her form, it becomes apparent that not only is she made of sand, she's not human.  She seems to be some sort of fox woman, with a snout, pointed ears, and even a flared tail of sand.
>The sandcastle turret you saw earlier rests atop her head at a jaunty angle, like a whimsical hat.  From behind a pair of sunglasses, she eyes you up, a little frown on her face.
>"What's the big idea, man?  Ain'tcha got any decency?  Grabbin' a gal by the boob before ya even say hi."
>A grin slowly spreads across her face as you swear a faint blush creeps to her cheeks.
>"I gotta say though, you have a heckuva grip, and some soft hands... gonna have to make some repairs real quicklike, though."
>She kneels down, grabs a handful of wet sand, and gently kneads it into her squashed breast, poking her sandy tongue out as she focuses.  She eventually manages to return her bosom to its proper shape, then fixes the shell back with a nod.
>"THERE!  Awright now, what's yer name, man?"
>You stare, silent and baffled.

>The vixen twitches an ear expectantly, smiling down at you. When you're unable to muster up a response, she laughs heartily.
>"Ha, speechless?  Guess I can't really be surprised."
>You finally manage to swallow your confusion and speak.
>"I-I'm Anon... how are you... WHAT are you...?"
>The sand woman laughs again.
>"Anon, huh?  That's a weird friggin' name, man, not gonna lie.  But, uh, I guess I ain't got room to say that, considering my name's S-"
>You cut her off accidentally.
>"Sandy, right?"
>She exhales sharply.
>"Psssh, like I ain't heard that one before!  Nah, name's Shorely.  No, not Shirley; Shorely."
>She extends a hand, and you hesitantly shake it, only for it to detach at the wrist.  Shorely gasps dramatically.
>"Holy ship!  My hand!"
>You panic and drop it, only for a new hand to sprout from her wrist.  Shorely sticks her tongue out playfully and laughs.
>"Just screwin' with ya, Anon."
>...this is so weird.  You smile awkwardly and chuckle, and she grins patiently.
>"...pretty friggin' out there, ain't it?"
>"How are you... alive?"
>She shrugs.
>"Psssh, beats the heckoutta me, but I ain't all that worried about it, man.  I'm here, and that's clear, feel me?"
>You nod, still processing things.
>"So, uh, what are you doing here, Shir- SHORELY?"
>She spreads her arms out and indicates the whole beach.
>"Same as you, I reckon: enjoying some R&R by the sea.  I was havin' a nice lil snooze cruise under the sand when ya grabbed aholda one'a my puppies."
>"S-sorry."
>"Eh, I ain't worried about it.  Live and let live, man.  Ya didn't know I was asleep under the sand.  Honest mistake.  'Sides, I gotta say I didn't mind it that much, man.  Like I said: heckuva grip on ya."
>With a thud, Shorely roughly drops onto her rump, sitting with her feet just shy of the water.
>"C'mon, Anon, why don'tcha join me?  Seems like it's just us two out here today, man."
>...why not.  You take a seat next to the sand fox, and she grins.

>The light wind continues to blow, having no apparent effect on Shorely's ears nor her precariously balanced hat.  She takes a deep breath and sighs happily.
>"Man.  I could sit here and smell that sea breeze allllll day.  Whattabout you, Anon?  Bet yer a fan of it too, huh."
>You nod in agreement, taking a whiff of the briny air yourself.
>"Good!  Figured ya had some taste, man.  ...well, that's still up in the air, considerin' those shorts."
>Oh yeah.  You had to wear your backup swim trunks today thanks to a dryer mishap.  Your extremely garish, colorful backup trunks.
>Shorely gently elbows you, her sandy form rendering the blow totally harmless.  You grin.
>"Oh yeah?  Well look at you!  Your bottom and, uh, top don't match."
>"Yeah, and?  'Least my bottom ain't but one color, lookit those clown pants ya got on, man!"
>She chuckles, and you can't help but join in.  She eventually stops, only to suddenly turn towards your blanket.
>"Uhh, don't look now, man, but I reckon the gulls found your cheese puffs."
>...dammit, so they did.  Stupid birds.
>A small flock of seagulls fights amongst themselves as they mangle the bag of puffs.  Feathers fly as a cacophony of squeals fills the air.  Shorely cracks up at the sight, only to clam up when a gull flys over and lands on her hat.
>A frown crosses her face as she realizes the bird is carrying a cheese puff in his beak, a fact that isn't lost on his kinfolk.  The swarm advances on the sandy vixen.
>"...aw, son of a beach."
>The gulls go berserk, flailing and fighting atop Shorely's head as she tries to shoo them off.
>"Getoff, getoff, getOFF!"
>She finally tosses her turret hat to the ground, then snarls at the birds, scaring them off.  As soon as they leave, she sits back down calmly.
>Her sunglasses fell off in the conflict, revealing that her eyes are large pearls.  Shorely blinks a few times, grinning sheepishly.
>"Uh... sorry 'bout that, man.  Lost my cool.  And my hat.  ...and my shades, apparently!  Man, I'm losing it, huh?"
>You hand her the fallen shades, blurting out:
>"You have beautiful eyes."
>She freezes halfway to putting her sunglasses back on.
>"..."
>Another blush somehow creeps to her sandy face.
>"...t-thanks, man.  That's sweet of ya."

>She clears her throat, putting her shades back on with a sheepish grin.
>"So, uh, gulls, right?  Friggin' birds, man.  Sorry 'bout yer snacks."
>"It's fine, I mainly brought those to feed the gulls anyway.  You're welcome to have some of my food if you want, though, I brought plenty."
>"Naw, thanks though. I'll jus' grab a lil-"
>Shorely plunges a hand into the wet sand beside her, pulling up a handful of tiny shells.  With a grin, she pops them into her mouth like popcorn, crunching loudly as she chews.  She eventually swallows with a sound like grinding cement.
>"There we go, that's the stuff!  Want some, man?"
>"Uhh..."
>She laughs and slaps you on the back, leaving a sandy handprint.
>"I ain't serious, man, just screwin' around!"
>She frowns for a second, then turns and spits out a little sand crab.
>"Whoops!  Sorry, little man."
>Unharmed, the perturbed crustacean promptly digs back into the sand.  Shorely turns back to you.
>"Hey, man, I ain't got anything else stuck in my teeth, right?"
>She opens her mouth, revealing fangs of sand, lined with bits of crushed shells.
>"...nope, you're good."
>"Awesome, man, thanks."
>She sighs happily, popping another handful of shells into her mouth and staring out across the ocean.
>"Y'know somethin', man?  'S nice to have someone else here for once.  You're a pretty friggin' chill guy."
>The fox yawns and leans against you, her damp, sandy form brushing against your bare skin.  She's a bit coarse, but not unpleasant.
>And, man, is she warm.
>"Hey, man, I know this is like, super sudden, but, mind if I nab a lil shuteye for a minute?  Like, laying in your lap maybe?"
>"...sure, go ahead."
>She grins and yawns again.
>"Thanks, Anon.  I'll only be out like, 10 mins tops."
>Shorely repositions herself, then falls backwards into your lap...
>...promptly collapsing into a blanket of sand when she lands, burying your legs.  The tip of her snout juts from the sand, a faint smile lingering.
>She begins snoring almost instantly as you sit there, feeling the incredibly soothing warmth of her sand in your lap.

>The sun shines down on you as the snoozing Shorely holds you in place.  The gull flock continues to squabble over your cheese puffs.  That cool sea breeze again wafts past you.
>You've never been more relaxed in your life.  You sigh contentedly, enjoying your sand blanket.
>...you start to feel a bit drowsy yourself, actually.  You gently lay backwards, only for an unusually soft mound of sand to rise up beneath your head.  It takes you a moment, but you soon recognize it as Shorely's tail.
>You rest on the makeshift pillow, listening to the waves as they wash in and out.  The blanket of sand covering your legs shifts around, soon covering up to your chest.
>Shorely reforms partially, her smiling face hovering above yours.
>"Hey, man, sleep tight, aight?  I'll wake ya up in a bit."
>She collapses back into a blanket as you doze off, wrapped in warmth...
>...you awaken to pressure on your chest.  You blink a few times, then realize your sandy companion has fully reformed.  She lounges on top of you, her elbow pressed into your ribs.  It doesn't hurt, thankfully, but you can feel her weight.
>She smiles warmly.
>"Feel better, man?  Always nice to grab a lil nap, ain'tit?"
>You nod as she stands up, stretching.  She brushes some sand off her midsection, to no apparent effect, then adjusts her shades.
>"Hey, Anon; wanna go for a dip with me?"
>You eye up the water, then her.
>"Uh...."
>"...what?  Oh, duh.  Don't sweat it man, I ain't gonna melt or anythin'.  I swim out here all the time."
>Concerns quelled, you step out into the water alongside Shorely.  To your shock, she reaches over and takes a hold of your hand as you walk.
>She sighs happily.
>"Mm... man, I love the water.  Feels good on the ol' sand, man."
>She unceremoniously lets go of your hand, then falls face first into the surf, floating on her belly.  She pulls her head up and out of the water, spitting a stream of sandy water at you with a chuckle.  You splash her with a handful of water, laughing in kind.
>Shorely puts on an exaggerated look of outrage and stands up.
>"Hey, man, what's the big idea?"
>She laughs and prepares to shove you, but pauses for a second.  It doesn't take long to see why: she lost her shell "top" when she faceplanted.
>Her perfectly formed breasts are on full display, nips and all.
>"Aw, clammit, this never happens!  G-gimme a sec, man."
>She bashfully covers her chest with an arm, then ducks down underwater for a moment.  In a moment, she resurfaces, holding two identical shells that are a bit larger than the ones she lost.
>"Bah, great, lost em.  Guess I'll have to make these work."
>She hands you the shells, then bends over again, this time emerging with two handfuls of wet sand.  Blushing madly, she massages this sand into her bust, slightly, ever-so-slightly, enlarging her chest.
>She can't even meet your gaze, her whole face practically glowing red somehow.
>"C-can ya hand me those shells, man?"
>You comply, and she gently applies them to herself, soon regaining her decency with an embarrassed giggle.
>"Thanks, Anon."

>After a good while of swimming, you and Shorely return to the beach, exhausted.
>"Phew, man, whatta workout!  But, fun as always.  Even better with a friend, though."
>"Yeah, it is.  Thanks for having me along, Shorely."
>"Hey, yeah, man.  Thanks for hangin' out with me.  I 'preciate it, Anon.  You're a pretty cool guy."
>She pulls her shades down and winks a pearly eye.
>"...and, uh... th-thanks for helpin' me with that wardrobe malfunction, man."
>"No problem.  But I think you oughta let those puppies free."
>You elbow her playfully, and she blushes again.
>"Ha... nah, man.  Maybe another time."
>She takes a seat by the ocean, and you join her, leaning against her warm, sandy side.
>Shorely yawns and stretches, discreetly throwing an arm around you and pulling you close.
>"Hey, Anon, man.  Let's just chill here a while, alright?"
>You nod, wrapping an arm around her narrow waist.
>The fox plants a gritty kiss on your cheek, then leans against you, smiling.
>The two of you sit back and watch the waves roll in till sunset, enjoying the best beach day you've ever had.
>Man, are you glad you didn't go to that stupid amusement park.
