>Be Anon
>Fucking lost in the fucking woods like a doofus. 
>glad you have a good trail to follow. 
>these trees are nothing like when you first got here. 
>see something ahead under a branch. 
>check it out like an idiot. 
>It's a bumblebee. 
>except it's the size of a fucking dog. 
>and it's injured. Caught under a branch, with a crumpled wing. 
>to be honest, you're fucking terrified. 
>If that thing were to sting you, you woukd be so fucking dead that when they found your body, they'd have to start looking for invasive species from Australia. 
>but it's hurt. and looking at you like it knows you can help it. 
>dammit, you know this will end poorly. 
>you free the thing then almost run for your life, expecting it to fly at you to attack. 
>it just sits there, all fluffy and cute, looking at you. 
>Cute? 
>Dafuq
>right. its wing is crumpled. It couldn't fly at you. It's broken two legs as well. 
>carefully pick it up. 
>idiot

>You hear fluttering.
>You're surrounded by cat-sized bees. 
>dead idiot
>You guess their wings are too big to buzz. 
>They move in formation down the path. 
>They pause and look back at you. 
>You're expected to follow. 
>welp

>You're led into a huge underground bumblebee nest lit up conveniently by bioluminescent fungus to keep the story moving. 
>move forward into a throne room. 
>fuzzy, soft, cuddly (if they weren't pointy) bees everywhere. 
>constant fluttering and beating of wings.
>one in the middle. 
>that must be the queen, the only one with two sets of hands for its first 4 legs. 
>She's got no stinger. 
>or it's so small it's hidden under her fuzziness. 
>so. fucking. fluffy...
>Her beady, black eyes take in the sight of you with her injured worker in your arms. 
>you're either going to die or you're going to be rewarded. 
>another worker carries the injured one away. 

>the queen beats her wings in a pattern, and suddenly everyone else clears the room. 
>She approaches you and rubs her fluffy self all over you.
>boner why
>her scent is overwhelming, and... sexy. 
>oh shit boner, no!
>She leans forward and separates her mandibles. 
>this is a bite, a weird kiss, or a weird kiss that's going to bite. 
>a proboscis prods between your lips and starts playing with your tongue
>betterthaniexpected


>she starts squirting nectar into your mouth. 
>kinky?
>her forceful grip tells you to swallow it. 
>it's delicious and sickly sweet. Her smell permeates the flavor. 
>she slowly leans you back as she continues filling your stomach with honey. 
>it's so good you relax and your eyes roll back.
>you don't notice her wing beats summoning her workers again. 
>nor the honey causing your erection to harden to diamonds. 
>nor her workers chewing away your clothes, and building the queen's new throne with you as a part of it. 
>the taste of the honey and the warm, humid air against your dick is enough to keep you in hypnotic bliss. 
>your stomach is near-bursting when you realize that your penis and your face are the only things not firmly sealed into the hive. 
>The queen's eyes are half-lidded, you imagine. But how?
>that nectar is doing something to you. 
>your insides are squirming, as though they were rearranging themselves. 
>you can't imagine eating anything BUT nectar now. Nothing else seems appetizing
>you should want out, but you don't. 
>you should be afraid, but you aren't. 
>you're just desperately, painfully horny. 

>your queen nibbles on your ear as she gently lowers herself onto your rod. She seems careful not to squish your over-stuffed belly. 
>you're cumming like a geyser. 
>you don't feel so full anymore.

You don't know how long it's been. 
>your digestive system has been rigged to only take nectar and only produce semen. 
>the queen lets you out of your beeswax prison. By then your muscles have atrophied so you can barely crawl. 
>Her workers have to help you wherever you go. 
>you don't mind. they're soft and warm and fluffy. 
>you spend your mornings being stuffed with nectar by your queen, your afternoons digesting it and cuddling her (and now your) babies, and your evenings releasing your bliss into your queen. 
>you resolve to become the best drone ever. 
>right after you finish digesting all this sugar and turn it into cum.
