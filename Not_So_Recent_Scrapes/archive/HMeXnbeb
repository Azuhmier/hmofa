>The feeling that you're being watched.
>You've heard that phrase in countless movies and shows over the years. But today's the first time you can say you've had the feeling yourself.
>You're walking down the street after a long shift at work; the sun's already set and the moon is rising. Not a soul on the street, and yet...
>You can't shake that feeling.
>You turn around and swear you see a flash of movement.

<Several actions, concluded with Grab Your Knife>

>Your mind races. You're unsure what to do. Several possibilities cross your subconscious. Make an outdated 90's cartoon reference. Do an air guitar solo. Tell off your nonexistent girlfriend for spooking you. Sing.
>Of all of them, the most useful is the urge to make sure your pocketknife is handy. Of course, it is. It always is.
>You hear a very faint scratching, like pen on paper. After that, silence. Nothing moves.
>Eventually, still holding your knife just in case, you turn and continue walking. It's not long before you get that eerie feeling again. And you notice a sound.
>Quiet footsteps. Following you from a distance. Every time you glance back you see nothing but an occasional blur of movement.

<Scream DON'T RAPE ME and twirl your knife>

>You try and think of something intimidating to yell at the blur.
>"PLEASE DON'T RAPE ME"
>Emphasis on "try to."
>You also try to twirl your pocketknife. You succeed in dropping it.
>You scramble to pick it back up, and in the meantime hear more scratching and... something else.
>A very faint voice.
>"Hmm. Interesting reaction..."
>You reclaim the knife and resume walking at a much faster pace now. The pursuing footsteps do not speed up. However, you still feel the piercing gaze of your observer.

<Slow down and look back>

>In an attempt to get a look at your pursuer, you slow your pace greatly. They do not change their stride. After a moment of this, you quickly turn to look at them.
>This time you get a vague impression of the mysterious follower.
>From what you can tell, they seemed to have a very feminine body type, and also seemed taller than you.
>Cautiously, you turn around and keep walking. You have the idea to play dead and see if that helps.
>You drop to the concrete and listen as the pursuer stops in their tracks. The only sound you hear is that same scratching.
>Eventually, you jump up in an attempt to catch a look at the stranger.
>Once again, they dash into a alleyway. This time you take note of their wide-brimmed hat.
>This is all proving somewhat frustrating.

<Roll in the mud to cloak your scent; hide behind something>

>Thinking back to what your granddad told you about avoiding predators, you quickly drop and roll in a mud puddle to mask your scent. You then dive behind a trash can to hide.
>The pursuer stops walking. You hear the scratching again and more of their faint voice.
>"Odd. Perhaps it's in touch with a more primal side than others..."
>Though you're not all that religious, you offer up a prayer to any god that'll listen in the hopes of gaining protection.
>Suddenly, you hear the pursuer speak again.
>"That should be enough for today..."
>You then hear them walk away quickly.
>Once their footsteps vanish, you slowly climb out of hiding. You then take a cab home.
>The next day, your godawful manager sticks you with another overtime shift.
>You find yourself walking that same road again, and it's not long before that same feeling creeps down your spine.
>You sense that they're closer this time.

<Roll on your back to show submission>

>For some reason, your mind once again snaps to avoiding predatory animals. You roll onto your back and expose your belly as a sign of submission.
>Your follower stops just outside your field of view. You can, however, make out one detail: their white trenchcoat. They speak again.
>"Hmm. I've never seen a human do that before..."
>Still on your back, you attempt to maneuver yourself so you can get a better glimpse at the stranger.
>You manage to see something that tells you a little more about them: a long, thin tail with a bushy tip.
>So your subconscious may not have been too far off after all.

<Talk to the stalker>

>Okay, predator avoidance tactics haven't worked, so might as well try diplomacy.
>"H-hello?"
>The scratching stops. The stalker seems startled, then speaks.
>"...hello. Interesting; it actually addressed me..."
>"Why are you following me? Who are you?"
>The stalker lets off a low growl that puts you in mind of a dog or wolf...
>"...I am in the midst of an investigation. You are a person of interest, one of many, in fact. My identity is not important. Please go about your business as though nothing were amiss."
>You slowly rise and look at the investigator. This time, they don't run.
>Your suspicion, that the stalker is female, is proven right upon seeing her hourglass figure, hugged tightly by a white trenchcoat. In particular, your eyes are drawn to her prodigious bust. Conspicuously open buttons reveal a generous amount of cleavage.
>The second thing you notice is that she's not human. She has stark white fur covering her entire body. She stands taller than you partially due to her digitigrade legs. The tail you noticed gently sways behind her. Most of her face is obscured by her wide hat brim, but you can make out a canine muzzle and long, straight ears that jut out behind her. Despite her fur, long white hair cascades from beneath the hat. 
>Though you cannot make them out, you can tell her eyes are intently focused on you. She carries a small notepad, and has undoubtedly been taking notes on your behavior.

<Ask about the case; joke about having dinner with her>

>"Since I'm a 'person of interest,' can you tell me more about this case?"
>She growls again before replying.
>"No. I cannot discuss the case. All details are strictly need-to-know. Rest assured that you're not in any trouble. Yet. Simply return to your daily routine, please."
>You can't help but try to cut the tension with a little joke.
>"If you're gonna be so open about this case, why don't we talk about it over dinner?"
>The investigator pauses for a lengthy time, staring at you.
>"...are you flirting with me?"

<Explain that dinner could help her investigation>

>"I'm just saying: you may learn more about me in a public place. Humans are communal, after all."
>The investigator pauses again.
>"...though that makes some sense, I feel that sharing dinner would be highly unprofessional. I will, however, admit that there is little more I can glean from observing you in solitude..."
>She places a hand on her chin thoughtfully.
>"...rather than follow your suggestion, I will simply observe you at work tomorrow. I trust that you work with the public, and I am confident that I can learn more from investigating your occupation."
>Before you can protest, the investigator takes her leave.
>Great. Now some kind of furry woman is gonna show up at work tomorrow...

<Q: Where does Anon work?  A: He's a window washer.>

>Most people laugh when you tell them your job.
>"That's not a real thing! That's just an old cartoon bit!"
>Ha. You wish.
>Being a high-rise window washer is rough. All that's between you and a prompt fall to certain death is a platform and some cables.
>You're currently wiping down one of many windows on the 150th floor of one of the local corporations. The man working within smiles and waves at you before heading out for the day. Lucky son of a gun; your shift isn't even close to done yet.
>As you keep polishing, you dimly recall something said to you last night...
>You glance back into the office.
>Your heart skips a beat.
>The investigator from before is sitting in the previously-occupied chair, intently watching you and taking notes.

<Suspect that this is in your head; go up a floor to see if she follows>

>Surely this is all some kind of hallucination. There's no possible way a woman with that height and that figure could run out of sight that fast.
>There's also no way she could get into an office in the time it took for its occupant to leave for the day.
>You finish the window and, ignoring the investigator, pull yourself up a level. 
>The occupant of this office has already left. Apparently some time ago; the automatic lights have already went off.
>You start cleaning up this office's window before something draws your attention.
>The lights in the office come on. The investigator walks in slowly, then takes a seat at the desk. As before, she watches you closely and jots down notes.
>This is one persistent lady. Or a stubborn hallucination.

<Suds up the window and go down a few floors to evade her>

>This cycle continues for a few floors. You clean the window, head up to the next, and the investigator soon follows, sitting down in the office beyond your window.
>Surely you can evade her watchful eyes...?
>You have the idea to coat the window in as much soap and suds as possible to obscure her view. 
>Just before the window becomes impossible to see through, you can see her stand and move closer to the window as though trying to get a better view.
>While she can't see you, you lower the platform back down a few floors and wait.
>As you watch the interior of the building, nothing happens for a good few minutes.
>However, a sound catches your attention:
>A window you passed on the way down opens up. The investigator leans out of it and looks down at you.
>"...what are you doing, exactly?"

<Say you're just cleaning; ask how she found you>

>"Uh, just my job: cleaning these windows all day."
>You can't see her eyes, but get the sense that she narrows them.
>"...and you've already taken care of those. I watched you and even noted which floors you've already completed."
>That's... worryingly comprehensive. What kind of investigation is this...?
>"Wait a minute. How'd you know where I work...?"
>"That's not important. Just continue working as though I weren't here. Once I've seen enough, I'll end my observation for today."
>With that, she promptly closes the window.
>It's gonna be hard to ignore someone like that watching your every move...

<Finish your shift>

>After finally finishing up your shift, you head home for the day.
>You can't help but look back at the office building as you leave. Sure enough, the investigator casually walks out of the building and begins following you.
>She never looks up from her notebook until she gets very close to you.
>She nods a few times as she looks over her notes again, then finally speaks.
>"...alright, I believe that's enough for today. Have a nice night, and thank you for your cooperation. ...and please refrain from trying to avoid observation. You only succeed in making my job harder."
>She quickly turns and walks the other way, eventually vanishing into an alleyway.
>You make it home with no further incidents.

<Imagine the stalker nude; enjoy those thoughts>

>As you head to bed, your mind races with thoughts about this mysterious woman.
>What is she investigating? Why is she so intent on studying you? How did she find out where you worked?
>Why is this whole situation so... exciting?
>Indeed, as you think about this tall, curvy woman following your every move, you can't help but get a little hot under the collar.
>Curse your libido. You should be freaked out by this. You're being pursued like an animal.
>And yet...
>Before you know it, you find yourself attempting to picture the investigator sans trenchcoat. It's not too difficult to picture; the coat hugs her figure very, very tightly.
>It's not long before you have a quick fap to these thoughts. Once that's settled, you turn in for the night, fully anticipating to run into her again tomorrow.
>The question is, where will she be this time?

<Go to the mall for Christmas shopping; hit 4Chan for potential advice first>

>You awaken after a good night's sleep, and your head is still spinning with thoughts about your situation.
>You planned to get some Christmas shopping done today, since you have the day off.
>First, however... you decide to hit 4Chan.
>You post a quick summary of what's going on, and are met with the typical replies.
>"Pics or it didn't happen"
>"Fake and gay"
>"RIP OP"
>"Squeeze her tits next time you see her"
>Eventually you give up on getting any sort of useful advice and head to the mall.
>You manage to get a few gifts purchased before noticing something:
>You haven't seen the investigator at all today.
>Sighing in both relief and... disappointment, you walk into the next store on your list: an electronics shop.
>One of the people you're shopping for wanted a cheap camera drone, and this place is having a pretty good sale.
>There's a little display in the middle of the store, featuring some mannequins in ugly Christmas sweaters wearing some cheap VR glasses.
>There's a little kid, an old man, a really tall, curvy woman in a trenchcoat, a teenage girl...
>Wait a minute.

<Call her out and offer her a deal>

>This is getting a little ridiculous.
>Making sure nobody is watching, you creep up to the poorly-disguised investigator.
>"You know I can see you, right?"
>She shows no indication of hearing you.
>"How about we make a deal? You give me answers, and I'll keep cooperating with you. Otherwise I could just stop playing along."
>This time she drops her mannequin act altogether.
>"...alright. I suppose that's a fair enough trade. Just... not here. Somewhere more quiet. Where there's less chance of witnesses. I'm already risking my cover hiding in this shop. You know this place better than me, I assume. Where can we go?"

<Find a dressing room>

>"Okay, there's a clothing store right over there; we can talk in the dressing rooms."
>"Alright. Lead the way."
>You exit the electronics shop and head across the mall walkway. The investigator slowly follows, darting from hiding spot to hiding spot.
>Eventually you make it to the dressing room, and she enters shortly afterwards.
>It's slightly cramped in here, but at least there's privacy.
>She pulls her notebook out of her cleavage and looks down at you, face still obscured by her hat.
>"Alright. You wanted answers. What do you want to know?"

<Ask some questions>

>You can't help yourself. You just have to ask the obvious questions.
>"So, uh... whaddya say we have some real fun back at my place?"
>She growls quietly before answering.
>"I would prefer that we keep this professional."
>Worth a shot.
>"What are your measurements?"
>Seems like you caught her off guard that time. She hesitates and clears her throat.
>"...please, take this seriously. That's rather personal."
>Okay, okay; time for the real question.
>"Why are you following me? I'm not that interesting."
>"As I said before, you're one of a few persons of interest in my investigation. Of those I've observed, you have been the most cooperative so far. That is why I've focused my efforts on you these past few days."
>"What kind of investigation is this? Personal business or something more official?"
>She surprises you by baring her teeth for a moment. She then regains her composure.
>"I cannot discuss the nature of the investigation. ...sorry. Rest assured that you're not in any sort of legal trouble. That being said, your continued cooperation is much appreciated."

<More questions>

>"If you're following me to see if I could be a potential mate, wouldn't it be easier to ask me to dinner?"
>You definitely caught her off guard that time. She drops her notebook and quickly scrambles to fish it back out of her "secret compartment."
>"...I asked you to please keep this professional. That's also rather presumptuous of you to think that the only reason I'd follow you is in the hopes of mating."
>Another thought comes to mind...
>"...are you an alien of some kind?"
>"Not exactly, no. I'm from elsewhere, where your kind are nonexistent in the way my kind are nonexistent here. But, I'm not an alien in the traditional sense, no."
>...that's a relief.

<More Questions>

>"Are you gonna hurt me? Mentally or physically?"
>She again surprises you; this time by laughing for a moment before abruptly regaining her stoic demeanor.
>"You're worried about nothing. If I wanted to harm you, you would already be hurt. I've been watching you for longer than you suspect, I've had plenty of opportunities to injure you if I so desired."
>Oh, THAT's reassuring...

<One more question>

>"I don't understand. You don't want to harm me. You claim this isn't about seeking a mate. What's the purpose, then? Can't you tell me anything about why you're investigating me?"
>"I already told you. I'm not out to harm you, nor am I after your company."
>"Well please tell me something; honesty is important. Besides, I-"
>You catch yourself. Too late, unfortunately.
>"...you what?"
>"I... I'm starting to feel a little attracted to you, and all this."
>There's an incredibly long silence. The investigator frantically scribbles something in her notes. Eventually she speaks, never looking up.
>"That's... very interesting. You humans are so strange to me. ...for the sake of my notes, what is it you find attractive about me? Be honest."
>Oh boy...

<Be honest; the mystery, the fur, the tits>

>She looks at you expectantly as you think about how to word this delicately.
>"Well... it's a combination of a few things, really."
>"Go on..."
>"Well, one is this whole mysterious vibe you have going on. Something about it just... gets to me."
>"Mm. What else?"
>"Well, uh... your fur looks extremely soft and cuddly..."
>She pauses.
>"...alright then... continue, please."
>You can't help it... you gently run your hand through the fur on the side of her neck. It's just as soft as you'd thought, and warm...
>"Erm, c-can we please keep this interview moving? What else?"
>"Well, somehow I get the feeling you WANT me to notice you following..."
>She says nothing and simply jots something down.
>"And, well, the biggest one is probably..."
>"...yes?"
>"You... have a very nice figure, and that coat of yours shows it off well, especially your chest. I think you know it too, why else would you keep the top few buttons open?"
>She pauses for a second, and even stops writing.
>"...I... see. Thank you for being honest."

<Ask about the case again>

>"Since I was honest... can't you be, too?"
>She sighs deeply.
>"I'm... sorry. I really can't say much about my case. It's out of my hands. Believe me when I say: I would tell you if I could. You have my word on that."
>"You mean you can't share anything with me? Not even the smallest tidbit?"
>"...no. I can't. Sorry."
>"I understand, miss..."
>She looks down at you and tilts her head for a moment before responding.
>"...please, just call me by my title. That's more professional. Call me Inspector, or Detective. Any similar title works. ...on that topic, what should I call you? I don't have a name in my notes..."

<Tell her to call you Anon>

>Rather than give her a name, since she's insistent on being "professional," you decide to harness your 4Chan days.
>"Uh... just Anon will be fine."
>She quickly writes that atop her notes, then stows the book back in her rack.
>"Alright then, Anon. Thank you for being so cooperative. My observation isn't done for today, however."
>"Oh, really?"
>"I still need more information. What should we do next?"

<Go grab lunch>

>"Well, I was just about to go grab some lunch... wanna join me?"
>"...hmm. Alright then. Lead the way. Don't worry about me, I'll get there undetected."
>You exit the dressing room and head to the food court. Good thing this store has some of the least attentive employees you've ever seen...
>As you walk through the mall, you occasionally see the Inspector dart behind columns and other objects. True to her word, nobody seems to notice her.
>Before long, you arrive at the food court. You carefully stand next to a large potted plant, and she ducks behind it.
>"Okay then... are you hungry? I can order something for you so you won't be seen."
>"Thank you... I'm not familiar with these restaurants, so just grab something you think I'd like. No pressure, Anon."

<Get two burgers>

>After mulling it over, you hit your favorite burger joint and grab two of your favorites: the Deluxe BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, complete with a side of fries.
>You can't help but think you probably look pretty conspicuous, carrying food for two people...
>Thankfully nobody seems to notice, or particularly care.
>You soon make your way back to the waiting Inspector.
>"Here you go; try this!"
>She takes a look at the burger and scarfs it down in two bites. She grins toothily.
>"Hmm. Pretty good, I must say! Thank you for that."
>"No problem. That's my personal favorite thing to get here, glad you liked it!"
>After a few minutes, you finish your lunch, and the Inspector finishes her fries.
>"Alright then, that's lunch settled. Where to next, Anon?"

<Go to Spencer's>

>"Okay, there's a store called Spencer's, and I have to stop by there."
>"Alright, I'll follow your lead, Anon."
>As before, you and the Inspector make your way across the mall, with her managing to remain undetected. Well... mostly.
>A baby notices her and cries; she seems to freak out a bit before dashing away to another hiding spot.
>Eventually, you reach your destination.
>"Hmm. I'm getting sloppy; I may need to take a break for a while..."
>"It's alright, that baby can't tell anyone about you! Anyway, it's usually dark in here, so you should be able to hide easier."
>The two of you enter the store. Almost immediately, as she looks around, the Inspector walks into a clerk.
>Oh boy...

>The Inspector immediately panics, attempting to excuse herself while remaining unseen, but it's too late. The clerk looks up at her and smiles.
>"Whoa... that's a sweet fursuit, dude! That musta cost, like, a fortune!"
>She tilts her head in confusion, so you jump in.
>"Oh, yeah, it was a little pricey! Don't mind her, she's just a little shy is all."
>"Really, dude? A woman that size, shy? Fair enough. You guys have a good one, alright?"
>He walks away as the Inspector breathes a sigh of relief.
>"Phew... good thinking, Anon. But... what exactly is a 'fursuit' anyway? I haven't heard of that."
>"Well, some of us humans are really attracted to the thought of people like you, so they dress up like you."
>"I had no idea my kind were considered so attractive by humans..."

>With that crisis averted, you and the Inspector shop unimpeded.
>Quite a few things catch her eyes, one of which is a little stuffed wolf dressed like a detective.
>"...this looks a lot like me, doesn't it?"
>"Well, minus your figure, but yeah."
>She playfully shoves you forwards.
>Soon, you've finished your shopping and get ready to check out. The same clerk from before smiles at the Inspector.
>She returns the favor, and he takes a few steps back at the sight of her fangs.
>"Whoa... that's freakin awesome, dude!"
>As you check out, a small display catches your eye. There are some 'suggestively shaped' lollipops for sale. You are momentarily tempted to buy one for the Inspector...
>You stop yourself. You don't know her that well yet, she may not think it's funny.
>After finally getting checked out, you and the Inspector leave the store.
>You walk past a rather disheveled man who's ranting, very loudly, about giant wolf-men.
>"AND THEIR WOMEN! MY GOD, THEIR WOMEN! JUS-JUST ONE OF THEIR TITS IS TWICE THE SIZE OF A HUMAN WOMAN'S!"
>The Inspector glances down at herself.
>"...I'm not THAT big, right...?"
>Well...
>Eventually you make your way past the ranting man.
>"Alright, I think one more stop is all I need, Anon. Where to?"

<Head to the grocery store>

>"Well, I think I'm done here, but I need to pick up some stuff at the grocery store..."
>"Alright then. Head on out to your car. I'll be there."
>You're unsure how she'll know where to meet you, but don't question it. You leave the mall and drive to the grocery store. Just as you exit the mall parking lot, you see the Inspector walking out of the mall.
>After a short drive, you arrive. You decide to wait for your follower to arrive, rather than go on in.
>It's not long before she sprints up to you, panting.
>"Huff... huff... that was a longer run than I thought..."
>"Are you gonna be okay?"
>"Yes, yes I'm fine... just... just go ahead and start shopping; I'll catch up."
>You shrug and head on into the store. Luckily there aren't many people inside, so when the Inspector sneaks in, nobody notices her.
>You walk down the freezer aisle, grabbing a few things. You look down at the grocery list on your phone the whole time. You've been here enough that you can pick stuff out of the freezers blindfolded.
>Let's see... check. Check. They're out of that. Check...
>You grab almost everything on your list. Once you pass the last freezer, you instinctively reach out and grab the handle.
>Howver, rather than the cold metal handle, your hand meets something warm and soft.
>You look up to see that you've just grabbed a handful of the Inspector's chest. Seems she was hiding at the end of the aisle and you somehow mistook her for a freezer out of the corner of your eye.
>Oops...

<Apologize; it was an honest mistake>

>"Sorry, sorry! It was an honest mistake, I swear!"
>The Inspector stares down at you for a while; you can't tell if she's mad or not, since her hat obscures her eyes...
>Finally, she writes something down and responds.
>"Anon, while I'm flattered, I would rather you refrain from groping me while I'm trying to work."
>"I'm sorry! I was checking my list and thought you were a freezer; I should've looked up before I grabbed, sorry!"
>"Mm. I suppose I'm also partially at fault; I should have gotten a better hiding spot... However, that doesn't change the fact that you haven't actually released your grip."
>She's right; you're still holding onto the handful you got.

<DON'T SQUEEZE EM>

>One thought runs through your mind, on loop:
>DON'T SQUEEZE
>DON'T SQUEEZE
>DO NOT SQUEEZE
>"...Anon? Is there something on your mind?"
>Before you can think about your response, you blurt out:
>"Just enjoying your boobs; they're very nice!"
>You immediately let go of her and clamp a hand over your mouth. Her jaw drops a little.
>"...*ahem* Well then. I, uh, I appreciate your compliments..."
>She trails off. After an awkward silence, you step backwards and open the freezer you thought you were reaching for.
>Aaaand they're out of peas. Of course they are.
>The Inspector adjusts her coat slightly before stashing her notebook back in her cleavage.
>"Well then. Is there anything else you need to grab while we're here, Anon?"
>She doesn't sound mad, but she seems to be trying to sound colder than usual. However... she's not putting much effort into that either.

<Head home, invite her for dinner>

>"N-no, I think I've grabbed enough for today..."
>You quickly make your way to the checkout. Before long, you and the Inspector are standing outside the store again.
>"Hmm. I've learned quite a bit about yo- *ahem* the case today. Out of curiosity, what are you planning to do now, Anon?"
>"Well, I was gonna head home and cook some dinner. Do you... wanna join me?"
>She seems to think long and hard before answering.
>"Hmm... I haven't actually observed your home life yet. But... I worry that a dinner date may be too unprofessional."
>"Well, it's not so much a DATE as I was just inviting you to enjoy some of my cooking."
>"Well... if you say it's not a date, I suppose that's fine. Just... please keep this professional, alright?"
>You walk to your car, and a thought hits you.
>"Inspector... wouldn't it be easier for you to ride with me instead of running?"
>"I appreciate the offer, but I'll walk."
>Indeed, she immediately sprints off towards your house.

<Follow her and offer a ride again>

>You live a pretty long ways away. She's bound to run out of breath before she gets there.
>You decide to follow alongside her, so you can offer her a ride when she tires out.
>You at first worry that you won't be able to find her, since she got a head start. But, someone dressed all in white with white fur stands out pretty well.
>You can't help but slow down and just watch her run. It's a wonder she doesn't knock herself out, bouncing like that...
>She keeps one hand firmly on her hat the entire time. She eventually stops for a breather, and notices you.
>"I-I thought I told you I didn't need a ride?"
>"Inspector, just get in; you've still got a long ways to go and you're already tired!"
>She catches her breath for a moment before finally relenting.
>"Alright, you've got a point. Thank you for the ride."
>She climbs into your passenger seat. She has to adjust it to compensate for her height, and the seatbelt struggles to stretch across her bust, but she finally gets settled.
>"Phew... sorry about this. It's not very becoming of me to run out of steam that quickly... I've been very busy following you, and I suppose it's caught up to me. Perhaps I need a day off."

<Offer to let her hang with you one day>

>"A day off? Why not just... hang out with me for a day? You could still do your investigation, but you could take it easy too."
>"Hmmm. That's an interesting option. I'll... consider it. Thank you, Anon."
>Soon, you find yourself coming up on the road you live on.

<Assure her the hangout is professional>

>"If it helps make up your mind, this hangout day would be strictly professional. You could just sit back and observe what I do on my days off."
>"Hmm. Alright then. I think that can be arranged. Does tomorrow work for you?"
>"Sure, I'm off."
>She pulls her notebook out to write that down. Considering the extra pressure her chest is under, it's a much lengthier process than usual. As you watch out of the corner of your eye, you see part of the cover:
>"PROPERTY OF INSPECTOR C"
>The rest is obscured by her hand.
>Eventually you make it home. Your place isn't fancy by any stretch of the imagination. It's a plain old 1 story house.
>The two of you head inside and the Inspector takes a seat at your table.
>"Okay, anything in particular you want?"
>"Mm, just cook whatever you usually eat; I'm not picky."
>You decide to cook up some spaghetti, making sure to cook extra for your guest.
>As the pasta cooks, you sit down for a moment and try to make some small talk.

<Interrogate her to turn the tables>

>Since the Inspector is so keen on investigating you, you decide to grill her in return. You've grabbed a little notebook and pen, and start questioning her.
>"Inspector, you don't mind if I ask you a few questions, right?"
>She tilts her head inquisitively.
>"I suppose that's alright, but I still can't talk about my case..."
>"Where exactly are you from?"
>"Well, it's a little complicated. I came from a town literally called Elsewhere. It's a pretty big city, on par with this one, I'd say. Humans are nonexistent there, just as my kind don't exist here."
>"Mmhm. Any hobbies?"
>"Well, I enjoy people-watching, even back home."
>"I see. Do you like movies?"
>"I don't go to the movies very often, but I do enjoy a good action film sometimes."
>"Ah. Do you drink?"
>"Not on the job, no. That would be very unprofessional."
>"Right. How do you feel about guns?"
>"They're useful in my line of work, but I'm thankful that my pistol rarely sees use."
>"Mm. Where do you buy all those trenchcoats?"
>"Well, ah, as you can probably tell, they're custom fit. A friend of mine is a good tailor, so she makes them for me."
>"Okay then. Why are you bad at sneaking around?"
>She growls a little at this question.
>"I hardly think I'm bad at my job. Only three humans have seen me, and of those, one is right here, one is too young to talk, and the other thinks I'm a human in a costume."
>"Fair enough. One more: is the food here safe for your kind?"
>"Yes, don't worry about that. You humans generally eat similarly to us, you just tend to use more spices and cook things for longer. Personally I prefer my meat medium rare, but well done is alright, I suppose."
>"Is there anything I need to avoid giving you?"
>"Only one or two. Mainly just chocolate. But, I'm a grown woman, I can make my own decisions as to what's safe and what isn't. I appreciate your concern though."

<Ask if she's single>

>You make a show of jotting down all her answers. One more question comes to mind...
>"Inspector, are you single?"
>She flinches. She quickly fixes her hat and nervously clears her throat.
>"I-I don't see how that's relevant, Anon. Besides, that's a very personal question."
>You give her a serious, expectant look.
>"...fine. Yes. Yes, I am. Don't take that as an invitation to flirt, please. This is a strictly professional arrangement and I hope to keep it that way."

<Ask about her name>

>"Y'know, that wasn't all that personal of a question. I could've asked something MUCH more personal."
>"I... suppose you could have. Sorry."
>"It's fine. Now then, I couldn't help but notice your notebook earlier... I saw your name starts with 'C'. What exactly IS your name, anyway...?"
>Her jaw drops for a moment.
>"Where did you see my..."
>She looks down at herself.
>"...I suppose you saw me retrieving it in the car. I suppose the question is: was sneaking a peek at my notes your goal, or was it a happy side effect of ogling my chest...?"
>Before you can answer, she suddenly sits bolt upright, sniffing the air.
>"Anon, isn't that food done cooking? We've been talking for a good while now."
>You nearly forgot the spaghetti!
>You run back into the kitchen and manage to save it. It's on the absolute verge of being burnt, but it should still be perfectly edible.
>You bring in two plates, with the Inspector getting a somewhat larger plate.
>"Alright, Parmesan or no?"
>"Yes, please."

<Serve dinner with more questions>

>You serve up the well-done spaghetti and pour a few glasses of wine.
>"Err, you don't happen to have anything else to drink, do you? As I said, I'd rather not drink on the job..."
>You grab her a glass of water instead.
>"You always talk about keeping things professional. Is that part of your job's guidelines or...?"
>"Well, my employer's guidelines are more lenient than some in our field, but there are still expectations laid upon us. Though I'll admit I hold myself to a higher standard than is absolutely required by my employer."
>"Oh, okay. Say, why the white clothes? Surely that's not good for blending in?"
>"Well... white's just my color. You've surely noticed my fur by now. Besides; I blend in better back home. I stand out more amongst humans by default."
>"That's true. What species are you, anyway?"
>"Well, that's fairly straightforward. I'm a wolf. Albeit, I have long ears due to some rabbits on my father's side. And my tail came from my great-grandfather, a lion."
>To be fair, the muzzle should've tipped you off.
>"Wait, so you guys can just... mix like that?"
>"Mm, we're more genetically flexible than the animals you're familiar with, Anon."
>"Are you the only investigator here?"
>"Yes, I came here alone. I have a handful of coworkers, but they're on different assignments..."

<Ask about the hat; offer to watch a movie>

>"Why not take off the hat? Surely you'd be more comfortable without it?"
>She pauses eating for a second and clears her throat.
>"I... would prefer to keep my hat on, thank you. I'm more comfortable wearing it than not."
>"Fair enough, I guess."
>After that, the two of you finish dinner.
>"That was very good, Anon. Thank you for inviting me over!"
>"Of course! Dessert?"
>She smiles.
>"Well... if you're offering I suppose it would be rude to refuse...!"
>You break out a frozen key lime pie you had bought.
>"Ooh, that looks nice. I'll limit myself to one slice though, I'm rather full already."
>10 minutes pass. Between you and the Inspector, you've eaten the entire pie. And you only got two slices!
>"Ah... that was fantastic. Thank you, Anon."
>"No problem! Say, you, uh, wanna watch a movie or something?"
>"Mm, alright. I suppose we can continue our mutual investigation over a movie."

<Try a horror flick>

>You open up Netflix and scroll through.
>"You said you liked action, right? Wait; do you watch human movies or...?"
>"Yes, I did say that. No, we have our own films. This should prove valuable information, being the first human film I watch..."
>As you scroll, you pass the kids' section.
>"Say, your world must look like this, right? All those animal folk walking around and all..."
>She laughs before answering.
>"Ahah, that's what you humans think our society would be like? No, we're just as modern as you are. Perhaps even a little more advanced, actually. Elsewhere, as I said, is a pretty modern metropolis."
>You coincidentally scroll past an adult flick you "watched" the other night.
>"Hey, how about this?"
>She pulls her hat down to cover more of her face.
>"Erm... I don't think that would be an appropriate choice. We're not on a date, merely a mutual interview."
>"Oh yeah, I forgot."
>Eventually you pick out a good slasher movie.
>"Hmm. This looks fairly interesting..."
>She watches the movie, fascinated, until the first jumpscare. She surprises you a little by letting off a loud yelp not unlike that of a dog.
>"I-I should've realized this was a horror film earlier... I don't do so well with these. P-pardon me..."
>She pulls her hat down even farther until you get the hint and turn it off.

<Never mind, try Die Hard>

>Hm. Might as well go for a classic.
>"Die Hard, huh? Sounds interesting."
>The Inspector tips her hat back a bit. Not enough to reveal her whole face, but enough for her to see the screen again.
>She seems much more interested in this than the horror movie. By the end, she's on the edge of her seat and grinning wildly.
>She notices you watching her and quickly goes back to her stoic act.
>"That, ah, that was a good movie. I feel like I learned a lot about human movies. Thank you, Anon."
>"You're welcome; glad you liked it."
>She sits back in her chair as you watch the credits roll.
>"...it's Connie."
>"Huh?"
>"You asked about my name earlier. It's Connie."

<Offer to let her stay the night>

>You glance over at the clock and realize it's getting late.
>"Well, Connie, it's been fun, but I think I'm gonna call it a night."
>She seems almost disappointed.
>"Hm. Alright then. Are you still free for further observation tomorrow?"
>"Yeah, I'm off tomorrow."
>"Alright then, have a nice night, Anon. I'll see you tomorrow, then."
>She slowly stretches and eases out of her chair.
>"Mmmff. I really should've taken it easy with that pie, I suppose..."
>"Where are you going?"
>"Ah, that's not important. I'll be here tomorrow."
>"...why not just stay here tonight?"
>She freezes in her tracks.
>"...that... wouldn't be very professional of me, I'm afraid... besides, I assume you only have the one bed, and sharing is definitely not an option..."

<Tease her about sharing the bed; offer to sleep on the couch>

>"Are you sure? That could be a good way to study how we humans sleep..."
>Though her face is both obscured and covered in fur, you get the sense she's blushing.
>"N-no... that would definitely not be professional."
>"Well... you're welcome to use my bed; I can sleep on the couch."
>"Are you sure, Anon?"
>"Yeah, of course; go right ahead! Besides, I don't think you'd be comfortable anywhere else; the couch is too small for you, I bet."
>"...alright. I think I'll take you up on that offer. I hope you don't mind the possibility of fur on your sheets..."
>"It's fine, I'm not allergic!"

<Get ready for bed; make breakfast in the morning>

>You get ready for bed as usual. You have a quick shower, spread out some blankets and a pillow on the couch, and start to strip down...
>"P-please allow me to leave the room first... it wouldn't be right to watch this..."
>Connie sprints into the bathroom as you strip down to your boxers.
>You gently settle in under your blankets as you hear her borrow your shower.
>It's pretty hard to fight the temptation to sneak a peek, but you somehow manage it.
>Before long, you feel yourself drift off to sleep...
>You wake up bright and early the next morning. For a moment, you're dazed and can't remember why you're on the couch.
>You stagger into your bedroom and immediately remember.
>Connie is asleep, completely covered up. Her coat hangs on the closet doorknob, and her hat rests on her face.
>You gently sneak back out of the room and decide to start a nice breakfast.

<Make a hearty breakfast, and put on an action movie>

>Since you have a guest, you go all out.
>You cook up a proper breakfast spread. Eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, the whole shebang.
>You decide to put on an action flick in case Connie wakes up; you just pick something at random, taking care to avoid anything spooky.
>Before long, breakfast is nearly done. But...
>Connie's still asleep, apparently.

<Knock to wake her up>

>You gently knock on the door to your bedroom.
>"Connie? I've got breakfast ready, if you're interested!"
>You can hear her wake up.
>"*yawn* Mm? I'll be out in a minute, Anon. Thanks for waking me up."
>Again, it's tempting to open the door and peek in...

<Offer to lend her some clothes; make some coffee>

>"You're welcome to borrow some of my clothes, if that'd be comfortable."
>"Mm, no thank you. My coat is comfortable. Besides, I doubt anything of yours would fit me."
>She has a point there...
>You decide to pour yourself some coffee while you wait. It's not long before Connie emerges from your room, clad in her usual coat and hat ensemble.
>"Thank you for waiting, Anon. Ah, you've been busy this morning, I see; thank you for cooking again!"
>She quickly fixes herself a plate and sits down. She also grabs a cup of the coffee you brewed.
>"Ah, nothing quite like a nice hot cup of coffee in the morning, is it?"
>She takes a deep gulp of the coffee and sighs in contentment.

<Suggest some sightseeing later today>

>After enjoying breakfast, during which Connie eats nearly twice as much as you, the two of you settle down in your living room.
>"Alright, Anon... what are you going to be doing today? I recall you saying that you have the day off today?"
>"Yep, no work today. I figured we'd take it easy. Maybe go do some sightseeing later, if you'd like; that way you could observe some of the things my world has to offer."
>"Ah, that could be interesting. Though Elsewhere is a fairly modern city, I must admit there are quite a few differences in our worlds."

<But first, another movie>

>"We can head out later; how about another movie first?"
>"Alright then. I believe that there were more Die Hard movies, right? Why don't we watch the sequel? For the sake of my notes, of course. *ahem*"
>"Uh huh. Sure."
>You pull up Die Hard 2 as Connie settles into her chair. She gently rubs her stomach.
>"Mm, I must say: you're quite a chef, Anon. Thank you for being so very kind."

<Make plans for later>

>As you watch the movie, you decide to make some plans.
>"So, anything in particular you want to see?"
>"Actually, yes: there's a bay back in Elsewhere I love to visit; do you have anything like that around here?"
>"Well, there's a lake on the outskirts of town, if that works?"
>"Hmm. I'd like to see that, if you don't mind..."
>"Okay, can do."
>Something else hits you...
>"So... what happens after your investigation ends?"
>"Well, I suppose I'll head home. But... I'm not very far along in my case yet."
>She sits for a moment before suddenly gasping.
>"Er- forget I said that. I'm not supposed to talk about my case... Anyway, I've still got a lot of observing to do."
>"Well, you're welcome to stay here as long as you need."
>"...that's... very generous of you, Anon. Thank you."

<Tell her you appreciate her company>

>"Y'know what? I've really enjoyed having your company, Connie. I'm usually pretty much alone, so it's nice to have somebody to spend time with. Thank you."
>You smile at her earnestly.
>There's a pause, and she pulls her hat down a bit.
>"I... I... I'm glad to hear that my observation has brought you so much happiness. I... must say I've been enjoying this as well. Thank you for letting me observe you, Anon."
>You're pretty sure she sniffled a little bit while saying that...

<Tell her she can stay as long as she needs>

>"Well, like I said, you're welcome to stay as long as you like."
>With that, you stretch your arm across the back of the couch and relax.
>"I appreciate that. If it's no trouble, I think I may stay here for the remainder of my investigation."
>"It's no trouble at all, Connie."
>She smiles and settles into her chair.

<Joke about sharing the bed; invite her over to the couch>

>"Maybe we could even share the bed sometime!"
>Connie shifts uncomfortably in her seat.
>"...I'd rather not do that. Sorry, I still want this to be professional."
>You chuckle good-naturedly.
>"Only joking; I'm fine with the couch for now! Speaking of, why not come over here with me? It'd be more comfortable than sitting in that chair all alone!"
>"Ah... I appreciate it, but I'm fairly comfortable over here, Anon."
>"Okay, suit yourself!"
>Before long, the movie ends.
>Connie yawns and stretches.
>"Mm, that was another good film. I need to be more careful about getting so comfortable... I nearly dozed off!"

<Suggest she take a nap>

>She yawns again and stretches.
>"You could just take a nap, if you're still tired. We can always go see the lake later!"
>She puts a hand to her chin and tilts her head thoughtfully.
>"Mm... I may take you up on that, actually..."
>"Sure, go right ahead! Need anything else beforehand?"
>"No, no... I'm... *yawn* I'm fine. I'll see you in a little while, Anon."
>Connie slowly rises and makes her way back to your room. She closes the door gently and you hear her crash onto your bed a minute later.

<Pack for a lakeside picnic>

>While your guest naps, you decide to make this trip to the lake a proper picnic.
>You start gathering up some supplies.
>You make some sandwiches, pack some chips, grab some napkins and plates, and top it all off with some booze, just in case she changes her mind.
>You've always loved heading out to the lake, but usually don't have anyone to go with. It'll be nice to share a picnic with your new friend!
>After about an hour, you're completely packed and ready to head out.
>You gently put your ear to your bedroom door.
>Connie is still asleep, snoring quietly.
>You suppose her job must be pretty exhausting.

<Peek at her notebook; fap into her sandwich; E G G S>

>Though it seems a little sneaky, you consider peeking through Connie's notebook while she sleeps. Then, it occurs to you: she stores it in her cleavage. There's probably no way to get it without waking her up.
>Besides... waking her up that way would probably not end too well.
>You settle for peeking in on her snoozing.
>As before, her body is completely covered, and her face is covered by her hat again.
>You quietly close the door.
>Suddenly, an old shitpost comes to mind.
>You quickly fill a bowl full of eggs for when she wakes up.
>A deeper, seedier part of you is tempted to "tamper" with the sandwich you made her.
>You decide against it purely because you'd probably get them mixed up. You've seen enough comedies to know how that kinda gag goes down.

<Plan ahead for later days>

>While Connie is still napping, you decide to plan ahead for future outings.
>You pull up the local theater's site on your phone to see what's playing.
>Generic cartoon, generic cartoon, 5th sequel to a horror movie nobody liked the first time, and an action movie you've kinda been looking forward to. May be worth seeing; Connie likes that kind of thing anyway.
>Next, you take a look through the newspaper to see if there are any coupons or anything. Maybe you can treat yourself and Connie on the cheap...
>Ah, there's one for that local coffee shop/bakery. Great!
>Speaking of coffee, you start brewing some for when she wakes up. Might help her get up and at em for the picnic!
>While you're in the kitchen, you grab a handful of mints you had handy. Hey, you can never have breath that's TOO fresh!
>With all that settled, you hear rummaging in your room. It's not long before Connie, fully clothed in her usual getup and half-asleep, stumbles out.
>"Mmm... what time is it?"
>"About 2 PM; how was your nap?"
>"It really hit the spot. Thanks for that, Anon."
>She slowly makes her way to the table, grabs a mug of coffee, and sits down. She takes a few swigs before speaking again.
>"So: are you still planning to head to the lake today? Sorry I slept so late..."
>"Yeah, we can still go; and don't sweat it! You were tired!"
>Connie smiles sheepishly and finishes her coffee.
>You gently slide the bowl of eggs over to her with a poker face.
>"...what?"
>"Before we do anything, you have to eat all of them."
>"Err... is this a human thing I'm not aware of, or...?"
>You snicker a little and put the bowl away.
>"Just a dumb injoke. Sorry!"

<Leave for the lake>

>After double-checking your supplies and making Connie another cup of coffee, you set out for the lake.
>"This is gonna be a fun date!"
>Connie growls softly.
>"Anon, this is a professional trip solely for the purpose of letting me observe the lake. The picnic lunch is a happy side effect. A date would be unprofessional."
>You notice that she's clearly not mad despite once again insisting that this stays professional...
>Once you get in the car, Connie again struggles with the seat belt.
>"Mmmf. I suppose some things never change. I have this problem back at home too, unfortunately..."
>Eventually she manages to get strapped in, and you hit the open road.
>The lake is a decent drive away. Not too far, but not all that close either.
>As you go down the road, Connie makes notes on everything of interest you pass.
>"Hm. There are a lot of interesting things around here, Anon. Thank you for the ride again. I'd walk, but... I don't know how to get to the lake. I'm thankful to have someone who knows this town to help me."
>"It's no trouble. I'm glad I can help you!"
>You glance over to see Connie smiling broadly.

<Offer to buy her a cellphone>

>Something occurs to you...
>"Connie, why don't I get you a cellphone? There's a lot they could do for your investigation!"
>She tilts her head.
>"Well, I actually already have one. But..."
>She opens up one of the pockets on her trenchcoat and pulls out a plain-looking smartphone. It's bigger than yours, but otherwise pretty similar. She unlocks it and fiddles around on the home screen.
>"You see, it doesn't work here. It's designed to work with different kinds of towers and networks. It's been pretty much useless since I left Elsewhere, actually. All it's good for is the calculator and a few games I have installed."
>She apparently opens one of said games up, as she stares down at her phone for a good few minutes, rapidly tapping and swiping at the screen. Eventually she seems to snap out of it.
>"...sorry about that. I told myself I'd delete that game. It's... unprofessional of me, but I'm sad to say I'm hooked on it. That's why I haven't really brought out my phone much."
>With some effort, she puts her phone away.
>"So... while I appreciate your offer, I think I'll pass for now. Besides: human phones are too small. They kind of hurt my eyes..."
>"Well, okay. If you change your mind, just let me know, okay?"
>"Of course!"
>Something suddenly dawns on you.
>"Wait a minute. You've got pockets on that coat. Why keep your notebook in, uh, the Grand Canyon?"
>She gasps before chuckling a little.
>"Is that really the term you're going with? ...anyway, it's for safekeeping. It's impossible for someone to try and take it without me noticing. Plus... men are hesitant to even attempt to reach in there."
>Well, she's got a good point there.

<Arrive at the lake; suggest taking a different route home>

>Before long, you arrive at the lake. Fortunately, nobody else is here today. Probably because there's a cool breeze today.
>"Okay, Connie: we're here!"
>She hops out of the car and stretches.
>"Mmf. I appreciate the ride, but your car is a little cramped for me. Though I will say I really enjoyed the sightseeing on the way here!"
>She smiles warmly before abruptly clearing her throat.
>"*ahem* It was very enlightening; I believe that I got some useful info for my case."
>"Well, if you liked that, we can take a different way home. See some different sights!"
>Connie's tail wags excitedly despite her trying to play it cool.
>"Hmm. That could be interesting. Thank you."
>You quickly unpack your picnic supplies and start walking to the lake.
>You've always loved this place. It's still absolutely breathtaking despite you having been here countless times.
>Connie also seems impressed. She even pulls out her phone to take some pictures!
>"Wow, this place is beautiful... It's not at all like the bay back in Elsewhere."
>"Why's that?"
>"Well, the bay is a lot more commercialized. There are a lot of pavilions and beachside shops. That sort of thing. This lake, however, is so much more natural! The water is so clear..."
>You set out the picnic blanket as Connie continues to rhapsodize about the sights. She eventually sits down and smiles.
>"Anon... thank you for bringing me here."
>"You're welcome! I'm glad you like it here so much!"

<Thank her for giving you a new perspective on things; go swimming>

>"Connie... thank you. You really help me see things I take for granted in a whole new light. I'm glad that things I see everyday can bring somebody so much excitement and happiness; thank you for being here!"
>Connie pulls her hat down a little.
>"I... I don't know what to say. I should be thanking you, Anon; it's your kindness that brought me here today! I'm glad that my company seems to have made you so happy. ...pardon me for a moment."
>She quickly gets up and runs behind your car. After a minute or two, she returns as though nothing happened. You can, however, hear her sniffle every now and then.
>"Alright then, Anon: what shall we do now?"
>"Hmm. How about a swim?"
>"That sounds nice..."
>She starts to smile, but suddenly catches herself and frowns.
>"...but I can't. I don't have a swimsuit handy."
>"Why not just... y'know..."
>"...Anon, you know how unprofessional that would be."
>"Alright, alright... I think there's a store down the road that has some. Think we can sneak you in there and grab one?"
>"Hmm. That's definitely possible. But they may not have anything that'll fit me..."
>"We'll never know if we don't try! C'mon, let's head over there!"
>The two of you jump back into your car and drive to the store.
>You make it there in only a few minutes, and the two of you start to head in.
>"Alright Anon, I think our best option is for you to go in while I stay out here. I trust you to pick out something nice!"
>You head into the shop and make your way to the swimwear.

<Get a tasteful one-piece>

>As fate would have it, a brief minute of browsing turns up a tasteful one-piece suit in white! It's even in a pretty large size; hopefully it'll fit Connie...
>You check out with no real incident. Well, barring the nosy cashier...
>"This for your girlfriend?"
>"Uh, not really, no..."
>"Pfft. Lemme guess, she's just a friend who's a girl. Just suck it up and admit it, pal."
>You ignore him and finish the transaction before heading back out. Connie is waiting in the car, fiddling with your radio.
>"Well, any luck, Anon?"
>"Yep, I think I found something you'll like!"
>She grins warmly as you hop back in and drive back to the lake.
>Once you arrive, you unpack your swimsuit from the trunk of your car and hand Connie the one you just bought.
>"Thank you... let me find somewhere private to change..."
>Connie runs off into some trees, where you can't see her. Meanwhile, you squat down by your car and change.
>As you put your clothes in the trunk, you hear Connie call out to you.
>"Anon, it... mostly fits!"
>Mostly may be a little generous...
>While it was the largest they had, the suit is still obviously too small for Connie. It especially struggles to cover her chest. 
>She's still decent, but you can't help but have a mental image of them just... popping out of that suit. One thing that particularly catches your eye is that she still has her hat on.
>"Wow... you look great! But, aren't you worried about getting your hat wet?"
>"T-thank you! It's a little too small... I'm still covered enough that I feel it's professional enough, though! And don't worry about my hat; it's waterproof!"
>Fair enough. With no further ado, the two of you jump into the lake.
>Connie lets out a little squeal when she hits the water.
>"Ah! It's colder than I expected..."
>"It'll warm up as you get used to it, don't worry!"
>She's right, though: the water is pretty cold. You don't even have the advantage of fur like she does!

<Grab the beachball and frisbee; have some fun>

>Anticipating a nice swim, you brought along a beachball and a frisbee! You climb out of the water for a second to inflate the ball, then toss it in to Connie.
>You jump back in, making sure to splash her in the process.
>"Hey! Two can play at that game!"
>Connie climbs out of the lake before diving in again; with her being larger than you, you're totally unable to avoid the resulting splash!
>She pops up from the water, laughing.
>You playfully toss the beachball at her, accidentally hitting her in the head! It bounces off harmlessly, but...
>"My hat!"
>Before you can get a look at her hatless, Connie dives under the water to reclaim it. After a moment, she comes back up, gasping for air, but with her hat firmly back on her head.
>"Phew... that was close! Be more careful next time, please!"
>She grabs the ball...
>"So, next time, please don't do... THIS!"
>She throws it at you full force, knocking you over!
>You quickly right yourself and toss the frisbee towards her. You miss, but she leaps out of the water and catches it with her teeth! However...
>In the process, her hat flies off, revealing her face!
>As you'd expect, she mostly resembles a white wolf. Her ears are long and point straight backwards, and her eyes are gray. She looks at you and smiles broadly, frisbee still clenched in her teeth.
>Then, she reaches up and realizes that her hat is off.
>Connie immediately spits the frisbee out before picking it up with her hands. She uses it to cover her face.
>"H-help me find my hat, please..."

<Compliment her but also find the hat>

>"What's wrong? You don't need to hide your face!"
>"I-I'm glad you think so, but please just help me find my hat..."
>"Why? Your eyes are beautiful; why cover them up?"
>"T-that's not important; I think it fell over here...?"
>"Aww, lighten up, Connie! You really don't need it, you look fine!"
>"Anon, please! I appreciate it, but I really need to find my hat!"
>You relent and dive under where you saw it fall. It's not hard to find, with it being a white hat in a clear lake.
>"Found it!"
>Connie almost immediately snatches the hat from you and puts it back on. She immediately calms down.
>"Ah... thank you, Anon. I-I was afraid I'd lose it."
>"No problem, I'm glad we found it!"
>She smiles before suddenly splashing you in the face!
>The two of you go back and forth splashing each other for a while before you eventually hear her stomach growling.
>"How about a quick lunch break, and we'll get back at it?"
>"That sounds good, Anon; guess I can't really deny I'm a little hungry!"

<Have lunch>

>After that little scare with Connie's hat, the two of you climb out of the lake.
>You hand her a towel you packed; she dries her fur off while you unpack your picnic lunch.
>As she walks over to the blanket, you take a good long look at her.
>The one-piece you bought her fits snugly, being made for humans and not her kind. Her breasts especially strain the fabric visibly. Somehow it manages to cover her nipples, however. You're a little disappointed that your vision of her bouncing out of the suit hasn't come true...
>It's fortunate that you found a white suit; you can't see any other color working so well with her. 
>The suit also shows off her legs very well, revealing the hips her coat clung so tight to. Though she is a bit top-heavy, Connie still has a respectable hourglass figure.
>As you look, however, you notice something that hasn't caught your eye before.
>Connie is ever-so-slightly pudgy.
>Not fat by any stretch of the imagination, but there's a definite softness to her midriff. You can't help but chuckle a little as you recall how she's eaten with gusto every time you've offered her food.
>Connie finally takes her seat, making sure to secure her hat, and grabs the sandwich you laid out for her.
>"I've learned quite a bit about how humans entertain themselves; thank you for the information, Anon! ...and thanks for helping me find my hat."
>"No problem! What's the story with that hat anyway? Seems pretty important."
>"...it was a gift from a friend. I lost it once and told myself 'never again.' Sorry I got so worked up; I really prefer to keep it on..."
>"Why? You have such beautiful eyes; why cover them?"
>You can't tell, since her face is furry, but you sense that Connie blushes.
>"I... thank you. I'd just like to keep it on whenever possible."
>"Okay, that's fine then!"
>"Thank you for understanding..."
>She's interrupted by her stomach growling. She grins toothily.
>"Well, I suppose I can't argue with that; let's eat, Anon!"

<Give her a peanut butter sandwich; lightly tease her about her belly>

>"Sure thing; dig in, Connie!"
>She smiles again before scarfing down the sandwich in a few bites.
>"Mm, that was pretty good; thanks, Anon!"
>"Done already? Surely you're still hungry, right?"
>"Huh? W-well..."
>Her stomach growls again quietly.
>"...yes, I suppose so."
>"Ha, that's fine; swimming works up an appetite! I brought two for each of us!"
>What you don't tell is that the second one is a peanut butter sandwich...
>Connie takes a sizable bite of this sandwich and smiles before realizing that the peanut butter is stuck. She starts smacking her jaws in an attempt to unstick it.
>"Huh? What if thif? Anon?"
>Laughing, you hand her a drink; she soon manages to wash down the peanut butter.
>"Hmm. That was alright... you could've warned me it was sticky first, Anon!"
>She reaches over and playfully punches you in the gut.
>"Hey! Alright then, how about this?"
>You reach over and poke Connie in the belly. As you suspected, she's definitely soft and pudgy. You smile warmly.
>"Haha, what's all this about?"
>"Huh? W-what's what?"
>"This!"
>You rub her stomach playfully.
>"W-well, winter's coming up..."
>"Uh-huh..."
>"...and human food is more fattening than what we have back home..."
>"But you haven't been here that long!"
>"..."
>She pulls her hat down a bit. Uh oh, you didn't go too far, did you...?
>Suddenly, she smiles and laughs.
>"Okay, okay, you got me! I can't resist a good meal, and I've never been able to!"
>"No shame in that; you're still beautiful!"
>You think she blushes again.
>"I see... t-thank you. I'll make a note of that later..."

<Offer to show her different foods while she's with you>

>"Well, if you like food, there's a handful of different places we could get some takeout from; you could investigate how other human cultures cook!"
>Connie smiles thoughtfully.
>"Mm... that sounds delicious... Err. I mean, interesting! That sounds very interesting. Good for my notes. *ahem*"
>"Suuure. Changing the subject: what do you do back home?"
>She almost looks disappointed to change the topic...
>"Oh, the same thing I'm doing here: investigating. I'm a private eye, you see. I do all sorts of cases, and I'm in the middle of a top secret one now, as you know..."
>"Right. That must be a neat job, huh?"
>She smiles.
>"Oh, it has its ups and downs; what job doesn't? ...that's completely off the record, of course. That's not a very professional assessment of my job..."
>Again with the professionalism.
>Connie takes another bite of the peanut butter sandwich absentmindedly.
>"But I will fay that I have a lot of good memorief from thif job. I really love it! ...why am I ftill eating thif?"
>She washes down the mouthful of sandwich and sets down what's left of it.
>"Ah. That's better... So: what do you want to do now? We can't hop back in the water yet; we just ate!"
>She has a point. You don't want to cramp up, do you?

<Fly a drone>

>"Well, I did buy a drone at the mall the other day... wanna give it a fly?"
>"Hmm. Sure, that could be interesting!"
>"Oh, wait a minute. You've got some peanut butter there on your face."
>"Huh?"
>"I'll get it, don't worry!"
>You grab a napkin and wipe off the "peanut butter," smiling and attempting to make eye contact. Her hat obscures her eyes, as usual, but she smiles back at you.
>"There we go!"
>"T-thanks; I didn't even notice it!"
>You head over to the car and bring out the cheap camera drone you bought yourself. After a minute or two of setup and promptly ignoring the instructions, you're flying!
>Connie watches the drone excitedly, and you start trying some tricks with it.
>Before long, it starts to plummet towards the ground at top speed! You panic and pull up, pull up, pull up...!
>You watch the feed become completely white. You have no idea where the drone went; you panicked when it started to crash.
>"Err, Anon..."
>You turn around to see Connie smiling sheepishly. The drone is firmly wedged between her tits, apparently still functional based on the green light blinking atop it.
>You've never been so jealous of a camera.

<Turn it off, offer to help>

>You quickly deactivate the drone with its remote and run over to her.
>"Sorry! Sorry! Are you okay?"
>"I'm fine; it stung a little, but otherwise I'm fine! One good thing: the rotors stopped before they tangled up my fur, so that's a plus!"
>"Phew, what a relief! ...um, do you... need some help getting it out of there?"
>She flinches at your suggestion.
>"N-n-no... I'll... I'll get it, don't worry!"
>Connie reaches into her cleavage and gently removes the drone. It's completely unharmed, probably had a soft landing...
>"Here you go, Anon; just... please try to be more professional when you fly something like that, alright?"
>You can't resist a cheesy joke...
>"Why? The airbags deployed before it crashed!"
>Again, you're certain she's blushing under that fur. She pulls her hat down and smiles shyly.
>"...w-well... I'm glad nobody got hurt. I suppose I can make a note of this new turn of phrase as well. Thank you..."
>She's not upset, it seems, but more... embarrassed. That's fair, you suppose.
>"Hey, forget what I said. Let's ditch the drone; there's a nice hiking trail over that way! Let's go, we can even keep the swimsuits on if you like!"
>Connie almost immediately smiles again.
>"Oh, that sounds nice! *ahem* I can, ah, write down some more interesting sights when we get back. And I think I actually will keep this on for now; maybe we can hop back in later? ...purely for the sake of further investigation, that is."

<Arrive at the hot springs at the trail's end>

>The two of you walk down the wooded path, with Connie looking around in amazement the whole time. You lead the way, and suddenly hear a yelp from behind you.
>"What's wrong?"
>"I JUST STEPPED ON A SNAKE!"
>Sure enough, a small snake is slithering away from her.
>"Wait. How'd you know that's what it was?"
>"Well, we DO have non-intelligent animals back at home. How else would people like me eat meat without it being murder?"
>She smiles in a slightly disconcerting manner.
>"That's a fair point."
>Suddenly, a squirrel darts across the trail.
>"Where'd he go? Where'd he go?"
>Connie looks around excitedly for a moment before regaining her composure.
>"*ahem* S-sorry about that."
>After a short walk, you arrive at the trail's end. More specifically, you arrive at the hot springs the trail led to!
>"Ta-da!"
>"Ooh, that looks nice..."
>"Yep! Just ease in, the water's pretty warm-"
>You trail off as Connie runs and dives into the spring headfirst. She pops back up laughing.
>"Mm, it's so cozy... come on in, Anon!"
>She grins, then seems to catch herself.
>"...I, ah, could use some data on how humans react to hot water. *ahem*"
>She's slowly getting worse at pretending this stuff is all professional...
>You ease into the incredibly pleasant spring water. Ah...
>"Isn't this nice?"
>"Yes, it really is... I wish we had one of these back in Elsewhere!"
>Connie lays back on the bank of the spring, giving you a view of her belly and the underside of her chest. She sighs in contentment.
>"Ah... I could stay here for hours."
>"Well... maybe don't get TOO cozy... it's pretty easy to fall asleep and end up getting a little burnt!"
>She raises up and smiles.
>"Ah, but I have fur to prevent that!"
>She promptly lays back down, adjusting her hat in the process.

<Ask her some questions about herself>

>You wade over to the bank and lie down next to Connie. She doesn't object, and even smiles.
>"So, can I ask you some stuff?"
>"Alright, but remember I can't talk about my case..."
>"I know! I was wondering: you mentioned the food back in Elsewhere; what do you usually eat?"
>She almost immediately turns over to face you before responding.
>"Well, being a carnivore, usually meat. Steaks, burgers, the like. As I said, we have a lot of the same things you eat, we just don't cook things for as long!"
>"Uh-huh... what about your family and friends?"
>"Oh, I'm pretty close to my family. But... they all live in other towns. So I usually don't see them much. That's alright though, we talk on the phone pretty regularly! As for friends, I have quite a few in different places; I've also got some coworkers from the same detective agency. They're all pretty nice, I suppose!"
>"That's nice! How'd you get into that work anyway?"
>"Well, my mother was actually a detective! So, I just picked up the torch, as they say! In fact, I'm the third in a line of detectives in my family; my grandmother was so proud when I got my badge... mainly because she never actually got one!"
>"Neat! Uh... what do you think about us humans keeping pets?"
>"Well... it, ah, it took some getting used to, I'll say! We don't really... do that back home. It's alright though, it's just a different world here!"
>"Glad it's not too weird... so, how common is it for your kind to be mixed-species like you?"
>"More common than you'd think, but not an everyday occurrence! Out of everyone I know in Elsewhere, I think my family's the only mixed one. Not to say they don't live in Elsewhere, I just don't know any. Now, I have some friends in other towns that are mixed-species!"
>"How does that work with you having herbivores in your family?"
>"It's, uh, interesting. Family dinners are complicated. But mainly it means I can eat whatever! ...but I'll say I've always preferred meat to vegetables!"

<Relax>

>After answering your questions, Connie lies back and relaxes for a while. You soon follow suit. Just before you doze off, she rolls back towards you.
>"So, is it alright if I ask you some things as well?"
>"Sure, fire away."
>"What did you think when you first realized I wasn't human?"
>"Well... I was confused at first. But, now I know you're a good person, and I'm glad to know you."
>"...t-thank you. How do you feel about me staying at your house while I investigate?"
>"I'm completely fine with it; I'm glad you have somewhere comfortable to rest."
>"Thank you for letting me stay... Would all humans be this friendly towards people like me?"
>"Well... it's hard to say. People can be cruel, or they can be kind. It depends."
>"I understand. The same thing applies back home... Are you disappointed that I can't talk about my case?"
>"Well, I was, but I can understand that you're required to stay quiet about it."
>"Thank you. One more..."
>She looks away shyly before asking the last question.
>"Do you... really, honestly find me attractive? Purely for the sake of understanding human attraction, of course..."
>"Honestly? Yes. 100% yes. Fur, hat, pudge and all."
>Connie's hat flops back slightly, and you can see her get a little misty-eyed. She quickly fixes her hat.
>"...thank you, Anon. I really appreciate that. Okay, those are all the questions I have for now... Let's just enjoy this spring for a while, shall we?"
>With that, the two of you kick back and relax...

<???>

>You feel yourself dozing off and quickly jerk awake. The water is so pleasantly warm...
>You look over to see that Connie isn't in the spring anymore. You can hear her humming a cheerful tune behind you.
>You roll over to see what she's doing...
>Connie has her back to you. Her trenchcoat flaps a little in the wind. She's clearly preparing something...
>She continues humming as she slowly turns around...
>You see her gray eyes sparkle as she smiles incredibly widely.

<?????>

>"Is the water nice and warm?"
>You nod lazily.
>"Great! Here, move over for a second..."
>You roll out of her way. She drops a handful of something into the water.
>"Thanks, Stew!"
>You smile.
>"No problem, Connie!"
>She pulls a wooden spoon from her coat pocket.
>"Let's see if you're ready..."
>She dips it into the spring water and takes a sip.
>"Mm! Yep, almost there! Let me just turn the heat up a little bit, I'm starving!"
>She bends down and stokes a fire. You come to the sudden realization that you're sitting in a boiling pot.
>"Connie? What's this?"
>She smiles at you again. This time, you can see something in her eyes.
>Hunger.

<!!!>

>"Uhh..."
>"What's wrong? Did I forget to add salt?"
>"UHHH...."
>She tastes the water again.
>"Hmm. No, no, there's plenty of salt. What is it? Is the water not hot enough? Let me stoke the fire a little more..."
>The water becomes unbearably hot. You break into a sweat.
>"Hm. I forgot that you humans sweat when you're hot. I suppose I could've held off on that salt then. Oh well!"
>"This is a joke, right? Right?"
>She leans right into your face, smiling uncomfortably.
>"Nope! I have to see how you taste for my notes! I've been waiting for this, actually; I've heard rumors that human is a really good dish!"
>She roughly pats you on the head.
>"Don't worry, you'll be remembered; I never forget a good recipe!"
>You start to feel dizzy from the heat...
>You faint. The last thing you see is a smiling Connie brandishing a huge knife and fork...

>You feel yourself dozing off. You sit up and stretch before looking over at Connie. She's fast asleep, twitching and yelping. She must be having a nightmare or something...

<Wake her up>

>You gently tap Connie on the arm. She doesn't wake up at first. She's muttering in her sleep...
>"No... no... just- just stay in there... It'll be alright..."
>You tap her again. No response other than more muttering, but she fidgets more violently than before.
>"I'm sorry... it's just part of my job..."
>You lean down and whisper into her ear.
>She suddenly sits bolt upright.
>"I KNEW I ADDED TOO MUCH SALT!"
>She looks around dazedly.
>"Huh? W-what happened? A-anon?"
>She stares at you for a moment.
>Suddenly she squeezes you in a tight bear hug.
>"Whoa!"
>"I-I... had a nightmare. I'm glad you're okay, Anon..."
>Your head is in a very cozy place: nestled between her tits. Ah, so this is what that drone felt...
>Connie embraces you for a while before finally stepping back.
>"Sorry... that, ah, wasn't very professional of me... nor was sleeping on the job, I suppose. Let's get out of the spring for a while, alright?"
>"Okay. I'm getting kinda hot anyway."
>The two of you get out of the spring. Connie shudders and shakes violently, spraying you with water. She smiles sheepishly.
>"Oh, sorry; force of habit!"

<Tease her with a motorboat offer; say you can still be friends professionally>

>Given that she's already a little flustered, you decide to tease Connie a little bit...
>"You know... you're still pretty damp. I can help with that if you'll hug me that way again; I can at least dry your chest~"
>She lowers her hat and looks away.
>"...t-that... no, thank you. I'll wait until we get back to the towels you brought. But... thank you for offering to help."
>"Of course!"
>The two of your head back towards the car.
>"Connie... you know we can still be friends, even on a professional level."
>She smiles broadly.
>"Well... I'd be lying if I said I didn't already consider us friends, Anon!"
>Truth be told, you already considered her a friend too.
>It's not long before you're back at the car.
>"Alright; anything else you wanna do before we leave?"
>"Hm. No, nothing in particular. Let me change back into my coat and we can head out!"
>Connie dashes into the trees. You quickly change into your dry clothes. By the time you get done, she emerges, clad in her normal getup.
>"Ah... I liked the swimsuit you picked out, but I must say I prefer the fit of my coats... Less tight in certain areas."
>Well, you're not sure you'd agree there... But it does at least conceal her pudgy midsection.
>The two of you each grab a quick snack from the picnic basket before piling into the car.
>"As promised, we'll take the scenic route home!"
>She smiles and takes out her notebook.
>You drive home, being sure to pass some of the best scenery on this route. Connie smiles the entire time, jotting down note after note.
>Eventually, you make a stop at a local candy shop.
>"Wait here, I'll bring you back something really nice!"
>"Ooh, I'm looking forward to it! ...I haven't sampled any sweets for my notes yet. *ahem*"

<Buy some jellybeans>

>Thinking hard, you grab a bag of jellybeans for Connie, making absolutely sure that there aren't any chocolate-flavored ones inside.
>You check out with no incidents and rush back out to the car.
>"Here you go!"
>She smiles as she reads the bag's label.
>"How did you know that these are my favorite? But I'm sure that human candy probably has different flavors than what I'm used to...!"
>"They're great! You should try all the different color-"
>Connie immediately opens the bag and dumps the entirety of its contents into her mouth.
>"Mmf, they're good!"
>You can't help but laugh at the absurdity of what just happened. Connie smiles with multicolored teeth. Eventually she manages to swallow the jellybeans.
>"Phew... maybe I shouldn't have done that. ...but they were sooo good! ...that is, of course, a professional assessment. N-not just the opinion of a sweet-tooth..."
>"Riiight. So you liked em then?"
>She nods vigorously.
>"Definitely; thank you, Anon!"
>"No problem! Let's head home; it's getting late."
>With that, you drive home. Connie continues to scribble notes in her book for most of the ride. After a short while, you're home. Home, sweet home...

<Order a pizza, let Connie have the TV remote>

>After taking all the picnic supplies inside, you kick back on the couch and relax. Connie settles into her chair and sighs in contentment.
>"That was a very fun- err, INTERESTING trip, Anon; thank you!"
>"No problem, glad you enjoyed it!"
>The two of you rest for a little while. Soon, you start getting a little hungry.
>"Connie, I'm gonna order us a pizza; here's the remote so you can find us something good on!"
>She takes the remote and begins browsing through the channels as you step into the other room with the phone.
>Once you get the pizza ordered, you walk back into the living room. Connie is watching... Animal Planet. She's leaning forward and staring intently at the screen, occasionally taking notes on what she sees.
>"Hmm. I've never really considered it, but the animals here behave differently than what I'm used to... Then again, I've never really looked into how non-intelligent animals act back at home either..."
>"I figure they must be pretty similar though, right?"
>She frowns, but doesn't look away from the TV.
>"Mm. They're not as widespread back home as they are here. Most non-intelligents live well outside Elsewhere..."
>"Oh? How do you guys get them for meat then?"
>"Well, some people farm them, others hunt... Some, like me, aren't good at either of those and so buy our food like you humans seem to do."
>"So your kind do have SOME similarities to us, then..."
>"Mm. Seems so..."
>You settle back onto the couch and watch Connie with amusement. Eventually she seems satisfied and puts her notebook away.
>"Sorry about that, it was a prime opportunity to get some data on your world..."
>"No worries!"
>Suddenly, there's a knock at the door. Must be the pizza.

<Enjoy the pizza, ask some questions>

>You go answer the door and grab the pizza. Thankfully your living room isn't visible from the door, so the delivery guy doesn't see Connie...
>You set the pizza on your coffee table and grab a slice. Connie follows suit.
>"Want me to go grab you a drink? I've got soda, milk, water, booze..."
>She absentmindedly answers you, still watching the TV.
>"Mm, sure, a beer would be nice..."
>She suddenly does a double take.
>"W-wait, no... not while I'm on a case. Err, water's fine, Anon."
>"If you insist!"
>You go grab her a bottled water; when you come back she's already finished the slice she had.
>"Thank you!"
>"Of course! ...is it okay if I ask you more stuff?"
>"Sure thing, go ahead..."
>"Okay... have humans ever been to Elsewhere?"
>"Mm, I don't think so, no. Maybe some time in the town's history, but definitely not recently."
>"Huh... I know you like action movies, but what kind of TV shows do you watch back home?"
>"Well, I'm a self-admitted gameshow addict... I blame my grandmother, she loves them."
>"Mhm... do you guys have the Internet, or something like it?"
>"Well, it's not the one you humans use, but we do have an equivalent, yes. It's extremely useful..."
>"It can be, yeah! Last one: what are the major differences you've seen so far between Elsewhere and here?"
>"Well, aside from humans and the lack thereof, our societies are just... a little different. Not too much, but noticeable, anyway. I... can't really think of a way to sum it up, I'm afraid. I'm still studying the differences myself. One big one I noticed is the existence of a big overarching government here. The highest authority I know back home is the Mayor of Elsewhere. She doesn't really answer to anybody but the citizens... She's been in office for a long time, and we're lucky to have someone like her in charge. We've not had any issues with her! ...I'm sorry to say that I've heard several humans complain about your leaders."

<Put on a gameshow, ask more questions>

>You gently take the remote and put on Wheel of Fortune.
>"Oh, is this what I think it is? How interesting!"
>Connie scoots to the edge of her seat and watches intently. It's not long before she's blurting out answers and scolding poor contestants...
>"Really? You know that there's not even an M on the board; how can it be that? UGH. Are all humans this stupid on TV? Then again: there's just as many dumb answers back home..."
>"Well, the bad answers are part of the fun. Say, out of curiosity: have you been in a relationship before?"
>She flinches a little, but otherwise keeps her eyes on the screen.
>"Well... not really, no; unless you count strictly professional ones and longstanding friendships."
>"Oh, okay. How do you like your job?"
>"I love it; I always have! There are some bad days, but I've never wanted to give up. I enjoy my work too much to quit!"
>"That's good! What were you like when you were younger?"
>"Well, my mother says I was pretty calm and levelheaded for a pup. Most of my family were wild and rambunctious as pups."
>"Really? I wouldn't have figured that... Are you sure that water's fine? I really don't mind to grab you something stronger..."
>"No, no... I make it a rule not to drink alcohol while I'm working. I have a colleague who is terrible about that. If there's booze around, she's drunk. No exceptions. I don't care what kind of case it is either; there are literally no exceptions."
>"Are you absolutely sure? Surely what we have is weaker than what you have at home...?"
>"Yes, I'm sure; thank you. I'm actually not sure if yours is weaker or not... I haven't tested it."
>"Hmm."

<Try one more offer of a drink, then offer dessert>

>"Last offer: are you REALLY sure?"
>"Yes, I'm absolutely sure, Anon. Please just drop it. I refuse to behave like Bonnie, drinking on a case..."
>"Alright then. Here's another question: how's dessert sound?"
>Connie smiles, but then catches herself.
>"I... that sounds good but I think I'll pass. Thank you anyway!"
>"Huh? You feeling okay?"
>"I'm fine, just not really feeling dessert. I suppose it's because of stopping by the sweet shop earlier..."
>"Alright then; lemme know if you change your mind!"
>You take a seat back on the couch, making it a point to sit closer to Connie than before. She doesn't seem to notice, but smiles at you when you sit down.
>"This has been a very nice day, Anon; thank you for everything! *yawn* But... I think I may call it a night. Is it still okay to borrow your bed?"
>"Make yourself at home! And goodnight!"
>She slowly rises with a yawn and makes her way to the back of the house. You can hear her enter the bathroom and turn on the shower.
>You're actually pretty tired too, actually... You go ahead and change into your sleepwear. Connie is still showering when you get changed.

<Leave her alone for tonight, make breakfast again tomorrow>

>Though you have a fleeting desire to peek in on the showering Connie, you resist your urges. Besides, you're actually pretty tired...
>You lay down on the couch and almost immediately start to drift into sleep. You hear your bathroom door open just before you fall completely asleep.
>You see Connie, in her hat and coat still, lean over you with a smile. She gently pulls your blanket over your shoulder and walks away. You fall asleep, promising yourself that you'll make breakfast again tomorrow...
>You wake up later than usual; you forgot to set an alarm on your phone. You can hear sizzling in the kitchen. Family Feud is on the TV, and you occasionally hear Connie quietly rage about bad answers. You crack an eye to see her sitting in her usual chair, very close to your head.
>She doesn't notice that you're awake yet, it seems: she doesn't have her hat on. Though she's clearly enjoying the gameshow, you can see her frustration with the contestants clear as day.
>After a little while, she gently rises and goes into the kitchen. It's not long before she comes back, just in time for a particularly idiotic answer. 
>Connie is unable to stay quiet this time.
>"ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW? THAT'S NOT EVEN A WORD!"
>She gasps and claps a hand over her mouth. She cautiously looks over at you...

<Pretend to be asleep for a minute, then get up and see what she's cooking>

>You manage to stifle a laugh and pretend to stay asleep; Connie slowly returns to watching her show, only to almost immediately have another outburst:
>"WHAT? IS THIS A JOKE? HOW DOES POTATO ANSWER THAT QUESTION AT ALL?"
>Again, she claps a hand over her mouth. This time, you can't help but laugh and sit up. Connie quickly grabs a newspaper from your table and hides her face.
>"Mornin, bright eyes!"
>"Ah... sorry I woke you up. How do some of these people even function? Seriously."
>"Heh, I can see just how frustrated you got. Your eyes were practically sparkling!"
>"...speaking of, I need to go get my hat..."
>She slowly rises and heads to your room, never lowering the newspaper.
>"Oh, and breakfast is nearly done..."
>"Thanks for cooking, sorry I slept in!"
>She doesn't respond, and soon comes back with her hat. She immediately seems more comfortable than before.
>"I'm... not the best cook, but I hope you like it."
>You head into the kitchen and see some bacon frying on the stove. There's also a plate of very lightly cooked bacon on the table, likely for Connie.
>"Yours is almost done, I think. I'm not too sure how long you humans cook things..."
>"It's actually perfect now; thanks!"
>You quickly fix yourself a plate and sit next to Connie. She grins at you as you take a bite of your breakfast.
>It's awful. Absolutely terrible. What did she cook this in...?
>For what it's worth, she ravenously cleans her own plate in only a minute or two. She smiles at you warmly.
>Suddenly, a thought occurs: what about work?
>Then you remember: it's Saturday. You're off. Phew!
>But now there's the problem of this awful cooking...

<Eat the awful bacon, gently offer to help her cook>

>You've never had such awful tasting bacon in your life, but...
>You can't tell that to her. You smile and force yourself to eat Connie's cooking.
>"This is pretty good! I didn't know you were interested in cooking yourself; I could show you some recipes sometime if you'd like?"
>"Hm, that would be interesting! Thank you!"
>To take your mind off the food, you decide to ask her something else about her home.
>"So, Connie: what's it like outside of Elsewhere?"
>"Oh, decently similar to your world, I suppose. There are some small suburban towns, some rural farming towns, even a village of people who live up in the mountains. And that's just places I've been; our world is huge like yours is!"
>"Huh... do you guys have different languages? And how come you speak English?"
>"Yes, different regions have different languages, and some more exotic species have their own as well. For example, a lot of aquatic species speak Atlantian. I've never been able to pick up Atlantian, sadly. I do have a friend who's good with it though. I speak a few different languages, and so do my colleagues. It's something you use a lot in our line of work, you see."
>"Yeah, that makes sense... How many investigators are there, anyway?"
>"Well... I suppose it doesn't hurt to tell you... Besides, they're on different cases. There's 4 of us, and our employer sometimes dips her hands into particularly deep cases."
>"Huh. Interesting..."
>Somehow, you've managed to choke down all the awful food...

<Ask what she wants to do today>

>"So, uh, is there anything in particular you wanted to do today?"
>"Ah... I can't really think of anything. I don't really know what all there is to do around here, as you know..."
>"Right... how about some video games?"
>Connie smiles, but tilts her head.
>"Mm, that could be interesting. I have a friend back home who is an avid gamer, but I've personally never gotten beyond casual play every now and again."
>"I know the perfect thing for you, and it can even help your investigation, maybe!"
>You start up a game of You Don't Know Jack, figuring the trivia questions can help Connie learn more about your world. Besides, it's vaguely gameshow like, so maybe she'll like it?
>Eventually, she manages to scrape up a victory despite having little knowledge of humans.
>"Hmm. That was actually really fun! ...and it gave me some interesting data."
>"Yeah yeah... let's try something else, huh?"
>This time, you pop in Mario Kart 8.
>Connie scrolls through the characters before suddenly stopping on Isabelle. She tilts her head incredibly far to the side.
>"......."
>"Connie?"
>"...I... huh. I hadn't seen human media with our kind in it before. Even if it is a cartoonish exaggeration of us. Is this really how humans interpret us?"
>"Sometimes. Some people see you as more, well, sexy than cutesy. Others think you'd be scary. It depends on the person, really."
>"...and what do you think of my kind, Anon?"
>"I think you already know the answer to that, right?"
>"...I see. Thank you."
>Connie sits in silence for a second before smiling and choosing Isabelle.
>"Well, I suppose this is the most fitting choice for me!"
>The two of you compete in several races, with you ultimately winning more than her.
>Once it's all said and done, Connie is grinning ear to ear.
>"This is really fun, I can see why people like these so much!"

<Show her Armello>

>"Well, if its games with your kind you like, here's one you might find interesting!"
>You boot up Armello on your PC. Connie seems incredibly interested almost as soon as the game starts.
>Rather than play, she simply sits back and watches over your shoulder, smiling and taking occasional notes.
>By the time you finish your game, she's practically resting her chin on your shoulder. She quickly sits back and clears her throat.
>"That was very interesting, Anon; thank you for sharing that with me! I'm a little embarrassed that I never considered that our kind would be shown in human media. After all, humans, or at least facsimiles of them, are in our media!"
>"Really?"
>"More often than you'd think, actually. But... we don't really know a lot about you. Hence, my note taking on everything."
>"That makes sense..."
>Connie hits down a few more notes before putting her notebook away.
>"Is there anything else you'd like to show me, Anon? I'd love to see some more takes on my kind, actually!"

<Show her a variety of games and movies>

>You decide to make a proper day out of this by showing Connie all sorts of relevant things, including a handful of games and movies. She seems to enjoy most of them. It's kinda fun just watching her various reactions.
>Primal Rage: she actually winces during much of it, and later comments about how brutal the characters seem to be...
>Star Fox: She ends up liking this one fairly well, but finds Slippy extremely annoying.
>Conker: Despite trying to hide it, she ends up chuckling at a lot of the jokes.
>Animal Crossing: This one eats up most of the day, as she ends up making a character and getting really engrossed in everything. She ends up really attached to Whitney and spends most of her gametime around her. You make sure to boot the game up again later and show Connie K.K. Slider. She ends up loving pretty much all of the songs you show off.
>Mickey Mouse: She really likes Donald of all characters. She gets really confused about Pluto not being intelligent enough to talk, but apparently smart enough to do other things.
>Kung Fu Panda: You never even get it started; she laughs it off when you tell her the name.
>Robin Hood: She really likes how the characters are done; she claims it's probably the closest to accurate of everything you've shown her.

<Destroy reality by showing her /hmofa/>

>Well... she already knows that some humans see her kind as attractive. Might as well show her some proof of that?
>"Connie, this next one is a little... uh, different."
>You navigate to 4chan's /trash/ board and head to your favorite thread: /hmofa/
>Connie watches you scroll through and quietly reads some of the posts under her breath. You sense that she's definitely blushing under her fur again.
>Though you don't really want to at first, she asks that you show her some of the pics that were posted. She definitely seems embarrassed, but... interested somehow.
>Huh? Oh, some idiot is writing one of those "interactive" stories.
>Something about a female Anon and some anthro detective named Jonnie. Seems pretty dumb so far.
>Especially the name. "Being Observed?" Really? How original.
>Once you reach the end of the thread, Connie steps away from the computer, with her hat pulled very far down over her face.
>"That... was, ah, very... I-interesting. I had no idea how many humans thought of us that way..."

<Form a plan to sneak her into an amusement park. But first...>

>Though Connie walked away, you decide to make a quick suggestion to the writer of Being Observed. You tell him to have his Anon show Jonnie the existence of /hmofa/.
>For a split second, a deep existential chill runs down your spine...
>Connie gently touches you on the shoulder.
>"Anon? Are you alright?"
>"Huh? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine..."
>Coincidentally, an ad for a nearby amusement park appears on your TV. Connie seems intrigued.
>"Hm. I wonder how similar your amusement parks are to the ones I'm used to?"
>"Wanna find out? I think we could swing this if we call you a mascot..."
>She looks down at herself.
>"...do mascots usually have my, ah, body type?"
>"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. You wanna try it?"
>"Mm... alright, I suppose it's worth a try, anyway..."
>The two of you hop in your car and head out.
>It's not long before you make it to the amusement park, the ever-popular Genericville.

<Enter the park>

>Ah... Looneyville. It's not actually called Genericville, despite your thoughts earlier. But it IS a pretty generic amusement park.
>You and Connie hop out of your car and make your way to the ticket booth; time to see if you can pass her off as a mascot or something...
>"Hey; 2 adult passes, please."
>"Err..."
>"Oh, uh... don't mind her, she's one of the mascots!"
>"...sir. We don't have a wolf mascot."
>Well that plan worked super well. And now this guy has seen Connie!
>"Well, uh, you see... she... uh..."
>Connie steps up to the window.
>"Hi, I hope it's okay to wear my suit in?"
>"Um, may I ask why, ma'am?"
>"Well... truth be told I have really bad anxiety, and wearing this is the only way for me to go into a public place like this and stay calm."
>"...ma'am..."
>The ticket booth guy sighs and rubs his forehead.
>"Okay, go ahead. Just... please don't cause any trouble, alright?"
>Connie smiles, and the worker flinches a little.
>"Thank you, have a nice day."
>The two of you head in before the worker can protest.
>Before long, the two of you are in the main plaza of Looneyville. So much to do, so much to see!

<Ride the carousel>

>Connie is obviously excited, and a little nervous, it seems. You're not surprised to see some people staring at her as they pass. One guy high fives you as he passes.
>"DUDE! You scored one of those freaky furry chicks? Killer suit, babe!"
>Connie smiles sheepishly and pulls down her hat.
>"What should we do first, Anon?"
>"Let's start with the classic: the carousel!"
>The old carousel is probably the least popular ride in Looneyville. There's barely a line, ever.
>The two of you get ready to board. The ride operator, a tiny old lady smiles up at Connie.
>"My my, such a tall young lady! And beautiful too; I love your hair, dear, I wish mine would grow like that!"
>"T-thank you, ma'am."
>The operator smiles and lets the two of you on. You get on a rather aged white horse, and Connie picks a golden one. She has some difficulty fitting into the horse, and ends up with the pole wedged suggestively in her chest.
>As soon as the ride starts, you can see a genuine smile spread across her face. It seems that the operator notices too; she waves and smiles back.
>Eventually, the ride ends; the two of you disembark, with Connie thanking the operator before she goes.

<Find a bounce castle>

>Once you're both out of the carousel, you immediately look for another ride. 
>A quick glance at Connie's chest immediately inspires you...
>"I have an idea: let's sneak into the kiddie area and go in the bounce castle."
>"Huh? Alright then..."
>Surprisingly, it's not difficult to get into the Kidzone. There are remarkably few workers around.
>A little girl sees Connie and squeals. She runs up and wraps around the detective's legs.
>"Puppy!"
>Connie gasps, and looks at you, helpless.
>Eventually, the little girl lets go and runs off again.
>"That... huh. Humans are so strange."
>The two of you climb into the bounce castle, with extreme difficulty on Connie's part, due to her height.
>She tentatively hops a few times, then suddenly starts bouncing around like mad. As do her... airbags. All according to plan.
>She giggles wildly and jumps circles around you, with the kids in the castle quickly warming up to her. Before long, they're all cheering and chanting for her.
>"DOGGY! DOGGY! DOGGY!"
>Connie's hat flies up on a particularly high jump. She winks at you mischievously. She starts to fall...

>For a second, time seems to stop. When things resume moving, you can see one of Connie's claws pierce the floor of the castle.
>There's a high pitched squeal, and then the castle quickly starts to deflate.
>Connie panics and starts rushing the kids out of the castle. You grab two particularly small ones and make a break for it.
>The castle collapses. Everyone is safe except Connie and one more kid.
>Suddenly, Connie pops out of the deflated castle. Sitting comfortably in her cleavage is the last kid, giggling.
>"Again! Again!"
>Connie gently pulls the kid out and sets her down on the ground. The little girl hugs her legs tightly.
>"Thank you, nice lady!"
>Connie bends down and hugs the little girl.
>"Uh, we need to go."
>The two of you quickly run away, eventually finding yourselves at the drop tower.
>"Huh... this looks kind of interesting. What do you say, Anon?"
>"Uh, sure!"
>The two of you line up for the drop tower. Everything goes well until...
>"Um, m-ma'am? I, uh, I don't think you'll fit in the restraints..."
>Sure enough, a quick trial in the test seat proves that the restraints simply won't fit over Connie. Embarrassed, she quickly apologizes and hops out of line.

<Ride the Ferris wheel>

>Connie seems disheartened, until something catches her eye...
>"Whoa... look at the size of that Ferris wheel!"
>"Yeah, tallest in the state, apparently; wanna go on?"
>She nods enthusiastically. The two of you run excitedly to the queue.
>As you wait in line, Connie draws quite a few eyes. Including those of a familiar face... that clerk from Spencer's.
>"Hey! Look who it is! Dude, how'd you get em to let her in with the suit?"
>"Well, uh..."
>"Ha, don't worry about it; lemme guess, you two have some plans for that suit and this wheel, huh? Heh heh. Go ahead of me, dude. Have a nice one, and you better make this worth her while!"
>Connie coughs awkwardly and shuffles ahead, hat firmly pulled over her eyes.
>Before long, you board the wheel. The cabins are enclosed, and two-person only. So, the two of you are totally alone. Connie looks out the glass with wonder, her tail wagging in excitement.

>The cabin slowly ascends as the wheel turns. Connie looks back and forth excitedly, occasionally looking over and smiling at you.
>Once you approach the top of the wheel, you lean over towards her and smile, making eye contact when she looks over and looking out when she does.
>"This is really nice... you can see everything from up here. I can see... oh, they got the bounce castle reinflated! There's actually a line for the carousel. Nobody's waiting for the drop tower..."
>She unconsciously leans forward, placing her hands on yours.
>You are face to face with her chest. It's very difficult to avert your gaze, but you tear your eyes away in time to see her frowning.
>"Something wrong?"
>"...no... I just... thought I saw something. Sorry."
>She gasps and immediately perks up.
>"Anon, why didn't you tell me they had bumper cars? I love those!"
>"Why didn't you say so? We'll head that way when this is over, if you want."
>She smiles, and her tail wags. She looks down and quickly moves her hands.

<Ride the bumper cars>

>As the Ferris wheel continues to turn, Connie happily chats away, pointing out interesting sights and generally enjoying herself. 
>"Is that a haunted house? Huh. Whoa, one of those big wooden coasters! Ooh, a water ride? This place has a lot of neat rides, huh?"
>She frowns and leans forward one more time. This time you follow her gaze.
>You don't see what she's looking at...
>She soon sits back and continues to chat and look around.
>Before you know it, the wheel stops. The two of you get out, and she immediately dashes towards the bumper cars.
>You run after her, watching as she somehow manages to avoid running into anyone.
>You soon arrive at the bumper cars. Connie is already climbing into a car; you quickly grab one as well.
>You look over at her and wave.
>The ride operator comes on the PA system...
>"Ma'am, you may want to take your hat off; we can't promise you'll get it back if it's bumped off."
>Connie hesitates, but eventually pulls her hat off.
>She looks over at you...
>The buzzer sounds and the bumper cars spring to life!
>You immediately regret your choice in ride when you see Connie's maniacal grin and the look of pure evil in her eyes. She barrels towards you at top speed...

<LEFT!>

>Panicking, you make a hard left.
>You narrowly avoid Connie, with her slamming into a car behind you. The kid inside screams; Connie growls playfully and adjusts her aim. She rams into several cars, and soon she has a clean shot at you again!
>You dodge again, barely.
>She rams into the wall and growls again. You look back...
>She looks almost legitimately angry now.
>Hooo boy.
>With an actually intimidating, fanged grin, she barrels towards you, with you driving away as fast as possible.
>She batters two cars aside, keeping her laser focus on you. Some of the other adults riding pick up on this and wisely keep their distance from you.
>The kids, however, are loving this.
>They make every effort to knock you back towards her. Some of them instead block her, giggling when she rams into them.
>Despite her scary enthusiasm, Connie seems to be having fun. She laughs heartily every time she hits somebody.

<FIGHT BACK>

>No. No more running. You're gonna fight like a MAN!
>You maneuver around and drive headfirst at Connie, as fast as the bumper car will let you.
>Her smile widens even farther. You're actually a little unsettled. You can see death and madness in her silvery eyes.
>Neither of you are backing down. 
>As the inevitable collision approaches, the other riders line up and watch in awe.
>Even the once-bored teen running the ride is on the edge of his seat.
>The ground between you and your foe is steadfastly shrinking.
>Your duel will be remembered for ages, surely.
>Connie comes closer. And closer.
>AND CLOSER...

>The wind blows. A child cries out in terror. A clown appears, attracted by the scent of bloodlust and children's tears.
>Your blood runs as cold as ice.
>The grid overhead crackles with white hot lightning.
>The tension in the air is thick enough to cut with a knife.
>Or the teeth of a wolf.
>Connie opens her mouth wide in a barbaric shout. 
>You follow suit with a mighty bellow that would make your ancestors shed tears of pride.
>Your cars are merely feet apart now.
>It's all come down to this.
>The ultimate collision.
>The Bump Heard Round the World.
>This
>Is
>IT.

>With a halfhearted buzz, the bumper cars deactivate.
>Your epic collision... never happens.
>Connie pants for a while before catching her breath. She promptly puts her hat back on and hops out of the car like nothing happened. You follow her back out of the ride.
>"What the heck was that all about?"
>"What do you mean, Anon?"
>"What do I mean? You went absolutely NUTS back there!"
>"Huh? It's called having fun!"
>"Your fun scares me, a little."
>"What, you didn't have fun?"
>"I didn't say that!"
>She laughs and playfully slaps you on the back.
>A kid runs up to the two of you.
>"Hey lady; that was wicked!"
>Connie smiles and kneels down.
>"Thank you! I had fun, what about you?"
>"Yeah! It was awesome! I lost a tooth when you hit me!"
>Sure enough; the little fella has a gap in his smile.
>Connie laughs and rises. The kid runs off.

<Check out some carnival games>

>With that settled, you hit the carnival games and such.
>There's a whole slew of the usual rigged throwing games. A carny is exasperatedly scolding a teen.
>"No, no, no. Ya gotta get the Rings INSIDE the bottle!"
>The teen wordlessly chucks a ring at the carny before storming off.
>You lose sight of Connie.
>Panicking slightly, you go from booth to booth, looking for her.
>Eventually, you run into something big, soft, and furry.
>"Phew, I thought I'd lost you. Let's go."
>You look up and realize you're talking to a stuffed animal. The carny running the game nearby laughs at you mockingly.
>Connie peeks her head around a booth.
>"Over here."
>You follow her...
>It's... a cotton candy booth. Of course.
>You buy two cotton candies, one for each of you. Surprisingly, it takes Connie a while to eat hers; mainly because it keeps getting stuck in the fur around her mouth.
>Eventually the both of you finish your candy and decide to try out a carnival game.
>You decide to try the strength tester. What better way to show off?
>With the strength of a Greek god, you raise the hammer as if it were the weapon of a hero.
>You let out a mighty roar and swing the hammer.
>A buzzer sounds, and the board cheerfully informs you that you are in fact, a weenie.
>"Betta luck next time, slick!"
>Rats. Stupid rigged games...
>In the meantime, Connie has racked up quite a haul from the corkgun shooting gallery. She proudly shows off a rubber cigar, an eyepatch, and...
>"Here's yer prize, toots."
>The carny suddenly stabs Connie's hand!
>...with one of those cheap spring-loaded trick knives. She snickers and shakes her head.

<Ride the Tunnel of Love>

>As you walk through the park, you suddenly see something: a rather garish, pink ride. A sign says TUNNEL OF LOVE, but LOVE is written above some crossed out text clearly reading BEES...
>"Hey, what about the Tunnel of Love?"
>"Err..."
>"...we'd be just checking it out professionally, of course."
>"...alright then, sure!"
>The two of you hop into the boat. The same old lady from the carousel is running this ride.
>"Have fun, dears! Oh, and you better hold her tight, young man; she's quite a fetching young lady!"
>You blush, and feel like Connie probably does too, under her fur.
>As you ride through the incredibly cheesy ride, you notice something odd...
>Connie slowly, steadily creeps closer to you, making no indication that she's doing so.
>Eventually, she's practically on top of you. She reaches for your hand, which is next to you on the bench.
>You gently take her hand, your fingers interlocking.
>She says nothing, and neither do you.
>You just share a warm smile.

>By the time the boat reaches the end of the Tunnel of Love, Connie has moved up from merely holding your hand to full on cuddling.
>She has one arm wrapped tightly around your middle, and grasps your hand gently with the other. She smiles gently.
>"Anon... I really wanted to keep things professional. But, I think you and I both know we're getting attached."
>She squeezes you even tighter.
>"I... I've never had this happen before. Back home, I had a few marks call me hot, and flirt, but I've never met anyone outside my family who showed any genuine love for me. I..."
>She sniffs, and releases your hand to wipe her eyes.
>"Thank you. Thank you for everything you've done for me. You could've left me to watch from a distance, but you didn't. You... you actually made an effort to be kind to me. That means a lot to- to-"
>She stops talking altogether and buries her face in your shoulder. You gently place an arm around her.
>She eventually looks up. Her hat has slipped, and you can see her eyes, glistening. She sniffles a few more times and smiles shakily.
>"Anon... I don't say this lightly: I... I love you."

>As the boat coasts to a stop, the two of you are locked in a tight, warm embrace. A familiar voice rings out: the old lady running the ride.
>"Yoo-hoo! Can I have a word with you two youngsters in private? We can talk in the control room! Come in, come in, I made tea!"
>The two of you gently rise and make your way up to the old lady. She smiles warmly and leads you to the control room.
>You're a little shocked at how cozy it is in here. All manner of hand-knitted decorations hang in the room, as do several paintings of various scenes.
>The lady smiles and swiftly motions for Connie to bend down. When she complies, the lady swiftly yanks her hat off.
>"Oh my, just as I thought: gray! Oh, my husband had the most beautiful gray eyes."
>She gently tousles Connie's hair.
>"You're from the other world, aren't you, dearie?"
>Connie gasps and starts stammering.
>"Heh heh, don't fret, dear. Your secret is safe with me."
>"How did you..."
>The lady smiles and wordlessly uncovers a large framed photo.
>The photo shows her and a burly, bearded bear man embracing.
>"My husband was an Otherworlder too. Ah, he was such a strapping man. He was a lumberjack. My, he was so strong... and yet, so warm, so gentle."
>The lady smiles nostalgically. She gently replaces Connie's hat.
>"Sorry to frighten you, dears. I just wanted to speak to an Otherworlder again. Young man, you treat this young lady right; she's, ah... er, what do you do, young lady?"
>"Err, I'm a private investigator..."
>"Really? That must be exciting! Do you have a badge?"
>Connie smiles and presents her badge to the lady.
>"Inspector Connie Lopine... That's a wonderful name, dearie."
>"Thank you, ma'am..."
>"Ah, thank you both for paying me a visit. Have a nice day in the rest of the park!"
>You leave the control room, waving goodbye to your hostess. She sits down and stares at the old photograph, smiling warmly.

>You and Connie walk out of the control room. She seems rather shocked.
>"I... had no idea that there had been marriages between our kinds. That's very interesting, I'll have to make a note of-"
>She's cut off by you tightly hugging her. She hesitates, then lifts you up slightly so you're eye-to-eye.
>The two of you share a warm, passionate kiss.
>As if on cue, the aging speakers in the Tunnel of Love spring to life, playing a shockingly clear "Can You Feel the Love Tonight."
>Stupid cliches.
>After what feels like an eternity, the kiss ends. The two of you lock eyes, and she gently sets you down.
>"...that wasn't very... forget it. This isn't a professional relationship. Anon... thank you for sticking with me, even though I pushed you away in the interest of keeping up an air of professionalism. I... I'm glad that we met. I'm glad that you invited me to stay with you. I'm glad that we went to the lake together. And... I'm glad that we came here today."
>You smile, and can't help but tear up a little. For what it's worth, she follows suit.
>"C'mon... let's go. I-I'm not a pretty crier, and it's crowded here."
>You take her hand, and the two of you walk away from the Tunnel of Love.

>The two of you quietly make your way out of Looneyville, holding hands all the way. A few people look on with warm smiles, and you soon pass the same clerk from earlier.
>"Whoa... dude, you scored the real victory here; what I was saying earlier is fun and all, but there's nothing better than love, man."
>He flashes an engagement ring and the woman next to him beams.
>"Me? I hit it lucky today too, man. Take care."
>The clerk and his fianc walk away. Connie smiles after them. 
>You soon find yourselves at your car.
>"Well, that was fun; wanna grab a bite to eat on the way home, Connie?"
>She laughs.
>"Anon, you ought to know the answer to that by now!"
>You fire up your car and make your way to the local Waffle House.
>After all... things are always weird there; nobody will question a she-wolf there, right?

>As expected, nobody bats an eye at your entrance. When you place your orders, the waitress takes a look at Connie and gasps.
>"Oh. My. GOD."
>Connie shifts in her seat and attempts to hide her snout.
>"...WHO DOES YOUR HAIR? It's gorgeous!"
>The two of you sigh in relief.
>After that scare, lunch goes off without another hitch.
>"So, Connie... what happens now?"
>"Well... my investigation is almost done. When it is... I'll have to go report back to my employer."
>"You mean you'll have to leave?"
>"...yes. But... I can come back afterwards. If you'll have me, of course."
>"Are you kidding? I'd love for you to stay with me."
>Connie smiles, and reaches over the table for your hand. You take her hand, and the two of you intertwine your fingers.
>Your food arrives, and she digs in with her usual enthusiasm.
>Ah... you'll never get tired of her zest for everything.
>Before you know it, you're on your way home. After an uneventful ride, you arrive at your humble house.
>The two of you head inside and settle down on the couch together. You cuddle up together and put on a gameshow.
>Almost immediately, the two of you are screaming at a particularly stupid contestant.
>Yup, this is the life.

>As the gameshow continues, you and Connie scoot closer and closer together on the couch. Eventually she's sitting in your lap.  She's so warm...
>During a commercial break, another passionate kiss breaks out. You gently run your fingers through her fur.  You can't believe how smooth and soft she is.
>The lengthy kiss is only interrupted when the show returns and the contestants onscreen give an absolutely godawful answer.
>"WHAT? THAT'S THE DUMBEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD."
>Connie glares at the screen, unconsciously squeezing you tighter, burying your face in her chest.  It's as if your face were lying between two of the softest, warmest pillows in the world.  Her fur tickles your nose a little.  You can feel yourself blushing... and your pants getting tighter.
>Eventually she shakes her head in disgust and looks back down at you. She smiles mischievously and gently squeezes her tits together.
>"Having fun in there?"
>"Mmmhmm."
>You eventually pull your face out, as a question has occurred to you.
>"Say... can I tag along when you take your report home?"
>"Ah... normally I'd say yes, but I don't think that's a good idea. My employer has very strict regulations on who is allowed into our agency. Sometimes she even bars my coworkers if she's in a bad mood..."
>"Who is your employer?"
>Connie hesitates, then sighs and answers.
>"I suppose it doesn't hurt to tell you. I work for Lonnie Hoardwell, the most famed detective in Elsewhere. Or at least, she was. She's semiretired now, only dipping her hands in particularly big cases. She... has a bit of a temper, but she's a good leader."
>"And you don't think she'd be okay with me?"
>"...no."
>"Fair enough, I guess..."
>Connie looks apologetic, and hugs you tightly again.  You are wrapped in warmth and comfort.
>"It'll be alright; I should only be gone a day or two."

>"So, what do I do if you're gone for more than a couple of days? Is there a way for me to come check on you?"
>"...I'll be alright. But, if it makes you feel better, you can come after me if I'm gone for a week or more. I'll leave a map for you when I go."
>"So, uh... when are you gonna have to go?"
>"Soon... I only have one more thing to do before I leave."
>"What's that?"
>She surprises you with a wry grin and another hug that leaves you once again buried in her cleavage.  It becomes nearly impossible to hide your excitement.
>"You, of course."
>She maintains eye contact and that smile for a moment, then starts to snicker.
>"I... I can't keep a straight face! I heard that in one of the handful of human movies I've watched. I just had to see your reaction!"
>She scoots out of your lap and stands up.
>"No, all that's left for me to do is to pack up and hit the road."
>She heads into your room. You can hear her rummaging in the closet, whistling a pleasant tune.
>You go back to watching the gameshow, but eventually you hear her call for you.
>"Anon, can you come here for a minute?"

>You gently open the door to your room, watching the TV over your shoulder. 
>"What's up, need somethi-"
>You blink a few times in shock.
>Connie is standing right next to your bed, fully nude, not even wearing her hat.
>"Well... what do you think?"
>She's... gorgeous. Her already impressive rack looks even bigger when not contained by her coat. Small pink nips peek shyly through her fur. You can't see much downstairs, due to her fur.
>You, of course, can see the small layer of pudge on her belly. She smiles shyly and turns around slowly. Beneath her tail is a firm, round ass, perfectly complimented by her wide hips and long legs.
>Her eyes seem to sparkle with enthusiasm.  Her flowing white hair cascades down her back.
>She sits on the bed and gives you another shy smile.  You are completely unable to hide your sheer excitement.
>"...well... what do you say?"
>Without a word, you immediately start stripping down.  She watches with mounting excitement...

>Once you've shed all your clothes, Connie slowly rises and walks around you, drinking in every inch of your body.
>"Hm... I must say you look better without clothes."
>She grins fiercely and suddenly drops to her knees in front of you.
>Before you can react, she immediately buries your member in her pillowy mounds.
>The feeling is positively heavenly.  The warmth of her body... The softness of her fur... The near constant jiggling of her chest...
>This is gonna be something special...
>Still bearing that mischievous grin, she gently leans down.  She hovers above the tip of your rod, and makes meaningful eye contact before giving you a teasing lick.  It's all you can do not to immediately fire off a load into her cleavage.
>She works you over with her mounds until it becomes clear that you're nearly finished.
>Just before you reach your climax, she gently places her mouth around you.  She swallows your entire load effortlessly, even licking you clean afterwards.
>Judging by the smile still adorning her face, that wasn't enough to satisfy her...

>An hour later, you're lying on your back, panting. Connie lies next to you, one leg seductively lying across your body.  The heat of her body lulls you into a comfy, relaxed state.
>She stares at you with warm, satisfied eyes.
>"That was absolutely worth the wait. Thank you, Anon."
>"Y-yeah... no problem."
>She grins teasingly and begins slowly rubbing you with her leg.  The smooth white fur glides across your bare skin effortlessly.  She makes an effort to slow her progress when she brushes against your rod.  Before long, she manages to perk you up again.
>"What's the matter? Tired? I know what'll pick you up..."
>She pulls you closer and begins grinding herself against you slowly.  The drowsy warmth begins to fade, replaced with a fiery anticipation.
>"You wouldn't be against another round, would you? I have to leave soon, remember~?"
>Your mind says no, but you're already standing at attention elsewhere.  Of course, she's already noticed that herself.
>She maneuvers herself deftly and grasps your stiff member gently.  She licks her lips and begins to gently stroke you with her fingertips...
>Round 2 it is then.
>She once again leans over you and carefully takes your length into her mouth.  Immediately, she begins an artful assault on you with her tongue.  You barely last a minute. 
>She finishes you off effortlessly.  Once she releases you, she pulls herself up from the bed.
>She adjusts herself so that she's hovering above you.  She looks at you with a silvery fire in her eyes.
>"You've already had two victories.  Now, it's my turn~"
>As your body prepares for a final round, she gently lowers herself onto your rod...

>After a full 3 rounds, she finally seems to be satisfied. She lays back and sighs in contentment.
>"That... was fun."
>She lays there for a few minutes, then steadily rises. She soon pulls her coat on, then her hat. She grabs a white briefcase and starts to leave.
>"Anon... I'll be back as soon as possible. If I'm not back in a week, check inside your nightstand. There's a map there."
>She takes a deep, shaky breath.  Her voice wavers, and you can hear her choke back sobs.
>"...goodbye, Anon."
>As she casts one final look over her shoulders, you see tears in her eyes.
>"...I love you."
>She dashes out of your house.
>Connie... is gone.
