>You are Anon, Biologist extraordinaire
>Ok well you got a PhD in Biology, but the university refused to fund your research
>In fact most of your colleagues Laughed in your face when you told them your end Goal
>You were going to find Bigfoot! He had to be real!
>After all Anthros are real! Therefore he must be one of the missing evolutionary links between humans and anthros
>And so your research and interviews lead to to western Canada, near the southern part of the Yukon
>But you were going to do this right
>Not go into the woods at night and yell at the sky
>You had dozens of Hunters cameras in your pack as you trudged through the thick forest
>Snow gently fell around you, blanking out the sounds besides your own foot steps
>While you were on a mission you also could appreciate it all
>The evergreen trees covered in a light dusting of snow, the mountains in the distance, the occasional deer or snowshoe hare
>Stopping by a large bare oak tree you set down your pack and pull out one of the Camera
>You fidget with it for a while, making sure it was set to take pictures at movement
>So far so good, it's attached to the tree about 5 feet up
>Rummaging in your pack earns you your GPS Device and a protein bar
>These cold temperatures really boosted your Metabolism because your body worked harder to maintain homeostasis
>As you bite into the bar, you look at the GPS and place a small mark on the map showing where this camera was
>The screen is littered with at least a dozen similar dots 
>Where to now though?
>A stream is about half a click north, Bigfoot had to get water from somewhere
>Maybe you could walk up the banks of it placing more cameras
>You decide that's the best plan of action for now
>If you could figure out its food source that would also make tracking it easier
>The beauty of the wilderness surrounds you as you walk through the snow,
>A gentle gust causes you to adjust your scarf a bit to cover your nose and mouth
>While you could appreciate nature, why couldn't Bigfoot live somewhere warmer?
>Mexico maybe? well actually after you prove Bigfoot is real you could go hunting for the Chupacabra 
>The name always name you giggle because it translates to "goat sucker"
>Legendary Mythological creature and the best name they could find was Goat sucker!
>Well now that you think about it, Big foot isn't any better at all
>Eh well some people called it a yeti
>But the name Yeti kinda got ruined after "ski free" came out and it would chase people down and eat them
>The sound of the stream bubbling away snaps you from your mental tangent
>You walk to it and look around, this would be a suitable water source for sure!
>Constant movement meant less bacteria making it healthy to drink 
>You look around a bit and decide to walk up the banks setting up cameras
>For the better part of 2 hours you walk upstream, setting up cameras , marking their location and casually eating
>If only this place water a little warmer, you would love to live here
>You think about how you might retire here one day, while you eat from a large bag of beef jerky
>The sound of a branch cracking snaps you out of your daydream
>You turn to the sound expecting to see another deer or maybe a Moose
>Instead its him!
>She?
>IT
>Bigfoot!
>A 9 foot tall ape like thing covered in shaggy grey fur
>It actually looks a lot less majestic than you thought it would, it had a pot belly and a double chin
>Your brain doesn't now what to do
>Pictures! Camera!
>You drop your bag of food and fumble around trying to get your pack off your back
>God dammit fingers work! Now is not the time for trembling
>As you fumble around you barely register the rushed stomping coming towards you
>Barely
>You look up and see the creature rushing you 
>It lets out a bone chilling howl just before swinging one of its massive legs to kick you
>You react just in time to raise your pack to cushion the blow 
>The kick still sends you flying, and you hear a faint Splash as your pack lands in the stream and is washed away
>Fuck that hurt
>You have just enough time to look up before seeing it rushing at you again
>Were you going to die?
>You don't want to die!
>Having never been in a real fight in your life, you didn't know what to do
>Your body reacts on its own though
>Adrenaline and fear fuel your movements as you swiftly draw your knife
>It was nothing big, a 4 inch blade you used for marking trees or cutting bits of nylon on the straps of your cameras
>Go down fighting at least
>It lunges at you and you try to jump away, but one of those mighty arms gets you
>It grabs you up in a Bear hug, crushing your body like its nothing
>You stab quickly into any part of its body that you can reach
>probably comparable to bee stings honestly, but it didn't stop you
>But you must have annoyed it enough to not want you
>You feel your body go weightless as he hurls you bodily with a pained Howl
>Weightlessness, cold air, then Crushing icy cold water
>It's thrown you into the stream
>The freezing water sucks the air from your lungs as you gasp and get to the surface
>Swimming weakly to the opposite shore gets you a reprieve from the crushing cold of the water
>As you pull yourself out you hear the Bigfoot stomping away 
>you look and see a blood trail in the snow as it leaves
>One problem solved
>But now you were in the middle of the woods, soaked, without your pack OR GPS
>Plus you somehow had to get to the other side of the stream again
>No use in staying here though, you begin heading back down stream, shivering against the cold
>30 minutes of walking, you can feel the water in your clothes freezing
>A blizzard was beginning to kick up as well
>You were going to die
>Lost and alone in the woods
>You collapse against a tree
>Your body stopped shivering a while ago trying to conserve energy
>It's a struggle to stay conscious
>You hear sounds of light footfalls before you pass out
>Honestly if some predator was going to eat you, you were happy to pass out
>Your world goes black, your consciousness fades
>So this is what its like to die

>You feel something fuzzy patting your face
>"I think he's still alive Sis! He must've fallen into the Stream"
>A feminine voice speaks through the abyss of your mind
>"The Idiot! What's he doing out here alone anyway? Come on, let's get him to the cave"
>A second voice cuts though sounding almost identical to the first only a little bit gruffer
>The fuzzy feeling persists and you fight the darkness to open your eyes
>A Snow leopard is rubbing your face with a fuzzy paw
>She has Long white hair, sticking out from under a beanie which her ears poking though
>"Hey there you still with us?" she says, her eyes full of worry
>You look into her eyes, the left one is light blue, the right deep brown
>"Am I d-dead? Are you an-n-n angel?"
>She smiles showing her front fangs a bit
>"Aww the flatterer, regains consciousness and the first thing he does is compliment me"
>Another snow leopard comes into view, holding a bolt action rifle of some sort
>"whatever Sasha, The blizzard is about to hit, grab him and lets go"
>"Can you walk?" the First Snow leopard, Sasha says
>You attempt to move
>"I c-c-can't feel my body, I'm sorry"
>Sasha smiles a sad smile
>"Oh you poor thing, you're lucky we found you, I'll get you up"
>you cant feel anything when she picks you up and throws you over her shoulders in a firemans carry
>"Whats your name? why are you out here alone, Stay Awake!"
>You struggle to stay awake
>She gives you a gentle shake
>"Come on talk to me!"
>"Uh, my name is A-anon, I was out here looking for B-bigfoot when I found one and it attacked me"
>You hear the other snow leopard Snort back a laugh
>"Seriously you were looking for Bigfoot? that's just a legend"
>Sasha ignores her sisters comments
>"Attacked you? Where?"
>"U-ups-stream"
>They walk up the stream banks following your footsteps
>Sasha talks to you the whole time
>She and her twin sister, Trish, are homesteaders
>They're on a hunting trip to try and get meat before the heavy part of winter hits
>"We actually found you by accident! Trish said she head something fall and it turned out to be you, she's got great hearing"
>You notice They're walking past where your encounter with Bigfoot happened, the snow is still stained slightly even with the new layer covering it
>"T-there! T-thats w-where it attacked me!" you stammer out weakly
>Trish and Sasha look over to the far bank
>"I'll check it out"
>Trish leans her rifle against a tree and takes a running leap
>She lands gracefully on rock sticking out of the water before making a second leap
>You see her shuffling around in the the snow before picking up your knife
>She sniffs the knife and looks at the blood
>"Well you fought something, I don't recognize the smell but it was something" she calls
>She bounds back over easily
>Felines and their crazy acrobatics
>"Come on, the cave isn't far! We gotta get you warmed up"
>Trish pick back up her rifle and brushes a bit of snow off it with a fuzzy paw
>"I Don't know what attacked you Anon but those footprints..." 
>Trish looks concerned, her ears folded back
>"lets hurry"
>The duo move double-time for about 45 minutes
>You're amazed at Sasha ability to carry you for some long
>When you voice this she laughs
>"You don't weigh anything compared to the logs and stuff I move on the homestead!"
>Before long, a cave appears through the now densely falling snow
>This blizzard was bad to say the least
>They head inside, Sasha takes extra care to duck so you don't hit the entrance
>"I'll Light a fire, Sasha, Get our guest out of his wet clothes" Trish says setting down her rifle
>Sasha sets you down on a stump of a tree next to a large fire pit
>She peels your jacket and shirt off with ease before pausing
>"Sorry anon, but I need to take it ALL off"
>You use what little energy you have to nod 
>"Ok Anon" she says with a smile
>Gently and methodically she removes your boots, socks , snow-pants and jeans
>Trish is piling wood into the firepit and stacking it neatly the whole time
>"Last bit, then I'll wrap you in a blanket ok?"
>Her paws grip your boxers
>You nod once more and she slides them off you, averting her eyes from your nethers
>A large blanket is then wrapped around you
>You hear the clicking of flint and tinder then the crackle of fire
>Sasha lifts you and sets you next to the fire
>"Warm up a bit sweetie, we'll get some food and warm drinks ready"
>The warm crackle of the fire and the blanket feels amazing compared to the freezing outdoors
>You hear the twins getting stuff ready
>The clinking of a pan, the shuffling of fabric
>Sasha appears once more with a large steel table that she sets over the fire, 
>Trish begins putting chunks of meat and a kettle on it
>They then disappear behind you again 
>You stare into the fire as feeling returns to your arms and legs
>You hear more shuffling fabric then they both walk back into view, totally nude
>"Whoa hey! You're naked!" You cry out as you cover your eyes with the blanket
>"Pssh what a prude, we needed to get out of our wet clothes too! Plus we gotta let our fur Dry, so don't worry Anon" Trish chides you
>"We promise it's ok to look Anon, just try not to Stare ok?" Sasha says more reassuring than her sister
>you bring the blanket down and look the two over
>Sasha and Trish are about 6'2 and both have gorgeous white hair that trail down their backs but that's where the similarity ends
>Trish is leaner, and has a more athletic looking body, like that of a runner, her movements graceful
>Sasha is a bit thicker, carrying more muscle and looking more like someone not who worked out at a gym but had the fat and strength of a professional powerlifter
>Even their eyes were opposite while Sasha had a left blue eye, Trish's was brown, and while Trish's right eye was Blue, Sasha's was brown
>They sat on either side of you, Trish poking at the mystery meat while Sasha pours a cup of whatever is in the kettle
>"Drink this, It'll warm you up"
>"Thanks" you say as you extend your hand
>She hands a steaming mugs to you, which you sniff then sip
>The warm beverage tastes like mint and warms your insides
>"What are you cooking? It smells good Trish" 
>"Wolf meat, Sasha seasoned some up before we left the homestead"
>You watch intently as she pokes the meat with a fork
>"It'll be done soon, then we should turn in for the night"
>You nod before a thought pops into your head
>"Uh I don't have a sleeping bag or anything"
>Sasha smiles a bit, "You silly human, you're going to have to cuddle up with us, you don't have fur!
>Trish nods as her twin talks
>"We can't save you, only to have you freeze to death in your sleep" 
>You look back and forth between them
>do you really get to spend a night in a cave with two gorgeous ladies?
>Did whatever deity that was out there decide to fuck you over THEN bless you?
>You weren't going to complain
>Maybes its equivalent exchange or something
>Trish begins doling out the meat and Sasha hums happily while looking out the cave mouth into the blizzard
>"Eat up Anon!" Trish says with a smile
>This snaps Sasha back into the cave "We don't get company often Anon, it's good to have someone to talk to other than Trish"
>Trish frowns but ignores the comment
>"So tell us the whole story of why you're out here, I Know you said you were hunting bigfoot, but tell us why!"
>You take a bite out of your food 
>God dam was it tasty and warmed you up even more
>As you eat you explain everything to them
>How you were disgraced for believing in bigfoot and how you sold your house to fund your research
>You told them everything up to the point they found you
>Sasha looks a bit sad 
>"Wow that's a lot of dedication to something you didn't even know as real"
>You nod as you finish your food
>"Thanks for the meal and for listening"
>Sasha smiles and takes your plate, Trish yawns and stretches, pushing her orange sized breasts forward
>Right they are still naked
>"Come on lets all get to bed, hopefully we aren't snowed in tomorrow" Trish says rubbing her paws across her muzzle 
>You stand and stretch yourself
>Sasha grabs your hand in her fluffy paw and leads you to a small area on the other side of the fire where several animal pelts line the floor of the cave
>Gently she guides you onto them before grabbing a few more blankets
>She throws them over you then gets under then herself, pressing her furry body against you
>Trish slides in behind you and sandwiches you between them
>"Lay on your side Anon, it'll be easier for us to keep you warm" Sasha half purrs half yawns
>You turn onto your side and Sasha scooches back into you while Trish slides closer, you feel her nipples rubbing against your back softly
>Guess you get to be the middle spoon in this drawer
>Sasha reaches back and grabs your hand, interlocking her padded fingers with your, before pulling it around her, your hand locked in her paw
>Trish reaches around you, and interlocks her paw with your left hand so her fuzzy arm is around you
>Both their tails wrap around your legs and they start purring loudly
>You fall asleep wrapped in fuzzy arms and tails to the sound of purring

>Gentle crackling of the fire wakes you and sunlight pours through the still falling snow into the cave
>The opening must face eastward
>Sasha Stirs against you, still purring
>Trish yawns loudly which in turn fully wakes Sasha, who also yawns
>"Mmpf Morning Trish, Morning Anon"
>She shift a bit then stops
>"Oooo I see someone is happy to see me"
>Your morning wood was pressed against Sasha's Thick thighs

>"But being close to a male is making it come a little earlier" She whispers into your ear before nibbling your neck softly
>You blink a few times
>"Plus knowing you fought off a predator of some sort got us riled up. We hoped you would try to take us last night!"
>Sasha releases your member from her fuzzy thighs then turns around on the pelts to face you
>"We Realllllly got lucky to find you Anon, usually we have to deal with our heats by ourselves"
>Trish grips your shoulder and rolls you onto your back 
>Both Girls pull themselves closer to you
