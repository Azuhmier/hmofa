>With a resigned sigh, you watch the last few rays of light fade from your now-dead flashlight.
>Great.
>You WERE enjoying a nice walk in the woods, when you got momentarily distracted... and subsequently got lost.
>Now you've been wandering for hours, unable to find a path out of the forest.
>It's been dark for a while now, and you now have no way to see where you're going.
>...it's gonna be a long night, isn't it.
>Cursing your rotten luck and the very real possibility of your death, you fumble around till you find a stump to sit on.
>Once you take your seat, you sigh again and look around for anything that could help.
>Of course, with it being a new moon, it's too dark to see anything remotely helpful.  Or anything at all, really.
>...wait.
>A faint red light catches your eye.
>It seems to dance through the trees almost... playfully.
>...could it be taillights of a passing car?  Or maybe a fellow hiker with a colored flashlight?
>Whatever it is, you feel oddly drawn to it, as if the glow were beckoning for you.
>Whatever, might as well go for it.  Beats sitting on a moldy stump and waiting for Death to come along.
>You begin trudging through the woods, following the bobbing red light.
>Eventually, you reach a clearing, and pick up your pace.  The light also seems to speed up.
>The wind blows through the trees loudly, with the leaves rustling in such a way it almost sounds like... snickering.
>You continue to run after the glow...
>And run headfirst into a branch, knocking yourself unconscious.

>You awaken with a throbbing headache.
>It's still dark out, so it can't have been long since you ran into that limb.
>Running your bruised head, you slowly scan your surroundings, thankful for the bright red light illuminating the clearing.
>Wait a minute.
>You blink a few times as what you're seeing sinks in.  You scream in terror, and suddenly find some sort of soft cloth clapped over your mouth.
>Another bit of cloth is placed over your eyes, and you feel someone lift you bodily.
>Whoever it is, they don't miss a step as they carry you off.  To where, you have no clue.
>...are they... singing?  Sure enough, whoever is carrying you is singing a slow, haunting tune as they walk.  The song seems to have no actual words, but it carries a sufficiently ominous tone to send a chill down your spine.
>The voice is rather deep, but... is also clearly female.
>Eventually, your captor stops walking and crooning, then drops you roughly into what feels like a rusty metal chair.
>The cloths remain firmly over your mouth and eyes, and the contralto voice speaks again.  Her tone is dark, but strangely melodic.
>"I'm going to take my hand away now.  If you scream, it'll be the last sound you make, got that, sweetie?"
>You nod hesitantly, and your antagonist allows you to see and speak.
>"W-where am I?  Who are y-"
>You trail off as you take a look at the woman before you, illuminated in blood red light.

>You're at first tempted to say she's covered in fur, but it's apparent that she actually seems to be comprised of cloth roughly sewn together.
>Two massive, gently wobbling breasts hang right above you, with... buttons in place of nipples?  Rips across these impressive mounds let handfuls of cotton peek out, stretching thick black stitching to its absolute limit.
>Below the chest is a somewhat plush midsection, reminiscent of a slightly overstuffed doll.  Again, wads of cotton peek through busted seams.  Long rips decorate the strange being's stomach like scars.
>Further down are long, shapely legs offset by wide hips.  These legs don't actually seem to bend naturally, and her feet seem to hover just above the floor, hanging limply from the ankles.
>A tail hangs behind her, apparently dead and useless.
>Suddenly, a soft hand is placed beneath your chin.  With alarming strength, the woman forces you to look up.  You can't help but notice a bit of fluff leak from her wrist as she does so.
>Her face is very reminiscent of a fox, though in an obviously exaggerated, toylike fashion.  She smiles with concerningly sharp teeth, her red eyes gleaming in the matching light...
>Which dangles in front of her face on a sort of antenna, revealing it to be what seems to be a plastic jewel with an LED inside.
>The woman smiles down at you menacingly, her many fangs glinting hysterically in the light.
>She wordlessly tugs at a loose black string hanging from her neck, then goes back to simply staring at you, crimson eyes glimmering.

>You can't help but notice how soft her hand is.  You suppose that's due to it being little more than a glove stuffed with cotton, essentially.  Despite that, there's a very real strength holding your chin up.
>She chuckles, a sound that carries around the small room you seem to be in as if there were a whole chorus of laughing women with you.
>"Well?  Are you speechless?"
>"...who are you?"
>She chuckles again, her silvery laugh tickling your ears.
>"Silly human. What does that matter?  What's important is that you are my entertainment for tonight."
>"W-what?"
>She rolls her eyes.
>"Please.  I have literal cotton for brains and I know what I mean.  You're a grown man, you know good and well what I mean."
>"..."
>She stares incredulously as you rub the newly-formed knot on your forehead.
>"My goodness, you're dense.  Must I spell everything out for you, human?  I crave passion.  I burn for the feeling of a man inside me.  To be blunt: I need a good fuck."
>Her voice loses its quiet, melodic quality in favor of a more matter of fact tone.
>"Seeing as you are the only male stupid enough to wander the woods alone on the night of a new moon... you have been granted the privilege of fulfilling my needs.  You may thank me when your work is done."
>You sweat a bit at the sight of her fangs again glinting.
>"W-what if I say no?"
>"If you refuse... I suppose I'll seek a replacement male.  After, of course, I sink my teeth into your neck."

>...your neck.  That's it!
>Before she can react, you reach up and grab that loose thread around her throats and yank with all your might.
>She gasps as the stitching unravels...
>And you gasp when her head falls off entirely, with it landing square in your lap.
>The red light flickers momentarily, then shines steady again as she smiles once more.
>"Hmhmhm.  You'll have to try harder than that, sweetie.  You've only succeeded in giving me another tear to patch later.  Horrid wretch.  I'll have to teach you a lesson, then."
>Her body autonomously lifts her head with one hand...
>And yanks your pants down with the other.
>Once you're fully exposed, she places her head back in your lap.
>With a wink and a predatory smile, she extends a forked tongue and wraps it around your dick.
>The feeling is amazingly intense, only exacerbated by her hot breath.  Once she gets a taste for you, her head practically leaps into position, taking the full length of you into her mouth.
>The feeling is frankly bizarre.  Her tongue and teeth certainly feel natural, but the rest of her mouth is clearly cloth and cotton.
>With dexterity that suggests this is not at all new to her, your captor's head begins sucking on you and wrapping her tongue around your rod.
>It's not long before she coaxes a full erection out of you, to her apparent delight.
>Her body, originally hanging limp, silently contorts about before plunging a cloth finger into an equally-plush slit, apparently priming herself for what comes next...
>As you watch her bizarre bodiless blowjob, something catches your eye...
>You can see the tip of your member emerging from the ragged cotton leaking from where her head originally met her neck.
>You're going all the way through her mouth.
>For some reason, this gets you even more riled up, enough to blow a load all over her eagerly awaiting body.

>The stuffed woman's head backs off of your still-twitching length, tutting disapprovingly.
>"Human.  Do you have any clue how hard it is to get that sort of stain out of cloth?  Careless oaf!  Seems that my punishment was not enough.  I'll have to get more... thorough~"
>Her body grabs her head and places it back atop her neck.  She pulls a needle from her tail, then roughly sews her throat back together.  As soon as she's back in one piece, she immediately turns 180 degrees and falls limply into your lap.
>Her literally plush ass rests atop your crotch, with your rod already attempting to ready itself for another round.
>"Now then.  To minimize further staining of my coat... you are not allowed to finish anywhere other than inside me.  Understood?"
>Before you answer, she raises up and practically slams herself down on your dick, with you sliding into her cloth slit.  She gasps and lets out a throaty moan.
>"Mmmm~ Perfect fit."
>She looks over her shoulder at you... then a heart-stopping RRRRIP echoes through the room as she tears the stitching around her throat, letting her head rotate all the way towards you.
>Now staring directly into your eyes, she smiles hungrily.
>"Well?  Get to work."

>You don't have to be told twice.  You reach up and attempt to find something to hold, never breaking eye contact...
>And you eventually feel your hands sink into two rips in her sides.  She narrows her crimson eyes and lets her tongue flop out.
>"Oooh... ripping my cloth?  How... kinky~"
>Ignoring the loud tearing of her cloth, you begin relentlessly thrusting into your partner, with her chuckling and moaning in ecstasy.
>The light dangling from her head glows brighter and brighter as she sinks more and more into pleasure.
>Her oddly melodious voice continues to encourage your pounding.
>"That's it, human~ Ravage me.  Give in to your primal urges and fill me with your seed!"
>You pick up your pace, pulling larger and larger holes in the bizarre doll's sides as she loses all composure, dissolving into wordless moans and cooing.
>Eventually, you reach your second climax, coating the cloth being's insides with a hot load.
>With a loud scream of joy, she collapses forward and off of you, with your still-gripping hands tearing off bolts of fabric as she falls.

>You pant from exertion, then slowly stand up, looming over your bizarre partner as she lays on the floor in a heap.
>Handfuls of cotton and torn fabric litter the floor.  Her head lays a few feet from her body, with her tongue again hanging from her mouth as she pants loudly.
>Her light glows like a crimson sun, and her eyes and fangs glimmer in the illumination.
>She looks up at you with a breathless chuckle.
>"L... look what you've done to me, you stud.  You've torn me to shreds in the throes of passion.  H-ha... it's going to take a while to fix all these holes... i-in the meantime..."
>Her body stands up, staggering, and collapses on you in a clumsy embrace.
>"Y-you will stay here with me... so I may punish your vandalism, thoughtless worm."
>Her body sinks down limply, her breasts coincidentally dragging across your groin.
>She winks and smiles as you catch her falling form and hug it close.
>"H-ha... thank you, human."
>You say nothing, but grab a handful of her plush rump, prompting more panting and moaning from her.
>"Y'know what?  You could get used to this.
