Super Grooming [Jackal; Cleaning, "Reverse" Transformation]: Heroes who save the day still have to wash themselves, or at least have a partner like Anon to help them out.

>Anon and Hilde
>Inseparable crime-fighting tag team
>You’re the strategist, the rational thinker, and the diplomat
>Not saying your better half isn’t smart or crafty, but she’s more than qualified to be the “brawn” of the duo
>In your downtime and pre-conflict investigation, Hilde’s a spunky, sarcastic jackal
>When fighting is inevitable (and she’ll always assume it is), the near-invulnerable juggernaut of a roid monster comes out
>She’s already a fairly tall and brawny anthro when relaxed, but ”Amazonian” doesn’t even begin to describe her alter ego
>And yet, you’re the only one who tempers the beast within her, and she does all she can to make sure no harm ever comes to you
>While you rarely return from a mission with more than a few scratches, Hilde is a walking trophy display for her conquests
>Black fur covered in shrapnel, alien splatter, still-smoldering debris, and sometimes happily dragging an appendage with her
>With the remnants of battle stuck in her fur and nostrils, she’s too inundated to revert back to normal
>So as one-half partner and one-half handler, it’s up to you to clean her up

>When you return to your modest “lair”, Hilde is already engaged in a game of tag with you
>Tearing through the place and dancing out of your reach
>You try to catch her, but you’re also wary of engaging her
>If her playful swipes don’t keep you at bay, her pelt full of sharp junk and toxic refuse usually does
>Eventually she exposes her underbelly (likely to taunt you) and you tackle her
>You could never overpower her yourself, but she doubles over and pulls you into her chest
>The two of you topple over, and Hilde splays her limbs and flops her tongue out
>Playing dead, defeated by Anon
>You try to drag the massive jackal by her foot, but make little progress
>She has to discreetly push herself along the floor to help you out
>If she hasn’t been rolling around in something radioactive, you can usually skip the preliminary soak
>Today, you’d rather not stick your face on some parts of her
>You take Hilde to a washroom with a large drain in the center
>You grab a hose and begin to spray her down
>There’s still a clever mind under all that mass, and she sidesteps the jet
>Luckily she doesn’t try too hard today, letting the deluge hit her head on after a few moments
>”WARRGARBLGARBL”
>Like a flowing stream over ice, you can see the subtle change in her size
>The jackal shrinks a small amount as the rage dissipates
>She shakes the water off, along with any loose clutter
>”Mmmm...much...better....”
>You have to dry her off a bit before trying to comb out the mats, snags, and the more stubborn attachments
>Like bullets that indent the skin but never quite break the surface
>Fortunately, her larger scale makes her fur thinner and easier to pluck the ballistics from her
>Each one you pick out is like taking away some of her resolve
>”Missed a spot,” Hilde grunts as she keeps backing into you
>You wield the brush and comb next
>Her body roils with the motions of your grooming
>Though still a good two heads taller, the jackal is a much more manageable height at this point
>She even lets you take her by the paw to your oversized shower
>Now comes her favorite part
>Her expandable harness has enough slack to unbuckle, and where was once a stretched torso of muscle now holds two much more defined, weighty breasts
>You lather shampoo all over her naked form, and she twists and bends to make sure you cover EVERYTHING
>Like any famous superhero duo, the two of you began your careers with a mutual sense of professionalism
>And like many of said duos, a certain level of romance budded between you
>Still, you know when to rein it in and when to enjoy her company
>Sometimes you join her in the buff, and sometimes you keep your shorts on
>The latter is often worse, as Hilde will snap your waistband repeatedly until you give in
>It’s almost not even for the sexual aspect with her
>She just likes sharing the moment with you
>Soaping her up gets easier as the cascades wash over you, and soon you don’t have to reach up so far to clean her
>She even joins in on rubbing the suds off her body
>Her increasingly shapely, soft body
>”Don’t use too much of that fragrant stuff,” Hilde says with much more eloquence. “I want you to still smell my natural scent.”
>Her dampness is utterly adorable when you finally shut the water off
>You didn’t wash out her mischievousness though, and you’re in a tug of war with the towel
>Still an extremely one-sided contest, but as you let go she wraps herself up in it
>You use her tangled state to grab the hair dryer
>She’s not really drying herself so much as trying to run it along her curves seductively, making the scene even more arousing while the air blows her fur around
>The jackal is back to her “regular” size, wrapping the towel around her ears and swaying out of the bathroom with nothing else
>By this time the two of you are getting pretty hungry
>If you have the foresight to pop in a meal before starting the whole process (and Hilde’s shenanigans don’t make you miss the timer) you’ll try to whip something up
>But most of the time, it’s just good ol’ takeout
>Meals can still be a stressful time for you
>If you don’t get all of the beast out of her, her ravenous appetite might make her a sloppy eater and ruin all the day’s work
>And sometimes the delivery boy is actually a villain’s henchman, and she’s instantly back to her wild mode
>Tonight she’s as classy as a naked jackal can be, slurping up noodles with her eyes only on you

>It’s the end of the day, and you’re wiped out
>Fighting evil is one thing, and on top of it you have to wrestle with an even more formidable force
>You lie on the bed absolutely spent
>You have just enough energy to turn your head and see Hilde leading against the doorway
>The jackal saunters over to you and slips under the covers
>The two of you are always “on call”, and you never know when the call to justice will have to interrupt an intimate moment
>That’s why you make the most out of every minute of peace together
>She curls up against your body, resting her head on your chest and folding her legs over yours
>In this position, you seem like the bigger one
>”You did a great job today, as usual,” she purrs, nuzzling her flawless coat against you
>Hilde will often poke fun at your combat prowess compared to her own, but she never jokes about your ability to make her feel perfect
>It isn’t just the grooming that does it, either
>No matter how many threats she protects you from, you are always the hero to her
>And it makes you all the more motivated to protect the safety she knows you can always give her
