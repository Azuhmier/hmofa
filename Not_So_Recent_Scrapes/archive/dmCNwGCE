>Jesus, it's been quite the busy day. 
>With your wife being constantly called away to work, and you being an on-call assistant at the local magic college, the house has been feeling pretty empty as of late. 
>Heck, even your two kids haven't really been around all that much now that they're getting older. 
>Your oldest joining the military and the other finishing up his schooling in computer science…
>You've been by yourself for most of the past month, actually. 
>But all that is going to change tonight.
>You've been using the entire day to make your wife’s evening off special. She'll be a tired little kitty, but she also deserves to be pampered.
>A familiar ringing catches your attention; you smile as you hear the oh-so-familiar jingling of her tail bells. 
>Before you know it, Star is already at the front door. You open it and step aside to let her through. She smiles gently at you as she enters.
>"G-good evening, honey. How was y-your day at work…?"
>The bags under her eyes and her laid-back ears show that she's absolutely exhausted. You're not going to bore her to sleep with long talks about your day. 
>"It was okay, kitty-cat. Come on and sit down, I know you're tired. You must have had a long day."
>As your wife plods over to the kitchen, you take in her form as you listen to her vent. 
>They say that with age comes grace, and they weren't kidding. It's been over twenty years since you married Stargazer and she's still just as lovely as the day you exchanged vows. 
>"Oh. My. Gosh. Davie, you have no idea… I don't know w-whether I should hit some of my patients over the head with my b-broomstick or j-just hop on it and drive into a brick wall...! They either c-complain about the medicine I give them, say that I'm wrong and that they should just b-buy another hex from Thrif, threaten t-to go to Carrie, or just whine and be a n-nuisance in general…”
>You sigh sympathetically and wrap her up from behind. 
>After you got married and decided to have kids, your wife went through some… drastic changes to say the least. Thanks to longtime exposure to healing magics and the like, she grew about four feet, but kept a good bit of her roundness.
>She pretty much puts some "mom bods" to shame with how she fits in those beautifully tight fitting jeans. 
>You're pretty sure you heard one of your students muttering something about her being a "thick mommy" in the hallways… not that you really took offense. It's a pretty damn accurate description.
>Even now, you found it difficult not to grope at her luxurious curves, just begging to spill out of her casualwear.
>"So, uh, Dave, sweetie. Wh-what's for dinner?"
>You reach up to scratch behind her ears. 
>"Your favorite: fresh halibut."
>Her yellow eyes glow brightly with the very mentioning of the delicious fish. 
>”Oooh, that's exactly w-what I needed after a long day. Thank you, honey~”
>”Anything for my shining Star. I wanted to make this evening allll about you, hun. You've been working so hard; you deserve it.”
>Your wife purrs as she wraps her arms around you.
>”Thank you so much, Davie. L-love you.”
>”Love you too, Star. Now, c’mon; let's eat while it's hot.”
>You enjoy most of the meal in relative silence. You try to split the food as evenly as possible. You know she's been all over town, so she's probably more hungry than she'd like to admit. 
>As you finish cleaning your plate of the last morsels of fish, your wife speaks up. 
>"W-where are the kids?"
>You quietly place both you and Star's dirty dishes and silverware in the washer and grab her hand. 
>Without a word you lead her down the hall and into your bedroom. 
>As it slowly dawns on her, you begin to slowly slip off her black robe. 
>"Gone for the night. Stan's with his army buddies and Brandon's with a few guys studying. I made sure we'd be… alone for the night."
>You hear her breath hitch slightly as her black silk robe soundlessly falls to the floor. 
>You gently nip at her fluffy nape and explore her curvaceous body with curious hands. 
>”I wanted to make… tonight EXTRA SPECIAL. A night of relaxation. And love. Something that you deserve after being busy for so long… It's been a little while since the both of us… with the kids and all… B-but they're almost out of the house…"
>You swallow a small lump in your throat and continue.
>"You've been the shining star in my life. You've given us two beautiful boys. Boys who are now men ready to take on the world…."
>You hear her sniffle once or twice as you hold her against you as tight as you can.
>"And there's no way I can ever thank you enough for that… But I can at least try to show you… H-how much I love you."
>Stargazer begins to purr loudly as she turns around, still in your grasp. She looks you straight in the eyes and tearfully replies. 
>"D-D-David. You've given me so much confidence over these years. I l-love you more than anything in the world…"
>Before you know it, her lips are locked with yours as your mind begins to race. 
>Both of your hands explore each other's bodies as the room heats up. 
>You pull away slightly as she mewls. 
>"Hold on, babe. I have one more little surprise, Star…"
>You motion to the path of rose petals you've lain on the carpet. Her eyes follow them, then light up as she sees that they lead directly to the master bathroom. 
>As she opens the door, she lets out a small gasp. 
>The jacuzzi tub is filled with hot water, a padded mat is on the tiled floor, and scented candles burn softly in the open window. 
>”Remember our first time? At the spa? I wanted to recreate that spa day, just for you. I even went and asked EXACTLY what kind of candles and bath add-ins they use, so it'd be authentic. Only the best for you.”
>Your wife doesn't say a word at first as she quickly removes her purple bra and panties and lays on the padded floor. 
>"If you really want to recreate that day…"
>She looks back at you with hunger in her eyes. Her stutter seems to melt away as she exercises the confidence she's built up over the course of your marriage.
>”Then be a good boy and eat my ass.”
>You throw any sort of sentiment to the wind and literally jump down onto her legs and ass. Her plump form gives way as you massage her legs and butt vigorously. 
>Stargazer shudders with pleasure as you paint her pristine back hole with your saliva. 
>"Oh God, Dave… It's been so long… TOO LONG… You've got a lot of time to make up for…"
>Needing no other excuse, you dive in and eat her out like it's going to be your last meal. A puddle of her love juices quickly accumulates on the pad, which you eagerly lap up. You shove your head between her thick cheeks and listen to her increasingly loud moans echo in the bathroom. 
>After a few minutes she rolls over onto her back and looks down at you. Her large chest rising and falling rapidly. 
>"If I didn't know any better, I'd think you're into this as much as I am."
>A quick swipe of your tongue is your only answer as you continue your oral onslaught on your pussy's pussy. You continue to pleasure your wife with shapes, sentences, and whatever you can think of before you feel like your tongue is gonna fall off. 
>After what feels like hours, you feel Star's legs wrap around your head and drive your face flush with kitty coochie. 
>"Oh God, Dave!"
>Feline femcum sprays you down, covering you with the tasty liquid. 
>Holy shit, you almost forgot she could do that…
>"That's enough foreplay, Davie… Now give me that DICK."
>Geez. She must be going into heat. You hope you can keep up with her. 
>After a few seconds of calculating, she grabs a hold of your member and gently spears herself with it…
>...and HOLY SHIT. YUP. SHE'S IN HEAT ALRIGHTY. 
>Her tight hole greedily milks you for your essence.
>It's almost like it has a mind of its own, begging for your release. 
>You unconsciously begin to thrust. Water splashes all around you and Star begins to moan loudly once again. 
>"Oh yes, Davie! Yes! I swear, I wouldn't even be mad if you put another kitten in me…"
>challenge_accepted.webm
>Through your own huffing and puffing you speed up. 
>This isn't making love any more. This is genuine fucking. 
>Water continues to slosh around you and onto the bathroom floor as you begin to suck wildly on one of her huge tits. 
>But before you can ask your wife to cast the "special spell", you hear a certain voice that makes your blood run cold.
>The next door neighbors'...
>"Holy shit, babe! They're really going at it! My God, those knockers put yours to shame darling! Boy I'd pay some good money to…."
>"W-wow… Even after all these years they still are going at it like a couple of teenagers… I wish we had a nice humie to share between the two of us, Claire…"
>You look and Star look up to see your neighbors peeking through the open window. 
>Shortly after you and your wife tied the knot, your old professor, Cordyllia, worked up the nerve to propose to her girlfriend of several years, Clarissa. Once those two got hitched, it wasn't long before they ended up moving right next door to you and Star.
>Ordinarily, this wouldn't be a problem… but the bee and spider have always been fairly lewd, and it seems that even the passage of 20-odd years hasn't dulled their libido.
>Almost makes you miss having the pun-loving, but harmless, Marris living beside you…
>Star smiles at the intruding bugs, addressing them directly.
>"Evening, ladies. I probably am the reason you're both here. I wasn't exactly quiet…”
>.........
>Neither you nor your neighbors utter a word as Stargazer slowly continues. 
>"If you're looking for a cute human to split for the night… There's plenty of room on the bed…"
>You snap your head around and see Star with wide eyes as she keeps eye contact with your Otherworldly neighbors.
>I'm sure he has enough energy for a few rounds… Isn't that right, Davie~?"
