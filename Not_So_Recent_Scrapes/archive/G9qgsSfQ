New Anon in Town [Canine; 1st Person Point of View, New Guy]; When everyone around town is so happy and nice, how is a dog girl supposed to get a cool guy like Anon?

>Just another day of being the “tough bitch” in town
>Every other fur and feather is so content with living out their assigned roles day after day
>I didn’t use to be the grump, the sourpuss, the loner
>But after a few bad days it became my “theme”, and even though I’m so testy in their eyes they act like it’s just a quaint little personality trait of mine
>Now I can’t get rid of it even if I tried
>It makes finding a mate around here pretty fucking hard as well
>The other dogs are slobbering meatheads, and I don’t roll over just because they beg
>The bears LOOK like they know a good time, but they’re just too soft for someone like me
>The rabbits aren’t bad, if you’re into sissy little girlyboys
>Hell, I’d play for the other team if most of the girls weren’t already paired off with their own type
>So here I am, sulking in the shadows as the rest of the town is getting ready to welcome some new resident
>”Anon”, he goes by
>Gee, wonder what kind of walking character trope he’s going to b-
>Holy shit, is that a human?
>I thought humans were just some stupid marketing icons
>Like, something advertisers made up because they’re so “neutral” looking for products
>And yet here he is, walking around all furless and naive
>There aren’t many things I need to ask for around here; either nobody stops me from taking something, or they’re such sickeningly sweet neighbors they just hand it over
>But as this Anon guy is swamped by all the others waiting to greet him, I feel something I haven’t felt in a long time
>Want
>I want HIM

>He’s visited at his remote little house for hours, well into the evening
>It’s not easy waiting for all the others to leave him alone, but if I’m going to do this I don’t want to be interrupted
>I also want to be the last one he thinks about before he goes to sleep
>Luckily he’s still awake when I rap on his door
>Dude barely comes up to my chest
>I make sure he gets a good look at it first
>Before I can introduce myself, he says my name
>…How the hell?
>Apparently all the others around town have been talking shit about me already
>Needless to say, I’m pretty damn livid right now
>If those gossiping busybodies already ruined this for me…
>Anon doesn’t seem to know any better
>He just heard about me just like any other fur around town, and he probably thinks I won’t bully him if he preemptively tries to be friendly
>Well, BUDDY…
>…It actually kind of works
>I expected him to put up a fight, or show fear, or have him see me with the same stupid whimsy like the rest
>I didn’t think he’d disarm me with kindness
>I’m so dumbfounded by it I barely remember being invited into his home
>Nothing I didn’t expect from a bachelor pad, but it doesn’t look like anyone else in town got as far as me in here yet
>Now I’m sitting on his couch, and he’s spilling his life story
>Where he comes from, why he’s here, what he hopes to accomplish…
>I’m not necessarily tuning him out, but when I hear the word I snap into focus
>”Friend”
>He’s looking to make some friends, and I’m damn well going to be his favorite
>But it’s already getting late, and the poor guy is pretty tired from the trip and from getting bombarded with welcomes all day
>He asks if I‘d want to come back first thing in the morning to hang out some more
>Yeah…sure thing
>I actually find myself heading back to my place pretty briskly
>Probably a good thing, because everything seems to be getting pretty foggy out all of the sudden
>I head inside and see that familiar bitch in the mirror
>Then I get a good look at my face, and my eyes, and I see why everything was so misty on the way back

>I’m at his door before he’s even fully awake
>Son of a bitch, tail. Stay still!
>He doesn’t look bothered by my early arrival
>Actually looks pretty excited to see me
>I really hope I didn’t mess up and get stuck with some perpetually merry little ditz
>He had the whole town come to him yesterday, so now he wants to see the rest of it for himself
>Fine, whatever
>I’m easily the best guide he’s going to get anyway, seeing as how I know all the paths and back alleys from avoiding those grinning dimwits every day
>We go to the shops, the restaurants, the meeting places
>He’s keen on mingling with the community, which is something I can’t say I’ve wanted much from these people
>It’s kind of endearing for him, I guess
>He’s a lot more personable than I am, and maybe I can actually stand to be around this place with him at my side
>Just wish he’d hurry up so we can be alone together again
>…Man, I’m terrible
>I feel like a spoiled pup wanting him all for myself, and all he wants is just to belong here
>He’s made more progress getting through to these people already then I ever could in years

>He’s had a pretty long day, and by the evening he’s ready to settle in
>I would have thought he’d be sick of me tagging along, but he’s full of surprises
>Anon seriously wants me back into his home for a little while
>Alright, a second chance
>Don’t fuck this up!
>He’s hospitable enough, though he seems just as nervous to be here as I am
>I mean, not that I’m nervous around him
>How did I even get to the couch again!?
>We’re just chilling together, but this time it’s me who’s acting like an open book
>I tell him about my part in the town’s little ecosystem
>How I’m seen as the designated grouch
>How I’m probably invited to all the gatherings out of obligation instead of genuine companionship
>How I'm so fucking lonely every single day…
>There it is, girl. You’ve said too much to this guy you barely know
>I’m sure it would feel good to finally get this all off my chest if I weren’t spending all my energy to not break down in front of him
>My throat burns too much from holding it all in to say anything
>And he’s just sitting there staring at me with pity
>Do something!
>And he does; just gets right to the point and pulls me in for a hug
>Even though I dwarf the guy, I feel so small in his arms
>I love how smooth he is, and how it feels to have his fingers comb through my fur
>I dreaded this was going to be my breaking point, but everything about his company puts me at ease
>I don’t need some kind of easy lay or piece of meat to make me happy here
>I’d be fine just like this for as long as I can
>He practically knows my whole history by this point, but he has none of the judgment or resentment I have for myself
>I don't deserve a guy like this
>But even when I try to pull away he just keeps holding on, sapping my resolve until I’m all but curled up into his chest
>He’s got the magic touch, this one
>Goddammit tail, we’re having a moment! 

>Boy have I gotten to be a smug bitch
>Anon and I go pretty much everywhere together
>He’s got to be some kind of oddity, tolerating a dog like me
>Not just tolerating, but borderline infatuated
>I don’t plan on being modest about my good fortune, either
>All the other furs and feathers around town are shocked by the two of us being a pair
>Not to mention being blown away seeing me not be such a downer anymore
>Plus, I’m not the only one who changed a bit
>I managed to make a dent in their cheery little facades, showing hints of jealousy in their goofy eyes
>I absolutely relish it
>But Anon’s too cool a guy for that kind of pettiness, and I feel lucky to have him as my better half
>He’s barely been here for long and he already made me the happiest girl out there
>Now, this town doesn’t seem so bad
>It helps that it feels like I have a fresh start here
>A new lease on life
>And I want Anon to be in it forever
