**SCP-682 ('Hard-to-Destroy Reptile' [[SCP link](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-682)])**
\*(From the Original Masterbin:)\*
>Immortal, always pissed, and requiring a daily shower of acid to keep it contained, most wouldn't consider this over-sized reptile to be wife material. Most. Incredibly intelligent and with the ability to shift it's own genetics to become the most optimal hunter, it is sometimes seen as an anthro lizard with tits. It is usually a she. Most of the time, D-Class personnel who meet her never live to talk about it.

>A small, paper-mache piñata that looks something like a pretty pretty pink unicorn. Has an intense fondness for finding small children (12 years and younger) and brutally bludgeoning them to death. Turns people's insides into candy that gives adults heart attacks; kids get turned into more piñata monsters.

**SCP-1471 ('MalO' [[SCP link](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1471)])**
\*(From the Original Masterbin:)\*
>A skull-headed werewolf creature that appears when interacting with an App. Abyssal_Wolf is it's closest looking Art tag on image sites
Canonically, Mal0 is genderless, but most agree on Female, and a few others giving it versions to specify it even further.

*Current 'Version' List:*
* **MalO v1.0-** 'The Original'. Typically female, generally known as 'MaleO' when male. Average humanoid build, shape and height, with black fur.
* **v0.9-** A variant of the original, with pronounced cervine features. Always hermaphroditic, and typically larger than the average human. Build is evenly split between humanoid and animalistic features.
* **v1.1-** A glitch; typically female. Similar to Version 1.0, except for the unique trait of being 'broken'; often manifests as having missing or distorted limbs, static or glitchy texture or appearance, or (rarely) as an unstable or unpredictable personality. May have a tendency to 'fuse' with it's partner while getting intimate.
* **v2.0-** A different take on Version 1.0; often presented as wearing a skull-face mask held in place with string, as opposed to having a skull for a face.
* **'Z0RR.a'-** A Mexican knock-off variant, with heavy vulpine features instead of lupine. Typically female, often dressed in traditional Mexican outfits; facial features vary and/or alternate between 'Dia de Muertos' facepaint and actual painted fox skull.
* **~~v0.¿-~~** ***We don't talk about Tiny Desk MalO.*** It never stops dancing, either.

**SCP-1513 ('Potted Pets' [[SCP Link](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1513)])**
>Flower-like creatures, often in the shape of cats or dogs, that grow from seeds planted in soil like normal plants. If properly nourished, watered and cared for, they tend to be very friendly and loyal pets; if neglected or treated badly, they sprout up feral and wild. Multiple seeds growing in one pot bond together to produce bigger, more intelligent creatures; often the explanation for humanoid versions.

**SCP-2547 ('Dog Days of Summer' [[SCP Link](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2547)])**
>Sometimes-feral, sometimes-humanoid coyote in a leather jacket, sunglasses and wooden crucifix necklace, followed by an entourage of other canines; travels from small town to town, preaching of 'old ways' and 'lost faith', while offering to barter fresh water for goods and services (especially sexual services). Tends to transform townspeople into more of his canine followers. Very definitely the Native American trickster-deity Coyote.
