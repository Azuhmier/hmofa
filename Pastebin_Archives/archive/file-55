How long since you had freedom from this ongoing torment?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Something out there was hunting you with a disturbing amount of enthusiasm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For so long you had dreamt of living off the grid, away from society and all of the constraints that came with it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why pay money to drive a car? Why pay money to OWN a car? Everything cost money and no one was truly free.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After all if you truly you were free, try doing something without money.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That was how you used to think.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before all this, before this terror.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now you know what you were free from; free of fear of what goes bump in the night.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A little over 8 months ago, you bought a plot of land in the middle of the wilderness, away from everything and everyone, and then spent the next 3 months building your log cabin with your own two hands.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You should have listened to your instincts then; the feeling of being watched, the occasional glowing red eyes that disappeared as soon as you tried to focus on them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was just your imagination right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nothing could be lurking in these woods, you had researched them over and over. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nothing here besides deer, squirrels and the occasional timber wolf.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No chupacabra, no anything besides herbivores you could hunt down in peace.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;well, maybe the occasional bear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;god, the warning signs were there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At first it was the feeling of being watched from the shadows.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then, a few empty snare traps, and it just got worse from there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sounds of large wings flapping outside your door, large claw marks on the wood outside your windows, and bits of smoked meat going missing from your store room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The last part hurt the most; you could deal with animals being curious, but when they can open doors to smokehouses and steal the food within, that was a problem.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Especially when the door to your cabin is the same kind of door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now.... Now you were huddled in a far corner of you cabin, wishing you had a gun or anything like that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This thing, or things that had been tormenting you had gotten bolder as time when on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had dismissed the obvious claw marks as deer running past with their antlers, refusing to believe something else was out there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now you were huddled in a corner of your cabin with nothing more than an old knife like that would do something.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your Axe was outside, buried in the wood of a hardy oak stump.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your crossbow was all but useless here in there tight quarters.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you were left with your Hunting knife for defense from whatever what out there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The sounds of claws scraping against wood makes you jump and look towards the offending sound.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s from one of the windows you had put in; after all how do you enjoy a life of living in the wilderness without seeing the wilderness from your indoor comfort?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you look to the window you see them; the pair of glowing red eyes that had always been in the corner of your vision, staring at you hungrily. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You watch, locked onto those glowing beacons of nightmares as pointed fangs form a cruel smile, staring at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This isn&#039;t something you should be going through! This was something children saw in their closets when they were too imaginative!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not here and now to you! </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You point your useless weapon towards the window .</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;G-get o-out of here! I-I&#039;m not afraid to fight you&quot; you stammer out, trembling visibly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To your dismay, the smile widens further, revealing more sharp teeth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Of course you aren&#039;t Anon~&quot; comes a quiet singsong voice softly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You freeze, paralyzed in fear; it can talk? It heard you yelling into the darkened abyss of the woods?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The smile widens revealing more pointed teeth in a sickening, sly grin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And then, like magic, it all disappears.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No more noise, no more voice or glowing eyes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nothing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look out the window, expecting the eyes to be staring back, but see nothing besides inky blankness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No! You weren’t fooled! Not this time!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yes, you&#039;ve been awake for 36 hours; yes, you haven’t left your cabin in all that time either! But this thing was after you! There was no time for sleep!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But maybe while it was gone you could just rest your eyes...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You huddle into a corner of the cabin, you back against a solid wall with the knife clenched in your hands, nothing could sneak up on you like this...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your eyes flutter open.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sunlight pours through your windows onto your face, making you sit up abruptly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You breathe in and out quickly, looking around your cabin from your bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In it was...Nothing; nothing besides your usual gear and appliances. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The stone fireplace with a smoldering ember, the crude chair and table you made.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nothing out of the ordinary.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You breathe in deep and rub your eyes with the heels of your hands, as if hoping to reveal some hidden secret after you pull them away.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Of course, nothing changes when you do; it&#039;s still just you, in your cabin, alone in the woods.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe you shouldn&#039;t have eaten that semi rotten beaver meat you found submerged in the nearby river.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It must be messing with your head...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Taking your time, you get out of bed slowly; stretching and cracking the odd ridgid parts of your body.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A creak from your back, the soft pop from your shoulders, and feeling your fingers pop in sequence as you pulled them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When did you go to bed last night? You can’t quite recall. You remember making dinner from that beaver meat, then....nightmares.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nightmares of teeth and fear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This isn’t the first time this had happened.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So many times you dreamt of eyes and teeth, only to wake up perfectly safe.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Either way, it’s time to get the day started; check the snares, look for any wildlife to eat, and all and all, feel free</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The constraints of modern society were too much... Why pay to live when you had what you needed right here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You eat a bit of your smoked venison for breakfast, then head out into the wilderness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you step out into the marred sunlight, you breathe in deep savoring the freshest of fresh air.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The woods, the forest, the wildlife all thriving around you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was all beautiful and lovely.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The various plants that had been planted grew healthily, letting you know that you would have potatoes, onions and garlic for the upcoming winter months.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nightmares aside, you were happier than you had ever been living within society.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No taxes, nothing other than your own hard work keeping you afloat and alive.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Humanity wasn’t made to live and die within a cubicle!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You breathe deep of the cool morning air once more, then head back inside once more for your gear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Today was a day to check your water wheel; it was the migrating season for the salmon and you could smoke the meat for winter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your crossbow for chance hunting, a large knife, a wagon to pull back any fish.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you attach the wagon to your ATV, you think to yourself happily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This was the life you had always dreamed of, a life away from paying just to live.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Of course this lifestyle came with some...unforeseen consequences.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The stress of wondering if you would have enough food, the cold winter weather, the stress induced nightmares of something trying to kill you in your sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but that wasn’t stress like the old world you left behind. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now, it was on you and your abilities, rather than some imaginary number given to you by someone. that you had to fulfill.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There was freedom in it, living by your own means; getting your own meat and milk and veggies.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have harbored a few goats while you lived here, they thrived in the summer and fall months, eating literally every bit of green while it was still warm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Next summer you would have to graze them on a different field, but it was worth it. Cheese, milk, and every other dairy product you had access to, even if the goats were always a bit skittish.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your ATV revves through the cool morning air as you head to your snares and traps.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few pelts and furs would net you some cash, and you could use the meat for the upcoming winter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re lost in thought about the possibilities until you ride up to the first snare, and you’re instantly disheartened.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The meat is gone, separated from the fur, and with the innards lay on the cold snow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Somethin- no, someone, a something would just eat the whole trapped animal, had pulled the guts apart from the animal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whoever this was had taken the time to pull everything apart. The meat was separate from the bones, and the skeleton taken apart into individual bones.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re both terrified and impressed at the skill required to pull the meat from the bone even though it was probably uncooked at the time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This carcass looked like it was a deer at some point, however the flesh had been eaten away down to the bone, but leaving everything BESIDES the muscle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even the pelt was sliced apart with near surgical precision.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whoever did this knew what they were doing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You curse under your breath silently at whoever did this but at the same time thank them. This pelt was ready to be stretched and dried, meaning you had a bit more warmth for the upcoming winter months.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Silently you pull the pelt away from the innards, leaving them for whatever lucky animal came across them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The bloodied mass is rolled up and set aside as you start up the ATV once more and head to your water wheel.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Another day, another grab for food.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had thought survival was what made humans different from animals.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even lions starved to death.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But that was it, they only starved if they were alone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you pull up to your water wheel, a simple machine made for catching fish; you&#039;re reminded how of course you do have enough food to last the winter, but this winter would be just...You.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had provisioned, collected and hunted for months, getting enough meat, enough veggies and even grain; through hunting, trading and farming to survive.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now it was just getting that little bit extra, the small amount to carry you over to the next spring so maybe you would have a day or so to relax.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but there was a price, no one to talk to. No one to share memories with; just you in the middle of the wilderness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh as you pull out all the salmon dumb enough to get caught.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;More than enough to survive the winter, that’s for sure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But less than enough for the sake of your sanity.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In terms of survival, this was perfect to say the least.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Having more food than needed was beyond ideal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The years of useless math equations had finally paid off. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If you ate X pounds of meat per day, and you had Y pounds of meat smoked, you could survive Z amounts of days.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And at this point you were well above Z.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Turns out careful planning, observation of fish population and organization paid off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Because of your careful planning you were thriving, even if someone was stealing your venison the fact they left you the pelt was almost ideal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had an extra blanket, an extra cover to insulate your windows from the cold.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now though, it was the time for fish.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You spend a few hours gathering your captured fish, taking careful meticulous notes of how many pounds you had captured.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looks like you had more than enough to survive solely on fish, if you wanted too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That didn&#039;t count the goat, deer, random rabbit or whatever animal you happened across.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This wasn&#039;t Alaska after all. Things didn&#039;t just disappear during the winter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sure they got a little scarcer, but they never really disappeared.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You recall your past life, the life before the cabin in the woods.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Living in the city with your girlfriend, watching a show of hermits living alone and hunting in Alaska</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For so long you admired them; they were free, away from all the bullshit you were trapped in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can remember the conversation leading to the break-up too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hey babe, if I bought land somewhere and built a cabin there; would you move there with me?&quot; you had asked.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looked at you and scoffed; annoyed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What? No! We both know you would never be able to. And why would I EVER leave this behind?&quot; she said.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jokes on her now. You had a comfy home out here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But now wasn&#039;t the time for memories and nostalgia; you load up the fish and head home, knowing the sun was setting sooner than normal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Luckily you had purchased a plot of land not too far from the river, so you arrived in no time at all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The rest of your day is spent peeling the scales off of the fish you had caught.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Heh stupid fish.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had enough for the cold winter months.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Again though, this wasn&#039;t like Alaska or someplace in the arctic circle; no 6 month period for frozen wasteland.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Instead you had 3-4 months of cold, bitter winter in the North American woods.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The meat is set into your smoker; a separate little shack apart from your cabin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was best to keep it somewhat away from your home, too many animals poking and prying.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could deal with a fox sneaking in and eating some fish.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could not deal with a bear breaking through a door to the building you were in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Plus every other homesteader kept everything apart.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You aren&#039;t popular enough to challenge the norm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s not an issue though.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But still you have the unpleasant feeling of not being alone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This feeling is different from one of being watched.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The feeling of being watched usually happens when one is alone and doesn&#039;t have anything else to focus on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At work, without aim for that was going on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you were peeking at your phone at work, because fuck work.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This was different. This was you working hard, yet your hair is standing on end.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;More than once you looked into the woods to see a bit of movement; not really perceivable, but not small enough to ignore.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;NO.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No no no!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re being over imaginative!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The claw marks are animals being bold. The hallucinations are from eating meat too far gone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nothing spooky or scary. Just you in the woods making bad decisions.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Regardless, the sun is beginning to set and you are left to either make a bonfire and sit outside, or light a cozy fire inside and relax.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The choice is obvious. Why sit around outside with mosquitoes and other dickhead bugs?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But the thought of lost food nags at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe set a few snares outside before the light fades.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You carefully set a few traps; a few in the woods around your cabin and one right outside your smoke house.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Chances are nothing will get snagged but it gives a bit of peace of mind; both because you know even if you did have a bad dream, you could remember the snares and because whatever wandered here should be caught.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The confidence you feel regarding these traps was in a word, amazing. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yea maybe you were alone, but you knew how to even the odds. And if anyone or anything was stalking you, you would catch it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You head inside and light a fire in your fireplace, revealing in the comfortable heat it provides.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The modern world is too much; too many people, too much deceit and treachery.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had had too much of it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But that was all behind you as you head inside and get your boots off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stretch in front of your fireplace, savoring the creaking and cracking of your bones.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yawns come involuntarily as you stare into the &quot;wilderness TV&quot; for a little.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pass a bit of time with a book in front of the crackling fire, eat a bit of venison you had caught.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All in all a solid night.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Time for sleep, if you caught anything in the night, it would be waiting there in the morning.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your bed is warm and welcoming as always.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The furs you had scavenged made your bed comfortable and perfect; albeit a bit lonely.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull them over yourself and snuggle in happily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fur was something that always provided a bit of snuggly warmth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It reminded you of your pets back in civilization. Your cats and dogs that you always had, so it was a comfort to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You settle in and pull the furs over you, sighing happily; this is the life.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No boss, no one to answer to.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just you and your own work.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile to yourself as you fall asleep; you have wood and blankets and meat to survive the cold winter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anything else was just a bonus.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And hey, you catch something in your snares and you might have a few less stress induced nightmares.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Luckily, sleep takes you before you can worry too much.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This night isn&#039;t full of teeth and nightmares.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s filled with snuggles and fur and warmth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The memory of your pets, all of them from your cats to your dogs to your chinchilla snuggled against you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All of them nuzzle you in your sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few times you wake to odd sounds; large wings flapping, angry hissing and the groan of tree branches.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you&#039;re able to fall back asleep quickly, not even bothering to look out the window for the source.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When at last the sunlight pours through your windows, you&#039;ve had a comforting night of deep sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sit up and get ready for the day, munching on a bit of jerky as you get your gear together.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Crossbow, hatchet (you now brought it inside with you) and your hunting knife.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One final check and you know you&#039;re ready to go.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Briskly walking to the door, you push it open and prepare to take on whatever is out there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The day is beautiful and the sunlight feels amazing, even if the air was a bit chilly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You walk to your smokehouse to check the traps you set, only to find it’s not there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The rope is neatly rolled up and on the ground in front of the door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;WHAT.

Winter is coming and you wouldn&#039;t have to steal food&quot; you ask casually, even though your heart is beating out of your chest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I mean, we can hunt and survive much better if it’s the two of us&quot; you add on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jade&#039;s smile fades as she looks at you with a look of confusion, worry and intrigue.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I mean if you don’t wan-&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Why...Why would you want that?

Great! Let’s go and check my traps for food, if you’ve only had my smoked meat, just wait till you try the fresh stuff&quot; you say picking up your knife and hatchet before turning to Jade.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jade looks at you with a bit of concern &quot;Weapons?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Raising your hands to her, you show her your nails.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I don’t have claws like you, ok?&quot; you say reassuringly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She contemplates for a moment before smiling once more, her large wings stretching open.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Okay~&quot; she teased before lurching forwards with dizzying speed, and wrapping her arms around you and lifting you off your feet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She then uses her large wing to rocket skywards.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You freak out in term, watching the world disappear below you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It’s faster if we fly~&quot; Jade singsongs to you, loving your reaction.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After about 15 minutes of flying around in circles with her teasing you all the while.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had to become friends with a teasing mistress that could fly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;On more than one occasion she pretended to drop you, causing another minor freak-out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But finally she drops you about 5 feet onto the ground in front of your water wheel.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I like fish, let’s get lots together~&quot; she remarks happily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Having Jade around actually made the harvesting a lot easier because you would fill a bag, and she would take off with it to take it back home.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Huh. Not bad. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With the last of the fish out of the water wheel, Jade takes off once more, leaving you to walk back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whew at least she isn’t going to pick you up again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You trudge back, noting the cool, brisk breeze with the promise of a cold winter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you move through the trees with their golden leave and contemplate your own good luck as you walk, a cabin land food, and now a jersey devil helping you survive.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The hairs on the back of your neck stand on end as you hear the flapping of wings.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Uh oh.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re swept off your feet once more as Jade laughs happily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;This is fun!

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;How long has it been? How long since you had freedom from this ongoing torment?
&gt;Something out there was hunting you with a disturbing amount of enthusiasm.
&gt;For so long you had dreamt of living off the grid, away from society and all of the constraints that came with it.
&gt;Why pay money to drive a car? Why pay money to OWN a car? Everything cost money and no one was truly free.
&gt;After all if you truly you were free, try doing something without money.
&gt;That was how you used to think.
&gt;Before all this, before this terror.
&gt;Now you know what you were free from; free of fear of what goes bump in the night.
&gt;A little over 8 months ago, you bought a plot of land in the middle of the wilderness, away from everything and everyone, and then spent the next 3 months building your log cabin with your own two hands.
&gt;You should have listened to your instincts then; the feeling of being watched, the occasional glowing red eyes that disappeared as soon as you tried to focus on them.
&gt;It was just your imagination right?
&gt;Nothing could be lurking in these woods, you had researched them over and over. 
&gt;Nothing here besides deer, squirrels and the occasional timber wolf.
&gt;No chupacabra, no anything besides herbivores you could hunt down in peace.
&gt;well, maybe the occasional bear.
&gt;god, the warning signs were there.
&gt;At first it was the feeling of being watched from the shadows.
&gt;Then, a few empty snare traps, and it just got worse from there.
&gt;Sounds of large wings flapping outside your door, large claw marks on the wood outside your windows, and bits of smoked meat going missing from your store room.
&gt;The last part hurt the most; you could deal with animals being curious, but when they can open doors to smokehouses and steal the food within, that was a problem.
&gt;Especially when the door to your cabin is the same kind of door.
&gt;Now.... Now you were huddled in a far corner of you cabin, wishing you had a gun or anything like that.
&gt;This thing, or things that had been tormenting you had gotten bolder as time when on.
&gt;You had dismissed the obvious claw marks as deer running past with their antlers, refusing to believe something else was out there.
&gt;Now you were huddled in a corner of your cabin with nothing more than an old knife like that would do something.
&gt;Your Axe was outside, buried in the wood of a hardy oak stump.
&gt;Your crossbow was all but useless here in there tight quarters.
&gt;So you were left with your Hunting knife for defense from whatever what out there.
&gt;The sounds of claws scraping against wood makes you jump and look towards the offending sound.
&gt;It’s from one of the windows you had put in; after all how do you enjoy a life of living in the wilderness without seeing the wilderness from your indoor comfort?
&gt;As you look to the window you see them; the pair of glowing red eyes that had always been in the corner of your vision, staring at you hungrily. 
&gt;You watch, locked onto those glowing beacons of nightmares as pointed fangs form a cruel smile, staring at you.
&gt;This isn&#039;t something you should be going through! This was something children saw in their closets when they were too imaginative!
&gt;Not here and now to you! 
&gt;You point your useless weapon towards the window .
&gt;&quot;G-get o-out of here! I-I&#039;m not afraid to fight you&quot; you stammer out, trembling visibly.
&gt;To your dismay, the smile widens further, revealing more sharp teeth.
&gt;&quot;Of course you aren&#039;t Anon~&quot; comes a quiet singsong voice softly.
&gt;You freeze, paralyzed in fear; it can talk? It heard you yelling into the darkened abyss of the woods?
&gt;The smile widens revealing more pointed teeth in a sickening, sly grin.
&gt;And then, like magic, it all disappears.
&gt;No more noise, no more voice or glowing eyes. 
&gt;Nothing.
&gt;You look out the window, expecting the eyes to be staring back, but see nothing besides inky blankness.
&gt;No! You weren’t fooled! Not this time!
&gt;Yes, you&#039;ve been awake for 36 hours; yes, you haven’t left your cabin in all that time either! But this thing was after you! There was no time for sleep!
&gt;But maybe while it was gone you could just rest your eyes...
&gt;You huddle into a corner of the cabin, you back against a solid wall with the knife clenched in your hands, nothing could sneak up on you like this...


&gt;Your eyes flutter open.
&gt;Sunlight pours through your windows onto your face, making you sit up abruptly.
&gt;You breathe in and out quickly, looking around your cabin from your bed.
&gt;In it was...Nothing; nothing besides your usual gear and appliances. 
&gt;The stone fireplace with a smoldering ember, the crude chair and table you made.
&gt;Nothing out of the ordinary.
&gt;You breathe in deep and rub your eyes with the heels of your hands, as if hoping to reveal some hidden secret after you pull them away.
&gt;Of course, nothing changes when you do; it&#039;s still just you, in your cabin, alone in the woods.
&gt;Maybe you shouldn&#039;t have eaten that semi rotten beaver meat you found submerged in the nearby river.
&gt;It must be messing with your head...
&gt;Taking your time, you get out of bed slowly; stretching and cracking the odd ridgid parts of your body.
&gt;A creak from your back, the soft pop from your shoulders, and feeling your fingers pop in sequence as you pulled them.
&gt;When did you go to bed last night? You can’t quite recall. You remember making dinner from that beaver meat, then....nightmares.
&gt;Nightmares of teeth and fear.
&gt;This isn’t the first time this had happened.
&gt;So many times you dreamt of eyes and teeth, only to wake up perfectly safe.
&gt;Either way, it’s time to get the day started; check the snares, look for any wildlife to eat, and all and all, feel free
&gt;The constraints of modern society were too much... Why pay to live when you had what you needed right here.
&gt;You eat a bit of your smoked venison for breakfast, then head out into the wilderness.
&gt;As you step out into the marred sunlight, you breathe in deep savoring the freshest of fresh air.
&gt;The woods, the forest, the wildlife all thriving around you. 
&gt;It was all beautiful and lovely.
&gt;The various plants that had been planted grew healthily, letting you know that you would have potatoes, onions and garlic for the upcoming winter months.
&gt;Nightmares aside, you were happier than you had ever been living within society.
&gt;No taxes, nothing other than your own hard work keeping you afloat and alive.
&gt;Humanity wasn’t made to live and die within a cubicle!
&gt;You breathe deep of the cool morning air once more, then head back inside once more for your gear.
&gt;Today was a day to check your water wheel; it was the migrating season for the salmon and you could smoke the meat for winter.
&gt;Your crossbow for chance hunting, a large knife, a wagon to pull back any fish.
&gt;As you attach the wagon to your ATV, you think to yourself happily.
&gt;This was the life you had always dreamed of, a life away from paying just to live.
&gt;Of course this lifestyle came with some...unforeseen consequences.
&gt;The stress of wondering if you would have enough food, the cold winter weather, the stress induced nightmares of something trying to kill you in your sleep.
&gt;but that wasn’t stress like the old world you left behind. 
&gt;Now, it was on you and your abilities, rather than some imaginary number given to you by someone. that you had to fulfill.
&gt;There was freedom in it, living by your own means; getting your own meat and milk and veggies.
&gt;You have harbored a few goats while you lived here, they thrived in the summer and fall months, eating literally every bit of green while it was still warm.
&gt;Next summer you would have to graze them on a different field, but it was worth it. Cheese, milk, and every other dairy product you had access to, even if the goats were always a bit skittish.
&gt;Your ATV revves through the cool morning air as you head to your snares and traps.
&gt;A few pelts and furs would net you some cash, and you could use the meat for the upcoming winter.
&gt;You&#039;re lost in thought about the possibilities until you ride up to the first snare, and you’re instantly disheartened.
&gt;The meat is gone, separated from the fur, and with the innards lay on the cold snow.
&gt;Somethin- no, someone, a something would just eat the whole trapped animal, had pulled the guts apart from the animal.
&gt;Whoever this was had taken the time to pull everything apart. The meat was separate from the bones, and the skeleton taken apart into individual bones.
&gt;You&#039;re both terrified and impressed at the skill required to pull the meat from the bone even though it was probably uncooked at the time.
&gt;This carcass looked like it was a deer at some point, however the flesh had been eaten away down to the bone, but leaving everything BESIDES the muscle.
&gt;Even the pelt was sliced apart with near surgical precision.  
&gt;Whoever did this knew what they were doing.
&gt;You curse under your breath silently at whoever did this but at the same time thank them. This pelt was ready to be stretched and dried, meaning you had a bit more warmth for the upcoming winter months.
&gt;Silently you pull the pelt away from the innards, leaving them for whatever lucky animal came across them.
&gt;The bloodied mass is rolled up and set aside as you start up the ATV once more and head to your water wheel.
&gt;Another day, another grab for food.
&gt;You had thought survival was what made humans different from animals.
&gt;Even lions starved to death.
&gt;But that was it, they only starved if they were alone.
&gt;As you pull up to your water wheel, a simple machine made for catching fish; you&#039;re reminded how of course you do have enough food to last the winter, but this winter would be just...You.
&gt;You had provisioned, collected and hunted for months, getting enough meat, enough veggies and even grain; through hunting, trading and farming to survive.
&gt;Now it was just getting that little bit extra, the small amount to carry you over to the next spring so maybe you would have a day or so to relax.
&gt;but there was a price, no one to talk to. No one to share memories with; just you in the middle of the wilderness.
&gt;You sigh as you pull out all the salmon dumb enough to get caught.
&gt;More than enough to survive the winter, that’s for sure.
&gt;But less than enough for the sake of your sanity.
&gt;In terms of survival, this was perfect to say the least.
&gt;Having more food than needed was beyond ideal.
&gt;The years of useless math equations had finally paid off. 
&gt;If you ate X pounds of meat per day, and you had Y pounds of meat smoked, you could survive Z amounts of days.
&gt;And at this point you were well above Z.
&gt;Turns out careful planning, observation of fish population and organization paid off.
&gt;Because of your careful planning you were thriving, even if someone was stealing your venison the fact they left you the pelt was almost ideal.
&gt;You had an extra blanket, an extra cover to insulate your windows from the cold.
&gt;Now though, it was the time for fish.
&gt;You spend a few hours gathering your captured fish, taking careful meticulous notes of how many pounds you had captured.
&gt;Looks like you had more than enough to survive solely on fish, if you wanted too.
&gt;That didn&#039;t count the goat, deer, random rabbit or whatever animal you happened across.
&gt;This wasn&#039;t Alaska after all. Things didn&#039;t just disappear during the winter.
&gt;Sure they got a little scarcer, but they never really disappeared.
&gt;You recall your past life, the life before the cabin in the woods.
&gt;Living in the city with your girlfriend, watching a show of hermits living alone and hunting in Alaska
&gt;For so long you admired them; they were free, away from all the bullshit you were trapped in.
&gt;You can remember the conversation leading to the break-up too.
&gt;&quot;Hey babe, if I bought land somewhere and built a cabin there; would you move there with me?&quot; you had asked.
&gt;She looked at you and scoffed; annoyed.
&gt;&quot;What? No! We both know you would never be able to. And why would I EVER leave this behind?&quot; she said.
&gt;Jokes on her now. You had a comfy home out here.
&gt;But now wasn&#039;t the time for memories and nostalgia; you load up the fish and head home, knowing the sun was setting sooner than normal.
&gt;Luckily you had purchased a plot of land not too far from the river, so you arrived in no time at all.
&gt;The rest of your day is spent peeling the scales off of the fish you had caught.
&gt;Heh stupid fish.
&gt;You had enough for the cold winter months.
&gt;Again though, this wasn&#039;t like Alaska or someplace in the arctic circle; no 6 month period for frozen wasteland.
&gt;Instead you had 3-4 months of cold, bitter winter in the North American woods.
&gt;The meat is set into your smoker; a separate little shack apart from your cabin.
&gt;It was best to keep it somewhat away from your home, too many animals poking and prying.
&gt;You could deal with a fox sneaking in and eating some fish.
&gt;You could not deal with a bear breaking through a door to the building you were in.
&gt;Plus every other homesteader kept everything apart.
&gt;You aren&#039;t popular enough to challenge the norm.
&gt;It’s not an issue though.
&gt;But still you have the unpleasant feeling of not being alone.
&gt;This feeling is different from one of being watched.
&gt;The feeling of being watched usually happens when one is alone and doesn&#039;t have anything else to focus on.
&gt;At work, without aim for that was going on.
&gt;When you were peeking at your phone at work, because fuck work.
&gt;This was different. This was you working hard, yet your hair is standing on end.
&gt;More than once you looked into the woods to see a bit of movement; not really perceivable, but not small enough to ignore.
&gt;NO.
&gt;No no no!
&gt;You&#039;re being over imaginative!
&gt;The claw marks are animals being bold. The hallucinations are from eating meat too far gone.
&gt;Nothing spooky or scary. Just you in the woods making bad decisions.
&gt;Regardless, the sun is beginning to set and you are left to either make a bonfire and sit outside, or light a cozy fire inside and relax.
&gt;The choice is obvious. Why sit around outside with mosquitoes and other dickhead bugs?
&gt;But the thought of lost food nags at you.
&gt;Maybe set a few snares outside before the light fades.
&gt;You carefully set a few traps; a few in the woods around your cabin and one right outside your smoke house.
&gt;Chances are nothing will get snagged but it gives a bit of peace of mind; both because you know even if you did have a bad dream, you could remember the snares and because whatever wandered here should be caught.
&gt;The confidence you feel regarding these traps was in a word, amazing. 
&gt;Yea maybe you were alone, but you knew how to even the odds. And if anyone or anything was stalking you, you would catch it.
&gt;You head inside and light a fire in your fireplace, revealing in the comfortable heat it provides.
&gt;The modern world is too much; too many people, too much deceit and treachery.
&gt;You had had too much of it.
&gt;But that was all behind you as you head inside and get your boots off.
&gt;You stretch in front of your fireplace, savoring the creaking and cracking of your bones.
&gt;Yawns come involuntarily as you stare into the &quot;wilderness TV&quot; for a little.
&gt;Pass a bit of time with a book in front of the crackling fire, eat a bit of venison you had caught.
&gt;All in all a solid night.
&gt;Time for sleep, if you caught anything in the night, it would be waiting there in the morning.
&gt;Your bed is warm and welcoming as always.
&gt;The furs you had scavenged made your bed comfortable and perfect; albeit a bit lonely.
&gt;You pull them over yourself and snuggle in happily.
&gt;Fur was something that always provided a bit of snuggly warmth.
&gt;It reminded you of your pets back in civilization. Your cats and dogs that you always had, so it was a comfort to you.
&gt;You settle in and pull the furs over you, sighing happily; this is the life.
&gt;No boss, no one to answer to.
&gt;Just you and your own work.
&gt;You smile to yourself as you fall asleep; you have wood and blankets and meat to survive the cold winter.
&gt;Anything else was just a bonus.
&gt;And hey, you catch something in your snares and you might have a few less stress induced nightmares.
&gt;Luckily, sleep takes you before you can worry too much.
&gt;This night isn&#039;t full of teeth and nightmares.
&gt;It&#039;s filled with snuggles and fur and warmth.
&gt;The memory of your pets, all of them from your cats to your dogs to your chinchilla snuggled against you
&gt;All of them nuzzle you in your sleep.
&gt;A few times you wake to odd sounds; large wings flapping, angry hissing and the groan of tree branches.
&gt;But you&#039;re able to fall back asleep quickly, not even bothering to look out the window for the source.
&gt;When at last the sunlight pours through your windows, you&#039;ve had a comforting night of deep sleep.
&gt;You sit up and get ready for the day, munching on a bit of jerky as you get your gear together.
&gt;Crossbow, hatchet (you now brought it inside with you) and your hunting knife.
&gt;One final check and you know you&#039;re ready to go.
&gt;Briskly walking to the door, you push it open and prepare to take on whatever is out there.
&gt;The day is beautiful and the sunlight feels amazing, even if the air was a bit chilly.
&gt;You walk to your smokehouse to check the traps you set, only to find it’s not there.
&gt;The rope is neatly rolled up and on the ground in front of the door.
&gt;WHAT. THE. FUCK.
&gt;You ready your hatchet and open the smoke house door to find....
&gt;Nothing besides your meat.
&gt;You frown and look around and find only 1 filet of fish missing.
&gt;An animal can&#039;t untie a snare, an animal would break into here and gouge themselves.
&gt;Someone is fucking with you.
&gt;You stomp out of the smoke house and slam the door behind you.
&gt;&quot;WHOS OUT THERE, QUIT FUCKING WITH ME AND FIGHT ME&quot; You yell to the woods.
&gt;Panting a bit in anger, you belittle yourself.
&gt;No one is going to answ-
&gt;&quot;Ok Anon~&quot;
&gt;Wut
&gt;Before you can react a figure flies, literally FLIES, out of the trees and swoops onto you, tackling you hard into the dirt.
&gt;Red eyes and razor sharp teeth.
&gt;This thing is strong, pinning you easily as you struggle to get away.
&gt;&quot;Aww you said you wanted to fight but you can&#039;t put up much of one~&quot; comes a deep yet very feminine voice.
&gt;Wait what?
&gt;You stop struggling and finally get a chance to look at your assailant, your torturer and now captor. 
&gt;It’s definitely a Female, that’s for sure, judging from the large breasts pressing against you.
&gt;Black fur covers the arms she is using to pin you, a long snout similar to a wolves is covered in grey and black fur.
&gt;Horns spout from the top of her head and wrap themselves around her long deer like ears.
&gt;Her eyes glow red like fiery coals and she has a terrifying smile that reveals so many teeth.
&gt;&quot;W-what are you?&quot; you wheeze out, it’s hard to breath with her full weight on you.
&gt;She sits up suddenly, straddling you and looking down with a bemused look on her face.
&gt;&quot;Hmmmm I suppose humans call me a ....What is it...Jersey Devil?&quot; she says twiddling a long clawed finger under her chin in contemplation.
&gt;A long black skinned tail, hairless except the tip, flicks behind her.
&gt;Flowing black and orange hair drapes over her shoulders and down her very exposed chest and tummy, which are covered in grey fur.
&gt;&quot;Are you going to kill me?&quot; you ask, trying to get to your knife sneakily.
&gt;The jersey devil notices though, and casually takes your knife then flicks it away while making a howling sort of laugh.
&gt;&quot;Kill you? Now why would I do that? You make very good food and great entertainment.&quot; she says with a wide smile.
&gt;What 
&gt;&quot;Huh?&quot; you utter in confusion.
&gt;She just liked your cooking?
&gt;&quot;When you first got here I debated hurting you to scare you off, buttt when I smelled your food. I decided not to~&quot; She says casually as light tapping noise fills the air.
&gt;You look down and see she has split hooves instead of feet, and she is making the &quot;Toes&quot; Click together.
&gt;&quot;So I let you stay, and got some food from you when I got the chance~&quot; she smiles again.
&gt;You attempt to sit up only for her to push you back down.
&gt;&quot;But why torment me&quot; you ask, dumbfounded.
&gt;&quot;I was bored, that’s all&quot; she responds, showing off her teeth like the was a perfectly excusable answer.
&gt;What now though? You have a jersey devil sitting on you, who could kill you but won’t because food?
&gt;&quot;You had me terrified! I fell asleep in a corner the other night!&quot; you snarl.
&gt;&quot;And woke up in your bed~&quot; the Devil teases.
&gt;Wait...That’s right you did...
&gt;&quot;You…You put me in bed?&quot; you stammer out.
&gt;Her tail flicks behind her as she keeps smiling.
&gt;&quot;Didn&#039;t want you getting cold~&quot;
&gt;Huh well now that’s... Interesting.
&gt;&quot;Uh...Can you let me up?&quot; you inquire, awkwardly.
&gt;&quot;Hmmm, okkkk but better not make me have to show you just how sharp my claws are&quot; she bemuses, dragging one down your chest.
&gt;And with that, she lifts herself off you by flapping her large membranous wings.
&gt;You stand up and look at her.
&gt;It was hard to tell how tall she was from the ground, but she’s much taller than you, standing near 6&#039;7 at least.
&gt;And she is still, very naked.
&gt;Don&#039;t focus on that, &quot;Are there more of you uh...what is your name&quot; youask, still trying hard to believe you’re talking to a mythical creature that likes your food.
&gt;Her ears droop a bit at the questions though.
&gt;&quot;Jade...And no, it&#039;s just me&quot; she says with a little less singsong in her voice.
&gt;That little droop and her words made you feel a bit sorry for her.
&gt;You don&#039;t have to imagine how lonely it can be out here, because you know how it feels.
&gt;The idea you get is...well it’s crazy to say the least, but it might be a net positive for both of you.
&gt;&quot;Why not...Why not stay here with me? Winter is coming and you wouldn&#039;t have to steal food&quot; you ask casually, even though your heart is beating out of your chest.
&gt;&quot;I mean, we can hunt and survive much better if it’s the two of us&quot; you add on
&gt;Jade&#039;s smile fades as she looks at you with a look of confusion, worry and intrigue.
&gt;&quot;I mean if you don’t wan-&quot;
&gt;&quot;Why...Why would you want that? I’m a monster and you’re a human and I stole from you&quot; she asks, her ears partly drooped and her tail no longer flicking.
&gt;You rub you facial hair a bit and sigh.
&gt;&quot;I suppose it because we shouldn&#039;t be enemies or whatever, plus...I hate picturing you alone in a cave or tree or whatever when winter hits&quot; you say, trying your best to sound somewhat cool.
&gt;Jade studies you thoughtfully for a moment &quot;Okay but I’m still going to sometimes stalk you~&quot; Jade says with her smile returning and her ears perked up.
&gt;Well, that was easy.
&gt;&quot;Uh well, OK! Great! Let’s go and check my traps for food, if you’ve only had my smoked meat, just wait till you try the fresh stuff&quot; you say picking up your knife and hatchet before turning to Jade.
&gt;Jade looks at you with a bit of concern &quot;Weapons?&quot;
&gt;Raising your hands to her, you show her your nails.
&gt;&quot;I don’t have claws like you, ok?&quot; you say reassuringly.
&gt;She contemplates for a moment before smiling once more, her large wings stretching open.
&gt;&quot;Okay~&quot; she teased before lurching forwards with dizzying speed, and wrapping her arms around you and lifting you off your feet.
&gt;She then uses her large wing to rocket skywards.
&gt;You freak out in term, watching the world disappear below you.
&gt;&quot;It’s faster if we fly~&quot; Jade singsongs to you, loving your reaction.
&gt;After about 15 minutes of flying around in circles with her teasing you all the while.
&gt;You had to become friends with a teasing mistress that could fly.
&gt;On more than one occasion she pretended to drop you, causing another minor freak-out.
&gt;But finally she drops you about 5 feet onto the ground in front of your water wheel.
&gt;&quot;I like fish, let’s get lots together~&quot; she remarks happily.
&gt;Having Jade around actually made the harvesting a lot easier because you would fill a bag, and she would take off with it to take it back home.
&gt;Huh. Not bad. 
&gt;With the last of the fish out of the water wheel, Jade takes off once more, leaving you to walk back.
&gt;Whew at least she isn’t going to pick you up again.
&gt;You trudge back, noting the cool, brisk breeze with the promise of a cold winter.
&gt;As you move through the trees with their golden leave and contemplate your own good luck as you walk, a cabin land food, and now a jersey devil helping you survive.
&gt;The hairs on the back of your neck stand on end as you hear the flapping of wings.
&gt;Uh oh.
&gt;You&#039;re swept off your feet once more as Jade laughs happily.
&gt;&quot;This is fun! Why didn’t I try this before!&quot; she cackles gleefully.
&gt;Why did you think this was a good idea?

2 months later

&gt;There is a blizzard roaring outside and snow covers the naked tree branches.
&gt;You don’t mind though, as you stand in front of your stove cooking up some deer meat.
&gt;&quot;Mmmm Anon smells good~&quot; Jade cooes happily from behind you.
&gt;The feeling of her arms wrapping around you and lifting you, was once a terrifying thing; now it was welcome.
&gt;You quickly learned how soft her fur was and while she did have an odd sense of fun (namely teasing and finding new ways to scare you), she was great to be around and welcome company.
&gt;Plus it didn&#039;t help that her fur was the softest you had ever felt.
&gt;She grew on you, starting as a terror in the night, to an uneasy partnership, to a friend, to now a lover.
&gt;Turns out spending every day and night with someone of the opposite gender reallllly does make for building a good relationship.
&gt;Also sharing a bed with her moved it along.
&gt;Ever since the first day she INSISTED that you two share a bed.
&gt;It was of course to tease you.
&gt;But now you were happy with her, and never wanted her to leave.
&gt;&quot;Dinner is served you says, grabbing 2 plates and putting the food on it while still being lifted by Jade.
&gt;&quot;Deer meat, roasted potatoes, and biscuits&quot; you says as she happily rubs her horns on your back.
&gt;&quot;Ooo you spoil me Anon~&quot; she said in quiet amazement, putting her head on your shoulder and staring at the food.
&gt;&quot;But I don’t want the veggi-&quot; .
&gt;&quot;You will eat the veggies Jade! Or none for you&quot; you assert.
&gt;She drops you on your feet with a huff.
&gt;&quot;And you people call ME a devil! Veggies are gro-&quot;.
&gt;&quot;I roasted them in bacon greeease&quot; You tease, eating one of yours happily.
&gt;Her ears perk up.
&gt;&quot;bacon grease...? You can do that?&quot; she murmurs.
&gt;Before you can reassure her, she’s digging in happily, not bothering with a fork or anything.
&gt;You could make a joke about being raised by wolves but that would be rather tasteless.
&gt;Quietly, you finish your meal before Jade can decide she wants yours too.
&gt;Grabbing the dishes, you tidy up the kitchen and Jade walks out of the room, her hooves clicking upon the wooden floor.
&gt;As you wash the dishes and pans, you hear Jade cooing to you from the other room.
&gt;&quot;Annnnonnn come read to me~&quot; she calls out
&gt;&quot;One sec love&quot; you call out to her as you wash the dishes.
&gt;She couldn&#039;t read, never learned, so you would spend some nights reading to her in front of the fire.
&gt;A few moments later and you&#039;re drying off your hands and heading into the living room where the fire is crackling heartily.
&gt;Jade is waiting for you, laying on a pile of furs, with no book in sight.
&gt;&quot;Jade? Where’s the book you wa-&quot;without warning jades tail and wings wrap around you, pulling you to the floor.
&gt;Just as quickly she rolled over and is straddling you.
&gt;&quot;hmmm do I want a book...or do I want you~&quot; she teases happily, grinding her hips against yours.
&gt;You place your hands upon her hips and savor the feeling of soft fur.
&gt;&gt;Without another word she’s lifted herself slightly and pulling your pants down.
&gt;More grinding from Jade, with her clawed hands upon your chest
&gt;She gasps slightly, feeling your now forming erection grow and press against her tight wetness. 
&gt;You feel her tail wrap around your leg and see her wings quiver as she looks down at you with her glowing red eyes.
&gt;&quot;Mmmm it’s good Anon~&quot; she hisses in joy.
&gt;She lifts her hips once more and positions her slit over your throbbing member.
&gt;You know better than to move, she wants to be on top, wants to be in charge.
&gt;of course you weren&#039;t going to fight it.
&gt;With a mighty flap of her wings, Jade Slams your full length into her, eliciting a sharp gasp from her and nearly knocking the wind out of you
&gt;She grinds side you side, while squeezing tightly with her tight slit; sending waves of pleasure through you.
&gt;MMM that’s good~&quot; Jade moans, closing her eyes and looking up as she slowly starts lifting herself and dropping down on you, forcing your shaft deep into her.
&gt;&quot;you like th-mm!&quot; 
&gt;Before you can finish Jade puts her hand over your mouth, cutting you off.
&gt;&quot;Shhhhh&quot; She hisses seductively
&gt;understanding that you were not going to talk, you instead reach up and grab Jade&#039;s nipples and pull them softly
&gt;her moans get louder
&gt;She clamps down harder and you feel her insides quivering with excitement.
&gt;She&#039;s hot and panting and she continues pounding harder and harder into you
&gt;Her wet insides are hot and tight; the pleasure is unbearable as she puts her hands on your chest again to steady herself.
&gt;Unfurling her large wings, she gives you a seductive smile and begin Flapping them hard, to lift herself and pound your pelvis into yours.
&gt;Faster and faster she goes, until you can&#039;t contain yourself anymore.
&gt;&quot;I-I&#039;m going to-&quot; Again her hand covers your mouth 
&gt;She smiles mischievously as she quickens the pace.
&gt;you feel your limit fast approaching
&gt;unable to contain it any longer, you grab jade&#039;s ample hips and try to pull her down onto you one more time.
&gt;with one last flap, she pushes herself down hard onto you hard.
&gt;you fill her up, panting and with your legs spasming slightly.
&gt;She leans forwards and kisses you softly, then lays on your chest with you still inside her
&gt;I love you Jade&quot; you gasp out
&gt;&quot;mm I love you too Anon~&quot; she giggles, licking your face softly.
&gt;you wrap your arms around her and bask in the warm glow of the fire.
&gt;what a wonderful life.
&gt;and to think it’s all because you were such easy prey.</textarea>
