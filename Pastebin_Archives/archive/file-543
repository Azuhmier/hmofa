&quot;Dunno. I think it&#039;s the beard on ya. Maybe it&#039;s the revolver. I have a hard time reading humans. Your people all have small eyes.&quot;
And here you thought you&#039;ll be misappropriating cultures.
 
 
 
&gt;&gt;Anyway, let&#039;s see our [SKILL]s for future reference. Maybe Anon has some charisma/diplomacy up his sleeves?
 
SPECIALTY: Western Aim
&gt;You feel more at ease knowing a gun&#039;s by your side. It&#039;s not a bloodlust thing. You have more proficiency in firearms than regular people.
 
ATTACK: Fire wildly
&gt;The name says it all. You unload all your shots into a direction or a target. Highly inaccurate because, well, your hand&#039;s flying all over the place.
 
BUFF: Sharpest eye
&gt;Temporarily heightens your sight to inhuman levels. Let&#039;s you read small labels companies like to hide on products. Can only be use 3 times a day.
 
We will be gaining more skills and evolve some of them as we progress, and I&#039;ll put up a separate paste to keep track of them. For now, let&#039;s go back to Jamie.
 
 
&gt;&gt;[INVENTORY]&lt;check inventory&gt;
&gt;&gt;[ACTION]Also &lt;set objective&gt;
 
Your coat pockets contain 4 servings of painkillers and a simple cloth sack, holding roughly 500 drachma, the currency used by most nations. As of now, 500 drachma could buy you a few day&#039;s stay at an inn. Another larger sack contains a few set of clothes, each made to pair with your coat. You figured that if you&#039;re gonna be a gunman, you might as well be a relatively fashionable one.
Your objective? Well, you hadn&#039;t really thought of a major one, yet. Striking it rich in the Labyrinth is everyone&#039;s dream, but none have ever made it a reality. You need a guild to start exploring, though, so making, or joining a guild would be your current goal.
 
MAIN OBJECTIVE SET: MAKE/JOIN A GUILD</textarea>
