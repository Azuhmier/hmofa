        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Charlie never really had a normal childhood
&gt;from age 6 he was taken from his abusive household and put into foster care
&gt;He moved from family to family
&gt;Sometimes the families were human, other times they were Anthros
&gt;He typically stayed with human families longer than the anthro ones, possibly due to tension between the races
&gt;except for one place
&gt;For some time during his late teens, Charlie lived with an aristocratic vixen whom took a keen liking to the human child
&gt;He would go on remembering those times as the best in his childhood

&gt;It was late October when the fox walked in to the foster center to apply for an adoption
&gt;Charlie didn&#039;t pay any mind, believing she was there for one of the other foxes
&gt;But he was soon disproved when the caretaker introduced Charlie is new mom, the fox
&gt;&quot;Charlie I&#039;d like you to meet... erm, what was it you said your name was?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ms. Rostinna Golver Concordia.&quot;
&gt;Concordia was about 5 feet tall. She looked like she&#039;s a winter fox. She&#039;s wearing a dark grey, tight fitting dress accompanied by equally grey high heels and hat 
&gt;&quot;Right. Well Charlie, Ms. Concordia has filed the paper for your adoption. So say hello to your new mom!&quot;
&gt;Charlie wonders if she has to say that every time an adoption is made because it lost its meaning to him
&gt;Charlie went to the boys room and packed what little clothes and personal effects he had
&gt;He had maybe 4 change of clothes and an old laptop he got when he was 14
&gt;Soon Charlie and Concordia left the foster center in a rather luxurious sports car
&gt;He wondered how much it must of cost for the vixen
&gt;he also wondered why Concordia adopted him
&gt;&quot;Hey&quot; the human boy muttered
&gt;&quot;Yes what is it?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Why did you adopt me? there were plenty of fox kids there so why me?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Because of three reasons:&quot;
&gt;&quot;one, I need work done around the house since i&#039;m going back to work
&gt;two, I like being the only fox in my household
&gt;and three is because i&#039;ve been feeling lonely

&gt;Charlie and Concordia have been in the car for a good part of an hour into the country side
&gt;The sports car pulls into a massive driveway that lays before a large, white mansion
&gt;in the drive way there are other similar looking sports cars
&gt;why a hot fox lady needs 4 different sports cars is beyond Charlie
&gt;The car is parked at end of the other cars and the two step out
&gt;only now does Charlie realize how big this place is
&gt;He stands there, marveling at the massive residence
&gt;Charlie didn&#039;t see Concordia chuckle at his gawking
&gt;&quot;You like it huh?&quot;
&gt;&quot;How did you afford this place?&quot;
&gt;&quot;My husband was a wealthy human. When he dies everything that was under his name went straight to me.&quot;
&gt;the two started to approach the front entrance
&gt;There were two Fox maids standing there waiting for their mistress and her new son
&gt;The maids opened the door for their masters and greeted them
&gt;The first this Charlie noticed was the lack of furniture
&gt;there&#039;s just two armchairs on a rug in the middle of the parlor with a small table between them
&gt;no paintings
&gt;no vases
&gt;there&#039;s a flight of stairs on the left side of the parlor that ascends to a balcony
&gt;&quot;The rooms upstairs aren&#039;t in use. our rooms are to the right of the of the parlor.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh, why isn&#039;t the upstairs used?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I never found a need to use them after my husband died.&quot;
&gt;A human butler greeted Concordia
&gt;&quot;Shall I show the young master his room?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes Daniel. Charlie, this is Daniel. He&#039;s going to show you you&#039;re room.&quot;
&gt;without saying anything Charlie followed the butler to his room. 

&gt;Charlie and the butler reach the end of the right wing corridor
&gt;To their left is a pine door, maybe?
&gt;&quot;Here is your room.&quot;
&gt;Charlie thanks Daniel and dismisses him
&gt;Charlie opens the door and steps into the equally barren room
&gt;There&#039;s a queen sized bed to the right with a night stand on the left
&gt;a sliding door that leads to a bathroom sits on the left side of the room
&gt;the room is covered with a light brown carpet
&gt;&quot;Sorry for the lack of furniture dear.&quot;
&gt;Finnthehumanscream.mp3
&gt;Concordia steps into the room
&gt;&quot;I didn&#039;t exactly inherit everything when my husband died. You see, my in laws wanted the furniture. I still don&#039;t know where they stored it all.&quot;
&gt;The Artic fox turns back around and approaches Charlies
&gt;&quot;Maybe some time this week we can go look at some furniture, together. What do you say?&quot;
&gt;&quot;sure?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Great, dinner will be ready in an hour.&quot;
&gt;the fox left the room leaving Charlie to get familiar with is new life

&gt;At first Charlie wasn&#039;t so optimistic
&gt;He thought it was going just other place with abusive people
&gt;He barely spoke to Concordia and harbored a little distain towards her
&gt;But as time went on he began open up more to his adoptive fox mother and even to some of the servents
&gt;he would talk about what his friends and himself would do for fun
&gt;sometimes the boy would cry, remembering all the horrible things in his life
&gt;During those times he had no one to go to
&gt;But now he has a caring anthro fox mother to go to in those times of distress
&gt;Concordia would do her best to comfort her human son when he was upset or angry
&gt;She would have him lay down in her lap and rub is head, singing some old songs she heard while growing up in a soft spoken tone
&gt;to Charlie this was heaven
&gt;finally he had a home where he wasn&#039;t seen as a just a pet, but as a living being

&gt;at some point in time Charlie began developing feelings towards his vixen mother
&gt;it started when he was being homeschooled
&gt;Concordia tought the boy herself, having majored in general studies
&gt;Charlie started noticing her features much more
&gt;She was slim all around but she did have curves
&gt;She had petite breasts, possibly only b cup in size
&gt;Her ass wasn&#039;t plump but it&#039;s probably firm and round
&gt;Charlie thought that Concordia noticed him checking her out because she would tease him whenever it looked he was looking at her
&gt;most of the time it&#039;s just playful talk
&gt;other times she used her tail
&gt;it was like that for a few months
&gt;it never escalated to anything physical before
&gt;until one cold January day

&gt;it&#039;s new years ever
&gt;Concordia didn&#039;t have anything planned for it
&gt;The servents took the day off
&gt;it was just the boy and the fox
&gt;oh and the furnace for the heat is busted
&gt;there was suppose to be a guy to come and fix it but they never showed up
&gt;Concordia wasn&#039;t really bothered by the cold but Charlie doesn&#039;t have a coat of fur
&gt;The fox had the briliant idea of snuggling together wrapped in a blanket
&gt;so the fox mother and her human son got close together in an embrace to warm themselves up
&gt;it took awhile for the warmth to take affect on Charlie
&gt;He closed his eyes as he sat there in the lap of his Vixen mom with a blanket draped over them
&gt;&quot;See dear isn&#039;t this nice?&quot;
&gt;&quot;mhmm.&quot;
&gt;Concordia took pleasure in petting her son&#039;s hair
&gt;Something about the feeling his hair against her fur felt nice
&gt;after some time they decided to watch the new years ball drop
&gt;they watched it on a new tv that was bought couple of weeks ago
&gt;the tv roared with the sound of millions cheering as the ball finally dropped
&gt;&quot;Happy new years, Charlie.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Happy new years, Mom.&quot;

&gt;Concordia&#039;s mind started racing
&gt;did Charlie just call her &#039;mom&#039;?
&gt;he never called her mom before
&gt;he always calls her by her last name
&gt;but this is new
&gt;what made him say it now she wondered
&gt;her thinking was interupted by soft snores coming from the now sleeping Charlie
&gt;He looks so peaceful as he sleeps
&gt;&quot;....mom...&quot;
&gt;aw he&#039;s dreaming about Concordia-
&gt;&quot;...please...don&#039;t hit me...&quot;
&gt;what
&gt;Hit him? Why would she hit him?
&gt;&quot;no please no no no stop please.&quot;
&gt;Charlie is starting to thrash
&gt;&quot;NO STOP STOP PLEASE IM SORRY!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Charlie! Charlie!&quot;
&gt;the fox is shaking her son, trying free him from what ever is tormenting him
&gt;Charlie wakes up, giving a small scream
&gt;tears are going down is face
&gt;his eyes are red and raw
&gt;&quot;Ch-Charlie?&quot;
&gt;The boy breaks down crying
&gt;Concordia immediately tries to calm her distraught son
&gt;after a good 10 minutes Charlie calms down

 &gt;&gt;11660888
&gt;Concordia decides that it&#039;s about time to get ready for bed
&gt;the fox tells Charlie to follow her
&gt;They arrive at a similar looking door to Charlie&#039;s
&gt;Obviously it&#039;s Concordia&#039;s room
&gt;the two enter the larger, spacious, equally empty room
&gt;Charlie and Concordia never did go out to get new furniture yet
&gt;The room is much bigger than Charlie&#039;s
&gt;A king size bed lays centered to the far wall with a Flat screen mounted to the opposite wall
&gt;A closet occupies the right wall and A much larger bathroom entrance to the left
&gt;&quot;I want you to go get in the shower and get cleaned up.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Alright Mom.&quot;
&gt;There it is again
&gt;He just called her &#039;Mom&#039;
&gt;Concordia starts wondering if Charlie really had such a hard life that he considered her is first real &#039;Mom&#039;
&gt;Her train of thought halted as the sound of the shower started
&gt;Right, A shower
&gt;Concordia undresses herself and tosses the dress she on to the side
&gt;She step towards the shower and opens the glass door
&gt;Charlie looks at Concordia with a surprised expression
&gt;&quot;w-what a-are you d-doing?!&#039;
&gt;&quot;What? It&#039;s only a shower. Plus you have seen me naked.&quot;
&gt;It was an unusual thought to her
&gt;The boy who sees her as a mother is seeing her in her most natural self 
&gt;&quot;Charlie could you wash my back for me? I&#039;ll get my front.&quot;
&gt;Charlie helped her wash her back
&gt;Charlie can&#039;t explain why this feels weird
&gt;It&#039;s true he has seen her naked before while showering in the past
&gt;It wasn&#039;t strange for them to take showers together since Concordia needs help washing her fur
&gt;But this time it&#039;s, different
&gt;Charlie feels hot and flustered when near the vixen like this
&gt;Running his hands through her soft wet fur
&gt;feeling her
&gt;Exploring her beautiful fox body
&gt;He want to be closer to her
&gt;He needs her
&gt;Concordia accidentally backs into Charlie when some soap gets in her eyes
&gt;She soon learn learns how big he is
&gt;&quot;Ch-Charlie!&quot; the fox yelped 
&gt;Oh god
&gt;Her son his hard
&gt;is it because of her?
&gt;Concordia mind raced with question on what is happening 

&gt;Her thoughts were interrupted when an uninvited hand found itself between her rump and playing with her slit
&gt;The Arctic Fox jump at the touch
&gt;&quot;Charlie what has gotten into you!?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I d-d-on&#039;t know. I feel so happy when I&#039;m around you and I.. I...&quot;
&gt;the boy was clearly confused
&gt;he doesn&#039;t know to do physically, emotionally, and mentally
&gt;but then again it is normal for kids his age to start exploring their bodies
&gt;and Concordia was going help him
&gt;her son
&gt;Concordia composed herself
&gt;&quot;Charlie, can you wash my front now?&quot;
&gt;Charlie just stood there
&gt;&quot;Charlie, do as your told.&quot;
&gt;In a fast fluid motion Charlie start to wash his mother&#039;s front
&gt;First he started with the arms
&gt;then her stomach
&gt;then
&gt;her breasts

&gt;&quot;what&#039;s the matter Charlie?&quot;
&gt;&quot;N-nothing.&quot;
&gt;He began to wash the fox&#039;s breast
&gt;They were soft, squishy albeit small
&gt;Concordia took sharp breaths as the boy began to play with her breasts
&gt;She was enjoying this
&gt;But she shouldn&#039;t
&gt;This kid sees her as his mother
&gt;But it feels too good to stop
&gt;&quot;Charlie, lower.&quot;
&gt;Charlie moved his hands down her body till they reach her slit
&gt;Charlie started run his fingers along the entrance of her snatch
&gt;Sometimes he would rub her clit, garnering a moan from the fox
&gt;Charlie pushed further, sending on of his fingers inside of Concordia&#039;s tight hole
&gt;The arctic fox started to breath faster and heavier every
&gt;She wouldn&#039;t last much longer if this continued
&gt;&quot;Ch-Charlie, stop. I think were done showering, the water&#039;s getting cold.&quot;
&gt;Concordia stopped the water
&gt;The two stepped out and helped one another dry off
&gt;It took awhile before Concordia was dried
&gt;so much fur
&gt;her tail was the worst
&gt;After they finished drying off the both headed for the bed
&gt;&quot;Keep your clothes off Charlie, let Momma&#039;s fur keep you warm.&quot;
&gt;The two joined each other on the bed
&gt;Charlie was still hard and his member wasn&#039;t going to go down
&gt;&quot;Awww poor baby, I forgot all about you and your problem there. Well, for making me feel good why don&#039;t I make you feel good, Hmm?&quot;

&gt;Concordia moved snake like toward Charlies standing soldier
&gt;Without delay she took the rock hard penis into her maw
&gt;The penis manages to reach the throat despite the muzzle that would normally prevent such thing
&gt;Concordia&#039;s tongue moved wildly, trying to get a taste of human dick that&#039;s in her mouth
&gt;She start to bob her head, causing Charlie instinctively buck his hips
&gt;Charlie starts to tense up, his bucking getting faster
&gt;Soon seed starts to pour into the fox&#039;s mouth
&gt;The taste of her child&#039;s semen is intoxicating
&gt;However Concordia thought that Charlie would go soft
&gt;He&#039;s still diamond hard
&gt;the fox drinks all of the semen
&gt;She sees charlie panting and moaning
&gt;&quot;How was that Charlie?&quot;
&gt;&quot;It felt... Amazing... thank you.&quot;
&gt;&quot;We&#039;ll considering how you&#039;re still &#039;standing&#039; I&#039;d say we get on to the main course.&quot;
&gt;With Charlie laying down, Concordia positions her soak pussy over his dick and slowly lowers herself onto him
&gt;Moans and gasps escape from Charlie as he feels his mother&#039;s tight walls hug his penis
&gt;&quot;Ah oh god you&#039;re big guy Charlie.&quot;
&gt;For you
&gt;Concordia starts to raise and lower herself, going as slow as possible to savor this feeling
&gt;Charlie starts bucking into his mom
&gt;&quot;How, how are you feeling Charlie?&quot;
&gt;Concordia&#039;s question was met with moans from the boy
&gt;guess that means it&#039;s good

&gt;Concordia has been riding charlie for a few minutes
&gt;She&#039;s surprised he even lasted this long
&gt;However she isn&#039;t gonna last much longer
&gt;&quot;Ch-Charlie... Charlie, I love you Charlie I love you!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I-I love you too mom!&quot;
&gt;Concordia leans down and kisses her son
&gt;She forces her tongue into his mouth
&gt;Charlie reciprocates
&gt;Concordia starts moving fast and faster as she reaches her orgasm
&gt;and when she reaches it it hits hard
&gt;She makes a sharp gasp and seizes up
&gt;Charlie feels the walls of her vagina tighten around his member
&gt;that feeling is all that was needed to send him into climax
&gt;He pushes as deep as far as he can and fills her with his seed
&gt;Concordia couldn&#039;t believe how much Charlie was giving her
&gt;She though there would be less cum after she blew him
&gt;A few minutes pass and the pair&#039;s climax reaches it&#039;s end
&gt;Concordia lays down on top of her son
&gt;A content smile forms on her face as the two lay in the afterglow
&gt;&quot;Th-thank you, Mom.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Your welcome sweetie.&quot;
&gt;The arctic fox plants a kiss on Charlie&#039;s forehead
&gt;&quot;I love you, son.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I love you too, mom.&quot;
The two of them fall asleep together in an embrace

&gt;it&#039;s been a few years after Charlie and Concordia shared the same bed
&gt;It was a rare occasion
&gt;It became even rarer when Charlie moved out for college
&gt;He barely has time to see his adoptive fox mother
&gt;and vice versa
&gt;Concordia has been married to another fox for 5 years now
&gt;They already have about 3 kids
&gt;still when Charlie does visit his mom he makes sure it&#039;s a good time
&gt;However all good things must end
&gt;Concordia died from an aggressive form brain cancer
&gt;Everyone one was heartbroken when it happened
&gt;But Charlie was affect the most
&gt;He lost the only person he called &#039;Mom&#039;
&gt;days later when going through Concordia&#039;s stuff, Charlie found a jewelry box
&gt;In it was an assortment of high end jewelry, possibly worth thousands
&gt;There was also a locket with a picture of Charlie and Concordia
&gt;He took the locket and left the other stuff
&gt;to him the memories of the fox who took him in and gave him a good life was priceless

Author notes:
Charlie and Concordia did eventually get furniture at one point.
Of course Concordia&#039;s new In-laws got the furniture too</textarea>
