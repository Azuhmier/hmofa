Come on baby. I need to go to work&quot; you whisper, rubbing your hands up and down her sides, spreading warmth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gives a gentle &quot;nah&quot; and squeezes her breasts together forcefully.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;6 layers of blankets cover you both, and the 7 foot tall croc has her bulk pressed on top of you, pinning you, but not knocking the wind out of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your hands rub her ticklish spots, right where the soft scales of her tummy meets the rough scales of her back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gives a few low guttural laughs, trying to keep her mouth and eyes closed as she giggles softly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They send deep vibrations through your body as you gently tickle and rub.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come on babe, Ineed to get up&quot; you whisper once more, feeling her huge breasts pressed on either side of your face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wanted to stay put, to feel her vibrations and just love on Bella, but life got in the way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still, you take a few moments to enjoy Bella and her body; your hands trail up her body to her large breasts to give a few longing squeezes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She reacts happily with a deeper Bellow that you swear resonates in your soul.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can feel your body responding to the gentle caress of your lover and want to indulge yourself with her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You longed to take her on this bed, to pound away at her as she moaned out sweet words of encouragement.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But those wants would need to take a rain check.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come on Bella, lemme go and get to work&quot; you mutter out, rubbing your hands from her breasts to the sides her body.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A soft &quot;Noooo, warm, Anon&quot; is heard as Bella tucks her arms around you further, pressing your face deeper into her chest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Cursing about having to leave, you wiggle out of her grasp, and then out from under the blankets.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bella caught on halfway through your daring escape; and although she lets you go, she doesn&#039;t look pleased about it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The large albino crocodile anthro huffs and stares at you in dismay, snuggling the blankets around her with a small shiver.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You give a halfhearted smile, then close the window and turn on the large space heater in the bedroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s been a little more than 2 years since you and Bella &quot;hooked up&quot;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Meaning she gave you a ride while you were buzzed and one thing lead to another.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In that time, you had moved in with her, away from the shady apartments, to the house on stilts she had inherited.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now it was winter, and Bella&#039;s shrimp season ended.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She wouldn&#039;t be able to sail the cold winter of the golf even if the season continued; the cold winter wind would snatch her warmth away like death gently beckoning a soul.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you could as a human.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You worked every chance you got to earn a bit of extra cash to get ahead of bills, and for a little something extra.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Making sure the space heater is set to max for Bella, you pull on your work gear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, you turn it on for her and for you;

What are you doing out of bed?

She murmurs as you pull the lights away from her body.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stands still expectantly, as if movement would be too much for her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When at last you get the lights away from her, she immediately wraps you in a hug, making your towel fall to the ground and you feel your feet lifted from the ground.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The present of fresh meat forgotten, you try your best to give her some of your warmth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She carries you, still wrapped in a hug, to the bedroom and to the bed, where she flops down on top of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was like you weighed nothing to her and you feel the side of her long snout pressed against your neck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Feeling the soft bed sheets against your skin and the smooth scales of Bella&#039;s underbelly is divine, her full weight pinning you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s not alarming though, not by a long shot; this weight was one you were more than used too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is Bella settling in to cuddle you while her predator sense got to dominate you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Something about her being a predator made her always want to be in command of the love making.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like the morning, she&#039;s pressed atop of you again, her breasts pushing both sides of your face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But unlike the morning, you don’t have places to be.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your hands grab and squeeze her breasts, gently massaging and groping them, while teasing her inverted nipples out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gives a happy bellow, sending vibrations through you while she fishes the blankets over you both.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;6 layers of blankets are an amazing source of warmth when coupled with a Human and her thicc thighs spread atop of you, bending softly to raise her body from atop of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Warmth permeates your body and out to your your crocodilian lover, as she grinds her wetness softly against you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;God dam your body reacting to her amazingly sexy body.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now full of warmth, her sluggish movements and shivering stammers are gone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Instead, her hands push her breasts on either side of her face and she slowly writhes her body on top of yours.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Just stay still hon, let me take care of you&quot; She moans between her bellows.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t even try to fight it as she glides her smooth body against yours, no point in fighting it; she has you pinned and all you can do is enjoy it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She plants her knees on either side of your body and lifts herself a little, spreading her legs and rubbing a wetness against your erect member.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s not like your body wouldn&#039;t react to having huge tits pressed on you, plus the vibrations from a very frisky croc.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gently glides her wetness over the tip of your engorged shaft, letting the head of your member slide in between her lips.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her clit and opening slide over the head of your shaft, making you want to thrust up into her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her weight prevents you from doing that though, and with each attempt to thrust she gives a soft, low giggle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Mmmm I feel you Love, shush and let me handle it for you&quot; She cooes, squishing her breasts together harder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a slow deliberate movement, she runs your member along her wet slit until she positions her quivering opening right on the head of your shaft.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The movement makes you want to grab her ass, force your way into her and pound until her was screaming and you were claiming her as yours.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That was, of course, in your dreams.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Reality was your arms were pinned in a position where you could only squeeze and tease her huge tits, your legs were pinned by her thicc legs and tail, barely able to move and her bulk held you down in a sweet embrace you could not escape from.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The tip of her long snout presses against your forehead in the equivalent of a kiss from her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Dropping her hips, she presses your shaft deep into her, earning a deep hiss of approval and pleasure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At this point, you&#039;re just along for the ride as she slowly undulated her body against you with slow precise movements.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This was different from a quick fuck, in more than one way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Usually quick fucks are about sheer quick release, pump into a chick until you got off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This was slow, carefully calculated movements from Bella to get more from the act.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yes, the want for release was present, but you wanted more than that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her inner walls tighten softly against you as she moves her hips in slow rhythmic movements, the vibrations adding a quivering sensation.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The feelings from the vibrations added a level of pleasure that was nearly indescribable.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was a feeling that added to and multiplied the pleasure felt from her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It made the tightness from her wetness into a wriggling and massaging feeling instead of a constant pressure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sure, she was less active now that there was cold, but you recall the days you could get behind her and pull her thicc tail (a thing she really liked) and get clamping wetness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As Bella undulated her hips against yours in a soft rhythmic motion, her snout plants more gentle kisses against your face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Mmmm I Love you Anon&quot; she half mumbles as she does so.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel her hands move from pressing her breasts onto your face, to finding your fingers and interlocking with them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her slow rhythmic pounding of your pelvis quickens slightly, showing her impatience at the buildup.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grimace and focus on the kisses over the wet pleasure that Bella was giving you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A Feat that was more mind over matter in real life.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her slow yet pleasurable movements had eroded any resistance you thought you could have.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She still has her huge breasts pressed on either side of your head when you finally gasp out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;B-bella I’m g-gonna cum&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She doesn&#039;t respond but her bellows redouble and the pace of her gentle massaging movements steady up on the pace, making sure it was exactly what you needed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Instead of crying out that you were cumming you plant a kiss on her snout and try your hardest to hug her close while you unload into your love without any reservation, her bellows of happiness resonating within you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She snuggles against you, her eyes almost half drunk in ecstasy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her grip around you redoubles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I Love you Anon&quot;

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Cold winter wind blows through the windows, waking you with its cold crispness.
&gt;That and your alarm clock.
&gt;Winter has come, and there is a sharp coldness to the air that you aren&#039;t used too down here in the south.
&gt;A deep bellowing resonated within you and a pressing force pins you as you try to wake up.
&gt;Your eyes open to Bella pinning you as she usually does, her huge breasts on either side of your face and her large jaw pressed against your chin.
&gt;Her deep bellowing snores continue, unconcerned about you waking up for work.
&gt;They shake you to your core as her arms wrap around you, snuggling you close.
&gt;Izabella; Bella, is a large American Crocodile, because of that, she craves your warmth in these cold December months.
&gt;Even in the chilly autumn months, she loved falling asleep on top of you, smothering you in her smooth underbelly scales.
&gt;Once winter hit, she opened the bedroom window, allowing the cold winter air into her now shared cabin so you were forced to cuddle her even more.
&gt;&quot;Bella... Come on baby. I need to go to work&quot; you whisper, rubbing your hands up and down her sides, spreading warmth.
&gt;She gives a gentle &quot;nah&quot; and squeezes her breasts together forcefully.
&gt;6 layers of blankets cover you both, and the 7 foot tall croc has her bulk pressed on top of you, pinning you, but not knocking the wind out of you.
&gt;Your hands rub her ticklish spots, right where the soft scales of her tummy meets the rough scales of her back.
&gt;She gives a few low guttural laughs, trying to keep her mouth and eyes closed as she giggles softly.
&gt;They send deep vibrations through your body as you gently tickle and rub.
&gt;&quot;Come on babe, Ineed to get up&quot; you whisper once more, feeling her huge breasts pressed on either side of your face.
&gt;You wanted to stay put, to feel her vibrations and just love on Bella, but life got in the way.
&gt;Still, you take a few moments to enjoy Bella and her body; your hands trail up her body to her large breasts to give a few longing squeezes.
&gt;She reacts happily with a deeper Bellow that you swear resonates in your soul.
&gt;You can feel your body responding to the gentle caress of your lover and want to indulge yourself with her.
&gt;You longed to take her on this bed, to pound away at her as she moaned out sweet words of encouragement.
&gt;But those wants would need to take a rain check.
&gt;&quot;Come on Bella, lemme go and get to work&quot; you mutter out, rubbing your hands from her breasts to the sides her body.
&gt;A soft &quot;Noooo, warm, Anon&quot; is heard as Bella tucks her arms around you further, pressing your face deeper into her chest.
&gt;Cursing about having to leave, you wiggle out of her grasp, and then out from under the blankets.
&gt;Bella caught on halfway through your daring escape; and although she lets you go, she doesn&#039;t look pleased about it.
&gt;The large albino crocodile anthro huffs and stares at you in dismay, snuggling the blankets around her with a small shiver.
&gt;You give a halfhearted smile, then close the window and turn on the large space heater in the bedroom.
&gt;It&#039;s been a little more than 2 years since you and Bella &quot;hooked up&quot;.
&gt;Meaning she gave you a ride while you were buzzed and one thing lead to another.
&gt;In that time, you had moved in with her, away from the shady apartments, to the house on stilts she had inherited.
&gt;Now it was winter, and Bella&#039;s shrimp season ended.
&gt;She wouldn&#039;t be able to sail the cold winter of the golf even if the season continued; the cold winter wind would snatch her warmth away like death gently beckoning a soul.
&gt;But you could as a human.
&gt;You worked every chance you got to earn a bit of extra cash to get ahead of bills, and for a little something extra.
&gt;Making sure the space heater is set to max for Bella, you pull on your work gear.
&gt;Well, you turn it on for her and for you; no one wants to get dressed while frozen.
&gt;Bella has snuggled into the blankets as you got dressed, pulling the blankets still soaked in your ambient warmth around her.
&gt;Now as you look at her, she looks like a giant cocoon of wool and cotton, with just her snout sticking out.
&gt;Honestly, she looks like a giant burrito.
&gt;You walk over to the bed and plant a kiss on the tip of her snout, earning a sleepily mumbled &quot;love you&quot;
&gt;Smiling softly and wishing you could stay with her, you pull away and head out into the wilderness.
&gt;As soon as you step outside you&#039;re sure its winter, frost kisses everything with its white presence.
&gt;The cold muddy ground is frozen with frost covering the surface, supporting your weight as you walk towards your car without any give.
&gt;You get into your car and start it up, then wait for it to warm up.
&gt;Ugh... You didn&#039;t want to work today, besides the fact that Bella was gorgeous and sexy and you just wanted to spend all day inside with her.
&gt;Today is Christmas Eve, and you had never worked anywhere that had made you work Christmas Eve.
&gt;Well, you weren&#039;t forced to work actually.
&gt;Captain Howard had asked you to work today, at double the usual pay rate.
&gt;You agreed because of 2 reasons, it gave you an excuse to leave the cabin to pick up Bella&#039;s presents and paid a lot.
&gt;The drive through the woods is peaceful and quiet; most animals had decided to stay in for the morning, leaving you to traverse the dirt roads.
&gt;Frost licks the leaves and the mud, giving a soft crunching sound as you drove over it.
&gt;And to think you had disliked the Bayou when you moved here.
&gt;Guess good company really helps brighten that mood and thoughts about places.
&gt;You drive calmly through the dirt roads, noting the water levels of the nearby water.
&gt;Next week you were probably going to have to drive the car and Bella&#039;s truck to high ground and use her dingy to get to work due to the water rising.
&gt;Heh high ground.
&gt;Thoughts of Obiwan dance through your head as you drive to the piers.
&gt;You get out of the car, already dressed in your waterproof gear, ready for the day.
&gt;&quot;Hey there Anon, let’s haul in a ton of extra trash&quot; Capt. Howard greets you with a smile and a wave as he get his boots on.
&gt;Howard was a thin man, raised on the water so he knew all the waterways and currents.
&gt;He hired you simply out of faith, you were a city boy looking for a job and he said he saw something in you that would be good for his line of work.
&gt;That line of work is hauling trash out of the gulf and nearby rivers.
&gt;It wasn&#039;t complicated work, but it was hard work.
&gt;Find patches of floating garbage and haul it out of the water, while you dug through it, picking out wildlife and tossing them back into the water.
&gt;Again, Not difficult, but hard.
&gt;Sometimes it was a small 2 pound fish that got caught in a plastic ring, which was no big deal. 
&gt;Other times, it was a 95 lb. turtle that was unlucky enough to get caught in a net; leaving you to pick up the struggling animal and chuck it to the water again.
&gt;A few times they were gators, a few times crocs, and more often than you enjoyed; dead bodies.
&gt;More than once you got turtle slapped but thick muscular fins.
&gt;But on the plus side, if you found anything among the trash that was worth something, Capt. Howard allowed you to keep it.
&gt;Today would be no different, it would be a day of picking through trash.
&gt;You clamber onto the trash boat and head out to sea and give a quick thumbs up to Howard
&gt;Your mind thinking about Bella, her gentle bellows of happiness and the breasts pressed against you.
&gt;Ughhh those breasts.
&gt;Your mind whirls to the first time you got to experience them.
&gt;The inverted nipples, the pressure of them wrapped around your member and the feeling of her soft scales.
&gt;Your day races by quickly, your head on autopilot as you think about Bella and little else.
&gt;Plus the gift you had planned out.
&gt;Before you know it, the day is ending with the sun setting to the west.
&gt;So much trash, so many things thrown away and forgotten by careless people.
&gt;Well, their carelessness paid your bills.
&gt;You help moor the trash boat and Howard pays you 600 Dollars for your work today, giving you a hearty clap on the back.
&gt;The sun begins to hide behind the tree line as you both head to your vehicles; you get to your car as Howard starts his truck.
&gt;&quot;Tell Bella I say hi&quot; he calls out of his truck as he pulls away, spraying wet gravel from his tires. 
&gt;You nod and wave at him, then start your drive, not to Bella, but into town.
&gt;The town is covered in decorations that were &quot;heirlooms&quot;.
&gt;Festive lights coil around anything and everything, candy canes, a nativity displays and the words &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; adorn almost all of the darkened buildings.
&gt;This place was far enough removed to not care about Political correctness, none of that &quot;happy holidays&quot; stuff.
&gt;Everywhere is closed, but you made prior arrangements for this.
&gt;You pull your car behind the local butcher shop and find exactly what you are looking for.
&gt;A large cooler is waiting by the back door of the closed butcher shop, and you&#039;re sure it has what you ordered.
&gt;Planning ahead has its advantages and this is one of them.
&gt;You pull the lip open and peer inside.
&gt;The cooler is filled with steaks of various cuts; rib eye, strip, T-bone, filet mignon, top sirloin and just about every other type.
&gt;You arranged this ahead of time with the butcher.
&gt;It’s hard to hide a present of delicious food from an apex predator when you live with her.
&gt;You smile as you look it all over.
&gt;It&#039;s perfect for Bella.
&gt;How do you treat a croc who has everything she needs?
&gt;Treat her stomach!
&gt;You load the cooler into your trunk with a bit of effort, then head to destination number 2.
&gt;The local post office is closed, but the section where you can pick up mail from your P.O. Box is open.
&gt;A small box is waiting for you, heavier that it should be for its size, but you know it’s exactly what you ordered.
&gt;Gathering it quickly, you head back to Izabella&#039;s cabin, thinking about things to come.
&gt;The river rising in the rainy season and claiming the forest, boating to and from work.
&gt;Your mind wanders and your body moves on auto pilot as you think about it all. 
&gt;Before you know it, you’re parking your car in front of the raised cabin.
&gt;The lights are off and that’s not surprising, without heat Bella would go into a semi hibernative state, sleeping most of the day away.
&gt;This time of year was tough for her and for you because of that.
&gt;She said you could do what you want to her body while she slept, but it just wasn&#039;t the same as having the love there.
&gt;Hopefully you could get the cabin warm enough to keep her awake and to appreciate the present you got her for Christmas.
&gt;Hauling the large cooler up the steps is easier than you thought it would be, you guess the years working in the trash boat industry has improved your physique.
&gt;Slowly, you slide open the front door and make your way inside, shutting the door behind you almost silently.
&gt;its warm in the cabin, warmer than you thought it would be, but that doesn&#039;t bother you as you set the cooler on the table, then strip out of your wet, trash smelling clothing.
&gt;A quick shower and you could join Bella again and get pinned by her tits again.
&gt;Unf, those tits.
&gt;You leave the lights off as you enter the only bathroom the cabin has and only then turn on the light; no one wants to shower in the dark.
&gt;The bathroom isn&#039;t big, being just a toilet and a stand up shower, but it has warm water; not hot water, just warm.
&gt;Not quite hot enough to sooth out the tension in your muscles, but warm enough to still be somewhat soothing.
&gt;Bella&#039;s shower products cover 3 full shelves of the hanging shelf thing you bought a while back for organizations sake.
&gt;How she could need so many things for her scales was beyond you, she didn’t have ANY body hair yet still has the &quot;Goo fetish&quot; most females have.
&gt;That is, she amasses half-filled bottle of soap and shampoo and lotion, never running out, yet constantly needing more.
&gt;Meanwhile you have 3 things in the shower.
&gt;Shampoo of some sort (Bella picked it because she liked the smell), body wash and a razor to shave.
&gt;You clean yourself quickly, not wanting to waste any more time away from Bella.
&gt;She might be half asleep most of the time now, but you still wanted to be near her.
&gt;Leaving the door to the bathroom partly open and the light on, you plan to use the light to guide you into the bedroom and to your undergarments for sleep.
&gt;The Heat of the cabin is more than that of the bathroom and your goal was within reach, another night and probably most of tomorrow snuggled with Bella.
&gt;However as you venture out into the cabin from the bathroom, a dazzling array of brilliantly colored lights appears from the center of Bella&#039;s living room.
&gt;The room where you and Bella first made love.
&gt;In the center of the room, Bella stands nude, shivering slightly while wrapped in Christmas lights, looking at you expectantly.
&gt;&quot;H-Hey Hon, w-welcome home! R-ready f-for your present?&quot; she asks with a smile filled with forced confidence.
&gt;You can tell she&#039;s struggling against the cold, the shivers sending tremors up and down her body.
&gt;God, it must be torture for her there.
&gt;&quot;Bella?! What are you doing out of bed? Isn&#039;t it too cold for you?&quot; you ask, nearly dropping your towel in shock.
&gt;You rush forwards as fast as you can, trying to keep the towel around you.
&gt;With more dexterity that you should have at the sight of your naked lover, you unwrap your &quot;present&quot;.
&gt;&quot;I-I w-wanted you to have a g-good present&quot; She murmurs as you pull the lights away from her body.
&gt;She stands still expectantly, as if movement would be too much for her.
&gt;When at last you get the lights away from her, she immediately wraps you in a hug, making your towel fall to the ground and you feel your feet lifted from the ground.
&gt;The present of fresh meat forgotten, you try your best to give her some of your warmth.
&gt;She carries you, still wrapped in a hug, to the bedroom and to the bed, where she flops down on top of you.
&gt;It was like you weighed nothing to her and you feel the side of her long snout pressed against your neck.
&gt;Feeling the soft bed sheets against your skin and the smooth scales of Bella&#039;s underbelly is divine, her full weight pinning you.
&gt;It&#039;s not alarming though, not by a long shot; this weight was one you were more than used too.
&gt;This is Bella settling in to cuddle you while her predator sense got to dominate you.
&gt;Something about her being a predator made her always want to be in command of the love making.
&gt;Like the morning, she&#039;s pressed atop of you again, her breasts pushing both sides of your face.
&gt;But unlike the morning, you don’t have places to be.
&gt;Your hands grab and squeeze her breasts, gently massaging and groping them, while teasing her inverted nipples out.
&gt;She gives a happy bellow, sending vibrations through you while she fishes the blankets over you both.
&gt;6 layers of blankets are an amazing source of warmth when coupled with a Human and her thicc thighs spread atop of you, bending softly to raise her body from atop of you.
&gt;Warmth permeates your body and out to your your crocodilian lover, as she grinds her wetness softly against you.
&gt;God dam your body reacting to her amazingly sexy body.
&gt;Now full of warmth, her sluggish movements and shivering stammers are gone.
&gt;Instead, her hands push her breasts on either side of her face and she slowly writhes her body on top of yours.
&gt;&quot;Just stay still hon, let me take care of you&quot; She moans between her bellows.
&gt;You don&#039;t even try to fight it as she glides her smooth body against yours, no point in fighting it; she has you pinned and all you can do is enjoy it.
&gt;She plants her knees on either side of your body and lifts herself a little, spreading her legs and rubbing a wetness against your erect member.
&gt;It&#039;s not like your body wouldn&#039;t react to having huge tits pressed on you, plus the vibrations from a very frisky croc.
&gt;She gently glides her wetness over the tip of your engorged shaft, letting the head of your member slide in between her lips.
&gt;Her clit and opening slide over the head of your shaft, making you want to thrust up into her.
&gt;Her weight prevents you from doing that though, and with each attempt to thrust she gives a soft, low giggle.
&gt;&quot;Mmmm I feel you Love, shush and let me handle it for you&quot; She cooes, squishing her breasts together harder.
&gt;With a slow deliberate movement, she runs your member along her wet slit until she positions her quivering opening right on the head of your shaft.
&gt;The movement makes you want to grab her ass, force your way into her and pound until her was screaming and you were claiming her as yours.
&gt;That was, of course, in your dreams.
&gt;Reality was your arms were pinned in a position where you could only squeeze and tease her huge tits, your legs were pinned by her thicc legs and tail, barely able to move and her bulk held you down in a sweet embrace you could not escape from.
&gt;The tip of her long snout presses against your forehead in the equivalent of a kiss from her.
&gt;Dropping her hips, she presses your shaft deep into her, earning a deep hiss of approval and pleasure.
&gt;At this point, you&#039;re just along for the ride as she slowly undulated her body against you with slow precise movements.
&gt;This was different from a quick fuck, in more than one way.
&gt;Usually quick fucks are about sheer quick release, pump into a chick until you got off.
&gt;This was slow, carefully calculated movements from Bella to get more from the act.
&gt;Yes, the want for release was present, but you wanted more than that.
&gt;Her inner walls tighten softly against you as she moves her hips in slow rhythmic movements, the vibrations adding a quivering sensation.
&gt;The feelings from the vibrations added a level of pleasure that was nearly indescribable.
&gt;It was a feeling that added to and multiplied the pleasure felt from her.
&gt;It made the tightness from her wetness into a wriggling and massaging feeling instead of a constant pressure.
&gt;Sure, she was less active now that there was cold, but you recall the days you could get behind her and pull her thicc tail (a thing she really liked) and get clamping wetness.
&gt;As Bella undulated her hips against yours in a soft rhythmic motion, her snout plants more gentle kisses against your face.
&gt;&quot;Mmmm I Love you Anon&quot; she half mumbles as she does so.
&gt;You feel her hands move from pressing her breasts onto your face, to finding your fingers and interlocking with them.
&gt;Her slow rhythmic pounding of your pelvis quickens slightly, showing her impatience at the buildup.
&gt;You grimace and focus on the kisses over the wet pleasure that Bella was giving you.
&gt;A Feat that was more mind over matter in real life.
&gt;Her slow yet pleasurable movements had eroded any resistance you thought you could have.
&gt;She still has her huge breasts pressed on either side of your head when you finally gasp out.
&gt;&quot;B-bella I’m g-gonna cum&quot;
&gt;She doesn&#039;t respond but her bellows redouble and the pace of her gentle massaging movements steady up on the pace, making sure it was exactly what you needed.
&gt;Instead of crying out that you were cumming you plant a kiss on her snout and try your hardest to hug her close while you unload into your love without any reservation, her bellows of happiness resonating within you.
&gt;She snuggles against you, her eyes almost half drunk in ecstasy.
&gt;Her grip around you redoubles.
&gt;&quot;I Love you Anon&quot; She grumbles happily.
&gt;&quot;I Love you too Bella&quot; you say with a smile, attempting to hug her.
&gt;She gives a happy sigh of contentment and snuggles further onto you, ensuring you aren’t going anywhere for the night and leaving your still erect member deep inside her.
&gt;You can&#039;t even fight it as deep snores come from her and you feel the weight of the day hitting you.
&gt;It was a long day, filled with hardship and want for your love.
&gt;The fact that her wetness continued to try and milk you for your seed was nothing more than bliss as you closed your eyes and fell asleep.


&gt;You awake to the feeling of being weightless.
&gt;After months of waking up being pinned by Bella, waking up without her on you was almost disconcerting.
&gt;You slowly get up and pull on a pair of ugly pajama pants, noting how hot it felt in the cabin.
&gt;As you walk out of the bedroom, you notice Bella tending to the stove naked except for a Santa hat on her head and an apron.
&gt;&quot;Bella?&quot;
&gt;&quot;You left the heater on last night, it&#039;s hot enough for me to cook&quot; She muses, looking over her shoulder and wriggling her thick tail.
&gt;You slowly walk to her and wrap your arms around her waist pressing her back to your chest.
&gt;&quot;I see you found part of my gift&quot; You say, looking at the stove.
&gt;In a frying pan rests a steak, typically paired with eggs for a breakfast meal.
&gt;&quot;I did! Thank you love&quot; she says, planting one of her snout kisses on the top of your head.
&gt;that means she hadn&#039;t found part 2 of your gift.
&gt;You break the hug and wander to your discarded clothes from last night, hoping she didn’t search them.
&gt;Fishing in your pockets from the night before, you fish what you are looking for.
&gt;Sure, Christmas was a silly time to do this but it was what you wanted.
&gt;Capt. Howard said you could keep want you found.
&gt;You had found a few gold necklaces and silver rings, studded with diamonds and rubys; and sent them to be forged into a beautiful chain of gold, silver and precious stones.
&gt;Holding the chain before you to Bella, you give a smile.
&gt;&quot;Bella?&quot; you asks pensively. 
&gt;The albino croc has her hands to the tip of her snout, looking from you to the shimmering chain.
&gt;&quot;Yes Anon?&quot; She says in barely over a whisper.
&gt;You take a deep breath; a breath filled with the love of this lady, the smell of steak prepared lovingly; and look at the sight of a beautiful woman in front of you.
&gt;It all steels your soul for the only question that matters.
&gt;&quot;Will you marry me?&quot;
&gt;There is only one word you hear behind a happy sob
&gt;&quot;Yes&quot;</textarea>
