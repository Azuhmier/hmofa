            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It is the year 142 Bello Victam.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are Anon Anonymous Curio, 4th son of Anon Anonymous Curio Scaeva.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Since you were a child, you’ve had a slave: a hyena girl named Appia who was raised alongside you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For years she was your partner-in-crime, your friend, your sister.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ate together.  You slept together.  You learned, fought, and played together.  You don’t recall a time when you weren’t together.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It seemed like the carefree days of playing out in the golden fields of Platum Aurum would never end.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But they did.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Appia has grown cold and distant.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She doesn’t look at you when you talk, her words terse and short.  She disappears for lengths at a time; and when you call for her she is slow to appear, but quick to leave.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She no longer sleeps alongside you, preferring the cold floor.  The floor of all things!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There was a time when she didn’t mind running naked with you through the fields, swimming nude in the pond.  Now she refuses to remove her clothes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s surly, aversive, and in rare cases downright hostile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It is bizarre.  You don’t recall doing anything to offend her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yet she acts like you’ve committed some unforgivable crime.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re going to need some advice on how to deal with this.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One day, without telling anyone, you leave for town.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Armed with a small purse of coins, you hope to get the help you need from the people of Platum Aurum.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Appia.  That is the name given to her when she were enslaved.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She is daughter of Matriarch Nyap-ga-nau of the now defunct White Neck clan, named for the white war paint they wore to battle instead of armor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At least that’s what she was told.  Appia don’t remember her tribal days, she was barely even a whelp when the legions came.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Appia has served in the family Anonymous by being the compatriot to their 4th son Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For years she has grown up with him, and have grown close to him.  She sees him like her brother.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But now, there’s more.  She stopped seeing Anon the boy she grew up with, and started seeing a man.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And it hurts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She aches for Anon, but she tries to distance herself at the same time.  It is wrong for a slave to lust for their master.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What she wants, what she doesn’t want, she’s constantly fighting herself.  And it manifests in unhealthy ways that only serve to alienate Anon from her, which only makes her angrier.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once she was able to speak with him about anything, and he to her.  Once she could speak Latin so fluently with him, even speaking a made up language they invented that was really just backwards Greek.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now she can no longer look him in the eye when speaking, lest her heart start beating uncontrollably.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now the words stumble out in a humiliating mess.  Every time she speaks to him, her throat seizes up and it is hard to speak and breathe.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So she speaks quickly, with few words and seeks to end any talk as soon as possible.  Anon leaves shrugging and Appia starts slapping her head for her stupidity.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once they ate at the same table.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now it hurts to be in the same room, watching him smile as the serving girl brings meals from the kitchen.  The way he dotes over her makes Appia so upset she-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She runs.  She slams her hands on the table, takes her food and leaves the room, eating as fast as she can before her throat closes up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once she shared a bed with him.  Always Anon would hold her close, her fur more comfortable that the sheets.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now she lays awake at nights, being so close to his warm body, his breathing in her ears, the scent of his body, and his legs brushing against hers.  Appia holds him close, her hands always reaching down to his thighs and touching his-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s too much!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Appia no longer shares the bed, afraid of what she’ll do if she stays next to him for a moment longer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once she had no trouble being naked around Anon, and saw nothing wrong with seeing Anon naked.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As they both aged it became apparent how different Anon is, and how his body made her desire something.  What she didn’t know, but it made her stammer and it made her nethers moist.  She couldn’t embarrass herself and her master by letting her see her incompetence!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now she covers herself, and makes herself scarce when Anon is in the nude.  No longer do they share the family’s private bath or wash in the hidey hole’s river.  She waits until Anon has finished and covered himself before she even thinks of stripping.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;’Oh by all the gods human and hyena what is wrong with me?’ Appia thinks to herself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There is only one place you can seek advice anonymously on such personal matters: the public toilets.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s not really spoken, but the private stalls of the public toilets have become a forum of the people.  Among the graffiti and crude insults are lines of conversations between men asking for advice.  Anything from who is the newest, hottest celebrity in the arena, to relationship advice, or if some weird bump on the ass cheek is something to be worried about.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With charcoal in hand you make your way to the empty building.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It is a new week.  The walls have been scraped clean of last week&#039;s messages.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pick a visible spot and not down your question</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Fellows, my slave whom I lived with for many years has suddenly grown upset with me through no fault of my own.  How do I make amends?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you leave.  And you wait.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In an hour, the toilets have seen many visitors already, men needing a place to empty their morning bladders.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You return to the wall.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Gaius is a woman who takes the phalli of men up his ass like a fish takes water.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Here I sit with Broken Heart.  For I ran to Shit, yet only Fart.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Publius is a slander of men, disregard his statements for nothing but wolf seed spews out.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That probably was meant for the Gaius writer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Is your slave man or woman?  Human or beast?  Details are needed man or not help can be given!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now you have something!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reply: “She is female.  Hyena.  Has just recently come of age to be a woman.  I have known her since she and I were but children in Nova Roma.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You leave again, opting to purchase a fresh roll and fish sauce with dried meat.  You’ll need an excuse to frequent the toilets...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Appia is worried.  Anon left this morning.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This feels so...wrong.  Anon never leaves home without you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But then, Anon had never been the brunt of your frustrations before either.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You begin to worry.  What if Anon was robbed?  Kidnapped?  He carries himself like a Patrician.  On his own, a wolf may try to steal him away!  They may try to torture him for fun!  Or rape him!  Or kill him!  And you can’t do anything!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">    &gt;But what if-oh no.  That’ can’t be it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Is he looking for another friend...another hyena?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The thought angers Appia.  Angry at the hyena that takes Anon from her.  Angry at Anon for not taking her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What if it’s not a hyena he finds but a wolf woman.  A wolf woman to accompany him everywhere, to eat with him, and swim with him, and sleep with him!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That’s unacceptable!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No ash colored bitch will steal Anon away!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">    &gt;But...she can’t go into town with a spear shouting curses.  The guards will lock her up on the spot.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But then what can she do?!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s clear she has to find Anon no matter what.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And even if she doesn’t have her weapon, she can still beat any wolf bitch senseless.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The thought calms Appia as she fastens her favorite red robe.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;’I will find you Anon’ she thinks to herself as she runs for town.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Over the next few hours you will stay near the toilets.  Men come and go, they piss and shit and scrape their own words on the walls.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you return to see the new words.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”The Praefectus Annonae is a horse fucking half wit that magically loses a quarter of grain every year.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”The Praefectuse Annonae is a lover of boys.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”The Censor’s spend more time with penis in mouth than pen in hand.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">    &gt;”Stop writing politics you jackasses!  It has no place on a shit wall!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Politics and shit go hand in hand.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Some sit to think.  Others shit and stink.  Some scratch their balls.  Others write on walls.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Long live the Warriors of the Warherd!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”The Warherd got fucked by the Legion years ago.  It is time to pluck your horns from your ass and be with your rightful master antler-boy!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Your slave, when has she been this way?  Was she ever this aggressive in the past?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Hyenas are temperamental and full of piss and vinegar.  Better to be with a deer woman who serves and knows her man is superior.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Deer women are full of genital lice”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait that last part.  Someone replied!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”My hyena slave has only began to act upset.  I am at my wit’s end to solving this.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You leave, camping outside the public toilets as people come and go.  After you believe sufficient time has passed, and because the street food is giving you the runs, you head back, braving the stink.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;More words are written</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Your slave, if she is a woman and upset, perhaps she is frustrated she cannot get satisfaction.  I have a hyena slave as well and I know.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Names or you lie.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”My hyena was lusting after a deer-man for nearly a year.  Yet the deer man never knew she existed.  Her lust manifested as rage and frustration towards the deer man and her peers.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”The legions in the west will fuck the sea dogs!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”They’re called the Otter-folk you nonce!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’ll call them dick warmers.  They will be fucked in every available hole.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Some write epics, others write on walls.  Some chase happiness, others suck my balls”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”A War of Poetry!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Wait, are you saying to me my hyena slave is angry because she is in love?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Again you leave.  Again you wait.  Again the call of nature comes and you are compelled to answer.  More writing on the walls.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Over and over this goes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”If you read these words, you are bored and take men’s penis up your ass”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Your hyena may indeed be experiencing love.  A strange concept to her is none explained it to her.  She may feel possessive of the object of her affections and show frustration if it isn’t returned.  From what you describe it may not just be love.  Lust and love.  Very likely with you.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”No sir, your hyena wants to plow you.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">    &gt;”Your hyena girl wants you to impregnate her.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">    &gt;”I want to impregnate the wolf girl in the tavern.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not in the markets, not in the bathouses.  Not in the temple, the forum, the arena, the slave markets, or even the brothels!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every possible spot Appia thinks she’d find Anon turned up nothing!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Where could he be?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Appia’s stomach twists into knots as she slowly makes her way home, some tiny sliver hoping Anon would be there waiting for her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yet even home, Anon was nowhere.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">    &gt;Now Appia began to panic.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her mind is filled with a million possibilities, all horrifying.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe he isn’t in the city.  Maybe he went to the ‘hole’.  He does like going there when he had enough of the world and wants to be by himself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe he found a new cavern and is trapped! </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If that’s true, she has to save him!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Are you certain this is hyena lust?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”More than certain. Wolf, or hyena, I encounter this time and time again with the slaves I raise.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”They say the Northern campaigns ran into a kingdom of foxes with many breasts.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”They also say your mother sells herself for money.  Is everything said by them true?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You know that I am the object of her affections?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”The way you describe her sounds like she is delirious for you.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I made bread.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I piss blood.  Do not hire the deerboy at the Itchy Wolf to satisfy you.  Or you will join me in pissing your life blood from your cock.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Do you love this slave of yours?  Do not be ashamed.  We are all men of maturity”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That is quite the question isn’t it?  Do you love Appia?  You never considered that before.  She had always been there for you; and you for her...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1"> &gt;If she was to leave you...by Jupiter you think you’re in love with your slave.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”By Jupiter I do.

I recognize your handwriting boy.  Frustrated she doesn’t notice you?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”How do I even profess love for a slave?  For so long she has been my servant.  How ignoble is it to love one below you.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Such romance happens more than you may believe.  I love my wolf wife once slave.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”And I love a peasant girl despite my status as Patrician”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I fuck wolf boys in the anus and they love me for it”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Crispus Calvus loves Drusa and Drusa loves Crispus Calvus”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”The longer you wait, the more irrational she will become.  Do as Crispus does to Drusa and love your hyena you fool!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Master Anon” Appia calls.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her voice echoes across the cavern walls.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Again she calls out for Anon.  All that greets her is the deafening silence of the hole.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tears begin to well up in Appia’s eyes.  Where is Anon?  Did she drive him away?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why did Anon have to be so stupid as to leave without her protection!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why did Anon have to leave in the first place?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;’Because of me’ Appia’s guilty thoughts plant in her mind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;’It’s my fault.  If only I hadn’t chased him away with my stupid emotions.’</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hot water falls from Appia’s eyes.  Why does Anon frustrate her so?  Why must her heart ache to see Anon so much?  Why does it hurt even more now?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Appia sits in the makeshift bed Anon made in the hole.  “Anon, I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I chased you away” she cries. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You did nothing Appia.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Appia shoots up.  Anon is crawling his way into the chamber.  Her heart leaps as she runs up to Anon, squeezing him as hard as she can.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Anon!  Where?!  How?!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anon pats Appia’s arms, indicating he needs air to talk.  And breathe.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Appia lets Anon go, giving him space, a mixture of emotions welling inside her.  Happiness, anger, shock, fear, and...arousal?  He reeks of sweat and male musk.  Why did she never notice until now how good he smells?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">    &gt;”I was asking my peers about how to progress with our relationship” Anon says as he brushes dust off his toga.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”...our?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Yes Appia.  Our relationship.  I finally understand what is happening between us.” Anon says, stepping closer to Appia.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Appia’s legs lock up, refusing to move as Anon grasps her arms, moving up to her face.  Her heart is racing, her face hot as molten metal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”M-master Anon?  What are yo-” her question is cut off when Anon pulls her in, pressing her lips to his as he rubs her hair.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Appia’s mind stops, dumbfounded by what’s happening.  Then something awakens within her.  Something that feels wonderful.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She reaches up and undoes the clasp that holds her robe in place, letting the crimson clothes drop to the floor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before it seemed so wrong to let Anon see her naked.  Now?  It just seemed natural.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anon breaks away from the kiss, guiding Appia to the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Appia doesn’t resist, practically gliding across the floor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She positions herself in the middle of the cushions, letting instinct take hold as she presents herself to Anon, legs spread.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anon crawls between her thighs, one hand cupping her breast, the other moving for her slit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Master…”Appia whispers as Anon drags his finger along her vulva, her inner muscles contracting in anticipation for something she has never known yet was expecting her entire life.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her hands slither into Anon’s robes, pulling away his robes, feeling for that thing between his legs.  Stiff, and ready.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Appia grasps your member, breathing heavily.  She wants you badly.  And you want her.  You let your robes fall aside, letting yourself stand to attention.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’ve been waiting years for this moment, and you won’t wait much longer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Appia guides your cock to her vagina, wetted by your fingers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eagerly you push in, finding resistance.  It doesn’t stop you as you sink your phallus into your eager slave.  Her legs buckle, her arms go limp, pain and pleasure intermixing into beautiful ecstasy from your union.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hilt, feeling her body desperately try to draw more of you in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Grasping her hands, you pull out, and push back in, thrusting slowly but rapidly building momentum as you increase in speed and intensity.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Master Anon!” Appia calls out.  “Master Anon!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Not master” you reply.  You interlock your fingers with hers as your slam into her sex again and again, each thrust bringing your head to her deepest depths, kissing her cervix with each push.  “Here, I am Anon, I am your Anon.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Anon” she repeats, looking into your eyes.  “I’m so sorry Anon, for everything!  I never should have spurned you!  I never should have distanced myself from you!  I want you Anon!  I need you Anon!  Give me everything you have Anon!  I want it all!” she shouts as she climaxes, spraying your waist with her release.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You follow along after Appia, calling her name as you fill her with liquid heat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lay on her for what feels like an eternity of bliss.  Appia’s breathing is short, and fast.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You idly suckle from one of her breasts as she attempts to slow her breathing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Being inside you is truly amazing.” you say when you pull away from her nipple.  You are still hard as a rock.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Appia says nothing, only grasping your shoulders in response.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I need to release inside you again.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anon suddenly pushes himself up and grabs her waist.  Appia is about to form a question on her lips when she feels her master thrusting into her again.  The words die in her throat as she moans in pleasure, his hot penis plunging into her again and again, seed leaking out with every slap against her ass.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Gods Anon!” Appia cries.  “Why do I feel so good?  Why does it feel like I wanted this all along?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I know the answer my Appia” Anon replies as he continues to pound her.  He leans in, whispering into Appia’s ear. “But first, I will enjoy you.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And he pushes her legs up, until he is standing above her, cock pointed straight down into her black lips.  Over and over he falls, dropping his weight onto the hyena as he fucks her hard, climax coming again too soon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Appia grasps the sheets as she howls, another climax shaking her entire body.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Appia take my seed!” Anon shouts as he feels more of his semen leave his cock, straight into the waiting, warm embrace of Appia’s walls.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hours pass; you would take Appia again and again, until his seed pours from Appia’s abused hole.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She is half asleep as she holds you close, mixing light kisses with licking your face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Appia” you begin.  “I know why you had been so aloof with me.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You do?” she asks you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You hold her hand tightly as you smile.  “Yes Appia, I know now, how much you love me, and how I’ve been blind to it.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Love?  I?  Love you Anon?” Appia looks confused.  “I love Anon.” she says again.  “I love Anon!” she repeats with more conviction.  “I love Anon!  I love you Anon!” she exclaims, like this is some amazing revelation.  “I knew I wanted something from you Anon.  I thought I just wanted your body!  But it’s clear now!  I want more than you physical body against mine.  I want you, I want you to take me, and hold me, and care for me.  To love me.”  She looks up at you.  “You...do love me right?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are silent for only a moment.  This afternoon, you didn’t know the answer to that question.  But you do now.  You lean in and kiss Appia.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Yes.”</div></li></ol>        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;It is the year 142 Bello Victam.
&gt;You are Anon Anonymous Curio, 4th son of Anon Anonymous Curio Scaeva.
&gt;Since you were a child, you’ve had a slave: a hyena girl named Appia who was raised alongside you.
&gt;For years she was your partner-in-crime, your friend, your sister.
&gt;You ate together.  You slept together.  You learned, fought, and played together.  You don’t recall a time when you weren’t together.
&gt;It seemed like the carefree days of playing out in the golden fields of Platum Aurum would never end.
&gt;But they did.
&gt;Appia has grown cold and distant.  
&gt;She doesn’t look at you when you talk, her words terse and short.  She disappears for lengths at a time; and when you call for her she is slow to appear, but quick to leave.
&gt;She no longer sleeps alongside you, preferring the cold floor.  The floor of all things!
&gt;There was a time when she didn’t mind running naked with you through the fields, swimming nude in the pond.  Now she refuses to remove her clothes
&gt;She’s surly, aversive, and in rare cases downright hostile.
&gt;It is bizarre.  You don’t recall doing anything to offend her.
&gt;Yet she acts like you’ve committed some unforgivable crime.
&gt;You’re going to need some advice on how to deal with this.
&gt;One day, without telling anyone, you leave for town.
&gt;Armed with a small purse of coins, you hope to get the help you need from the people of Platum Aurum.

&gt;Appia.  That is the name given to her when she were enslaved.
&gt;She is daughter of Matriarch Nyap-ga-nau of the now defunct White Neck clan, named for the white war paint they wore to battle instead of armor.
&gt;At least that’s what she was told.  Appia don’t remember her tribal days, she was barely even a whelp when the legions came.
&gt;Appia has served in the family Anonymous by being the compatriot to their 4th son Anon.
&gt;For years she has grown up with him, and have grown close to him.  She sees him like her brother.
&gt;But now, there’s more.  She stopped seeing Anon the boy she grew up with, and started seeing a man.
&gt;And it hurts.
&gt;She aches for Anon, but she tries to distance herself at the same time.  It is wrong for a slave to lust for their master.  
&gt;What she wants, what she doesn’t want, she’s constantly fighting herself.  And it manifests in unhealthy ways that only serve to alienate Anon from her, which only makes her angrier.
&gt;Once she was able to speak with him about anything, and he to her.  Once she could speak Latin so fluently with him, even speaking a made up language they invented that was really just backwards Greek.  
&gt;Now she can no longer look him in the eye when speaking, lest her heart start beating uncontrollably.
&gt;Now the words stumble out in a humiliating mess.  Every time she speaks to him, her throat seizes up and it is hard to speak and breathe.
&gt;So she speaks quickly, with few words and seeks to end any talk as soon as possible.  Anon leaves shrugging and Appia starts slapping her head for her stupidity.
&gt;Once they ate at the same table.
&gt;Now it hurts to be in the same room, watching him smile as the serving girl brings meals from the kitchen.  The way he dotes over her makes Appia so upset she-
&gt;She runs.  She slams her hands on the table, takes her food and leaves the room, eating as fast as she can before her throat closes up.
&gt;Once she shared a bed with him.  Always Anon would hold her close, her fur more comfortable that the sheets.
&gt;Now she lays awake at nights, being so close to his warm body, his breathing in her ears, the scent of his body, and his legs brushing against hers.  Appia holds him close, her hands always reaching down to his thighs and touching his-
&gt;It’s too much!
&gt;Appia no longer shares the bed, afraid of what she’ll do if she stays next to him for a moment longer.
&gt;Once she had no trouble being naked around Anon, and saw nothing wrong with seeing Anon naked.
&gt;As they both aged it became apparent how different Anon is, and how his body made her desire something.  What she didn’t know, but it made her stammer and it made her nethers moist.  She couldn’t embarrass herself and her master by letting her see her incompetence!
&gt;Now she covers herself, and makes herself scarce when Anon is in the nude.  No longer do they share the family’s private bath or wash in the hidey hole’s river.  She waits until Anon has finished and covered himself before she even thinks of stripping.
&gt;’Oh by all the gods human and hyena what is wrong with me?’ Appia thinks to herself.


&gt;There is only one place you can seek advice anonymously on such personal matters: the public toilets.
&gt;It’s not really spoken, but the private stalls of the public toilets have become a forum of the people.  Among the graffiti and crude insults are lines of conversations between men asking for advice.  Anything from who is the newest, hottest celebrity in the arena, to relationship advice, or if some weird bump on the ass cheek is something to be worried about.
&gt;With charcoal in hand you make your way to the empty building.
&gt;It is a new week.  The walls have been scraped clean of last week&#039;s messages.
&gt;You pick a visible spot and not down your question
&gt;”Fellows, my slave whom I lived with for many years has suddenly grown upset with me through no fault of my own.  How do I make amends?”
&gt;And you leave.  And you wait.
&gt;In an hour, the toilets have seen many visitors already, men needing a place to empty their morning bladders.
&gt;You return to the wall.
&gt;”Gaius is a woman who takes the phalli of men up his ass like a fish takes water.”
&gt;No.
&gt;”Here I sit with Broken Heart.  For I ran to Shit, yet only Fart.”
&gt;No.
&gt;”Publius is a slander of men, disregard his statements for nothing but wolf seed spews out.”
&gt;That probably was meant for the Gaius writer.
&gt;”Is your slave man or woman?  Human or beast?  Details are needed man or not help can be given!”
&gt;Now you have something!
&gt;You reply: “She is female.  Hyena.  Has just recently come of age to be a woman.  I have known her since she and I were but children in Nova Roma.”
&gt;You leave again, opting to purchase a fresh roll and fish sauce with dried meat.  You’ll need an excuse to frequent the toilets...


&gt;Appia is worried.  Anon left this morning.  
&gt;This feels so...wrong.  Anon never leaves home without you.
&gt;But then, Anon had never been the brunt of your frustrations before either.
&gt;You begin to worry.  What if Anon was robbed?  Kidnapped?  He carries himself like a Patrician.  On his own, a wolf may try to steal him away!  They may try to torture him for fun!  Or rape him!  Or kill him!  And you can’t do anything!
    &gt;But what if-oh no.  That’ can’t be it.
&gt; Is he looking for another friend...another hyena?
&gt;The thought angers Appia.  Angry at the hyena that takes Anon from her.  Angry at Anon for not taking her.
&gt;What if it’s not a hyena he finds but a wolf woman.  A wolf woman to accompany him everywhere, to eat with him, and swim with him, and sleep with him!
&gt;That’s unacceptable!
&gt;No ash colored bitch will steal Anon away!
    &gt;But...she can’t go into town with a spear shouting curses.  The guards will lock her up on the spot.
&gt;But then what can she do?!
&gt;It’s clear she has to find Anon no matter what.  
&gt;And even if she doesn’t have her weapon, she can still beat any wolf bitch senseless.
&gt;The thought calms Appia as she fastens her favorite red robe.  
&gt;’I will find you Anon’ she thinks to herself as she runs for town.

&gt;Over the next few hours you will stay near the toilets.  Men come and go, they piss and shit and scrape their own words on the walls.  
&gt;And you return to see the new words.
&gt;”The Praefectus Annonae is a horse fucking half wit that magically loses a quarter of grain every year.
&gt;”The Praefectuse Annonae is a lover of boys.”
&gt;”The Censor’s spend more time with penis in mouth than pen in hand.”
    &gt;”Stop writing politics you jackasses!  It has no place on a shit wall!”
&gt;”Politics and shit go hand in hand.”
&gt;”Some sit to think.  Others shit and stink.  Some scratch their balls.  Others write on walls.”
&gt;”Long live the Warriors of the Warherd!”
&gt;”The Warherd got fucked by the Legion years ago.  It is time to pluck your horns from your ass and be with your rightful master antler-boy!”
&gt;”Your slave, when has she been this way?  Was she ever this aggressive in the past?”
&gt;”Hyenas are temperamental and full of piss and vinegar.  Better to be with a deer woman who serves and knows her man is superior.”
&gt;”Deer women are full of genital lice”
&gt;Wait that last part.  Someone replied!
&gt;”My hyena slave has only began to act upset.  I am at my wit’s end to solving this.”
&gt;You leave, camping outside the public toilets as people come and go.  After you believe sufficient time has passed, and because the street food is giving you the runs, you head back, braving the stink.
&gt;More words are written
&gt;”Your slave, if she is a woman and upset, perhaps she is frustrated she cannot get satisfaction.  I have a hyena slave as well and I know.”
&gt;”Names or you lie.”
&gt;”My hyena was lusting after a deer-man for nearly a year.  Yet the deer man never knew she existed.  Her lust manifested as rage and frustration towards the deer man and her peers.”
&gt;”The legions in the west will fuck the sea dogs!”
&gt;”They’re called the Otter-folk you nonce!”
&gt;”I’ll call them dick warmers.  They will be fucked in every available hole.”
&gt;”Some write epics, others write on walls.  Some chase happiness, others suck my balls”
&gt;”A War of Poetry!”
&gt;”Wait, are you saying to me my hyena slave is angry because she is in love?”
&gt;Again you leave.  Again you wait.  Again the call of nature comes and you are compelled to answer.  More writing on the walls.
&gt;Over and over this goes.
&gt;”If you read these words, you are bored and take men’s penis up your ass”
&gt;”Your hyena may indeed be experiencing love.  A strange concept to her is none explained it to her.  She may feel possessive of the object of her affections and show frustration if it isn’t returned.  From what you describe it may not just be love.  Lust and love.  Very likely with you.”
&gt;”No sir, your hyena wants to plow you.”
    &gt;”Your hyena girl wants you to impregnate her.”
    &gt;”I want to impregnate the wolf girl in the tavern.”
    
&gt;Not in the markets, not in the bathouses.  Not in the temple, the forum, the arena, the slave markets, or even the brothels!
&gt;Every possible spot Appia thinks she’d find Anon turned up nothing!
&gt;Where could he be?
&gt;Appia’s stomach twists into knots as she slowly makes her way home, some tiny sliver hoping Anon would be there waiting for her.
&gt;Yet even home, Anon was nowhere.
    &gt;Now Appia began to panic.
&gt;her mind is filled with a million possibilities, all horrifying.
&gt;Maybe he isn’t in the city.  Maybe he went to the ‘hole’.  He does like going there when he had enough of the world and wants to be by himself.
&gt;Maybe he found a new cavern and is trapped! 
&gt;If that’s true, she has to save him!

&gt;”Are you certain this is hyena lust?”
&gt;”More than certain. Wolf, or hyena, I encounter this time and time again with the slaves I raise.”
&gt;”They say the Northern campaigns ran into a kingdom of foxes with many breasts.”
&gt;”They also say your mother sells herself for money.  Is everything said by them true?”
&gt;”You know that I am the object of her affections?”
&gt;”The way you describe her sounds like she is delirious for you.”
&gt;”I made bread.”
&gt;”I piss blood.  Do not hire the deerboy at the Itchy Wolf to satisfy you.  Or you will join me in pissing your life blood from your cock.”
&gt;”Do you love this slave of yours?  Do not be ashamed.  We are all men of maturity”
&gt;That is quite the question isn’t it?  Do you love Appia?  You never considered that before.  She had always been there for you; and you for her...
 &gt;If she was to leave you...by Jupiter you think you’re in love with your slave.
&gt;”By Jupiter I do.  I never once considered my concern to be true affection”
&gt;”The beast women do have a way with men.”
&gt;”Beast fuckers are race traitors that should face decimation lest they invite ruin to Rome.”
&gt;”So speaks the deer boy who lusts for his human mistress.  I recognize your handwriting boy.  Frustrated she doesn’t notice you?”
&gt;”How do I even profess love for a slave?  For so long she has been my servant.  How ignoble is it to love one below you.”
&gt;”Such romance happens more than you may believe.  I love my wolf wife once slave.”
&gt;”And I love a peasant girl despite my status as Patrician”
&gt;”I fuck wolf boys in the anus and they love me for it”
&gt;”Crispus Calvus loves Drusa and Drusa loves Crispus Calvus”
&gt;”The longer you wait, the more irrational she will become.  Do as Crispus does to Drusa and love your hyena you fool!”

&gt;”Master Anon” Appia calls.  
&gt;Her voice echoes across the cavern walls.
&gt;Again she calls out for Anon.  All that greets her is the deafening silence of the hole.
&gt;Tears begin to well up in Appia’s eyes.  Where is Anon?  Did she drive him away?
&gt;Why did Anon have to be so stupid as to leave without her protection!
&gt;Why did Anon have to leave in the first place?
&gt;’Because of me’ Appia’s guilty thoughts plant in her mind.
&gt;’It’s my fault.  If only I hadn’t chased him away with my stupid emotions.’
&gt;Hot water falls from Appia’s eyes.  Why does Anon frustrate her so?  Why must her heart ache to see Anon so much?  Why does it hurt even more now?
&gt;Appia sits in the makeshift bed Anon made in the hole.  “Anon, I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I chased you away” she cries. 
&gt;”You did nothing Appia.”
&gt;Appia shoots up.  Anon is crawling his way into the chamber.  Her heart leaps as she runs up to Anon, squeezing him as hard as she can.  
&gt;”Anon!  Where?!  How?!”
&gt;Anon pats Appia’s arms, indicating he needs air to talk.  And breathe.
&gt;Appia lets Anon go, giving him space, a mixture of emotions welling inside her.  Happiness, anger, shock, fear, and...arousal?  He reeks of sweat and male musk.  Why did she never notice until now how good he smells?
    &gt;”I was asking my peers about how to progress with our relationship” Anon says as he brushes dust off his toga.
&gt;”...our?”
&gt;”Yes Appia.  Our relationship.  I finally understand what is happening between us.” Anon says, stepping closer to Appia.  
&gt;Appia’s legs lock up, refusing to move as Anon grasps her arms, moving up to her face.  Her heart is racing, her face hot as molten metal.
&gt;”M-master Anon?  What are yo-” her question is cut off when Anon pulls her in, pressing her lips to his as he rubs her hair.
&gt;Appia’s mind stops, dumbfounded by what’s happening.  Then something awakens within her.  Something that feels wonderful.
&gt;She reaches up and undoes the clasp that holds her robe in place, letting the crimson clothes drop to the floor.
&gt;Before it seemed so wrong to let Anon see her naked.  Now?  It just seemed natural.
&gt;Anon breaks away from the kiss, guiding Appia to the bed.
&gt;Appia doesn’t resist, practically gliding across the floor.
&gt;She positions herself in the middle of the cushions, letting instinct take hold as she presents herself to Anon, legs spread.
&gt;Anon crawls between her thighs, one hand cupping her breast, the other moving for her slit.
&gt;”Master…”Appia whispers as Anon drags his finger along her vulva, her inner muscles contracting in anticipation for something she has never known yet was expecting her entire life.
&gt;Her hands slither into Anon’s robes, pulling away his robes, feeling for that thing between his legs.  Stiff, and ready.

&gt;Appia grasps your member, breathing heavily.  She wants you badly.  And you want her.  You let your robes fall aside, letting yourself stand to attention.
&gt;You’ve been waiting years for this moment, and you won’t wait much longer.
&gt;Appia guides your cock to her vagina, wetted by your fingers.
&gt;Eagerly you push in, finding resistance.  It doesn’t stop you as you sink your phallus into your eager slave.  Her legs buckle, her arms go limp, pain and pleasure intermixing into beautiful ecstasy from your union.  
&gt;You hilt, feeling her body desperately try to draw more of you in.
&gt;Grasping her hands, you pull out, and push back in, thrusting slowly but rapidly building momentum as you increase in speed and intensity.
&gt;”Master Anon!” Appia calls out.  “Master Anon!”
&gt;”Not master” you reply.  You interlock your fingers with hers as your slam into her sex again and again, each thrust bringing your head to her deepest depths, kissing her cervix with each push.  “Here, I am Anon, I am your Anon.”
&gt;”Anon” she repeats, looking into your eyes.  “I’m so sorry Anon, for everything!  I never should have spurned you!  I never should have distanced myself from you!  I want you Anon!  I need you Anon!  Give me everything you have Anon!  I want it all!” she shouts as she climaxes, spraying your waist with her release.
&gt;You follow along after Appia, calling her name as you fill her with liquid heat.
&gt;You lay on her for what feels like an eternity of bliss.  Appia’s breathing is short, and fast.
&gt;You idly suckle from one of her breasts as she attempts to slow her breathing.
&gt;”Being inside you is truly amazing.” you say when you pull away from her nipple.  You are still hard as a rock.  
&gt;Appia says nothing, only grasping your shoulders in response.
&gt;”I need to release inside you again.”

&gt;Anon suddenly pushes himself up and grabs her waist.  Appia is about to form a question on her lips when she feels her master thrusting into her again.  The words die in her throat as she moans in pleasure, his hot penis plunging into her again and again, seed leaking out with every slap against her ass.  
&gt;”Gods Anon!” Appia cries.  “Why do I feel so good?  Why does it feel like I wanted this all along?”
&gt;”I know the answer my Appia” Anon replies as he continues to pound her.  He leans in, whispering into Appia’s ear. “But first, I will enjoy you.”
&gt;And he pushes her legs up, until he is standing above her, cock pointed straight down into her black lips.  Over and over he falls, dropping his weight onto the hyena as he fucks her hard, climax coming again too soon.
&gt;Appia grasps the sheets as she howls, another climax shaking her entire body.
&gt;”Appia take my seed!” Anon shouts as he feels more of his semen leave his cock, straight into the waiting, warm embrace of Appia’s walls.

&gt;Hours pass; you would take Appia again and again, until his seed pours from Appia’s abused hole.  
&gt;She is half asleep as she holds you close, mixing light kisses with licking your face.
&gt;”Appia” you begin.  “I know why you had been so aloof with me.”
&gt;”You do?” she asks you.
&gt;”You hold her hand tightly as you smile.  “Yes Appia, I know now, how much you love me, and how I’ve been blind to it.”
&gt;”Love?  I?  Love you Anon?” Appia looks confused.  “I love Anon.” she says again.  “I love Anon!” she repeats with more conviction.  “I love Anon!  I love you Anon!” she exclaims, like this is some amazing revelation.  “I knew I wanted something from you Anon.  I thought I just wanted your body!  But it’s clear now!  I want more than you physical body against mine.  I want you, I want you to take me, and hold me, and care for me.  To love me.”  She looks up at you.  “You...do love me right?”
&gt;You are silent for only a moment.  This afternoon, you didn’t know the answer to that question.  But you do now.  You lean in and kiss Appia.
&gt;”Yes.”</textarea>
