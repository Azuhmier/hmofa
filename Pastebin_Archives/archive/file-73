You had been smart enough to do your shopping earlier in the week before the snow got this bad.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pitied any idiot who had to drive in the foot of snow currently falling onto the road.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was nice to be at home.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Right now you were just waiting for dinner to be done, your roommate, a timid Anthro Collie named Sarah, was currently in the small kitchen, standing over a pot of boiling water.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you had lived together for quite a while now, and as a result, the two of you were pretty close.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Right now, she was making some spaghetti for the two of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nothing special, just with canned sauce and some frozen garlic toast that was currently cooking in the toaster oven.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You would have helped her, but she always seemed to get upset if you tried. She always insisted on having you relax...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The apartment not being very big, the smell of dinner easily filled the room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Asking Sarah once more if she needed help, you got your answer in the form of an angry huff.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It&#039;s almost done. I just need to drain the pasta and add the sauce. Just take a seat... I&#039;ll have it out to you in a few minutes.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As much as you hated to just sit there and do nothing, there was no fighting with Sarah.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You would never want to upset her. Not on purpose, at least.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sitting at the small dinner table with Sarah, the two of you made small talk as you slowly ate.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The meal was okay, the sauce not being the best, and the garlic toast being slightly burnt on one side.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still, everything smelled good. You&#039;ve definitely had worse, too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were just happy you didn&#039;t have to cook for yourself. You didn&#039;t exactly have many skills in the kitchen...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Right now, the two of you were talking about the weather.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For the past day and a half, it had been snowing hard, with no signs of stopping anytime soon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There was a parking ban citywide, and half the streets were blanketed in at least a foot of snow. There was no going out anywhere, that was for sure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;ve always liked the snow, Anon. Back when I was growing up, out on my family&#039;s farm, I always loved to make snowmen out in the fields.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smiled. You couldn&#039;t remember the last time you built a snowman. While Sarah was from out in the country, you had lived in and around the city almost your entire life. Not many places to build snowmen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Maybe if the weather dies down sometime this week, we could go to the park after work and build one together... It&#039;d be fun!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You told her that you&#039;d definitely like that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking behind Sarah, out through the window, there were fat flurries of snow coming down without stop. The streets were empty, and it was already dark out. The entire road and sidewalk was blanketed in snow, only interrupted by the occasional vehicle or plow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were glad you were inside. You despised the cold... Always have, and always will. You couldn&#039;t wait for spring to get here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Standing in the kitchen, you were just finishing the dishes, insisting that Sarah go take a seat while you cleaned up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was an argument you two had almost daily, Sarah always insisting that she wanted to help. This must be how she feels when you offer to help cook.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sat on the couch, frowning at the TV.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The satellite dish must be covered in snow or something, as half of the channels weren&#039;t available, and the ones you did get had a fragmented picture and no sound.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Aww... There was a movie I wanted to watch on tonight.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Putting the last plate in the drying rack, you washed your hands again, quickly drying your hands before joining Sarah on the couch.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She scooched over a little to make room for you, her tail starting to wag as you sat down next to her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, the two of you could also just pop in a DVD and watch a movie.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah huffed. &quot;I&#039;ve already watched everything we have... I really wanted to watch this one.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Poor puppy. Maybe the two of you could play a board-game then. You had a few of them in your closet, being leftover from when you were younger.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah huffed again. &quot;I am -NOT- a puppy!&quot;, she said pitifully, crossing her arms. &quot;I&#039;m a big, strong farm dog... Yeah...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You snickered, Sarah shooting you a displeased look. If by big and strong farm dog, she meant short and thin office worker, then she was right on the money.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gave you a weak punch to the shoulder, smiling as she shook her head. &quot;Fine. Let&#039;s play a board game. I guess...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You told her to look on the bright side. It&#039;s not like the night could get worse. Only the TV was out. At least you still had power and heating.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah gave a small nod, turning to look at you. &quot;Yeah, I-&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her words are cut short as the lights flicker, then go out altogether.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The silent grumble of the central heating suddenly goes silent, and the two of you are left sitting quietly in the pitch black darkness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anooooooooooon!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For the past few hours your apartment, and the surrounding blocks, were without power.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Checking your cell, the apartments Wi-Fi was down, and you were already dangerously close to exceeding your limit on wireless data. For now, it seemed there was no getting info about the power outage.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some dumb-ass probably hit a pole or something. The power hasn&#039;t even flickered back on yet, so there&#039;s probably lines down somewhere. And in this weather, you didn&#039;t have your money on it being fixed extremely quickly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Either way, for now you had no electricity, or even worse, no heating.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Currently, you were sitting on the couch with Sarah, the both of you wrapped up under a couple blankets.

It&#039;s been some time now...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You only shrugged. How much longer could it be? While you may not have lived in the biggest and nicest city, you still lived in the city.

Any second now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;By the time you got tired of playing board games, and just tired in general, the power still wasn&#039;t on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The apartment was properly chilly now, the temperature hovering at least around freezing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You yawned, sitting back on the couch.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah&#039;s ear flicked. &quot;Tired, Anon?

Are you awake?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was just Sarah.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You mumble something about being wide awake, and she enters your room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It&#039;s too cold in my room to sleep, so I know it has to be too cold for you...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was full of shit.

She just wanted to make sure you were okay.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Walking closer to the bed, her clawed toes clacking against the wooden floor, she continues.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I was, um, thinking maybe we could... Share a bed?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you can respond, she quickly blurts out excuses: &quot;Justfortonight,Idon&#039;twantyoutobecoldandIreallythinkthatyourroomistoocoldand-&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You cut her off, the shy Collie stopping with a whine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s not like she hasn&#039;t insisted on sharing a bed before.

I&#039;ll keep you warm, don&#039;t worry...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her arms cling tightly to you, her thick, warm, winter coat instantly heating the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could swear you could hear her quietly sniffing you as she holds you tight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Trying to scooch back, she prevents your movement by quickly swinging a leg over you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even thoughs she&#039;s shorter than you, she pretty much has you pinned by now, her warm fur making the bed, and by extension, you, much warmer.

&gt;Be Anon
&gt;You were 27 years old, standing at a height of 5&#039;11&quot;.
&gt;It was a Saturday evening, Sometime mid-winter.
&gt;The skies were dark, and the time was 5:00 PM.
&gt;You had been home all day, the weather too bad for you to want to go anywhere.
&gt;Not that it mattered. You had been smart enough to do your shopping earlier in the week before the snow got this bad.
&gt;You pitied any idiot who had to drive in the foot of snow currently falling onto the road.
&gt;It was nice to be at home.
&gt;Right now you were just waiting for dinner to be done, your roommate, a timid Anthro Collie named Sarah, was currently in the small kitchen, standing over a pot of boiling water.
&gt;The two of you had lived together for quite a while now, and as a result, the two of you were pretty close.
&gt;Right now, she was making some spaghetti for the two of you.
&gt;Nothing special, just with canned sauce and some frozen garlic toast that was currently cooking in the toaster oven.
&gt;You would have helped her, but she always seemed to get upset if you tried. She always insisted on having you relax...
&gt;The apartment not being very big, the smell of dinner easily filled the room.
&gt;Asking Sarah once more if she needed help, you got your answer in the form of an angry huff.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s almost done. I just need to drain the pasta and add the sauce. Just take a seat... I&#039;ll have it out to you in a few minutes.&quot;
&gt;As much as you hated to just sit there and do nothing, there was no fighting with Sarah.
&gt;You would never want to upset her. Not on purpose, at least.
 
&gt;Sitting at the small dinner table with Sarah, the two of you made small talk as you slowly ate.
&gt;The meal was okay, the sauce not being the best, and the garlic toast being slightly burnt on one side.
&gt;Still, everything smelled good. You&#039;ve definitely had worse, too.
&gt;You were just happy you didn&#039;t have to cook for yourself. You didn&#039;t exactly have many skills in the kitchen...
&gt;Right now, the two of you were talking about the weather.
&gt;For the past day and a half, it had been snowing hard, with no signs of stopping anytime soon.
&gt;There was a parking ban citywide, and half the streets were blanketed in at least a foot of snow. There was no going out anywhere, that was for sure.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ve always liked the snow, Anon. Back when I was growing up, out on my family&#039;s farm, I always loved to make snowmen out in the fields.&quot;
&gt;You smiled. You couldn&#039;t remember the last time you built a snowman. While Sarah was from out in the country, you had lived in and around the city almost your entire life. Not many places to build snowmen.
&gt;&quot;Maybe if the weather dies down sometime this week, we could go to the park after work and build one together... It&#039;d be fun!&quot;
&gt;You told her that you&#039;d definitely like that.
&gt;Looking behind Sarah, out through the window, there were fat flurries of snow coming down without stop. The streets were empty, and it was already dark out. The entire road and sidewalk was blanketed in snow, only interrupted by the occasional vehicle or plow.
&gt;You were glad you were inside. You despised the cold... Always have, and always will. You couldn&#039;t wait for spring to get here.
 
&gt;Standing in the kitchen, you were just finishing the dishes, insisting that Sarah go take a seat while you cleaned up.
&gt;It was an argument you two had almost daily, Sarah always insisting that she wanted to help. This must be how she feels when you offer to help cook.
&gt;She sat on the couch, frowning at the TV.
&gt;The satellite dish must be covered in snow or something, as half of the channels weren&#039;t available, and the ones you did get had a fragmented picture and no sound.
&gt;&quot;Aww... There was a movie I wanted to watch on tonight.&quot;
&gt;Putting the last plate in the drying rack, you washed your hands again, quickly drying your hands before joining Sarah on the couch.
&gt;She scooched over a little to make room for you, her tail starting to wag as you sat down next to her.
&gt;Well, the two of you could also just pop in a DVD and watch a movie.
&gt;Sarah huffed. &quot;I&#039;ve already watched everything we have... I really wanted to watch this one.&quot;
&gt;Poor puppy. Maybe the two of you could play a board-game then. You had a few of them in your closet, being leftover from when you were younger.
&gt;Sarah huffed again. &quot;I am -NOT- a puppy!&quot;, she said pitifully, crossing her arms. &quot;I&#039;m a big, strong farm dog... Yeah...&quot;
&gt;You snickered, Sarah shooting you a displeased look. If by big and strong farm dog, she meant short and thin office worker, then she was right on the money.
&gt;She gave you a weak punch to the shoulder, smiling as she shook her head. &quot;Fine. Let&#039;s play a board game. I guess...&quot;
&gt;You told her to look on the bright side. It&#039;s not like the night could get worse. Only the TV was out. At least you still had power and heating.
&gt;Sarah gave a small nod, turning to look at you. &quot;Yeah, I-&quot;
&gt;Her words are cut short as the lights flicker, then go out altogether.
&gt;The silent grumble of the central heating suddenly goes silent, and the two of you are left sitting quietly in the pitch black darkness.
&gt;...
&gt;&quot;Anooooooooooon!&quot;
 
&gt;For the past few hours your apartment, and the surrounding blocks, were without power.
&gt;Checking your cell, the apartments Wi-Fi was down, and you were already dangerously close to exceeding your limit on wireless data. For now, it seemed there was no getting info about the power outage.
&gt;Some dumb-ass probably hit a pole or something. The power hasn&#039;t even flickered back on yet, so there&#039;s probably lines down somewhere. And in this weather, you didn&#039;t have your money on it being fixed extremely quickly.
&gt;Either way, for now you had no electricity, or even worse, no heating.
&gt;Currently, you were sitting on the couch with Sarah, the both of you wrapped up under a couple blankets. It wasn&#039;t particularly cold yet, but it certainly wasn&#039;t warm. Your apartment never really seemed to hold onto heat too well...
&gt;As soon as the power had gone out, the two of you had retrieved the few candles you had, lighting them and setting them around the living room.
&gt;Sarah was huddled up under her tightly wrapped blanket, her fluffy head poking out through the top.
&gt;She didn&#039;t really even need a blanket, her winter coat being thick enough to keep her warm by itself. It was almost funny to see how puffed up she looked with her fur like this every winter.
&gt;If it kept her comfortable though, well then that was just fine.
&gt;Trying to keep the both of you in good spirits, you had gotten and retrieved a few board games.
&gt;Right now, you were playing checkers with Sarah.
&gt;You weren&#039;t sure if it was the stress of the situation, but Sarah was god-awful at checkers it seemed.
&gt;Even trying to let her win, it&#039;s like she purposely went out of her way to play badly.
&gt;In the last move she made, she captured one of your pieces, only to leave herself wide open to a triple jump.
&gt;&quot;Okay... Your turn, Anon...&quot;
&gt;Trying to calculate the worst move possible, you move a piece to leave it open for a double jump.
&gt;Sarah just snickers. &quot;Wow Anon, you&#039;re pretty bad at this...&quot;
&gt;Yeah, sure.
&gt;She turned to look at you, concern in her eyes.
&gt;&quot;Do you think it&#039;s going to be off much longer? It&#039;s been some time now...&quot;
&gt;You only shrugged. How much longer could it be? While you may not have lived in the biggest and nicest city, you still lived in the city. You were almost positive that it would be on any second now.
&gt;As the minutes pass, the air growing colder, you continue to play checkers.
&gt;Yep. Any second now.
 
&gt;By the time you got tired of playing board games, and just tired in general, the power still wasn&#039;t on.
&gt;The apartment was properly chilly now, the temperature hovering at least around freezing.
&gt;You yawned, sitting back on the couch.
&gt;Sarah&#039;s ear flicked. &quot;Tired, Anon? Me too...&quot;
&gt;You stood up, the thin carpet feeling like ice. You should&#039;ve put on some socks...
&gt;Stretching real quick, you tell her that you&#039;re headed to sleep.
&gt;Hear ears flatten, seeming disappointed.
&gt;&quot;Oh. Okay... I was going to try and get some sleep too. In a bit.&quot;
&gt;You ask her if she could blow out the candles before she goes to sleep, and she nods.
&gt;&quot;Sleep tight, Anon. I hope it isn&#039;t too cold for you...&quot;
&gt;Sarah was always acting sympathetic for you whenever it was cold out. She thought you hated the cold because you had no fur to protect you. While that was probably a little true, you just didn&#039;t like winter in general.
&gt;&quot;If you need a few extra blankets, just let me know. I have some you could borrow, if you needed.&quot;
&gt;That was Sarah, always trying to make sure you were comfortable.
&gt;Letting her know you had plenty, she leans back into the couch.
&gt;&quot;Okay... Goodnight, Anon.&quot;
&gt;You tell her goodnight as well, before heading into your room, closing the door behind you.
&gt;It was just as cold in here as it was out there, the wooden floor only making your feet colder.
&gt;Fumbling around in the dark, taking off your clothes and putting on a plain white t-shirt and some pajama pants, you can&#039;t help but shiver.
&gt;Damn, you wish the heat was on...
&gt;Your teeth chatter as you slide under your blankets, the thin sheet and heavy blankets feeling like ice.
&gt;You hoped you would be able to get to sleep soon.
 
&gt;You weren&#039;t sure how much later it was, but you still weren&#039;t able to sleep. It was just too damn cold...
&gt;By now the blankets and sheets directly in contact with you had warmed up somewhat, but the bed was still mostly freezing.
&gt;Just as you were about to take up Sarah&#039;s offer for some extra blankets, you hear your doorknob click open, the door slowly creaking open.
&gt;Your eyes adjusted to the dark a little, you watch a figure peek into your room.
&gt;Quietly, it speaks.
&gt;&quot;Anon? Are you awake?&quot;
&gt;It was just Sarah.
&gt;You mumble something about being wide awake, and she enters your room.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s too cold in my room to sleep, so I know it has to be too cold for you...&quot;
&gt;She was full of shit. With fluff like hers, there was no way she&#039;d even let out a shiver. She just wanted to make sure you were okay.
&gt;Walking closer to the bed, her clawed toes clacking against the wooden floor, she continues.
&gt;&quot;I was, um, thinking maybe we could... Share a bed?&quot;
&gt;Before you can respond, she quickly blurts out excuses: &quot;Justfortonight,Idon&#039;twantyoutobecoldandIreallythinkthatyourroomistoocoldand-&quot;
&gt;You cut her off, the shy Collie stopping with a whine.
&gt;It&#039;s not like she hasn&#039;t insisted on sharing a bed before. She still tries to worm her way under your covers every time there&#039;s a big thunder storm...
&gt;She feels the edge of the mattress, letting out a small gasp.
&gt;&quot;Anon, It&#039;s freezing! You must be so cold...&quot;
&gt;Before you can respond, she&#039;s already climbing into your bed, her furred body pressing against you.
&gt;&quot;You feel so cold, Anon... I&#039;ll keep you warm, don&#039;t worry...&quot;
&gt;Her arms cling tightly to you, her thick, warm, winter coat instantly heating the bed.
&gt;You could swear you could hear her quietly sniffing you as she holds you tight.
&gt;Trying to scooch back, she prevents your movement by quickly swinging a leg over you.
&gt;Even thoughs she&#039;s shorter than you, she pretty much has you pinned by now, her warm fur making the bed, and by extension, you, much warmer. The cold holding you hostage, you have no other choice than to accept her cuddles.
&gt;Not that it was a bad thing to be forcefully cuddled by a fluffy Collie.
&gt;Sarah happily squeezed you, resting her head under your chin.
&gt;&quot;There... That&#039;s better. Right?&quot;
&gt;Well... You were definitely going to be able to get to sleep now, that was for sure.
 
&gt;You were asleep before you knew it, Sarah&#039;s fluff sapping all your energy.
&gt;Every single time... You swear your biggest weakness was warm fur.
&gt;Waking up, you noticed two things.
&gt;Your ceiling fan was spinning on the lowest setting, and the room was warm again.
&gt;Well, it seems that both the heat and power was back on.
&gt;Sitting up, you realize that Sarah is no longer in your bed. All that&#039;s left are a few loose black and white hairs.
&gt;That probably explains why you can smell bacon frying.
&gt;Walking out of your room into the living room, still in your pajamas, you&#039;re greeted by Sarah.
&gt;&quot;Anon! You slept in.&quot;
&gt;Looking at the digital clock on the cable box under the TV, sure enough it was almost 11&#039;o Clock. Wow, you never usually slept this late. Not even on weekends.
&gt;Sure enough, Sarah was frying up a pan of bacon. Probably for one of those bacon sandwiches she was so fond of for lunch.
&gt;&quot;Take a seat at the table Anon, you must be hungry! I&#039;ll just cook some more bacon for myself.&quot;
&gt;You refuse, telling her that you just wanted some cereal. After all, she should enjoy the bacon she&#039;s been cooking for herself.
&gt;In response, she let&#039;s out a short growl, demanding you sit down and let her fix a plate for you. Or else she&#039;ll awoo at you.
&gt;Telling her you&#039;re just going to go back to bed until she&#039;s done eating, she takes the pan off of the heat, then rushes you.
&gt;Jesus Christ how horrifying.
&gt;Trying to flee to your room, you&#039;re no match for her, being tackled into your bed.
&gt;&quot;Awoooooo!&quot;
&gt;Looks like you&#039;re eating first after all.
