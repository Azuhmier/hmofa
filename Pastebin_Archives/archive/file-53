&gt;This had been a great week
&gt;Your Loving wife, Amanda had suggested that you and her take the kids to Disney world and the area around it
&gt;Why not do that? you were a firefighter and had plenty of vacation days saved up
&gt;So you treated your loving Wife and you kids to the best week ever
&gt;Your Son, Derek got over his fear of the dark because of the ride space mountain
&gt;And you Daughter, Ashley, finally discovered a love of star wars
&gt;Granted it was just because she saw a remote controlled BB-8 toy and insisted on having it but that&#039;s besides the point
&gt;Even the Family dog, Moose, a big doofy German Shepard,  had fun wandering around the park with you all
&gt;You had driven around Florida in your... uhm, Manvan (You refused to call it a minivan for masculinity) seeing the sights
&gt;Daytona beach, Orlando, Cape Canaveral, the swamps to see some gators
&gt;It had been a long time since you had seen your family smile so much
&gt;When Moose tried to attack a Crab on the beach and it pinched his nose you laughed and cried for him
&gt;The Lovable doofus just didn&#039;t know when other animals didn&#039;t wanna be friends
&gt;You decided to take the wheel to drive home after the week was over
&gt;After all Amanda was so tired from playing with the kids and your nighttime... activities that she could barely stay awake
&gt;You too had been playing with the kids but you knew your limits and had the sheer willpower to stay awake
&gt;How else do you fight a fire for 12 hours without food water or a piss break besides that?
&gt;Lots of training
&gt;As you drive up the Interstate, you look around
&gt;You&#039;ll miss the Spanish moss, the willows and the warm humid rainstorms that happened every day
&gt;You can see why old people retire to Florida
&gt;The Mountains come and go as you drive through the Appalachians
&gt;They always did take you breath away
&gt;The serenity, the calm cool beauty
&gt;You miss camping here, like you did with your father when you were a child
&gt;Maybe when Derek was older you could take him camping, like you father (god rest his soul) had before you
&gt;You enter a tunnel through the mountain and think of nothing else beyond relaxing at home with you wife
&gt;The light at the end grows brighter and brighter and.........

Nothing

&gt;The world is a blur
&gt;Happiness, sadness, sadness, pain, and joy
&gt;All things you can&#039;t even recall
&gt;What is this around you
&gt;Its reminds you of stars, or the aurora borealis
&gt;You hear something
&gt;Singing, music? You can&#039;t tell beyond its beautiful
&gt;Spinning somethings in the distance
&gt;Nightscapes of light and dark
&gt;The edge of time and everything beyond it
&gt;All of it is taken from you as sit up in the middle of an alley
&gt;Where are you? Who are you?
&gt;You sit up and ponder it as you look around
&gt;Its night and nearly pitch black 
&gt;Something bothers you
&gt;But what?
&gt;You run your fingers through your hair and feel like you&#039;re forgetting something important
&gt;Maybe something on you can tell you who you are?
&gt;You dig through your pockets in search of something
&gt;Anything
&gt;A cell phone? The battery is dead though
&gt;A wallet! You flip it open and look at the license
&gt;You are Anon....
&gt;The memories hit you like a flash flood
&gt;Your wife! Your Kids! 
&gt;Where are they!?
&gt;You run out of the alley shouting for them
&gt;Grabbing anyone and asking if they had seen your family
&gt;Only to your horror they aren&#039;t anyone
&gt;Animals
&gt;Walking animals pretending to be people
&gt;What nightmare is this? You feel like you&#039;re in one of your children&#039;s storybooks
&gt;&quot;Sir are you ok! I&#039;m with the police I can help you&quot; a voice behind you
&gt;You sigh in relief as you turn
&gt;The police!
&gt;You had dealt with them so many times!
&gt;They might a silly competition with firemen but it was always in jest
&gt;They could help you no doubt
&gt;But its not police
&gt;Its Moose, or a nightmare version of your beloved dog
&gt;Walking on 2 feet, wearing a police uniform and talking
&gt;TALKING!
&gt;You scream and run
&gt;What had you done to deserve this?
&gt;You run
&gt;Back into the only place you knew was safe
&gt;The alley
&gt;Anyway from the monsters that stalked the night of this nightmare
&gt;You need to wake up!
&gt;First you pinch yourself
&gt;Nothing
&gt;Then punch yourself
&gt;Still nothing
&gt;Then you bite yourself so hard that you taste blood and it pours down your chin
&gt;This can&#039;t be real!
&gt;Can it?!
&gt;Maybe you need to sleep
&gt;You curl up besides a dumpster in your alley
&gt;Yea...
&gt;Just sleep it off....
&gt;This is all just a dream


Chapter 1: All Alone
&gt;How long has it been since you entered this goddamn world?
&gt;This hell
&gt;Too long
&gt;Why hasn&#039;t your suffering just ended
&gt;Why haven&#039;t you just ended it yourself?
&gt;You knew the answer to that one
&gt;Hope that you could wake up and be in your lazy boy chair with your family around you
&gt;And cowardice
&gt;As much as you hated this life and where ever you were
&gt;You had to live
&gt;Live in this new world, this new hell
&gt;A world filled with Animals disguised as people
&gt;And when you saw normal people, and tried to point the Animals out; they look at YOU like you were the crazy one
&gt;Then later you saw the Feds looking for you
&gt;&quot;The BHA&quot;
&gt;They were looking for you, to whisk you off to some torture
&gt;Some hell for brainwashing you to not see these animals
&gt;SO many animals acting like people
&gt;At this point the only anchor to your old life was a picture, faded and torn
&gt;You and your family
&gt;Amanda, Derek, Ashley and you
&gt;All smiling at a camera
&gt;This picture was the only thing that kept you rooted
&gt;It let you know that hadn&#039;t been a fever dream, not a drug induced hallucination
&gt;And the drugs flowed
&gt;As much as you hated what you had become, you hated this new world more
&gt;You found a human, someone, and asked for the strongest thing they had
&gt;What it was you didn&#039;t care
&gt;Why would you
&gt;As long as it made you forget them
&gt;Forget your previous life
&gt;The thoughts plagued you
&gt;Where they here in this new world?
&gt;Were they dead?
&gt;Or were they alive and growing up without you? back in your world?
&gt;How could you know?
&gt;Would you ever know?
&gt;You doubted it
&gt;You sit in your box, head drooped, the pills whoever gave you taking effect
&gt;How many druggies had you dealt with?
&gt;Enough to say that you were never going to do drugs
&gt;Yet here you were
&gt;Paying random people for random pills
&gt;Those animals had come to you before, offering you &quot;Better&quot; pills
&gt;You ran from them, those whatever they were
&gt;Demons, sent to torment you
&gt;Or were they the vision of people, and you were finally seeing what they really were?
&gt;Doesn&#039;t matter, the city is one you don&#039;t recognize
&gt;you didn&#039;t even know what it was called
&gt;But you never left it
&gt;Maybe, just Maybe, you get pulled back to your home
&gt;Even though every night proved you never would
&gt;You had to try



&gt;You lay in you usual alleyway
&gt;The big cardboard box from something kept you warm
&gt;A refrigerator box? The box from an oven?
&gt;Doesn&#039;t matter
&gt;It was your home now
&gt;You sit in it
&gt;The picture of your family pinned to the cardboard wall
&gt;Even though you hated your life, hated everything for bringing you here
&gt;You wouldn&#039;t beg for money
&gt;Those animal things wouldn&#039;t get a thing from you
&gt;Never
&gt;Not in a million years would you ever let them see you
&gt;Never would you help them
&gt;How many times had you seen a group of those beasts robbing another one?
&gt;Too many to remember
&gt;And you recall seeing the robber look at you and simply dismiss you like a piece of trash
&gt;Yea... At this point that&#039;s what you were
&gt;Nothing more than trash
&gt;Why didn&#039;t one of them just end it for you?
&gt;Please Just Put you out of your misery!
&gt;But they never did, they just looked at you and smirked, then let you live
&gt;Condemning you to life
&gt;But it wasn&#039;t all bad
&gt;Even as you sat in your alley, these things; these animals gave you some mercy
&gt;A dime, a nickel, a dollar
&gt;You didn&#039;t beg like the others
&gt;You simply slumped against the opening to your alley
&gt;Trying to remember your family
&gt;They tossed the bits that didn&#039;t matter to them your way
&gt;Because you didn&#039;t matter to them either way
&gt;You sat in your box, wearing torn clothing
&gt;Scraps from a box, a dumpster, a bunch of junk left behind by people too self righteous to simply throw away their old clothing
&gt;It kept you warm in the winter as you tried to close the cardboard box that you found
&gt;How many winters?
&gt;You don&#039;t know, too many drugs and too much alcohol made you forget
&gt;At this point nothing bothers you though
&gt;Why should it?
&gt;Robberies, burglaries whatever
&gt;The cops were all those animal things
&gt;When they came asking you disappeared
&gt;Into a dumpster, onto a roof
&gt;Or simply got so high you didn&#039;t eve realize they were cops
&gt;Even now as you sat in your box you didn&#039;t care as you heard the scuffle of feet and angry voices
&gt;But something catches your attention
&gt;A voice
&gt;A poor sweet sounding feminine voice
&gt;Begging for life, begging to be spared
&gt;&quot;-EASE! LET ME G-&quot;
&gt;Its cut off by a sharp thud
&gt;A druggie you may now be, but you weren&#039;t a monster
&gt;You had to help a girl in trouble
&gt;As you stand the world whirls around you, the pills you popped doing their job
&gt;Why now of all times? the one time you didn&#039;t want them to work you were a dizzy mess
&gt;You rub your face and hair in an attempt to wipe away the drugged &quot;out of it&quot; feeling
&gt;How many times hard you heard that?
&gt;You grab a broken something
&gt;A broom handle? A lead pipe? Whatever
&gt;The girls weeping cries drive you onward, boring into your brain
&gt;Who would hurt such an innocent sounding person?!
&gt;When you finally find you source of the crying its from a group of Humans
&gt;A few have somethings, knives, machetes, sticks?
&gt;You don&#039;t know
&gt;All you know is from the center of them is the crying , the begging for help
&gt;You bring the blunt object, whatever it was, onto the back of the nearest offender
&gt;Muscle memory returns
&gt;Chop down that door, kick through that door frame
&gt;Get to those that need help
&gt;You keep chopping, your body taking control as your mind wanders to better times
&gt;Times of happiness with your family
&gt;Then your body freezes, your &quot;ax&quot; held tight ready to strike
&gt;But you can&#039;t as the Humans run away
&gt;One of those animals is in front of you
&gt;Tears pour from the eye that remains and she grips her right arm with her left
&gt;All that&#039;s left of her right arm is a bloody stump and her left eye is gone
&gt;You stare, holding your ax ready to attack
&gt;But all she does is tear up before speaking
&gt;&quot;Please.. Help m-&quot;
&gt;She passes out and begins to fall
&gt;You drop your weapon and catch her
&gt;As you hold the passed out dog thing in you arms, you think
&gt;She&#039;s one of those things! 
&gt;She&#039;s a monster!, you should just leave her
&gt;But she begged out your help
&gt;And humans did this to her
&gt;You weren&#039;t like them
&gt;You pledged to help those in need, even if it was in the other world
&gt;No matter what, even if it meant running into a fire you were going to help
&gt;The nearest hospital is nearly 3 miles away
&gt;Better start running

Chapter 2: All In
&gt;The Dog girl thing is passed out in your arms as you run
&gt;You had put your belt around the stub of her arm and tightened it as much as possible
&gt;Gotta stop the blood flow, gotta keep her from bleeding out
&gt;You had looked for her arm before you left the alley but hadn&#039;t found it
&gt;But you weren&#039;t going to stick around long
&gt;She needed help and you were going to get her to it
&gt;And so you run, pushing through the evening crowds of people and animal things
&gt;A few give you terrified stares as you carry the bloody girl in your arms
&gt;They can all go fuck themselves
&gt;You swear to yourself as you feel yourself getting winded
&gt;The time hasn&#039;t been kind to your physique, you hadn&#039;t been able to eat as much or work out
&gt;You think the hospital is still about a mile away but you can&#039;t stop, how could you
&gt;Run, run until your heart pounds in your chest and you veins pump battery acid
&gt;Run even though your arms feel numb, supporting the limp weight 
&gt;Run until your lungs burns 
&gt;Then run some more
&gt;Fueled by adreniline you finally make it to the hospital, panting and tired
&gt;The Automatic doors open to the emergency room 
&gt;&quot;HELP ANYONE PLEASE&quot; you call out loudly
&gt;You see a nurse look at you confused then see her eyes fall to the Dog in your arms
&gt;&quot;OH GOD! GET A STRETCHER!&quot; the Cat thing calls out
&gt;In a flurry, nurses and doctors get her from you placing her on a stretcher
&gt;You watch as  they take care of her, attempting to find blood to give the helpless creature
&gt;But your work here is done, you got her here and helped just like she asked
&gt;You need a seat though, it had been a long time since you had to do anything like that
&gt;The waiting room chairs look good enough for now, and the pills you took earlier are still in your system
&gt;Everything is spinning when you fall back into the chair roughly
&gt;When this stuff, these pills wear off you&#039;ll leave
&gt;Maybe one of the human nurses can give you some pills or something
&gt;What a day
&gt;As you sit and relax, staring at the floor you see a few pairs of shoes start in from of you
&gt;&quot;This is the man who brought her in&quot; you hear a male voice
&gt;Huh? Who are they?
&gt;Hands grab you and lift you to your feet
&gt;&quot;Sir, we have some questions for you&quot;
&gt;Your eyes focus on cops
&gt;A human and a dog- thing
&gt;NOPE!
&gt;You struggle and try to push them off you
&gt;&quot;NO! LEMME GO!&quot;
&gt;They would turn you  itno that group the BHA
&gt;Never! you had to fight them off!
&gt;But youre so tired and they are much stronger than you
&gt;You&#039;re thrown to the ground and they put the cuffs on you as you struggle 
&gt;So this is what you get for helping someone, you get arrested
&gt;They physically lift you as you try to fight them off you still and carry you into the back of a police car
&gt;You&#039;re thrown into the back of the patrol car roughly
&gt;&quot;Figures a fucking drugged hobo would attack a defenseless woman&quot; you hear one of the officers say 
&gt;What? They think you did it?
&gt;Figures they would
&gt;You feel the car start as you lay face down in the patrol car
&gt;Fuck these guys, they don&#039;t know anything


&gt;You sit in a jail cell waiting for something
&gt;Waiting for anything to happen
&gt;How many hours have you been in here?
&gt;Long enough for the pills in your system to wear off
&gt;Ugh what a waste of good pills and drugs
&gt;Whatever they wanted from you they wouldn&#039;t get it
&gt;After a while a few officers come and hand cuff you then drag you  to an interrogation room
&gt;Literally
&gt;You fought the whole way there
&gt;In the end though you&#039;re handcuffed to a table and sitting across from  german shepard thing
&gt;&quot;So sir. why dont we start with your name, im officer Davies&quot;
&gt;You frown
&gt;&quot;Fuck off, dog get me a person to talk to&quot;
&gt;He bares his teeth at you
&gt;&quot;Is that why you hurt that girl you speciest scum?!&quot;
&gt;Speciest?
&gt;&quot;Whats a speciest? Is that some kinda weird insult in this world?&quot;
&gt;When you say that his ears perk up
&gt;&quot;This world? Are you?&quot; He eyes you  &quot;One sec&quot; he says before leaving the room
&gt;You look over at the one way mirror and frown at your reflection
&gt;Long matted dirty hair, a scruffy straggely beard,  clothes covered in dirt and refuse and cold eyes
&gt;How long had it been? you lost count of the days
&gt;About 5 minutes later a human comes in wearing a suit and tie
&gt;&quot;Hello sir, I&#039;m going to ask you a question that might seem weird but, What do you know about the cold war?&quot;
&gt;You frown? he wants a godddam history lesson? What is this a joke?
&gt;&quot;You mean like the cuban missile crisis and the red scare? Hiding under your school desk from nukes?&quot;
&gt;His eyes go wider and wider as you answer
&gt;&quot;Wow, you&#039;re really from the other world&quot;
&gt;Your frown deepens 
&gt;&quot;You mean the normal world where animals aren&#039;t treated like people?&quot;
&gt;He looks you over and frowns back
&gt;&quot;Is that why you hurt that woman? Shes only about 20 and you know they couldn&#039;t save her eye&quot;
&gt;That makes you mad
&gt;Really really mad
&gt;&quot;Did you even talk to her? I didn&#039;t do that to her! She called for help and i carried her 3 miles to that hospital!&quot;
&gt;Another man in a suit enters the room and whisperes something into the First mans ear
&gt;&quot;My associate tells me that there were reports of a man matching your description carrying the victim, Ms. Cameron, to the hospital, but that doesn&#039;t mean that you didn&#039;t assault her in a drugged up stupor&quot;
&gt;You sigh and slump back against the chair angrly
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not talking to you anymore, you aren&#039;t listening to me anyway, plus you never read me my Rights&quot;
&gt;The men look at each other and frown
&gt;You knew you had them at that, in almost every state, at least the ones in your world, the police had to read a person thier rights when they are in custody before asking questions
&gt;And these guys had been asking questions
&gt;The men leave the room and you&#039;re left in the room for a while
&gt;How long you don&#039;t know but long enough for you to fall asleep
&gt;The sound of the door opening stirs you awake
&gt;A man wearing a cowboy hat walks in and sits down opposite you at the table
&gt;&quot;Howdy there, I&#039;m just here to let ya know you ain&#039;t under arrest or nothin&#039;. People call me Hank and I&#039;m with the BHA&quot;
&gt;You remember the BHA, men in Blacked out vans looking for you when you first arrived
&gt;&quot;You mean the feds? here to brainwash me to thinking these animals are people?&quot;
&gt;He actually smiles at that and chuckles to himself
&gt;&quot;They&#039;re called Anthros, and yes they are smiliar to feral animal but they are people, just a different kinda people. They aint much different in terms of who they are or how they act, just looks no different from a white person or a black person&quot;
&gt;Anthros? Fancy name and a lot of extra explaination for saying they ARE animals but legally they are people.
&gt;&quot;Fine animal people, What do you want anyway?&quot; you ask calmly
&gt; &quot;Well first off your name, and secondly what year did you come here?&quot; he says with a smile
&gt;&quot;Anon. I don&#039;t know what year it is here but I go pulled here summer of 2013&quot;
&gt;His eyes go wide
&gt;&quot;Oh man thats a while...tell me more about what happened&quot;
&gt;So you do
&gt;You tell him about how you were transported and where you were
&gt;What you did as a job
&gt;About the Drugs and alcohol
&gt;And all about your family
&gt;You hoped that he would telll you there&#039;s a way back to your world that you could return and see your family
&gt;Or at least tell you that there was a way to know they were ok
&gt;But he told you what you feared the worst
&gt;There was no way home, there was no way to find out about your family
&gt;You were stuck here with nothing
&gt;You feel your heart sink further than ever
&gt;No way home
&gt;&quot;Look Anon, we can help you at the BHA but you gotta get clean, we can send you to rehab but it&#039;s on you&quot;
&gt;Huh? Help? 
&gt;&quot;What do you mean help? I&#039;ve got nothing here&quot;
&gt;He smiles
&gt;&quot;We know you&#039;ve got nothing but the BHA is here to help Anonymous memebers like you; thats what you are by the way; Anonymous, people like you got transported here&quot;
&gt;They&#039;ll help you, get a shell of your life back together? 
&gt;For What?
&gt;&quot;Whats the catch?&quot;
&gt;He shakes his head, &quot;no catch, its our job, you get clean, we shack you up in a temporary home until you can get on your feet&quot;
&gt;You sigh
&gt;&quot;Rehab huh? Alright then, how do we get this started?&quot;
&gt;You hear what sounds like shouting from the other side of the glass
&gt;After a moment one of the men is suits bursts in yelling
&gt;&quot;You can&#039;t Just Let him go! he brutally attacked a young Anthro!&quot;
&gt;Hank Stands and looks the man over
&gt;&quot;He&#039;s our responsibility now, if by chance he DID do this we can turn him over to you once you do some investigating WITHOUT voliating his rights next time&quot;
&gt;The man in the suit, you never learned his name but he looks utterly defeated
&gt;&quot;Fine but we want full details on where he will be&quot;
&gt;You rattle the handcuffs holding you to the table
&gt;&quot;Can I get uncuffed now?&quot; you ask 
&gt;Grumbling the suit uncuffs you and lets you go
&gt;You rub your wrists and stand up
&gt;Maybe it was time to turn your life back around



Chapter 3:  Beauty of a Hidden Heart

&gt;It burns, it all burns
&gt;You skin crawls and you feel like you’re going to puke at any moment
&gt;Withdrawal is being a bitch and a half and you&#039;re only 2 days into the detox process
&gt;Now you knew why those junkies would just keep themselves high
&gt;Except you are the junkie
&gt;The Bureau of Human Assistance, or the BHA, the people you avoided so actively were there to help all along
&gt;They were paying for this Rehab for you
&gt;It was a high end place too, you got your own room
&gt;Hank said they had failed you, that you living in the streets should have never happened
&gt;He told you an expert in Human assistance would come as well as another Anonymous Member
&gt;But when they would come he hadn&#039;t told you, but he did say it would be sometime this week
&gt;You hoped it was soon, you wanted to know how to live again
&gt;How to be a person
&gt;How to cope with losing everything
&gt;More than everything, Losing your family, the love of your life and your kids
&gt;How do you get back to being the person you were, when they were the reason you were
&gt;They had been the best of you
&gt;And you had been here how long?
&gt;Hank told you it had been 5 years
&gt;Five long years on the street
&gt;Amanda would be 11, Derek would be 9...
&gt;You had missed them growing up
&gt;For what? You were given no real reason as to why you were pulled here
&gt;Only a bunch of Half-assed &quot;No one knows&quot;
&gt;You look in the mirror at the shell of your former self
&gt;Dressed in white hospital garments, hair clean and free of knots but still long and unkempt
&gt;Your facial hair had grown wild, you looked like a crazed version of Hagrid from harry potter
&gt;A knock at your door and in pop the head of a Human nurse
&gt;They don’t bother waiting for an answer here for some reason but they learned to peek first
&gt;The last time they just entered it was an big wol- Ahem- a Wolf Anthro
&gt;How else does someone react to a Fucking hug wolf tearing open the door than to throw the first thing in reach at it?
&gt;Turn out for you the first reaction was the throw a lamp at it- Him- right him not it
&gt;But a human you’re ok with
&gt;&quot;Mr. Anon? You have a few visitors, try to stay calm&quot;
&gt;It must be them, finally
&gt;You&#039;re about to answer when in walks a tiger
&gt;A FUCKING TIGER
&gt;This is like a bad version of some gladiator game
&gt;You trapped in a small room with an apex predator and no weapons
&gt;A certain British man’s voice hits you
&gt;IMPROVISE ADAPT OVERCOME
&gt;You jump to your Closet and rip out the hanger bar
&gt;Fuck this you aren’t going down without a fight
&gt;&quot;ANON PLEASE CALM DOWN YOU!&quot; you hear the nurse shouting
&gt;Fuck that! It’s a goddam tiger
&gt;As you go to swing your improvised club at the tiger something hits you in the chest sending you sprawling out onto the floor
&gt;&quot;Calm down, I know you&#039;re scared but try to avoid attacking us&quot;
&gt;You look up from the floor, rubbing your head
&gt;In front of the tiger is a man
&gt;Heavily scarred and wearing an eyepatch, he look like he belonged in a modern Wild West film
&gt;Somehow not only had he decked you but also gotten ahold of the bar you had in your hands
&gt;But his calm stern voice calm you down 
&gt;&quot;Sorry...sorry I&#039;m just not used to...them&quot; you say, looking away
&gt;&quot;Anthros?&quot; you hear him say
&gt;You look up at him
&gt;He is offering you a hand to help you up
&gt;You take it and he pulls you to your feet with ease
&gt;&quot;Yea... Anthros&quot; you say still not making eye contact with either
&gt;A hand falls on your shoulder, making you jump and look at him
&gt;&quot;Come on, let&#039;s all talk. Maybe somewhere a little more open&quot; he says with a slight smile
&gt;You nod and avoid looking the tiger
&gt;As much as they tell you it’s ok to be near them, memories of people torn apart by animals float in your head
&gt;Even koalas, those Chlamydia infested fucks, were dangerous in your world
&gt;And Here you had seen them walking around 
&gt;Where they also infected? Not that you really cared for the answer
&gt;The duo lead you to an outside courtyard, a picnic table sits in the center under a dogwood tree whose petals rain like snow
&gt;You sneak a few peeks at the tiger as it- she sits
&gt;Is she pregnant?
&gt;You feel a twinge of guilt in your stomach
&gt;Was this who you wanted to be? A man who attacked pregnant animals
&gt;Not animals
&gt;People
&gt;You sit opposite them and finally look at the tigers face and notice her eyes
&gt;Green like American money
&gt;You quickly look away
&gt;&quot;Come on now, I won&#039;t bite&quot; She says calmly
&gt;You fight your urge to run as you look up at her
&gt;Yea, that’s a tiger, a white tiger, that’s smiling at you with her large fangs exposed
&gt;&quot;There you go! See! I&#039;m not gonna attack you or anything, although I must say your reaction to seeing me was a bit more...violent.... than I expected&quot; She says calmly
&gt;You look back down
&gt;&quot;Sorry, I&#039;m just no used to this yet&quot;
&gt;More guilt 
&gt;You tried attacking her and she’s being nice
&gt;Something fuzzy on your hand makes you jump and pull it back to you across the table quickly
&gt;&quot;Sorry! I didn&#039;t mean to startle you!&quot; you hear her voice
&gt;You look back up
&gt;Come on man! Keep it together
&gt;It’s just a giant murder cat and a dude that makes Clint Eastwood look like a pussy
&gt;Clint Eastwood never even existed here! Why does that bother you so much right now!?
&gt;Breathe, Introduce yourself
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s ok, just not used to this, I&#039;m Anon&quot;
&gt;You extend a hand, a Shivering, shaky hand
&gt;But it’s still your hand
&gt;She takes it slowly and gently
&gt;This must not be her first rodeo
&gt;&quot;Jasmine, pleasure to meet you Anon&quot;
&gt;Fuzzy paw and sharp claws
&gt;You would be lying if those didn&#039;t make you nervous
&gt;Those sharp fangs of hers too
&gt;When she lets go she introduces her friend
&gt;&quot;And this is my lovely husband!&quot; she says enthusiastically motioning to the man who knocked you over like you were a child
&gt;Husband? Humans and Anthros together? This opens up a whole new world of confusion to you
&gt;Also no wonder he was so fast to defend her, you would have done the same for Amanda...
&gt;He seems to sense your confusion and unease as he extends a hand to you
&gt;&quot;People call me Chick, I&#039;m Anonymous like you are and I’m sure you have questions&quot;
&gt;You sigh and look at him then her then back at him
&gt;&quot;First things first&quot; you say with a knot in your throat &quot;Can I ever learn what happened to my family? I was driving andIgotPulledAndThen...” 
&gt;You feel the tears forming and your mouth stop working
&gt;You know the answer already but you need to confirm it with someone who has been through it
&gt;&quot;There&#039;s no way to know for sure, not unless another Anonymous member appears with knowledge of them&quot; He says solemnly
&gt; Tears run silently down your face as you look at him
&gt;&quot;None?&quot; you choke out
&gt;He shakes his head
&gt;&quot;I’m sorry Anon, there&#039;s nothing we can do&quot;
&gt;You hang your head, and wish you could do the same to your body
&gt;&quot;What- Who did you leave behind Anon?&quot; you head Jasmine&#039;s sorrowful voice
&gt;Its almost instinct how you reach into your pocket for the picture of your family
&gt;How many times a day did you do it? 
&gt;Even when your old torn clothes got taken you saved the only memoir from your old world
&gt;You slide it across the table to them, tears running down your face as you point each out
&gt;&quot;Ashley was 6 when I left, she wanted to be a news broadcaster&quot;
&gt;&quot;Derek was 4, he said he wanted to be a firefighter like me&quot;
&gt;&quot;Amanda was my high school sweetheart, we said we would always be together&quot;
&gt;That last part made you fall forward into your arms, sobbing quietly 
&gt;Always together can sometime mean together as long as the universe thought you deserved it
&gt;By now, if she was still alive she might be remarried
&gt;Living a whole new life where you were a distant memory, a scar in the back of her mind
&gt;Would your children even remember you?
&gt;It all hits you again like tsunami, washing over you and drowning you in sorrow
&gt;A fuzzy paw rests on your hand which is still on your families’ portrait
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m so sorry Anon, I can&#039;t even begin to say I understand&quot; jasmine says, you can hear her choking back tears
&gt;You look up at her and chick, tears still in your eyes
&gt;Even with your vision blurred you can see the tears forming in her eyes
&gt;And Chick is... stoic, a face you&#039;ve seen before
&gt;A look on the face of your fellow firefighters when they lose something
&gt;When you emerge from a fire with a dead child in their arms
&gt;A face trying hard to not show the pain
&gt;So he was like you
&gt;How like you, you don&#039;t know, but you weren&#039;t going to ask
&gt;You knew how it felt to try to describe your past life
&gt;He seems to also want to change the subject, for your sake, and maybe in some part for his
&gt;&quot;When you were found, they said you carried a Dog Anthro 3 miles to the hospital where you were arrested, if you&#039;re so scared of Anthos, why would you do that? He asks, his voice monotone, but with a slight crack of emotion
&gt;It was barely there but you picked up on it
&gt;Maybe
&gt;You wipe your eyes and look at him
&gt;&quot;Honestly? I didn&#039;t know she was an Anthro when I saved her, I heard crying for help and I just...acted... and when she passed out I couldn&#039;t just leave her to die, I’m not a monster&quot;
&gt;He nods, maybe in approval, maybe in understanding
&gt;&quot;You can trust Anthros you know, they won&#039;t try to hurt you, they are just people like you and me&quot;
&gt;You at him, eyeing the scars and eyepatch
&gt;&quot;Promise I can?&quot;
&gt;He nods and digs into his pocket before pulling out a photo of his own
&gt;Its him, Jasmine, a tall man with his arm around a snow leopard, and a gruff man with holding a raccoon in front of him
&gt;All of them are smiling and happy
&gt;He points to each human
&gt;&quot;3rd Generation Anonymous, Married to a snow leopard&quot; he points to the tallest one
&gt;&quot;First generation Anonymous, Married to a raccoon&quot;
&gt;Jasmine smiles happily and digs through her purse and pulls out a small book
&gt;She flips it open, revealing a photo album and points to each picture as she does
&gt;&quot;1st generation married a Maned wolfess, 1st Generation married to a Hybrid...&quot;
&gt;She goes on and on
&gt;1st gen, 2nd gen, 3rd gen Anonymous
&gt;Happily married to Anthros, some with children
&gt;&quot;You can trust us Anthros Anon, we are people like you, just a bit fuzzier&quot; she says, intentionally causing her fur to fluff out a bit
&gt;You actually stifle out a bit of a laugh
&gt;&quot;I-I&#039;ll try&quot; you say meekly
&gt;&quot;Good, because I have someone who wants to meet you really badly&quot; Jasmine says with a toothy smile as she taps away at a phone
&gt;Who would want to meet you?
&gt;You don&#039;t know anyone here
&gt;Chick looks a bit uneasy, looking from you to the tigress
&gt;&quot;You sure about this love?&quot; he says quietly
&gt;You&#039;re sure you weren&#039;t meant to hear that but you did anyway over the quiet taps of clawed pads hitting glass
&gt;&quot;mhm, trust me!&quot;
&gt;What are they talking about?
&gt;You&#039;re left to sit and ponder that for a moment before a familiar feminine voice sounds off behind you
&gt;&quot;UH h-hi&quot;
&gt;No
&gt;It can&#039;t be
&gt;You turn around and see her
&gt;The dog you saved from the mob
&gt;Wearing a blue and white button up shirt and jeans
&gt;And with a medical bandage covering her left eye and bandages wrapped around what would be her right arm
&gt;Even now in your disbelief she stands awkwardly, her remaining purple eye focused on you
&gt;&quot;Anon this is Madeline Cameron, the Anthro you saved&quot; you hear Jasmines voice
&gt;You barely hear her
&gt;Her screams echo back to you
&gt;The mob surrounding her
&gt;The smell of her blood that covered you as you ran
&gt;You stare as she nervously shuffles next to you
&gt;&quot;Uh... Hi...I&#039;m Madeline, My friends call me Mattie&quot; the Dog says to you 
&gt;She raises her stump, frowns at it then raises her left paw to you
&gt;Hesitantly you stand then reach up and shake it
&gt;Fuzzy paw
&gt;You look at her, light brown fur covers her body, her hair is cut short
&gt;Her ears end in black fur and she has an uneasy smile\
&gt;&quot;T-thank you Anon, they told me you carried me 3 miles and that you used your belt to apply a tourniquet to keep me from bleeding out&quot; 
&gt;She has a cute voice, that’s a bit higher than you expect
&gt;You feel her eye studying you
&gt;It makes you suddenly self-conscious
&gt;You need a haircut and to shave badly
&gt;But they wouldn&#039;t let you have sharp things here so that would have to wait
&gt;She sits next to you at the table as you sit
&gt;&quot;Anon was a firefighter before he got pulled here, we&#039;re working on getting him recertified&quot; Jasmine says with a smile 
&gt;They were? News to you but whatever you needed a job
&gt;&quot;So you have no family here?  Who is here to visit you and stuff?&quot; Mattie asks with a frown
&gt;You frown slightly
&gt;&quot;Anon doesn&#039;t have anyone besides us right now&quot; Jasmine answers for you
&gt;&quot;Oh....can I visit you again then, you saved my life I would feel awful just leaving you here&quot; 
&gt;Mattie looks up at you then her ears fold down
&gt;You recognize that! That’s what dogs do when they are unsure!
&gt;Moose used to do that....
&gt;&quot;You don&#039;t mind if I visit you, do you Anon?&quot;
&gt;You sigh
&gt;Might as well get used to being around Anthros
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t mind Mattie, I could use the company&quot; you say looking at her
&gt;Her short tail wags slightly as you answer
&gt;When you look up you see Jasmine beaming at you with a smile
&gt;&quot;That’s good progress to getting you used to Anthros Anon&quot; Jasmine says before looking at her cell phone
&gt;&quot;Oh shoot, we have to go! We have a doctor’s appointment, it was nice to meet you Anon&quot; 
&gt;Both Jasmine and chick stand up
&gt;You stand up as well and shake their paw and hand, respectively
&gt;Mattie stands as well and looks at you
&gt;&quot;I have to go too Anon, my parents are worried about me and came into town&quot;
&gt;She sticks out her left paw, which you shake 
&gt;&quot;Thank you again, I’ll see you again soon&quot;
&gt;She leaves the courtyard, leaving you underneath the dogwood tree
&gt;The petals billow past as you stand and a shiver runs down your spine
&gt;So this was it then
&gt;The start of your new life
&gt;But were you ready for it?
&gt;You breathe deep and head back to your room
&gt;It doesn&#039;t matter if you’re ready or not
&gt;You just have to keep on living


Chapter 4: Broken

&gt;Withdrawal was proving to be a bitch and a half
&gt;Turns out you had a mix of drugs in your system because you never even bothered to learn what it was that you took
&gt;As such, you got hit with a tsunami of symptoms
&gt;Nausea, Shivers, headaches, joint pain, you name it
&gt;It had been 6 days since Jasmine, Chick and Mattie had visited you
&gt;And as sincere as Mattie sounded when she said she would visit you, you doubted she would
&gt;Why would she?
&gt;Who would want to visit a junkie hobo?
&gt;Hopefully not a girl like her, she seemed nice enough even though she was a dog
&gt;So you sit in your room, suffering in silence
&gt;They offered you some other kinda drugs to wean you off but you refused
&gt;It didn&#039;t make sense to you
&gt;&quot;Here take more drugs to get you off drugs&quot;
&gt;Dumb logic to you so you sat alone in your room
&gt;There was an area you could go out and watch TV and socialize, but there were too many anthros out there
&gt;How do people come here and just accept it?
&gt;How do they come to this world and just see animal people and say &quot;oh ok cool&quot;
&gt;Maybe they didn&#039;t have the panicked wake up you did
&gt;A scrambling crawl through an alley looking for your family
&gt;Was it just because you had so much to lose? So much you had lost?
&gt;Your thoughts are broken by a knock at your door
&gt;&quot;Anon? You have a visitor&quot; 
&gt;Jasmine had requested you have an Anthro nurse or helper or whatever her title was
&gt;An anthro border collie Named Michelle
&gt;She was nice enough to you, although she often wanted you to go out and socialize
&gt;Nope, you needed to get used to this on your own pace
&gt;It was taking a while but you were getting there
&gt;How weird was it to see these animals that look like your pets back home
&gt;No...Not back home
&gt;This was your home now, there was no way to go back
&gt;&quot;Anon?&quot;
&gt;You snap back from your mental detour and focus back on Michelle
&gt;&quot;Uh.. right.. let them in&quot; you say, not trying to sound dismissive
&gt;But you can&#039;t quite look at her, she reminded you too much of your childhood pet
&gt;But with boobs and hair
&gt;Michelle disappears behind the door frame and ushers in Mattie, who gives a small, but warm smile
&gt;&quot;Hi Anon, you cleaned yourself up I see&quot; she says, her purple eye studying your face
&gt;You run your fingers through your hair and down your now clean shaven face
&gt;&quot;Yea... couldn&#039;t stay looking like that&quot; you say attempting to smile
&gt;The small Canine girl looks around your room quickly until her eye rests on the photo of your family
&gt;&quot;Is this...Them? Your family I mean?&quot; she says stepping closer to it
&gt;Every instinct is telling you to leap forwards and snatch the picture away, but you resist it
&gt;She&#039;s just a girl coming to thank you
&gt;Not a monster
&gt;Just have a conversation with her
&gt;Easy right?
&gt;You swallow hard and step forwards
&gt;&quot;Yea, that&#039;s Amanda, and Derek and Ashley and our dog Moose&quot; you say as you point out each one of them
&gt;It&#039;s hard holding back the emotions in your voice
&gt;She steps away from it instantly
&gt;&quot;Sorry! Sorry! I know that must be a tough subject&quot;
&gt;You sigh, turn and then sit on your bed
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t be sorry Mattie, It&#039;s not your fault&quot;
&gt;She walks over and sits next to you
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m still sorry that happened to you, I can&#039;t imagine what you went through&quot;
&gt;You look over at her and see her looking down at the floor
&gt;Tears forming in her eye
&gt;Fatherly instincts kick on
&gt;&quot;Hey Hey! Look, I&#039;m...dealing with it, if anything I&#039;m sorry&quot;
&gt;She give a light sniff then looks at you
&gt;&quot;Y-You? Sorry? For what?&quot;
&gt;You frown slightly and your eyes fall on the stump that was her arm
&gt;&quot;That... if I hadn&#039;t been on whatever drugs, I might have been able to find and save your arm....&quot; you trail off, looking down
&gt;It had bothered you for days
&gt;Her arm couldn&#039;t have just disappeared
&gt;And in your drugged haze you might have just glazed over it 
&gt;The guilt was in the bottom of your stomach like a pit
&gt;A fuzzy touch, padded fingers grip the top of your hand
&gt;&quot;You saved my Life, you beat those men up with a pipe, put a tourniquet on me and THEN and carried me 3 miles, you did more than enough&quot;
&gt;You grip her paw
&gt;Honestly this was the only real meaningful contact you&#039;ve had with someone since you got taken
&gt;But meaningful doesn&#039;t need to be dreary; so it was best to change the subject
&gt;&quot;So uh Mattie, do you have a job or school or something?&quot;
&gt;She frowns a bit
&gt;&quot;I was in school to be a Pharmacist, but I&#039;ve had to take time off because of the injury&quot;
&gt;Pharmacist? That means she could get you...
&gt;NO
&gt;You shake the thoughts out of your head
&gt;Rehab is for getting better, not for pressuring the only creature here to show you compassion into getting you drugs
&gt;But you felt hollow
&gt;Those drugs filled the hole your family left
&gt;You were going to have to find a way to fill it, to not have a hole in your soul anymore
&gt;Or at least learn to live with it there
&gt;&quot;And you Anon? What did you do before? I recall Jasmine said you were a firefighter&quot; Mattie asks with a small smile
&gt;You focus back on Mattie
&gt;Had you always wandered in and out of thoughts?
&gt;Must have messed with your cognitive functions along the way
&gt;&quot;I was a firefighter. But I was also an EMT&quot;
&gt;You look into Mattie&#039;s deep purple eye and she smiles
&gt;&quot;That explains how you were able to hit those guys so hard&quot; 
&gt;Heh something like that
&gt;In times of stress, muscle memories come back like a flood
&gt;All those hours training to get through doors
&gt;Hours spent cutting through drywall to look for the last ember to put out
&gt;What you assume is Mattie&#039;s Cell phone rings a few short rings, causing her to jump slightly
&gt;&quot;Oh! Sorry Anon, one sec!&quot; she says with her ears folded down
&gt;Digging through her purse quickly, she fished up a cell phone with a small charm made out of coins with holes in them
&gt;Japanese coins? You can&#039;t tell from here
&gt;&quot;Hello? hi Mom, oh... I&#039;m with Anon&quot;
&gt;She mouths a quick &quot;Sorry&quot; to you
&gt;&quot;Yes the guy who saved me.. Huh?&quot;
&gt;Her remaining eye goes wide and you swear you can see the color drain from her face despite all the fur
&gt;&quot;NO! NO NO Mom! He&#039;s Not used to Anthr- Hello?&quot;
&gt;She looks at her phone, wide eyed
&gt;&quot;FUCK!... Uh.. Anon, How would you like to meet my parents?&quot;
&gt;You blink twice at her, mouth agape
&gt;If you were a computer you would have a Loading bar
&gt;&quot;Parents? what?&quot;
&gt;She gives you a small apprehensive smile
&gt;&quot;Yyyyyes? They want to meet you and thank you&quot;
&gt;You give a small sigh, looks like you can&#039;t get out of this
&gt;She gives a small smile of sympathy
&gt;&quot;Please Anon, they really wanna meet you, plus I think you should get out of here for a bit...Michelle told me you just stay in here all day&quot;
&gt;You feel a small squeeze on your hand 
&gt;&quot;Please?&quot;
&gt;Perhaps you could use a little time out of here, out of the alley and out of the streets
&gt;But were you ready to be out there?
&gt;You look down and away from her, trying to avoid her eye contact
&gt;But your gaze falls on the picture of your family
&gt;Would they be proud of what you were doing? Trying to hide from thankful parents?
&gt;Hell, you would do the same thing if someone saved Ashley....
&gt;&quot;OK Mattie, I&#039;ll meet them&quot; you say with a bit of hesitation
&gt;You look back to her and see her grinning broadly
&gt;&quot;Thank you Anon&quot; She sighs out with a bit of relief
&gt;&quot;For the record I tried to tell them you aren&#039;t too fond of Anthros...&quot;
&gt;You frown
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s not that I&#039;m not fond of anthros Mattie&quot;
&gt;She stares at you with her head cocked to the side
&gt;&quot;I never really got, I Dunno, introduced to them in a non shocking way I guess? I woke up in a panic to find my family only to have&quot;
&gt;You motion to her in mock shock
&gt;&quot;THIS! People out of a story book or a children&#039;s movie but real! Walking, talking animals! And honestly you&#039;re the only one I&#039;ve talked to more than a few seconds!&quot;
&gt;She squeezes your hand tighter
&gt;&quot;Well I hope I&#039;m giving you a good impression&quot; 
&gt;How could she not?
&gt;No other person, human or anthro, would give you the time of day
&gt;Yet here an anthro was talking to you 
&gt;She even visited you like she said
&gt;You stand and she follows suit
&gt;&quot;Lead on, I guess&quot; you mumble hesitantly
&gt;A quick nod and the small Canine is leading you gently out the door and through the rehab center
&gt;&quot;Ms. Cameron, already lea- Mr. Ymous, you&#039;re out of your room!?
&gt;Michelle stands at the nurses station, wide eyed and mouth agape
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m Borrowing Anon! I&#039;ll bring him back later!&quot; Mattie calls out as she pushes past the shocked nurses
&gt;You&#039;re lead into the street, where you stand shivering and looking around quickly
&gt;So many of them... so many different kinds
&gt;Lizards? Felines? Birds? Bovines?  
&gt;So many different kinds of Anthros rush past you in this bustling city that you don&#039;t even know the name of
&gt;Iron weighs down on your feet, your eyes shift quickly and you feel your body shiver
&gt;Too many!
&gt;Too Much!
&gt;Barking! Squawking! Mewling!
&gt;Your lungs feel like they are going to collapse, your heart is going to implode with how fast it&#039;s beating
&gt;Vague shouting, a somewhat familiar voice
&gt;One you just barely got accustomed to
&gt;&quot;ANON!&quot;
&gt;A sharp tug on your arm and you&#039;re staring at Mattie
&gt;&quot;Hey there... Stay here with me... Focus on me, come on&quot;
&gt;You breathe deep and keep you eyes locked on her, trying to ignore the anthros pushing past
&gt;A quick chirp from her phone and she breaks contact with you to dig in her purse again
&gt;Your hand feels somehow incomplete without her paw there
&gt;Was it because you were out here? There were only 2 real anchors you had in this world at the moment
&gt;Your alley; a smelly dark place where you could hide until your final days
&gt;And her, a small anthro you barely know
&gt;Pathetic, once you think about it
&gt;Mattie is holding her phone in her paw, texting and cursing to herself
&gt;You see her stump move a bit each time she swears
&gt;&quot;Do you need help?&quot; you ask calmly, looking for something to do with your hands
&gt;She looks up at you quickly, a slight look of annoyance on her muzzle
&gt;You put your hands up, unsure of what you did
&gt;&quot;Uh sorry Madeline, just trying to help&quot;
&gt;Her face softens at that
&gt;&quot;Just Mattie Anon, and its not your fault, I just have to get used to this I guess&quot; she waves the bandaged stump at you as she speaks
&gt;Another wave of guilt, another stab of sorrow
&gt;&quot;Not that it&#039;s your fault!&quot; she says quickly as she grasps you hand and pulls you to a parking garage nearby
&gt;You must have had a frown on your face
&gt;&quot;Come on, my parents will meet us here&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re dreading meeting her parents to be honest
&gt;How could you look them in the eye?
&gt;You&#039;re a drug addicted loser who let their daughter lose an eye and an arm
&gt;She has a firm hold of your hand when a car pulls up
&gt;How long has it been since you paid attention to car models?
&gt;Well, you know the answer
&gt;5 years
&gt;5 years of being out of the loop on everything
&gt;Even more so because this world has different types of cars to accommodate different sized anthros and their various limbs
&gt;Bigger cabs for antlers, seats with holes for tails to peek through, sunroofs for giraffes
&gt;Pretty neat considering 
&gt;But a Black car parks in front of you and Mattie, who holds your hand in anticipation
&gt;No matter how mentally prepared you think you are, the explosion of fur and emotion is more than you bargained for
&gt;A small cannon ball of fur hits your midsection in a hug, knocking the wind out of you 
&gt;You let go of Mattie&#039;s paw and double over, the pint sized furball latched onto your stomach
&gt;&quot;THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!!!!!&quot;
&gt;You gasp and fall over, the wind knocked out of you 
&gt;A few coughs escape you as you try to pry the whatever it is off you
&gt;&quot;Jesus Beth, Let the man up&quot; you hear a distinct male voice chime in
&gt;The fuzzy missile lets go and back off, leaving you winded and on the ground
&gt;&quot;Sorry, I got too excited....&quot; 
&gt;You feel a paw and a hand offer to help you up
&gt;Grasping both, you&#039;re lifted to your feet
&gt;Mattie has one hand and the other is a human
&gt;Not what you expected when Mattie said her parents where coming
&gt;As you stand, you see a small dog anthro about Mattie&#039;s size and a Human
&gt;Standing tall and with a confident smile, he helps you too your feet
&gt;You&#039;re at a loss for words
&gt;&quot;Wait.. Humans and anthros can mix?&quot; you ask before you can stop yourself
&gt;Then the thought of Jasmine and Chick float back into your head
&gt;As you say it you realize how much of a dick you sound like
&gt;But water off the man&#039;s back, he smiles instead
&gt;&quot;Ah Mattie told us a bit about you, don&#039;t know much about this world huh?&quot; he says with a smile
&gt;The Small dog anthro next to Mattie hugs her tight and then looks to you in anticipation, only to be held back by the man
&gt;&quot;Calm down Beth... this poor man had a rougher time than I did coming here&quot; 
&gt;A Hand is extended to you calmly
&gt;&quot;Chase Cameron, first generation Anonymous, like you&quot; the man says confidently
&gt;The hand lingers for a moment as you stare at it, trying to catch our breath
&gt;You reach out and shake it uneasily
&gt;&quot;Anon, uh...Yea, nice to meet you&quot; 
&gt;How you gasped that out is beyond you, the furry projectile knocked everything out of you
&gt;&quot;Elizabeth Cameron!&quot; 
&gt;The offending cannonball has pushed between you and Chase, her eyes alight with a fire you haven&#039;t seen before
&gt;Her paw is extended to you, however it quivers with anticipation
&gt;You go to grasp it only to have your hand pushed out of the way and have Her latch onto you once again
&gt;&quot;THANK YOU ANON&quot;
&gt;You look to Mattie, who can only give a half-hearted smile
&gt;Looking down, Beth is holding your waist like a vice grip
&gt;&quot;You Saved our only daughter, even though you had such a bad time with anthros&quot;
&gt;A quick look around for some relief shows that Mattie and Chase are both standing back, letting this play out
&gt;Yes, this was a meaningful show of affection, but Seriously you don&#039;t want a hug
&gt;Hesitantly, you pat Beth&#039;s head, even though you&#039;re unsure if that&#039;s ok
&gt;&quot;hey now, I was just doing what anyone would do&quot; you say calmly, hoping your words will make her loosen up on you
&gt;Unfortunately it has the opposite effect and she tightens around you more
&gt;&quot;NOOOO! You saved her! THANK YOU!&quot;
&gt;You look to Mattie only to see her face palm (Face Paw?) at her mother&#039;s antics
&gt;&quot;Mom please, he don&#039;t know how to interact with anthros yet! Plus you&#039;re embarrassing me!&quot; Mattie sighs, finally coming to your Aid
&gt;All of your attempts to squirm away result in a tighter hug
&gt;The canine looks up at you with tears in her eyes
&gt;&quot;We can never repay you Anon... We don&#039;t know what&#039;s happened to you but you can always call us for a hand!&quot;
&gt;Finally Beth lets you go and rejoins her husband
&gt;&quot;Mattie said you were homeless for a while Anon, why don&#039;t we at the very least treat you to dinner?&quot;
&gt;Your body shudders violently and completely involuntarily, causing you to collapse
&gt;&quot;Anon?! You ok?&quot; Mattie cries as she rushes to your side
&gt;You start getting up slowly and cautiously
&gt;&quot;Withdrawal Mattie, not ok at all really&quot;
&gt;Beth looks you over a bit differently now
&gt;&quot;Withdrawal? like drugs?&quot;
&gt;You grimace and look away
&gt;&quot;I haven&#039;t had a great time in this world&quot; 
&gt;You feel Mattie&#039;s paw wrap around your hand once more
&gt;&quot;Well, let&#039;s make it better then, I can help you in this world as repayment for saving me&quot;
&gt;A firm hand falls on your shoulder, and chase gives you a small shake
&gt;&quot;What you&#039;ve done to yourself was terrible, but we aren&#039;t here to judge that alright? Mattie, send me the address of the rehab center, we&#039;ll just have to settle for pizza for now&quot; He says with a smile
&gt;Beth grips you in another hug
&gt;&quot;We&#039;ll see you in a moment!&quot;
&gt;They break away and get into a black Mustang and pull away as Mattie walks you out of the parking Garage
&gt;&quot;Well uh, they seem nice&quot; you finally choke out
&gt;&quot;Dad came from your world a while ago, so he understands what you&#039;re going through kinda&quot; 
&gt;Mattie pulls you along slowly and more cautiously this time
&gt;&quot;You Ok Anon? Sorry about mom&#039;s hugs, she nearly reopened my stitches hugging me when she saw me at the airport&quot; 
&gt;You wave it aside
&gt;&quot;I understand as a parent, I can&#039;t hold it against her&quot; you say with a small smile
&gt;Seeing the level of parental concern was refreshing
&gt;It was so very...human
&gt;You both walk quietly back into the rehab center and back to the courtyard
&gt;You sit underneath the dogwood tree and feel the petals rain on you as Mattie fishes her phone out of her purse again to text her father
&gt;&quot;You like pepperoni right? that Moms favorite and mine too&quot; she asks as she texts
&gt;Heh a dog likes meat, not surprising
&gt;You nod calmly as you answer, realizing shes probably looking at her phone
&gt;&quot;Yea pepperoni is fine&quot;
&gt;Mattie smiles as she types away, mouthing out the words she texts
&gt;Cute
&gt;&quot;Ok they are coming with Pizza!&quot;
&gt;How long has it been since you had fresh pizza?
&gt;You sit and chat With Mattie about this world
&gt;The culture, the music, the TV
&gt;How to anthro couples work? If one is a dog and one is a cat can they breed?
&gt;She got a little annoyed when you said &quot;Breed&quot; though
&gt;&quot;Not Breed Anon! That&#039;s for animals! We aren&#039;t animals!&quot;
&gt;Well fuck, how were you to know what terms to use
&gt;By talking to her, you guess
&gt;Before long Beth and Chase arrive with a few pizzas
&gt;One bite and the flashbacks to your home are coursing in your head
&gt;Ashley&#039;s Pizza party when she turned 5
&gt;Yours and Amanda&#039;s first date...
&gt;So many years of eating old food out of dumpsters and trash cans must have killed your care for real food
&gt;That or the drugs made you not care
&gt;The talks you have with the Cameron family is amazing
&gt;Chase tells you of the historical differences
&gt;No cold war, no red scare
&gt;Beth tells you about different Anthros and how they like to live
&gt;Mattie tells you of how medicine is so different here
&gt;Before long you realize it&#039;s nearly 11 at night
&gt;Michelle is poking her head into the courtyard looking both impressed and a little sad
&gt;&quot;Hey guys I&#039;m sorry but we have to start closing up, I know you&#039;re making great progress with Anon but visiting hours ended hours ago&quot; 
&gt;Beth and Chase wish you a good night and leave, taking the leftover pizza with them
&gt;You walk with Mattie to the exit door before she stops and looks to Michelle
&gt;&quot;Can I Stay the Night with Anon Michelle? you can say its part of his integration right&quot;
&gt;you look a bit confused at Mattie then to Michelle
&gt;Why would she want to stay here with you?
&gt;Michelle pulls her jowls a bit and looks a bit distressed
&gt;&quot;Well...Mrs.Jasmine did say we have to get you used to Anthros so uh....&quot;
&gt;Mattie tugs Michelle&#039;s arm and looks up at her with her single purple eye
&gt;&quot;Pleaseee I don&#039;t want to leave Anon here alone!&quot;
&gt;Michelle swears under her breath and sighs
&gt;&quot;Fine! But it&#039;s only because he needs more contact with anthros!&quot;
&gt;Mattie does a short jump and pulls you back to your room
&gt;As you enter the room and close the door behind you, you give Mattie a quizzical look
&gt;&quot;Why would you wanna stay here with me Mattie?&quot;
&gt;She kicks off her shoes before turning and looking at you
&gt;&quot;Uh...Don&#039;t tell my parents ok?&quot;
&gt;You nod
&gt;&quot;Ever since...This&quot; she waves her stump at you &quot;I&#039;ve been having nightmares about that day and just hope with you here, I can get some decent sleep&quot;
&gt;This poor girl...How silly could you be to think she would only be physically scathed 
&gt;She must have been putting on a brave face for her parents so they wouldn&#039;t worry
&gt;You nod and go to your closet
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t have much in the ways of pajamas but I have uhm.. this&quot;
&gt;You toss her a t-shirt
&gt;She looks at it then at you and gives a small frown
&gt;&quot;C-can you help me change? It&#039;s a bit hard now...&quot;
&gt;You internally kick yourself before walking over to her
&gt;&quot;Ok but this is because I&#039;m helping you, nothing sexy or whatever&quot;
&gt;She nods and holds her arm and stump up
&gt;You pull her shirt off her, revealing a black sports bra
&gt;&quot;Keep em up&quot; you say and you grab the t-shirt
&gt;Carefully you slip it over her arm and head then grip her jeans and carefully pull them off her
&gt;She stands before you with a small smile
&gt;&quot;Thanks Anon&quot; she says with a smile
&gt;You strip down to your shirt and boxers before getting into your bed
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s a little cramped on this twin size, I hope you don&#039;t mind&quot;
&gt;She gets into the bed with you 
&gt;&quot;I just want a good night sleep, hopefully you and your smell will help&quot;
&gt;As you hold open the covers for her, she gives a small sigh and cuddles back into you
&gt;Being in a bed was weird enough after all this time, but being in a bed with someone, let alone an anthro was a whole new weird experience
&gt;You lay with her for a while, you arm around her
&gt;The ticking of the clock tells you it&#039;s been a while that you&#039;ve layed in bed
&gt;Was this too much too fast?
&gt;Mattie&#039;s quiet snores, while adorable, are a bit much
&gt;But when she starts kicking and crying in her sleep you have to act
&gt;How many nights had you laid with your children?
&gt;Enough to recognize a nightmare when you see one
&gt;And enough to know how to sooth one away
&gt;&quot;Shuuusssshhh it&#039;s ok Ashl-Mattie. I&#039;m here, you&#039;re ok&quot; you coo softly to her, running your fingers through her fur
&gt;The kicking slowly subsides along with the crying and whimpering as you gently talk to her
&gt;Before long a small smile is on her face
&gt;Still got it huh??
&gt;You smile slightly and focus on the small snores before you drift off to sleep yourself

Chapter 5: Do I Want To Know?

&gt;You awake slowly, feeling fur against you
&gt;Heh what a crazy dream, talking animals and drug filled days
&gt;But of course the fur you’re feeling is Moose, Amanda must&#039;ve let him into the bed again when she went to work
&gt;Hopefully there was some coffee waiting downstairs
&gt;You stay lying in bed, eyes closed, wrestling between getting up and out of your warm bed
&gt;Eventually the need to go to the bathroom wins out and you finally open your eyes
&gt;Wait... this isn&#039;t your room
&gt;Quickly you sit up and look around you room at the rehab center
&gt;The realization that you weren&#039;t dreaming sets in again
&gt;You feel a wave of disappointment wash over you
&gt;But wait what about the feeling of fur
&gt;You look down and remember that Mattie stayed with you overnight
&gt;She is still asleep, a small smile on her muzzle
&gt;Actually kind of cute...
&gt;You shake your head of the thought and carefully extract yourself from the bed as to not wake her
&gt;That skill you learned from sharing a bed with your wife
&gt;Ex-wife? Dead wife? Were you a widower?
&gt;The term doesn&#039;t matter
&gt;All you know is you&#039;re single now
&gt;Not a thought you enjoyed in the slightest
&gt;As you get up and head to the bathroom you think about dating
&gt;You hadn&#039;t ever really dated before
&gt;Amanda had been your high school sweetheart, as soon as you were able to marry her you did
&gt;As you relieve yourself you think about Anthros and humans dating
&gt;Chick and Jasmine were together and seemed happy
&gt;Chase and Beth obviously had “done the deed&quot; so to speak because Mattie was there with you
&gt;That spirals into a whole new set of thoughts
&gt;Do Anthros have the same parts as their &quot;feral&quot; counterparts?
&gt;You recall reading that kangaroos have like 4 vaginas
&gt;As well do dogs have that weird folded thing for a vagina? 
&gt;Fucking weird thing to think about first thing in the morning
&gt;Slight whimpering from the bedroom gets your attention
&gt;You shake it off and wash your hands quickly then go back to see what’s going on
&gt;Fatherly instincts always come back full swing
&gt;Mattie lays in your bed, a frown on her face
&gt;She whimpers softly and her legs kick a bit
&gt;Just like Moose did when he had nightmares
&gt;But she isn&#039;t a dog
&gt;Well she is but more than that
&gt;They keep emphasizing they are people too
&gt;Just different people...
&gt;Either way, you place a hand on her head and rub softly
&gt;&quot;Hey shush it&#039;s ok, you’re ok&quot; you whisper to her as you pet her head
&gt;Slowly her whimpering subsides and her frown is replaced by a smile again
&gt;Yep still got it
&gt;Quietly you pull away and go to your closet to begin getting ready for the day
&gt;What did you have to do today?
&gt;Not much, stay off drugs and stay out of trouble
&gt;You pull on some pants and change your shirt
&gt;Someone from the &quot;anonymous network&quot; had donated these to you
&gt;In fact ever since you go placed into this rehab center people have been donating things
&gt;You would have to ask someone about why they would do that
&gt;You remember dealing with...no not dealing with... you knew better now
&gt;You remember talking to a few homeless people while you were in your old world
&gt;They said most people ignored them, rather than treating them like a person
&gt;Why was it different here?
&gt;Maybe humans learned better here, pack mentality or something like that
&gt;Either way you were eternally grateful
&gt;A pang of hunger hits you
&gt;You don&#039;t usually go to the cafeteria to get food
&gt;No reason to, usually Michelle or one of the other nurses brings it to you
&gt;But you&#039;re sure Mattie must be hungry as well
&gt;Silently you slide out of the room and head to the Cafeteria
&gt;Before you even get to it the smell of coffee and bacon waft past you
&gt;Memories flash by as you walk
&gt;Hanging out at the firehouse with your crew
&gt;Brewing a pot of coffee as you got the kids ready for school and day care
&gt;Making BLTs for dinner with the kids and Amanda
&gt;Why did the sense tied most to memory have to be smell?
&gt;More and more memories wash over you like hard waves
&gt;And all you can do is try to walk through them as they crash down upon you
&gt;New memories float up from within the depths of your brain
&gt;They make you want those pills again
&gt;Something, Anything; a pill or a hit from a pipe to drown those memories again
&gt;You stop and breathe hard, resting a hand on the wall
&gt;Why did you have to be the one pulled here?
&gt;Why not so many of those single people, men and women without a family to leave behind
&gt;But then again another thing chick told you floats up
&gt;Sometimes children get pulled here, sometimes infants
&gt;You remember all the pictures of missing children, feelings of happiness and sadness hit
&gt;You were happy that those children might not just be dead, but sad because you think of all the parents missing their children
&gt;Pull yourself together Anon!
&gt;What were those breathing techniques you learned
&gt;Breathe in for 4 seconds through your nose
&gt;Breathe out for 4 seconds through your mouth
&gt;Calm down, but keep a hold of those memories
&gt;No needs to throw them away, save them
&gt;Once you feel like you’re calm enough you continue walking to the cafeteria
&gt;The set up they have is basically like a buffet with several different kinds of foods being kept warm
&gt;The BHA sure got you into a top of the line rehab center
&gt;You grab up 2 trays and begin loading them up with the basics
&gt;Scrambled eggs, bacon, a few slices of toast, and 2 cups of coffee
&gt;Does Mattie even drink coffee?
&gt;Meh even if she doesn&#039;t you&#039;ll drink it
&gt;You can feel the stares though, the other patients staring at your back
&gt;You&#039;re aware that you&#039;re the odd man out and that they probably knew about you
&gt;In fact one of the first few days here you got called a &quot;Speciest&quot; by a wolf Anthro
&gt;You assumed it was like the word racist but ignored it nonetheless
&gt;Plus you&#039;re sure they were trying to bait you
&gt;Were Anthros stronger than humans? Were different ones better at certain sports?
&gt;What about the Olympics? How do those work? Is there a human category?
&gt;Fuck were their just species categories?
&gt;So many things to ask and learn about this world
&gt;Well actually you have a person to ask
&gt;Mattie had lived here her whole life and could probably answer things for you
&gt;You steadily but quickly head back to your room and with a bit of trouble get the door open
&gt;It’s hard to open a door when both your hands are full but you made it work
&gt;Do opossums have prehensile tails? Can they grip stuff with them?
&gt;Might be handy for carrying things
&gt;As you enter the room you see Mattie is still snoring quietly on the bed
&gt;Quietly you set the food down and then walk over to Mattie
&gt;Placing a hand softly on her should, you shake her gently
&gt;&quot;Mattie, come on time to get up&quot; you say in a hushed tone
&gt;She opens her eye and blinks a few times then yawns as she sits up
&gt;&quot;Morning Anon, what time is it?&quot; she drowsily mumbles &quot;mmm I finally got a good night sleep&quot;
&gt;You look at the alarm clock quickly &quot;it&#039;s 8 o&#039;clock, I got breakfast for us&quot;
&gt;Her ears perk up quickly
&gt;&quot;You got food?&quot;
&gt;With an over exaggerated flourish you motion to the food on the table
&gt;Her violet eye widens in surprise and she smiles at you
&gt;&quot;You even got coffee? I feel flattered!&quot;
&gt;She gets up out of the bed and you take a moment to really study her body
&gt;Same as a humans really, except covered in fur...
&gt;As well her hands and feet are more reminiscent of paws
&gt;When she turns away from you, you see her tail pokes out of a hole in her shorts
&gt;When she turns to you, you look at her lower chest and stomach
&gt;Huh so she has breasts but not the extra nipples
&gt;&quot;Uhhh like what you see?&quot;
&gt;Her uneasy words snap you back to attention
&gt;&quot;S-sorry Mattie, I just haven&#039;t seen an Anthros body before. I was wondering how different you were from humans&quot;
&gt;You’re flustered about looking at her so intensely
&gt;She cocks her head at you
&gt;&quot;Oh...that’s right you haven&#039;t really seen Anthros huh?&quot;
&gt;You nod solemnly
&gt;&quot;Well I don&#039;t mind you looking Anon, its ok. Really!&quot;
&gt;She does a quick spin on her toes...Uhmm pads?
&gt;”What do you call your uh feet Mattie?&quot;
&gt;She giggles at you with a smile
&gt;She starts pointing to parts of her body that are different and telling you the terms
&gt;&quot;Footpaws, tail, Muzzle, snout, ears, Pawpads”
&gt;Pretty much the same as a feral dogs
&gt;You notice her short tail wagging quickly
&gt;&quot;Do you have the uh&quot; you motion up and down your own chest awkwardly &quot;extra Nipples&quot;
&gt;Mattie giggles at you and takes a step closer to you
&gt;She grabs your hand and places it on her lower chest
&gt;&quot;Feel!&quot;
&gt;The short fur on her torso is soft and parts under your fingers
&gt;&quot;See no extra nipples! Just like you!&quot; she says happily
&gt;You pull your hand away
&gt;&quot;You could have just told me Mattie&quot;
&gt;She pouts a bit, looking hurt
&gt;&quot;That wouldn&#039;t be any fun!” besides you need to have SOME physical contact with Anthros&quot;
&gt;Ugh she’s right but you feel like she should have just told you
&gt;Mattie looks around quickly and see&#039;s the pile of shirts you now own
&gt;&quot;Hey Anon can I borrow a shirt? Mines dirty and I promise I&#039;ll bring it back!&quot;
&gt;You nod and she digs through the pile quickly before finding a black shirt with a big skull on it
&gt;&quot;Ooo punisher shirt! Cool!&quot; she says as she pulls it on awkwardly
&gt;She’s about to sit down at the table when she stops and looks at her stump
&gt;&quot;Uh...Anon, i know this is a bit weird to ask before we eat but can you help me change my bandages?&quot;
&gt;You blink hard a few times, processing the request before saying &quot;yes&quot; quickly
&gt;She gives a quick smile and digs through her purse then hands you some lotion, a roll of medical tape and a few pieces of gauze
&gt;&quot;Ok Mattie, I’m a bit rusty at this but I know what to do&quot;
&gt;You lead her over to the sink and trash can then begin slowly unwrapping the medical tape on her stump
&gt;As you pull off, you take note of the stitches around the wound as well as all the fur that was shaved away
&gt;&quot;They guys who attacked me didn’t make a clean cut so the doctors had to do something to the bone so it healed right&quot; Mattie explains as you look over the stitches for any issues
&gt;&quot;Looks like its healing nicely and there are no infections so that’s good&quot; you state bluntly as you finish looking it over
&gt;You grab a clean towel, get it wet and soapy, then gently and diligently wash around the incision site
&gt;Next you grab a dry towel and wipe it down and then apply gauze and some medical tape
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re good at this Anon&quot; Mattie whispers as she watches you work
&gt;&quot;I was EMT certified as well as a firefighter&quot; you say as you look over your tape job
&gt;Satisfied that it&#039;s not going to come unraveled you give a short nod to yourself
&gt;&quot;Done&quot;
&gt;Mattie looks it over then looks at you with a frown
&gt;You thought you did a good job, what’s her issue?
&gt;&quot;What’s wrong?&quot; you ask calmly
&gt;Mattie&#039;s frown deepens
&gt;&quot;I uh- I need help with my eye patch too&quot;
&gt;Right, that was a thing that had to be done
&gt;Guess either Chase or Beth had helped her before
&gt;She scoots a bit closer to you &quot;Please?&quot;
&gt;You nod, and move your hands slowly to the bandages covering her eye
&gt;&quot;It’s a bit weird sorry&quot; Mattie apologizes while trying to stay still
&gt;You pull off the bandages revealing where her eye was
&gt;The area around the socket is shaven and a few stitches are on the eyelids, which is thankfully closed
&gt;&quot;Looks good Mattie&quot; you say as you apply a new bit of gauze and tape it down
&gt;She finally gives you a smile as you finish up
&gt;&quot;Ok then Mattie, let’s eat, Plus I have some questions about this world&quot;
&gt;She nods happily before sitting down across from you at the table
&gt;Both of you eat ask you ask your questions
&gt;First about history, then about other Anthro species, then about just this world in general
&gt;It’s actually quite interesting
&gt;You had actually finished eating a while ago but Mattie seemed to enjoy talking to you
&gt;And you enjoyed actually having someone to talk to
&gt;But there is still one question burning in your head
&gt;&quot;Mattie this is gonna sound weird&quot; you start out with a frown
&gt;Her ears perk up slightly
&gt;&quot;Hm what’s up Anon?&quot; she asks, cocking her head to the side
&gt;That’s the same as feral dogs
&gt;&quot;Oh...do you, uh I mean anthro dogs...do they have the same stuff downstairs as feral dogs?
&gt;She blinks a few times
&gt;&quot;Downstairs? What do you me-.&quot; she pauses mid-sentence
&gt;Her eye goes wide as she pieces together what you mean
&gt;&quot;Oh...OH! You mean do male dog Anthros have that weird knot thing and to female dog Anthros have cookies?&quot; she says with a giggle
&gt;You feel your face turn red as she giggles
&gt;&quot;WEEELLLLLL, Males do have that thing but I know *I* do not have a cookie thank you!&quot;
&gt;At least she didn&#039;t make you feel her this time
&gt;But her giggling at you is making you feel like an idiot
&gt;&quot;Look it’s a legitimate thing! I don&#039;t know any of this biology stuff!&quot;
&gt;Trying to defend your curiosities makes her laugh more
&gt;Luckily her phone goes off causing her to jump slightly
&gt;In a panic she digs through her purse for the offending noisemaker, growing more and more flustered as she looks
&gt;When at last she does find it, she answers with a short &quot;hello this is Mattie&quot;
&gt;You watch as her eye widens and she then jumps for her footpaws
&gt;&quot;OK ok! I’ll be there in a bit one sec!&quot;
&gt;She hangs up quickly
&gt;&quot;My mom got an appointment at the DMV so I can take the driving test again! I have to go now Anon sorry!&quot;
&gt;She quickly begins putting on her socks and shoes
&gt;You notice her shoes look new and instead of laces they have Velcro
&gt;Smart
&gt;Mattie heads to the door and you walk her out of you room and through the rehab center
&gt;At the front door she stops and turns to you
&gt;&quot;Thank you Anon, I haven&#039;t been able to sleep well since the attack, I&#039;ll visit again soon!&quot;
&gt;She then hugs you unexpectedly
&gt;You go ridged for a moment, then hug back
&gt;&quot;Ok Mattie, I&#039;ll see you then&quot;
&gt;With a smile she pulls away and leaves you standing alone in the entrance
&gt;What’s this feeling? Something new within you that you don’t recognize
&gt;Doesn&#039;t matter now
&gt;You retreat back to your room
&gt;Hopefully she&#039;ll be back tomorrow

Chapter 6: Violet City

&gt;Weeks have passed in a flash
&gt;Mattie visits you in rehab every time she can, and often stays the night
&gt;She said she had nightmares otherwise
&gt;You weren&#039;t going to shoo her away for that
&gt;But today was a special day, the majority of your withdrawal symptoms had faded and Mattie wanted you to come with her to meet some people
&gt;Some sort of a support group
&gt;As well Jasmine had come and presented you with a phone that someone called &quot;the Mechanic&quot; bought for you
&gt;She said he had a weird complex involving the homeless 
&gt;You were very grateful  of course, but now your phone had only a few contacts
&gt;Mattie, Jasmine, Chase, Beth.... that’s it
&gt;Of course you were going to meet a few more people along the way
&gt;You had a Firefighter re-certification course in a couple months, when you were out of rehab completely
&gt;Rain pours outside as you try on a button up shirt and slacks
&gt;The you in the mirror looks like you
&gt;But you don&#039;t quite feel like you still
&gt;Like somehow you aren&#039;t really you, just a shell made to look and talk like you
&gt;Was the real you the druggie out there in the alleyway? Or was it the family man you had been before
&gt;Or was it a mix of both?
&gt;The fancy clothes and haircut, they might just be a cover up
&gt;Because even now, although you know you don’t need the drugs, the pills or the booze
&gt;Part of you still wants them, the nurses said that would never really go away
&gt;You just have to be better than that
&gt;Going through all that, through getting pulled or transported or whatever it was
&gt;It all made you numb, numb to your feelings, numb to your health
&gt;But being near Mattie, helping her through her hard times
&gt;Made you feel something again
&gt;You recall a few weeks ago, when you were sitting with a frustrated Mattie
&gt;She had to learn to write all over again
&gt;She had been right Han-err pawed before the attack
&gt;As such she was learning to hold a pencil again, how to write with her left paw
&gt;You sat with her, and did the training with her
&gt;Using your left hand to write was harder than you thought it would be, but you wanted her to know that she wasn&#039;t alone here
&gt;It made you feel...useful
&gt;Like when you taught Ashley how to read
&gt;Or Derek how to ride a bike
&gt;But at the same time that you helped Mattie, she helped you
&gt;While you still avoided most Anthros, you enjoyed her company at least
&gt;Although you weren&#039;t used to the shedding
&gt;Well you were from your dog’s growing up but not like this
&gt;But that was something you could deal with
&gt;Grabbing a clip on tie, you pop your collar as you think and pin it on
&gt;What would Mattie wear? She confided in you that ever since the attack she wore sports Bras because they were easy to put on
&gt;Most of her wardrobe was usually just shorts and t-shirts, easy things to put on
&gt;But this was supposed to be a fancy dress event or something
&gt;Shirt and skirt? Pants? Maybe her mom would help her put on something 
&gt;Your phone buzzes, snapping you out of your tangent
&gt;Fumbling with it and swearing at the technology, you manage to tap the &quot;pick up&quot; thing on the screen
&gt;These smart phones sure have come a long way since you last had one...
&gt;&quot;Hello?&quot;
&gt;Her voice is kind of distant as she speaks
&gt;&quot;Hey Anon! I&#039;m outside! Hurry up so we can get going&quot;
&gt;&quot;Mattie? Am I on speaker or something?&quot; you say into the phone as you walk out of your room
&gt;&quot;My phone is hooked up to my car, hurry up!&quot;
&gt;Right that was much more common now
&gt;As you walk through the rehab center towards the front door, you wave to Michelle
&gt;Rain patters against the glass and the street lights cut through the inky darkness of the night
&gt;A flash back of to you in the alley, rain pouring over the box you called home
&gt;You shake it out of your head quickly as you step outside
&gt;&quot;Where&#039;s your car Mattie?!&quot; you say was you stand under an awning, trying to dry for as long as possible
&gt;&quot;The red One!&quot;
&gt;There&#039;s a quick honk from a Red Sedan on the other side of the street
&gt;&quot;K&quot; you say as you hang up and prepare yourself
&gt;You rush out from your dry sanctuary into the heavy rain
&gt;A cold drop falls down your neck, causing you to gasp
&gt;The memory of the first night it rained while you were in this world flood back
&gt;The coldness, the sadness
&gt;NO!
&gt;Do NOT let your memories ruin this night 
&gt;You check the street for oncoming cars before dashing to Mattie&#039;s waiting car
&gt;Pulling open the door and sliding in quickly, you turn to Mattie and are shocked
&gt;She looks...Amazing
&gt;A Red Chinese dress, complimenting her light brown fur, a red Eyepatch and matching sleeve over her stump
&gt;All tied together with Red thigh high socks
&gt;Her Violet eye rests on you as you stare
&gt;&quot;I look that bad huh? I told Mom you would-&quot;
&gt;&quot;Holy shit Mattie you look stunning&quot; you say, cutting of her self-loathing tirade
&gt;Her mouth drops open as if to retort
&gt;&quot;Seriously Mattie, you look gorgeous&quot; you say before she can say anything
&gt;You hear her tail wagging, thumping against the chair through the hole that was made specifically for Anthros with tail, her ears are perked up and she’s staring at you
&gt;&quot;You mean it?&quot;
&gt;You nod slowly, not breaking eye contact with her
&gt;She opens and closes her mouth a few times, as if trying to process what you just said to her
&gt;&quot;Come on Mattie, let’s not be late&quot;
&gt;This snaps her out of her trance of confusion and she shift her car into drive
&gt;The DMV appointment she had all those weeks ago was for a driving test so see if she was still able to drive with one arm and one eye
&gt;Her depth perception might be a little off but other than that she drives fine
&gt;You on the other hand, had to wait to get clean before you would be allowed to try
&gt;But Mattie seemed content with driving you around for now
&gt;&quot;You look very handsome too, by the Way Anon&quot; Mattie says with a small smile
&gt;You catch her violet eye taking quick peeks at you as she drives
&gt;What’s this? 
&gt;A feeling in that black hole you called a soul
&gt;Butterflies? 
&gt;What? Why? You hadn’t felt those since...Well in a long time
&gt;This was MATTIE, and she was an ANTHRO
&gt;No no no, you can&#039;t have feelings like this
&gt;Not for her! 
&gt;But as you look at her, you can see why you have them
&gt;This was someone who has done nothing but try to make you feel welcome in her world
&gt;Constantly smiling and asking for nothing but to have you help her sleep
&gt;But you did more than she asked... For what?
&gt;&quot;Stop Staring at Me! You’re making me self-conscious!&quot; She says with a small grin
&gt;You feel your face go red and look out the window away from her
&gt;But as you look out the window, her reflection is there
&gt;How have you never noticed her body? Or were you forcing yourself to not notice?
&gt;Well for starters her chest was always trapped by sports bras, but you can see now they are perky and at least a solid C cup
&gt;Thick thighs...and you can still hear her tail wagging furiously
&gt;&quot;So uh... who are we meeting&quot; you say, not wanting to sit in silence for the whole ride
&gt;This awkwardness was something totally new between you two and you hate it
&gt;&quot;Uhmm, there is a support group for people who lost limbs and stuff, the person we are meeting is one of the people who lead it, plus her husband in Anonymous like you!&quot;
&gt;Wait, that sounds familiar
&gt;&quot;Oh uh neat&quot; you say, hoping she&#039;ll continues
&gt;Thankfully she does
&gt;&quot;Yea they said they wanted to treat me to dinner and I wanted you to come along...after all you&#039;ve helped me so much&quot; 
&gt;As the drive goes on she explains how she Found the group on Pawsapp (What’s Pawsapp?) and joined it, then the head of it reached out to her
&gt;Before long though she&#039;s parking her car in a parking lot in the suburbs of the city
&gt;You look out the car window to see a dimly lit restaurant with the name &quot;Chiasse &amp; Chatte&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Anon there is an Umbrella in the backseat, can you grab it for me?&quot; Mattie says as she looks in her mirror and adjusts her eye patch
&gt;You reach back and feel it, then step out into the rain
&gt;Popping it open and walking around to the driver’s side of the car, you open the door for Mattie and offer her your hand
&gt;She blinks once or Twice while looking up at you then takes your hand
&gt;&quot;So gentlemanly&quot; she teases as you hold the umbrella above you both, keeping her dry
&gt;You give a small smile at her and offer your arm, leading her to the front door, which you open for her
&gt;Following her in and shaking off the umbrella, you look around the restaurant for whomever you’re supposed to meet
&gt;&quot;Over there! Come on Anon!&quot; 
&gt;Mattie grips your hand and leads you to a table where a One armed maned wolfess and a Human are sitting, looking over the menu
&gt;OH!
&gt;You&#039;ve seen them before! Jasmines little book of pictures! They were in it!
&gt;The Wolfess looks up and smiles as the two of you approach
&gt;&quot;Sorry! I had to pick up Anon, It’s nice to finally meet you both&quot;
&gt;The duo stand and greet you as you shake the man&#039;s Hand and the maned wolfess’ paw
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m Raquel and this is my Husband Anon, it’s nice to meet you both&quot;
&gt;The man is tall and thin, but with a Smart smile for you and Mattie
&gt;The wolfess has a happy, glowing smile and has a Plastic prosthetic left arm
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m Madeline, but you can call me Mattie and this is Anon, He&#039;s Also Anonymous&quot; 
&gt;Raquel&#039;s ears perk up a bit 
&gt;&quot;Oh really? Well we can call my husband by his middle name so we don’t get confused&quot;
&gt;The man smiles &quot;Call me Ethan I guess&quot;
&gt;You smile and pull Mattie&#039;s chair out for her then take your own
&gt;The duo sit down across from you, beaming
&gt;&quot;So Mattie, let’s just get this part out of the way...what happened?&quot; Raquel says before sipping some water
&gt;Mattie shifts in her seat uncomfortably
&gt;You know she doesn&#039;t like to talk about it
&gt;So you step in
&gt;&quot;Uh, she got attacked by a group of people, they got her arm and eye&quot; you say as you reach your hand to her paw under the table
&gt;She gives it a small squeeze
&gt;&quot;OH! I saw something about that in the news! You got saved by a homeless guy right!?&quot; Raquel says with her eyes wide, leaning in closer
&gt;&quot;Yea that was me...And he&#039;s the guy who saved me&quot; Mattie says motioning to you with her head
&gt;Raquel sits back and looks you up and down
&gt;&quot;Him? But I thought...&quot; 
&gt;Ethan rests his hand on Raquel’s paw
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re the one Jasmine told us about huh? The guy who lived on the streets and was afraid of Anthros?&quot; He says looking you up and down
&gt;You nod slowly
&gt;Words gets around quickly thanks to the Anonymous Network
&gt;&quot;He&#039;s gotten much better though! I&#039;ve been helping him get used to Anthros&quot; Mattie says with a smile
&gt;Raquel looks you up and down
&gt;&quot;How long were you out there Anon?&quot;
&gt;Ethan steps in &quot;Raquel don’t just-!&quot;
&gt;&quot;5 years. After I lost my family, I was on the streets for 5 years&quot;
&gt;The Maned wolfess&#039; ears droop and you see Ethan grimace
&gt;Mattie&#039;s Paw squeezes your hand tightly under the table
&gt;Raquel Must regret asking because she changes the subject quickly
&gt;&quot;Well uh! I lost my arm in a swimming accident! I got caught by a propeller when I was swimming in a lake! Then a little while later, I met Ethan and the rest is history!&quot;
&gt;She beams at Ethan, who smiles at her
&gt;Mattie smiles too, looking at you
&gt;&quot;Anon has been helping me so much, he&#039;s even been doing the writing exercises with me&quot; she says with a smile
&gt;You smile back at her
&gt;At that moment, an Anthro golden retriever walks to the table with a pawful of menus
&gt;&quot;Hi all! I’m Bessie! I&#039;ll be your waitress! Can I get ya&#039;ll something to drink?&quot;
&gt;Mattie gets a coke, while you order a refreshing Dr.Pepper™
&gt;Raquel gets water while Ethan orders Asahi Beer
&gt;And since you weren&#039;t picky, you ordered a simple cheeseburger
&gt;The rest of the group place their orders
&gt;For the remainder of the evening, Raquel talks about different places to go for prosthetics, different services for amputees and even places to get glass eyes
&gt;Ethan tells you about this world, and the previous one
&gt;Seems he came here after you, so he had a bit of insight of the last things that happened there
&gt;Nothing about your family though
&gt;You didn&#039;t think that he would but still you hoped
&gt;When at last it was time for you all to leave, the restaurant had actually closed
&gt;Raquel and Ethan had given you and Mattie their numbers
&gt;You smiled and waved them off when they pulled out of the parking lot as you held the umbrella above you and Mattie
&gt;&quot;Anon, why don&#039;t we just go back to my place? It’s close by and...&quot; her voice trails off as she looks at you
&gt;Fuck it why not
&gt;&quot;Ok Mattie, let&#039;s go&quot; you say with a smile
&gt;Her tail wags furiously behind her as she gets into her car, leaving you to follow suit
&gt;When she started the car and pulled out into the street you can&#039;t help but feel....nervous
&gt;Why? This was no different than when she stayed with you at the rehab center
&gt;But still it....Feels different
&gt;Like there’s a tension between you two that’s never been there before
&gt;&quot;Thanks for coming to that with me by the way, I didn&#039;t wanna go alone&quot;
&gt;You smile at her and see her purple eye dart to you momentarily
&gt;&quot;It was no problem, thank you for inviting me&quot; you say, trying to watch her reactions
&gt;Over the weeks you&#039;ve learned the things she likes and how she reacts
&gt;You see her ears perk and hear the swishing of her tail
&gt;&quot;W-we&#039;re not far Anon, my apartment&#039;s a b-bit messy...” she stammers
&gt;Guess you got to her, in a good way though
&gt;&quot;Mattie, I lived in an alley, your messy apartment is NOT going to bother me at all&quot; you say with a sly smirk
&gt;She lets out a short Barking laugh
&gt;&quot;Fair enough! I hope you don’t mid the decor” she says with a worried grin
&gt;Decor?
&gt;Whatever it is you&#039;re sure it&#039;ll be fine
&gt;She pulls up to a small duplex, pointing at one of the doors,
&gt;&quot;Mom and dad bought me this when I started going to school, come on I’ll give you grand tour!&quot;
&gt;You grip the umbrella and walk Mattie to the door, where she unlocks it and step in
&gt;&quot;Uh... ta-da! Welcome to my lovely abode!” she says gingerly flicking on the lights
&gt;As you walk in and look around, the first thing you notice is the stacks of books that are everywhere
&gt;Seriously LOTS of books 
&gt;Some are look like college text books, some say things like &quot;Monster Manual&quot; or &quot;Creative Campaigning&quot;
&gt;As you walk through and Mattie trails behind you quietly, you notice odd little things
&gt;Graph paper, little figurines, posters of forests, dice laying on every table and what looks to be a statue of a dragon
&gt;What is all this? Some kinda lord of the rings thing?
&gt;You turn to her, both confused and perturbed
&gt;&quot;Uh Mattie, what IS all this stuff for?&quot; you say as you pick up a piece of Graph paper
&gt;On it is a (Badly) drawn sketch of floorplans
&gt;&quot;Uhmm...I like to play DnD... You know! Dungeons and dragons! It’s uh....my favorite hobby, but I don’t tell people cuz I’m afraid I’ll get made fun of&quot;
&gt;She looks to you with her single violet eye
&gt;&quot;You probably think I’m a dork now don&#039;t you&quot;
&gt;You actually laugh at that
&gt;&quot;No, I wondered why you never told me your hobbies before&quot; you say looking around
&gt;Nothing too crazy here
&gt;&quot;Some of the guys I worked with had one of these things set up too&quot; you say as you look over one of her sketches &quot;You tried to draw this with your left paw didn&#039;t you? Before the training?&quot;
&gt;She looks down and kicks a crumpled piece of graph paper out of the way &quot;Yes, I used to DM and play as a Bard occasionally&quot;
&gt;You give her a smile
&gt;&quot;Whatever, if it&#039;s what you like that it&#039;s what you like&quot; you say with a shrug
&gt;Mattie&#039;s tail wags happily as she approaches you
&gt;&quot;Thank you Anon, now I have a favor to ask of you....&quot; she says with an uneasy smile while she grasps your hand
&gt;You look around the room quickly
&gt;&quot;With what, cleaning up? Or...&quot;
&gt;You shut up, seeing the uneasy look on Mattie&#039;s face
&gt;This wasn&#039;t a joking matter to her, that much you can tell from the folded ears and tail trying to retreat between her thick thighs
&gt;&quot;Help me take a bath please? I don&#039;t wanna ask my mom and it’s hard to do with one paw&quot; she asks quickly, scrunching her muzzle as if anticipating a negative answer
&gt;You feel the butterflies in your stomach flutter
&gt;Why? The anticipation of seeing her naked?
&gt;You had slept with her how many times but now you were getting anxious?
&gt;WHAT. THE. FUCK.
&gt;&quot;Of course I’ll help you Mattie&quot; you say as you pet her head softly
&gt;She looks at you first in surprise, then in relief
&gt;&quot;Thanks Anon&quot; she says with a relieved smile
&gt;She holds you hand and leads you to her bathroom
&gt;&quot;Help me take this off please, I wanted to look good for you tonight...&quot; she says as she attempts to pull off her dress
&gt;Hesitantly, you begin undoing it for her
&gt;Was this ok? She was only 21 and you were... how old were you again? You don&#039;t even remember
&gt;Finally she slips out of the dress, revealing a small red bra and red panties
&gt;Did she plan this?
&gt;As you help her slip out of the thigh high socks, you can&#039;t help but think that the hidden bits of her body
&gt;Behind a simple piece of fabric where her most private parts...
&gt;NO! Now is not the time for that!
&gt;You breathe deep and focus as you turn on the water, she pours some kind of bubble bath into the water, causing a huge amount of bubbles to spawn
&gt;She stand of a moment, adjusting the water temperature slowly, letting you watch her
&gt;Still, you catch her violet eye sneaking peeks at you, as if to make sure you&#039;re still watching
&gt;When she FINALLY finds the heat she likes, she turns away from you, showing a small set of hooks on her Bra
&gt;Words aren&#039;t needed for this part
&gt;You gently unhook the bra then move down to her panties
&gt;Carefully and quickly you pull them off, revealing her ass before she lowers herself into the bubbly water
&gt;You reach into the water and feel her fur, cool and free moving underneath the bubbles
&gt;It takes a moment for you to realize that you have NO idea what you’re doing
&gt;But still you delve deep into the unseen, rubbing and massaging her body and fur
&gt;You grab a bar of soap and begin scrubbing gently, savoring the feeling
&gt;It was different from cleaning your pets, instead of a whining dog, you had a woman sighing happily as your finger dug through thick fur 
&gt;&quot;Ooo feels good Anon&quot; Mattie said with a content smile as you washed her legs
&gt;Your hands trail up her body and chest, where luckily she also is scrubbing away calmly
&gt;What is this feeling welling up
&gt;Disappointment?
&gt;Did you want to wash the unseen parts of her body?
&gt;Why?
&gt;Don&#039;t try to kid yourself, you know why....
&gt;But still you help your favorite Anthro clean herself, wishing that you were in the tub with her
&gt;Sadly, all good things come to an end
&gt;Or does it, Mattie pulls the plug to the tub, allowing the water and suds to start draining out
&gt;&quot;Can you please grab me a towel off the rack?&quot; she says pointing to a bar behind you
&gt;You sigh and turn away from her to grab the towel, only to turn back towards her and seeing her standing, a few bits of suds on her fur but otherwise gloriously naked
&gt;You can see small shivers going up and down her body as she stands
&gt;Was it from the cold or nervousness?
&gt;You can’t help but stare
&gt;Perky and full breasts, a shapely ass, and thick thighs; never mind the fact they were all covered in clinging fur
&gt;&quot;TOWEL!&quot; She says sternly to you, holding out her paw
&gt;Snapping out of your thoughts you hand her the towel, then help her dry herself
&gt;Your hands shake as you feel her body, even if it is through a piece of fabric
&gt;When she is dry, she gives a faint smile and grips your hand 
&gt;&quot;Come on Anon, Bed time&quot;
&gt;Still naked and wrapped in a simple towel, she leads you to her bedroom
&gt;NO
&gt;You shouldn’t be feeling this!
&gt;Not towards her....this was wrong right?
&gt;As you&#039;re pulled along you scan every bit of your brain, trying to find a reason to sleep on her nonexistent couch
&gt;Fuck it the floor then
&gt;But every excuse you think of has a simple counter argument: this is what SHE wants
&gt;She leads you into her bedroom, her walls covered in posters from movies and mythical scenes from things you don&#039;t understand
&gt;&quot;Out of those Anon, let’s go to bed&quot; Mattie demands, pointing to your clothes 
&gt;Quietly and hesitantly, you strip to just your underwear
&gt;&quot;Nope, all the way, if I’m Naked so are you!” She says with a smirk
&gt;When did she get so bold
&gt;But a quick look at her tells you otherwise
&gt;She&#039;s shaking visibly, staring at you for any signs of anger or disapproval
&gt;Her bed is only a twin, like the one you and her were used to sharing back at the rehab center, so you can’t complain
&gt;You slip into it, then pull off your boxers under the covers
&gt;When you hold them up to her, her eye goes wide
&gt;&quot;Oh Uhmm, Yes! Bed time!&quot;
&gt;She clicks off the lights, leaving only a silhouette of the canine in the darkness
&gt;&#039;Fwoop&#039; come forth the soft sound of her towel hitting the floor
&gt;&quot;Ooooooo, this is ookkkkk&quot; you can hear Mattie Mumble through the darkness
&gt;You lift open her covers for her
&gt;&quot;Just like back at the Center Mattie, its ok&quot; 
&gt;A sharp inhale in surprise, then a calm exhale before you feel her weight on the bed
&gt;&quot;Right... just like at the center&quot; you hear unsure mumbling
&gt;Slightly damp, yet warm fur presses against you
&gt;Slowly you bring an arm around her and pull her into your chest
&gt;&quot;Goodnight Madeline, its ok&quot; you whisper softly
&gt;You feel her tail slowly wiggle against you
&gt;&quot;Goodnight Anon, thank you for everything&quot;
&gt;Warm fur....Careful positioning....A girl that you cared about
&gt;It was no use trying to deny it; you cared deeply about Mattie
&gt;And even as she drifted off to sleep in your arms
&gt;You can&#039;t help but hope she feels the same


Chapter 7: Up &amp; Up

&gt;Sunlight pours through the blinds of your bedroom, telling you it’s time to wake up
&gt;But as you open your eyes, something is off
&gt;Yes the usual fur is there
&gt;Wait this isn’t your room
&gt;Quiet snoring interrupts your thoughts
&gt;You have your arms around Mattie, who sleeps with a small smile across her muzzle
&gt;How cute can she get?
&gt;Cute enough for you to want to snuggle her more
&gt;She was Mattie!
&gt;You can&#039;t get feelings for her…Can you?
&gt;The girl you coached, the girl who coached you
&gt;But even as you sit and look at her, you can clearly see one thing
&gt;She isn’t JUST a girl
&gt;She’s clearly a woman
&gt;A woman who is different from you, but a woman none the less
&gt;You run your fingers across your face and through your hair
&gt;Why did you agree to this? Why would you torment yourself with her?
&gt;A quick look at her and her body tells you why
&gt;Aside from being adorably nice to you from day one, Mattie had a body that was just your type
&gt;A nice perky chest and wide hips
&gt;NO
&gt;That wasn&#039;t it
&gt;She was so nice to you, never blaming you for anything and only thanking you
&gt;As well she was just so friendly
&gt;As you look down at her snoring sleeping body, you can&#039;t help but feel sorrow
&gt;A missing arm...A missing eye
&gt;She didn’t deserve this
&gt;You did
&gt;If you could take her place you would in a heartbeat
&gt;But you can&#039;t...much to your disappointment
&gt;Best you could do was make her life comfortable 
&gt;Just like she had done for you
&gt;You slide out of her bed quietly, pull on your under shirt and boxers before heading downstairs to her kitchen
&gt;This was still something you remember
&gt;Make your lover breakfast in bed
&gt;NO! Not lover....
&gt;Right??
&gt;You push graph paper aside as you clear a spot on her stove then look into her fridge
&gt;The usual things for breakfast, you would have to thank Beth for making sure Mattie’s fridge was well stocked
&gt;Eggs, bacon, shredded cheese and butter
&gt;As you prepare a breakfast for her memories flood back like a deluge
&gt;Your honeymoon, waking up and preparing breakfast for your wife
&gt;Getting up early to spoil Amanda before she got the kids up
&gt;Just being a good husband and making breakfast for the whole family
&gt;You shake your head as you walk to her coffee maker, starting a pot of coffee
&gt;You would never had that life back, fate saw to that
&gt;But maybe... just maybe you could have a mockery of it
&gt;Setting a few strips of bacon on a frying pan, you wait for the smell to draw Mattie to you
&gt;In the meantime, you whisk up a few eggs, mixing a little bit of milk with them to add some fluffiness
&gt;It was easier for you to make these than it was for Mattie to make them alone
&gt;But that wasn’t your focus, in truth for a moment...You forget that you are in a different world
&gt;For a moment, just a singular moment...You’re back in your kitchen, with Moose begging for a scraps of food
&gt;But reality sets back in is a quiet yawn from the stairwell
&gt;&quot;Mornnnning &#039;Nonnn&quot; comes a quiet yawn as Mattie stumbles into the kitchen, rubbing her good eye while wearing nothing but an old t-shirt
&gt;You stand, spatula in one hand, oven mitt over the other, waiting for it to dawn on her that you were really there
&gt;It doesn&#039;t take long
&gt;She sips a cup of coffee before looking up at you 
&gt;Her eyes go wide and she nearly drops the mug before trying to pull the shirt down to cover herself
&gt;&quot;ANON! I-I Forgot you were here&quot; She says, ears folded back and tail trying to escape from your vision
&gt;You ignore it, instead opting for the &quot;I got food&quot; approach
&gt;Holding up the frying pan, you smile
&gt;&quot;I made us breakfast Mattie&quot; you say with a calm smile
&gt;Luckily, that calms her down as she looks at you and the food with her one good eye
&gt;She doesn&#039;t have on her eye patch, which hits you with a pang of guilt
&gt;She was so young......
&gt;And yet she was looking at you with an empty eye socket....
&gt;She deserved better
&gt;Hopefully you would one day get revenge on whoever did such a thing to such a poor innocent soul
&gt;Better to let your angry tainted soul get a little dirtier than let hers get even just a smudge on it
&gt;But that’s a thought for another time as you 
&gt;&quot;Hope you like Bacon and eggs with cheese&quot; you wafting the smell of bacon and eggs to her
&gt;She gives a few sniffs before sipping her coffee
&gt;&quot;Thank you Anon, it smells delicious&quot; Mattie says as she gets a plate of eggs
&gt;What was this sense of accomplishment?
&gt;All you did was make eggs
&gt;Yet, hearing it from her
&gt;...It was better than any drug you had had in the past
&gt;You feel you heart skipping as she draws herself nearer, albeit hesitantly, eye locked onto you and an unsure look on her face
&gt;Your hands feel disconnected as she pulls her arm around you, and you wrap your arms around her
&gt;And everything feels like dream when you pull her into a kiss
&gt;Or did she pull you into it?
&gt;All you know is it&#039;s a Kiss to blast away the dull grey years of your life
&gt;Burying the last 5 years of torment and sadness
&gt;Even as you tongue fights hers, all you feel is warmth, not the sadness you expected
&gt;She wanted you
&gt;More than anyone else had in a long time
&gt;Let’s face it, your marriage with Amanda wasn&#039;t perfect
&gt;If anything...She would be relieved, that vacation you took was a last ditch effort to keep your family together
&gt;She&#039;s rid of you, even if she felt bad about it; you and her had been drifting apart
&gt;Guess fate decided to spare you all that
&gt;But that didn&#039;t make it hurt less
&gt;The smell of eggs and coffee drift around you as you hold Mattie close
&gt;She pulls away from the kiss and looks up at you, an even more unsure look painting her muzzle
&gt;&quot;Are you Ok with this Anon? Ok with....Me?&quot; she says waving the small stump that was left of her arm at you
&gt;&quot;I mean...I&#039;m an Anthro...And y-&#039;
&gt;You silence her doubts with another small kiss
&gt;&quot;If you&#039;re ok with me Mattie&quot; you say with a smile
&gt;She nods quietly and looks up at you, smiling
&gt;That smile fills you with more bliss than any drug had
&gt;You pull her into a hug as her tail wags furiously
&gt;&quot;So uh...are you my boyfriend now?&quot; she says into your chest 
&gt;You chuckle a bit
&gt;&quot;Uh...I guess I am&quot; you say down to her, rubbing her back
&gt;She pulls away from you with a happy smile then grabs her plate
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s eat breakfast and then get to the rehab center, you need to change your clothes&quot; she says with a smirk
&gt;You look down at yourself and then back to her and shrug
&gt;So what you&#039;re only wearing boxers and a undershirt
&gt;But all you had here was your dress clothes, so you suppose she was right
&gt;You would rather stay here today, so hopefully she&#039;ll let you do that
&gt;The both of you eat quickly, sipping coffee as Mattie looks on her phone at the sites Raquel pointed out to her
&gt;Prosthetic arms are surprising to you now, they had come a long way since you were &quot;in the Know&quot;
&gt;Guess basically going MIA for 5 years will do that
&gt;She shows you a few on her phone as you sip your coffee
&gt;This world really is a bit more accommodating than your last one
&gt;How else could you explain the BHA simply coming in and helping you get your life back together?
&gt;Or even that different Prosthetic arms for different species and different sizes Anthros
&gt;Jasmine had even showed you rooms that you could move into once you were out of rehab (which was hopefully soon)
&gt;When the food is done and you’ve loaded the dishes into the Dishwasher, you head upstairs, following Mattie
&gt;&quot;Help me get dressed please Anon? I can do it but it’s easier if I have some help&quot; Mattie says, eyeing you pensively
&gt;You nod and watch as she goes to her closet and picks out a blue shirt and black shorts 
&gt;As she digs through her drawers for underwear and a bra, you pull on your pants and dress shirt
&gt;Better to take it with you and wash it up
&gt;As you finish buttoning it up, Mattie presents you with a Lacey black bra and matching Panties
&gt;&quot;These First!&quot; she says as she pulls off her T-shirt
&gt;&gt;You get the chance to ogle her body once more
&gt;Thick thighs and waist... perfect perky tits...
&gt;&quot;Hey quit staring perv&quot; Mattie laughs at you &quot;What have you never seen a naked woman before&quot;
&gt;You shake your head, noting her tail wagging behind her
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re the only Anthro I’ve seen Naked&quot; you say as you walk over and kneel in front of her, holding her panties out for her to step into them
&gt;The tail wagging stops
&gt;&quot;Wait like.....No others? Not even like porn or anything?&quot; she says questioningly
&gt;Anthro porn is a thing? Wait why you are even questioning that
&gt;There is porn of EVERYTHING
&gt;&quot;Nope, never bothered looking it up&quot; you say as you look up from your kneeling position
&gt;She puts a paw to your Face
&gt;&quot;OH Mr. Boyfriend...I have so Much to teach you later&quot;
&gt;Should you be concerned or excited?
&gt;You decide to go with excited 
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m eager to learn&quot; you say with a smile
&gt;She nods and turns away from you
&gt;&quot;Snap the panties around my tail base&quot; she instructs
&gt;Right, tails. You had wondered how Anthros get their pants on and this was a quick learning exercise as you help Mattie get dressed
&gt;You finish up by helping her get her eye patch on
&gt;&quot;Alright! Let’s get you to the rehab center&quot; she says in a very plucky eager way
&gt;Something seems off about that but whatever
&gt;She guides you out of her house and to her car the ride is quick enough if you disregard traffic
&gt;The whole time you try to figure out how to use your phone right
&gt;Even as you apologize profusely as you try to get anything resembling helpfulness Mattie shrugs it off
&gt;Her good mood is more than contagious though
&gt;In fact it puts you on edge
&gt;As she pulls into the parking garage you&#039;re set even more on edge as you spot
&gt;&quot;What’s going on Mattie?&quot; you ask as you get out of her car and follow the now skipping canine
&gt;&quot;You&#039;ll see Anon!&quot; she says as she skips far ahead of you into the rehab building
&gt;As you follow her in, you&#039;re shocked to see Michelle, Jasmine, Chick, Chase and Beth all waiting there
&gt;You stop dead in your tracks both confused and surprised
&gt;&quot;HI ANON!&quot; comes the hello of the greeting from the furry cannonball that is Beth
&gt;The wind is knocked out of you as you double over from the sheer force of her tackle to your midsection
&gt;&quot;OOF! H-hi Beth&quot; you choke out
&gt;You can see Mattie roll her eyes at the spectacle of her mom latched to you
&gt;Looking around you see a few luggage bags, all with a name tag on them
&gt;&quot;Anon&quot;, they are full of your stuff?
&gt;&quot;What’s going on?&quot; You choke out from the tiny yet crushing hug that is Beth
&gt;&quot;You&#039;ve completed your rehab Anon! We have spoken to Mattie and several of the care providers here! They say you&#039;ve made huge leaps and bounds, not only with you drug problem but with your Anthro issue!&quot; Jasmine says to you, eyes beaming with a proud smile
&gt;&quot;You get to move into one of our Anonymous shelters, and be your own man!&quot; She adds happily
&gt;Mattie steps forwards looking a bit like a child who had just been yelled at
&gt;&quot;C-Can Anon stay with me instead? I can an eye on him better that way!&quot; she says with a half confident smile
&gt;Oddly enough, it&#039;s not Jasmine who steps forwards to comfort Mattie; it&#039;s Chase
&gt;&quot;Mattie, if you want Anon there with you, it’s ok...&quot; he says with a knowing smile
&gt;Jasmine looks a bit confused at the statement but relents with a kind smile that shows her large sharp fangs
&gt;They actually make you wince a bit at the sight of them
&gt;You were used to Anthros now....Kinda
&gt;Mattie was an odd exception, the Anthro you had spent so much time with she was more than an Anthro
&gt;More than a regular person
&gt;She was more than you could ever describe
&gt;Yet others, like Jasmine with her sharp sharp teeth, and Beth, who looked like Mattie but just wasn&#039;t her
&gt;They were a mystery to you
&gt;A thing to be avoided if possible
&gt;&quot;We already packed your stuff for you Anon, although we will miss you here&quot; says Michelle with a smile
&gt;You knew that was a lie
&gt;How could they miss you? You had spent the majority of the time in your room, avoiding them
&gt;But still you’re grateful for what they did for you
&gt;You smile at her and Nod
&gt;&quot;Thank you Michelle, and thank you everyone, I won&#039;t let you down&quot;
&gt;The speech sounds hollow in the words you speak yet you mean every one of them
&gt;Mattie gives you a hug as you grab some of you bags and begin heading to the car
&gt;Chickenman, being the &quot;wild west&quot; guy he always reminded you of, simply throws 2 over his shoulders and carries them with ease
&gt;But even as you and your company head to Mattie’s there are thoughts that bug you
&gt;Are they just tired of you?
&gt;Is the rehab center just trying to shrug of the speciest human?
&gt;You didn&#039;t ask to be like this....
&gt;But how do you get over the primordial fear of predatory animals?
&gt;Even now ask Jasmine walked next to you, there as a twinge of fear
&gt;What if she just turned and mauled you?
&gt;Would the others stop her? Would it be seen as normal? 
&gt;The questions flood your mind, involuntary, yet like a constant mosquito that you can’t ignore
&gt;You breathe deep, trying to relax yourself
&gt;Box breathing, that’s what they called it
&gt;They were just people...Fuzzier people....
&gt;They weren&#039;t going to maul you and eat your body
&gt;You try to logic away those emotions, those basic fears
&gt;And when Mattie pulls you into a one armed hug... All those fears vanish
&gt;&quot;Surprise! Bet you didn&#039;t expect that!&quot; she says with a confident smile
&gt;Such confidence, a look you have rarely seen from her in months knowing her
&gt;You wrap your arms around her and smile
&gt;&quot;I didn&#039;t, you got me Mattie&quot; you say with smile
&gt;Her tail wags furiously and you hear Beth Squee happily
&gt;&quot;OoooH! Our little girl found a good Anon! I’m so proud&quot;! You hear 
&gt;But you ignore it and focus of the small dog hugging you tightly
&gt;Mattie Made you happy, and you made her happy
&gt;What else matters beyond that?

Chapter 8: Love Is All You Need

&gt;Months have flown by in the blink of an eye
&gt;And in that time you’ve lived with Mattie and made leaps and bounds together
&gt;She&#039;s back in school to be a pharmacist and you actually gone and gotten re-qualified to be a firefighter
&gt;Granted, you aren’t as spry as you used to be but you still got it all done
&gt;You had income, a home and a loving girlfriend
&gt;Maybe this world wasn&#039;t so bad
&gt;But despite the snuggles and cuddles and trust you both shared
&gt;There was never anything sexual between you
&gt;Sure there were times where it came close, but in the end she would pull away and go to bed early, leaving you both confused and concerned
&gt;You had never been with an Anthro,
&gt;Fuck, you had never been with anyone other than your wife
&gt;...Ex-wife
&gt;Is it ex-wife? You never really got used to the semantics
&gt;Either way, you were stuck waiting for Mattie to be used to... you
&gt;She told you she had never been with anyone sexually
&gt;Between her schooling and her love of D&amp;D, she never really bothered trying
&gt;She said it was just better to try and find a man who cared for her despite those things
&gt;You cared for her because of all that
&gt;Even with her arm and eye gone you cared for her
&gt;How could you not?
&gt;She was still smart, friendly, and a blast to be around
&gt;And even as snow started falling, she made the most of it
&gt;Snow angels were &quot;Snow gimps&quot; missing a wing, and snowball fights with the local children always had her trying to guilt trip them
&gt;It worked the first few times but after that they learned
&gt;As well, you got stationed at a local fire station, where you would spend 4 days a week
&gt;That part is what really drove the wedge between you and....what was her name.....
&gt;Guilt struck you every time you thought of her...Amanda... that&#039;s right
&gt;But if you didn&#039;t have that picture of them all, their faces would be gone
&gt;You couldn&#039;t remember them at all
&gt;But what did they look like now anyway? It had so long
&gt;Those thoughts didn&#039;t bother you now though
&gt;Mattie had class late tonight, and you had the day off
&gt;So why not prepare dinner for her?
&gt;You had Chicken Parmesan cooking and garlic bread in the oven
&gt;Snow fell freely outside and bitter winds gusted by
&gt;Street lamps outside looked like burning torches when you looked out and remembered the cold nights of snow
&gt;Why businesses had grates that spewed warm air out, you would never know, but you remember the frigid nights trying to find a free metal grate
&gt;A bid to stay warm and not freeze to death
&gt;Even now, as you glare out the window at the falling snow your reminded of cold and pain
&gt;People never really have felt cold until it isn’t cold, it’s just pure pain
&gt;Waking up buried in snow, feeling like your blood is frozen
&gt;You shiver thinking about it, as you flip over the chicken strips in the oven
&gt;Funny how this world changes people
&gt;You never enjoyed cooking much before, but now that you knew what it was like to not have good food
&gt;Now you loved it
&gt;Either way, as you tend to dinner in the kitchen, you hear the front door open and then a quick &quot;I&#039;m home!&quot;
&gt;You smile as you brush your hands against each other quickly and head to the front door
&gt;At the door is Mattie; standing confident and calm with a smile on her face wearing a long coat to keep her warm
&gt;How long have you worked to get that smile?
&gt;So so long
&gt;Even with her missing eye, you loved that smile
&gt;Her long coat covered her body as she stood in the front entrance of the house
&gt;&quot;HI Anon! Dinner smells good!&quot; She says with her violet eye watching you
&gt;You nod and smile
&gt;&quot;Chicken Parmesan and Garlic bread. I know you like them love&quot; you say with a smile, holding up a spatula at her
&gt;She nods and takes a step closer to you
&gt;&quot;Uh, Anon...Do you like... uh&quot;
&gt;She hesitates, looking at you with an uneasy eye
&gt;&quot;DO you like this?&quot; she says finally, pulling open her coat uneasily
&gt;She reveals lingerie, her breasts poking out from a bra that does nothing to hid her nipples and a thin underwear thong
&gt;You stare at her open mouthed at the coat falls to the floor and she smiles at you uneasily
&gt;&quot;Uuuuh Surprise!&quot; she says, propping her breasts up with her arm
&gt;Speechless
&gt;You are absolutely speechless as you look upon her
&gt;Sure you had seen her naked plenty of times before but this... this was like a blind man seeing the sunset for the first time
&gt;You stare, awestruck at her body and try to say something, but no words can even form in your mind as you look upon her
&gt;But as you stare she shivers a bit and attempts to hide herself
&gt;&quot;Oh... I knew you wouldn&#039;t like...”
&gt;You rush in, pulling her into a hug and not letting her finish that thought
&gt;&quot;Fucking hell Mattie, you look amazing! What even prompted this?&quot; You say stepping closer to her
&gt;She smiles and you feel her firm perky breasts press against you
&gt;&quot;You never made a move on me, despite us always snuggling and sleeping together&quot; she says, smiling up at you
&gt;You shift uneasily on your feet, looking into her eye
&gt;&quot;I didn’t want to pressure you Madeline, plus...it’s been a while since I was with anyone&quot; you say, looking down and away
&gt;Mattie pulls you down into a kiss and you feel her long tongue overpower yours
&gt;For someone so much smaller than you she had a lot of strength
&gt;You feel her sharp canine teeth, her tongue and breathe deep, savouring the smell of her fur
&gt;This kiss was something that blasted away the boring years of street living
&gt;The life of loneliness, worrying not about who you were but only the next hit
&gt;Mattie’s paw wraps around the back of your head, pulling you deeper into the kiss as your hands explore her body and wide hips
&gt;But the moment is broken by a loud beeping from the oven, telling you that the chicken is done cooking
&gt;Quickly you pull away from Mattie and look at her with a bit of unease
&gt;&quot;Go get the food doofus!&quot; she says with a cheerful smile
&gt;You nod quickly and rush back into the kitchen and then to the oven
&gt;With your mind racing about Mattie and her body, you grab the cooking tray with a shaky hand and set it on the stove
&gt;Better get it placed down and out of the way as you turn off the oven and look to the doorway where Mattie stands waiting for you
&gt;With a beckoning finger, she draws you out of the kitchen and into her living room
&gt;You watch her walk with a confident swish of her hips as she goes to the couch and pats the spot next to her
&gt;With a bit of hesitation, you sit down and look at her, loving the view but a bit afraid
&gt;How long had it been since you had been with a woman? You had never been with anyone other than Amanda and now here you were
&gt;A new world, a new woman, a new species
&gt;Were you a new person too?
&gt;All of those concerns are forgotten as Mattie straddles you and places her paw on your face, forcing you to look at her
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s ok Anon, I promise&quot; she says before kissing you again
&gt;Your hands snake their way down her sides, digging through her slightly chilled fur
&gt;Her eye is locked on yours as you explore her body with renewed vigour
&gt;How could not seeing her like this not excite you?
&gt;She slowly grinds her hips against you as you feel every inch of her body and she gives a relieved smile when she feels your body react
&gt;Finally, you snake your hands up her side and settle on her perfect breasts
&gt;She moans a bit and bites her lower lip before pushing them together slightly with her arm and her stump
&gt;&quot;Do you like them? I know they aren&#039;t th-&quot;
&gt;You cut her off with a kiss that makes her moan softly into your mouth
&gt;&quot;They&#039;re perfect&quot; you say as you pull away from the kiss that leaves her panting
&gt;You reach behind her and undo her bra with ease, and pull it off her then place your hands back on those gorgeous mounds
&gt;Even unsupported by the lingerie, her tits are perky and full
&gt;Mattie moans more and you squeeze her breasts and gently pinch her nipples
&gt;&quot;Oooo that’s good&quot; she gasps &quot;Get these off&quot;
&gt;Her claws dig at your pants and you nod quickly
&gt;She props herself up off you and you arch your back, then undo your jeans and slide them off without getting up
&gt;Mattie&#039;s paw grabs at the hem of your shirt and tugs at it, helping pull it off you and get you undressed
&gt;&quot;Ooo Anon, someone’s happy to see me&quot; Mattie gasps as she lowers herself once more onto you
&gt;With your jeans no longer holding back your erection, your boner is pressed against her thong, which has a slowly growing wet spot
&gt;Mattie’s paw runs down your chest and over her abs before her thumb hooks into her waistband
&gt;With a little bit of difficultly she slides it off, although with a bit of help from you
&gt;Her wetness is now pressed against your erections head, which strains against its cloth prison
&gt;Slowly she grinds side to side, with her eye locked on you
&gt;You place your hands on her thick thighs and guide her motion
&gt;Her moans grow steadily as her grinding gets faster and your erection presses against her lips
&gt;&quot;Ready Mattie?&quot; you ask as your hand guides itself to her wet slit
&gt;She gives a small nod and interlocked her paw with your hand as she lifts herself a bit to allow your fingers access
&gt;&quot;Go slow Anon&quot; she says with a worried look on her muzzle
&gt;You nod and kiss her quickly
&gt;With one finger you gently rub the outside of her lips before pressing between them gently, getting plenty of lubrication from her
&gt;&quot;Ooooooh just like that Anon&quot;
&gt;Gently you push a single digit into her, earning you small stifled moans
&gt;She&#039;s tight, tighter than you expected and far far warmer than anyone else you had been with
&gt;Slowly, you start to move your finger into and out, with each push getting a little further into her
&gt;Her Moans grow steadily louder the further you push and eventually you full pointer finger is in her
&gt;&quot;Ready for another?&quot; you say softly, the fingers on your free hand still interlocked with her
&gt;Mattie gives a small nod and kisses you once more as you add another finger, pressing deep into her
&gt;She moans softly into your mouth as you gently finger her
&gt;You curl your fingers slightly, hoping to find that spot
&gt;Eventually as you press deep into her, your pointer finger brushes a small area deep in her pussy that sends visible shivers up her body
&gt;Her eye widens in shock as you deliberately rub your fingers against it
&gt;&quot;W-what Is the-that Anon?&quot; She moans softly grinding her hips against your fingers, trying to relive the sensation
&gt;&quot;That’s your G-spot Mattie&quot; you say as you rub the spot a bit harder, getting more shivers and shudders from her
&gt;&quot;M-my G-g-g-spot? I never had this when I d-did this m-myself_&quot; she stammers, trying to keep her composure
&gt;You nod and kiss her
&gt;&quot;You didn&#039;t have me before&quot;
&gt;You pick up the pace now, fingering her harder and faster earning you louder moans
&gt;Mattie grinds her hips against your hand as you push deeper into her, causing her juices to drip out and soaking your boxers
&gt;Her moans and more addicting than any drug you&#039;ve ever taken.
&gt;How could they not? They were bliss, a resonating sound of satisfaction for you that you hadn’t felt in so long
&gt;You press further into her, rubbing her g-spot while kissing her softly
&gt;Do you dare push it a little bit more?
&gt;How could you not?
&gt;You thumb presses against her clit and you rotate it softly as you push your fingers into her
&gt;Quiet slow breathing from you is all you can do as you focus on Mattie
&gt;Your fingers find every point to make her gasp
&gt;Your thumb circles slowly, earning new gasps from her
&gt;And even though you had been with women before, this was new
&gt;She was tighter, warmer and more sensitive; every move you made, made her shudder slightly
&gt;Each time you press against her g-spot, it causes more violent, yet graceful shudders
&gt;Gently, yet steadily, you speed up, two fingers rubbing her g-spot and your thumb making quick methodical circles on her clit
&gt;Even as she tries to kiss you to fight the oncoming orgasm, you can tell her body is responding to you
&gt;As your fingers touch and rub every sensitive spot within her, she sits straight up, looking upwards and shivering
&gt;A violent shudder resonates down her body and she collapses onto you, her arm trying to wrap itself around your neck
&gt;You feel her legs try to close, but get blocked by yours as she straddles you
&gt;Her inner walls clamps down with frightening tightness, forcing your fingers out, falling onto you with full force
&gt;&quot;Aaaaanonnnnn, Ooo it feels gooooood&quot;&quot; Mattie moans, panting heavily while looking into your eyes
&gt;You smile and hug her close as her tremors from her orgasm shake her body
&gt;After a moment or two she regains her composure and the small tremors stop
&gt;Mattie smiles and grinds on you a bit
&gt;&quot;Ohhhhh someone is rearing to go&quot; She says with a smile
&gt;You had been so focused on Mattie that you are just now aware how painfully erect you are
&gt;Mattie looks down at your boxers and back at you, biting her lip
&gt;&quot;Can...can we go all the way Anon? I promise I’ll try to be sexy&quot; she says looking down at her body and then her stump
&gt;With one finger under her chin, you lift her face and kiss her
&gt;&quot;You are sexy Madeline&quot;
&gt;Her ears perk and you feel her tail wag softly
&gt;&quot;Then uh... Let me get these off you&quot;
&gt;She gets up off of you and pulls on your boxers softly, which you help guide down your legs
&gt;Your erection springs free, causing her to stare at it
&gt;&quot;It...it’s bigger than I expected&quot; she say both nervously and worriedly
&gt;&quot;C-can I touch it?&quot; she asks, extending her paw towards your shaft like it’s a museum piece
&gt;You nod at her and her paw touches your shaft and wraps around it gently
&gt;Its different than you expected
&gt;Warm and soft, like being touched with very very fine silken fibres that were warmed
&gt;Her paw gently moves up and down your shaft, feeling you from the head to the base and eventually your family jewels
&gt;&quot;It’s just like the videos, and different from those dog ones...&quot; you hear Mattie murmur to herself as she slowly strokes your length
&gt;&quot;Videos?&quot; you ask before you can stop yourself
&gt;&quot;Mhm videos online&quot; She says absentmindedly, massaging your member gently with her paw
&gt;She leans her head closer, you feel her hot breath on the tip of your cock
&gt;A few wet licks from Mattie&#039;s long tongue sends shivers down your spine like you&#039;ve never felt before
&gt;It’s been years since anyone had given you any type of attention sexually and now you have Mattie cautiously licking you
&gt;And it feels amazing, her tongue is wetter, stronger and softer than any woman you had been with, granted that was only one
&gt;But it was a whole new feeling, one of sheer pleasure
&gt;And all she was doing was licking!
&gt;Her paw strokes you as she softly caresses you with her tongue
&gt;Your gasps and groans fuel her further, and she takes the tip of your cock into her mouth
&gt;Her tongue rapidly licks your tip and she quickens the pace of her stroking
&gt;But all too soon she releases you from her mouth with a pant
&gt;&quot;A-anon I know this feels good for you b-but I’m at my limit! I Need you please!&quot; she says standing
&gt;Between her thighs glistens with wetness, somehow she was even wetter than before and her legs were quivering slightly
&gt;Who were you to deny her the cure to her problem?
&gt;You beckon her to you and she straddles you once more
&gt;&quot;Take it slow....don&#039;t hurt yourself&quot; you say as she positions herself
&gt;She nods quickly and places her paw on your chest as you position your cock against her lips
&gt;She slowly lowers herself, allowing you to penetrate the sopping wetness that is Mattie&#039;s pussy
&gt;Shallow gasps and long breathes
&gt;You feel the radiating warmth, the incredible wetness and the constricting tightness
&gt;When she felt tight on your fingers it was amazing but as you feel her on you with you inside her, it’s indescribable
&gt;You place your hands on her wide hips and her guide her descent
&gt;&quot;Ooo its biggggg Anon&quot; Mattie moans as she leans forwards onto you
&gt;Well that’s an ego boost to be sure
&gt;Slowly, you guide her moments up and down, helping move her with you still inside her
&gt;She gasps every time you bring her down onto you, a soft *plap* noise is head each time
&gt;Her fur is so soaked that is doesn’t act as a cushion anymore
&gt;Her lone violet eye looks at you hazily, her arm around you while her stump tries to get a good grip
&gt;You kiss her softly as you keep guiding her movements
&gt;After all you are experienced with this, and even if Mattie was an Anthro, she was still a female
&gt;You knew how to make them sing in bed
&gt;At least you hoped you did
&gt;You begin using your feet to bounce upwards, helping Mattie’s movements a bit more on you
&gt;Her face is one of pure bliss, a bit of drool as she hangs onto you
&gt;No more words from her, just the quiet *ha* and *ah* as you thrust upwards into her
&gt;The inner walls of her pussy constrict, and feel tighter than before as she shudders a  bit and pulls you close, her body shivering and nuzzling against you
&gt;&quot;AAA-anonnnnn its sooooooo goood&quot; Mattie moans, her mouth slightly agape with a grin
&gt;You smile and continue, your hands on her glorious hips and ass, guiding her movements on you
&gt;And as she constricts and nuzzles you, you feel your own limit approaching
&gt;The build up from the licking and stroking was too much to bear
&gt;&quot;Mattie, can I cum in-&quot;
&gt;&quot;PILL! DO IT!&quot; She cries in a brief moment of clarity
&gt;That’s all the invitation you need
&gt;You unload every drop, every ounce of love you have into her, pulling her close in a shuddering orgasm that made your legs shake
&gt;She gives out a long &quot;aaaaaah&quot; as you give a few extra thrusts, pushing into her with the last bit of vigor you have
&gt;At last your arms fall away and your left breathless
&gt;No human could compare to that which Mattie gave you
&gt;The love, the warmth, the... well everything
&gt;She slumps against you, her head resting on your chest
&gt;&quot;Was it good for my first time?&quot; Mattie pants, looking at you expectantly
&gt;you nod and kiss her
&gt;&quot;The best I’ve ever had&quot; you say with a smile
&gt;There was no lie there
&gt;Just the love you felt for this woman

Chapter 9: Exitlude

&gt;Time flowed by like a river as you and Mattie lived together
&gt;you loved her, that much you knew
&gt;How could you not?
&gt;She accepted you, all of your flaws and you past
&gt;And you loved her
&gt;Her DnD campaigns that she constantly pulled you into
&gt;The Days where she would come home and talk about her job (You didn&#039;t understand most of what it was she was talking about, but you smiled and nodded anyway)
&gt;her parents, Chase who helped guide you through this new world and Beth who still gave you tackling hugs
&gt;Oh, and you loved her despite her missing arm and eye
&gt;To you it never made a difference
&gt;In a way, both of you related to each other
&gt;You both lost something
&gt;But none of that matters as you sit across from her at this fancy restaurant
&gt;you fidget in you pocket while looking at Mattie
&gt;She has a big smile on her face as she eats dessert, strawberry cheesecake, which was one of her favorites
&gt;Why were you nervous?
&gt;You had done this before
&gt;But... something was different this time
&gt;You were different
&gt;Just do it! Don&#039;t be a fucking soyboy!
&gt;Grasping the small box in your hand firmly, you stand up, earning a confused look from Mattie
&gt;&quot;Anon? whats up we haven&#039;t fin-&quot;
&gt;Her eye goes wide as you kneel in front of her on one knee
&gt;Yea it&#039;s cheesy, but its all you know
&gt;She brings a paw to her mouth, staring at you with her beautiful violet eye
&gt;&quot;Are you sure&quot; she finally says, disbelief filling her voice
&gt;You chuckle as you reach forwards, extending a hand to her
&gt;&quot;Of course I&#039;m sure Mattie, I love you; will you Campaign with me forever?&quot;
&gt;A DnD Callback; Nice
&gt;She removes her paw from her face and places it into you hand
&gt;Carefully, you slip the ring onto her padded finger
&gt;&quot;If I wasn&#039;t sure, I wouldn&#039;t ask&quot; you say with a confident smile
&gt;Mattie stares at the ring for a moment, tears filling her eye before she pounces on you in a hug
&gt;&quot;YES YES YES A THOUSAND TIMES YES ANON&quot; she cries happily her arm around you neck in a comforting hug
&gt;You smile as you wrap your arms around her 
&gt;You never could feel bad about loving her
&gt;Why would you?
&gt;Were it not for her, you would still be in that alley
&gt;And for some reason, you can&#039;t help but think
&gt;Were it not for you, she would never have made it out of that alley either
&gt;Were it no for each other, Things would have never changed
&gt;But you&#039;re glad it did
