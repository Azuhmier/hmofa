            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">On the Fringes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">By Ago</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I had to shut the television off. It was the same story all the time for the past couple of months. Humanity victorious, the Elders defeated, ADVENT in disarray. Everybody cheering and hollering, as if most of the planet wasn&#039;t still a smoking, smoldering heap that might never again know a touch of green or the flow of clean water. Sure, Earth was free, I guess. Some celebrations were in order. But how long were they going to wave that banner around before they realized things were still just as bad as they were before? Before they realized that the time for celebration was long past, and it was time to roll those sleeves up and get to the real ugly work of reconstruction and reclamation?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;d fume and rant some more about it to myself later. The clock said five in the morning, which meant it was feeding time. I slipped into my dirty overalls, slid on my ballcap and headed downstairs; the creak seemed to have gotten worse, and the banister wobbled just as badly. I kept telling myself I&#039;ll fix it but it just wasn&#039;t high on the list of priorities.  Feeding first, then feed myself, then I needed to work on the perimeter security system. Either the detection protocol was degraded or the foxes kept finding new ways in. Of all the animals ADVENT wiped out, foxes managed to slip under the radar. Somehow I wasn&#039;t surprised. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I guess I couldn&#039;t be too mad at ADVENT&#039;s laxity. Had they been any more thorough, I would&#039;ve lost my animals.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I pushed through the camo netting, pausing for just a minute to rearrange some of the branches caught in the mesh entrance. I passed by the console and glanced at it to make sure everything was as it should&#039;ve been; temperature and humidity were good, airflow was holding steady, water collection systems were working perfectly. I wanted to build an automated dispenser to save myself a bit of time in the mornings, but I never seemed able to find the time. As such, the most advanced feeding method I had was a bucket underneath a manual dispenser. The boys and girls in the next room were already excited; they heard the feed plinking against the dented walls of the aluminum bucket. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hey guys, how&#039;s it goin&#039;?&quot; The chickens crowded around as I opened the door. They knew the routine. They&#039;ve known it their whole lives, for what little that encompassed. It&#039;s something I&#039;ve always felt bad about. They&#039;re animals after all; they should see the sun, get fresh air, be able to feel the elements on their bodies. Instead they&#039;ve got heat lamps on timers, water from drippers, and fans to fake a breeze. Truth be told I&#039;m not sure they would know what to do with a damn worm if they saw one. But I had to do this. I&#039;ve always had to do this. We&#039;ve been hiding ever since the invasion, but the ADVENT ban on animals only made our concealment that much more important. Even now, with humanity back in control, I couldn&#039;t risk letting them be seen. What if some passing &#039;resistance&#039; guys decided to take them for the greater good? Screw that, what&#039;s the greater good ever done for me? No, best to just live out the rest of my life here, alone -- what little that encompassed. Things were simple here. Everywhere else was chaos.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I took stock of them as I scattered the feed by hand. Marlene looked a little thin. Holly&#039;s bald spot was still there; I don&#039;t think she&#039;s sick, so another hen must be bickering with her. Judy was looking plump, and she&#039;s getting to be that age; she could be the next one on my table. Cathy&#039;s seemed to have lost interest in her chicks; I guess it was time to move them to the second enclosure. Iris and Penny were getting along again, so that&#039;s good, unless one of them just moved onto bugging Holly. And then there&#039;s Harvey; he seemed to have calmed down, so I&#039;ll keep him in here. The hens liked to have a rooster strutting about. I was thinking about building a third enclosure for him, he can get a little testy sometimes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The sharp snap of a popped light bulb brought me out of my thoughts; one of the heat lamps called it quits. I&#039;ll have to get another bulb from the basement. Another thing to add to my list.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">After the hens and rooster have had their fill, the chicks were next in line. They get fed in their own enclosure, so an agitated adult doesn&#039;t get too ornery with them. So far all of the little guys appeared healthy. I sure hope they stayed that way since they were going to be the next generation. I checked their water drippers, and before I left I noticed a dip by the far wall of the enclosure, like someone had been digging. But the straw inside was undisturbed, so it must have been from the outside. It&#039;s got to be a damn fox. I&#039;ll have to add some chickenwire before filling that hole in tonight. Yet another thing on my to-do list.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Collected eggs. Tended to the garden. Had breakfast. Beat the unused eggs and froze them in the basement. Kept the left-over veggies for dinner. Morning routine over.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The perimeter detection software was the next big thing. It&#039;s always the biggest pain in in the ass I have to deal with. I have to drag an old laptop out to the invisible fence line and spend hours debugging the code. I&#039;ll be on the verge of fixing it, only to find some new error&#039;s popped up in the code in a place I never even changed. Sometimes the laptop loses its wireless connection to the basement server and I have to spend forever walking up and down the fence line looking for a spot with good signal. Almost reminds me of what most people would call the goold old days, where we only had little problems in our day-to-day lives. For all the frustration this crap caused me, it&#039;s worth it. Haven&#039;t lost a chicken to a predator in years, so I haven&#039;t given up on it, even with its myriad bugs. Couldn&#039;t afford to if I wanted to stay here by my lonesome and survive.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">By the time the software was fixed -- for the time being -- the sun had begun to set. My stomach grumbled angrily, so I headed back inside. Dinner&#039;s just more eggs and veggies. When I was done eating, my anger over the morning broadcasts had subsided and I switched the television back on. Surprise, surprise -- more hoohawing about how humanity has won. Footage abounded of alien forces still being routed across the globe, of the resistance forces waving their flags and shouting &#039;vigilo confido&#039; while the news anchors play up the pride-of-humanity angle for the fighters. They damn near televised an execution before they realized what was happening and the camera panned around. Still heard the gunshots, though -- that made my skin crawl. It was at that point I had had enough. Switched everything off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Settling in was a strange ritual in that every time I paused at the sink to brush my teeth, I said a little prayer to god that the plumbing still worked. The property has its own well, but the pipes were old -- like, older than dirt.  I anxiously turned the handle, wondering if today was going to be the day; regardless of what curses I spat during my daily chores, the powers that be saw fit to keep the water running for the time being. I brushed my teeth, stripped to my boxers, and climbed into bed. Only to remember then that I had forgotten to fill in that hole by the chicks&#039; enclosure. I agonized for a few torturous moments, tossing and turning. I even switched the light back on a few times, ready to crawl back outside. Screw it, I thought. I decided to take care of it tomorrow morning, and drifted off to sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A shrill buzzing woke me up about two in the morning. It wasn&#039;t my clock but the fence alarm I&#039;ve got wired up to my basement server, the one that tells me if the perimeter&#039;s been crossed by something roughly fox-sized. The thought briefly crossed my mind that if I hadn&#039;t fixed the software I&#039;d have gotten a full night&#039;s rest, but then again I could be down a chicken or more. I threw on old ratty t-shirt, grabbed the shotgun from beneath my bed, and rushed into the pitch black. The moment I set foot outdoors I could already hear the commotion coming from my chickens and my heart sank. I flicked on the muzzle flashlight, checked my gun, saw the flashy red of a loaded shell, and made a beeline for the coop.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I stopped dead in my tracks. The latch on the door was open. Foxes didn&#039;t do that. They can&#039;t. I mean, they could -- they can be pretty smart -- but why would it dig one night and then suddenly know how to use the door latch the next? And the tracks going into the coop were real weird. No paw prints, just a deep gouge in the dirt. Did it drag something inside? Of all the places to store a kill, it&#039;s got to use my chicken coop? And why the hell was the light on? The adrenaline surging through me left no time for useless questions and I barged in, leveling my gun at what I supposed was a fox&#039;s height.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Only to see a long, long tail that went deathly still the moment I entered. My jaw dropped and I tracked up, and up, and up further until I was staring eye to eye with by all accounts was just a giant freakin&#039; snake -- with arms.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Its whole body was frozen, its amber eyes focused on me, one of my chickens in its grasp throwing an absolute fit. In the lifetimes this snake and I spent staring at one other, I remembered what I had seen on television: alien soldiers. Used to look different during the initial invasion. Spat venom. Newsfeeds called&#039;em vipers, though with the hood they looked more like cobras. Lackeys of the Elders, instruments of death and malcontent, perpetrators of unspeakable acts of cruelty against humankind. At least, that&#039;s what the television said. They were fearless and always on the move, impossible to pin down and even harder to kill.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">This one looked nothing like that. Creepy as all hell, sure. But with my shotgun pointed at its chest, I absolutely saw fear in its eyes. A desire to run, to preserve itself. A piece of its armor was missing, exposing half its chest and what looked like some birdshot wounds around what appeared to be a human-shaped torso. A fist-sized chunk of flesh was missing from the bottom right edge of its hood; dark yellow blood dripped intermittently from its wounds. They must have been fairly recent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I could kill it. It would have been so easy. Wasn&#039;t that my duty? As a member of humankind, shouldn&#039;t I? One of the many tools of our former oppressors -- why shouldn&#039;t I kill it?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Drop my chicken.&quot; Part of me hoped it wouldn&#039;t understand, that it simply couldn&#039;t. I hoped it would just make a threatening move and give me an excuse to pull the trigger. For all I knew it had just been in a fight; maybe it had just killed someone before being forced to retreat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Unfortunately, it immediately obeyed. Judy fell to the ground, angry and noisy before quieting down and joining the rest of the chickens cowering in the far corner. The alien&#039;s gaze flickered to my gun before it seemed to recoil, sliding backwards a couple of feet. Was it cowering, too? What happened to the fearless killer the newsfeeds always showed? Where was the predatory instinct that made them vicious beasts? Where was the animal that I wouldn&#039;t feel bad about killing?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You understand english?&quot; It nodded near imperceptibly, perhaps afraid anything more might set me off. &quot;Do you speak it?&quot; It shook its head just once; again, a blink-and-you&#039;ll-miss-it sort of movement. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It was not immediately threatening, even for how imposing it looked. It was clearly wounded. I watched the tongue flick out past its lips and its eyes would try as hard as they could to glance at my chickens without moving its head; it was obviously hungry. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">If I pulled the trigger now, I&#039;d just be an executioner.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You can&#039;t have a chicken. I can&#039;t do that,&quot; I said, lowering my gun to my hip but with the barrel still pointed at it. The cat was out of the bag now; what harm would there be in taking it down to my basement? I&#039;ve got plenty of eggs and veggies in freezers. &quot;I can give you something else and send you on your way. That fair?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It nodded earnestly. I jerked my head towards the door and began to step backwards, still keeping my weapon pointed in its direction. It understood and began to follow me out, keeping a healthy distance between it and myself. I kept walking backwards towards the house until reaching the cellar, where I kicked the latch open. The doors were too heavy to just lift with my foot, though. I motioned with my gun at the entrance.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Open it and I&#039;ll follow you down.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">At this it hesitated. I suppose I might, too; a stranger behind me with a gun wanted me to descend into an underground bunker. Lots of old horror films or crime dramas might end or start this way. But hunger is a very powerful motivator -- I would know. The alien only thought for a moment longer before slithering up to the cellar doors and throwing them open, then carefully wound its way down the stone steps. The motion-sensing lights flickered on, bathing the basement in a strong white glow, and I followed down after it. This was where I kept damn near everything; food, water, spare clothing and bedding, my freezers, generators and fuel, my server for the various electronics around the property. It knew I had chickens; everything else seemed insignificant by comparison.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Here,&quot; I said, circling around it to open one of the freezers. With my gun still trained on the snake, I reached in with my free hand and fished out two large bowls of beaten eggs then placed them both on the floor. Each bowl was probably about five or six eggs worth -- not that it mattered. I had plenty to spare. &quot;This is all I&#039;ve got for protein. You&#039;ll have to wait for it to defrost. Afterwards you could drink it if you wanted to, or heat it up and scramble them. You know, heat it up until it starts to turn solid. Whitish-yellow and brown are good, any darker and you&#039;re burning them.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I backed away and it came forward, gingerly picking up each bowl as if it were some sort of trap. In all honesty, it did seem thoroughly confused. It was almost like it was unable to process what was happening. Had it not known an ounce of kindness before? I figured ADVENT never treated its footsoldiers as anything other than tools, and I highly doubt any aliens got much courtesy from humans. Maybe it actually was confused. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I grabbed a tiny package -- one of many -- about half the size of a child&#039;s lunchbox, from one of the central shelves and slid it across the ground. &quot;Home-made first-aid kit. It&#039;s only got clean rags and alcohol in it. Clean your wounds. Fair warning: the alcohol will hurt like a bitch. I mean -- it&#039;s going to hurt a lot.&quot; I couldn&#039;t spare antibiotics. I didn&#039;t know a damn thing about dosage for an alien, or if it would even be effective. The rags and alcohol would have to do.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;And here,&quot; I said. I flipped the lid on a plastic container and grabbed a light blanket, then dropped it on the ground between us. The snake cautiously inched its tail forward and wrapped it around the blanket and first-aid kit before dragging it back. &quot;This time of year, days are always nice but the nights can get chilly. You can stay warm with that. From here, you head west and you&#039;ll crest a small hill. A few dozen yards past that is the edge of my property line. Do you get what I&#039;m saying? I&#039;m not going to see you again, am I?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Those amber eyes still wide with confusion couldn&#039;t tear themselves away from the eggs, kit, and blanket. I had to repeat myself before those slitted pupils turned towards me. The alien slowly shook its head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Go on, then,&quot; I said, using my hands to motion towards the stairs. &quot;And don&#039;t -- don&#039;t get yourself killed, I guess. That&#039;s good food and a good blanket. I&#039;d hate for it to go to waste.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Its tail twitched over and over, like some sort of anxious habit. It turned slowly and slithered up the stairs, carefully so as not to drop the lifelines I had given it. I followed a short ways behind, just to keep it within eyesight as it made its own way off into the impenetrable black again. For as dark as it was -- it must&#039;ve been close to three -- I didn&#039;t have to watch long before it seemed to dissolve into the night. Despite our...amiable meeting, it still made my hair stand up to know a giant, intelligent snake was out there and I couldn&#039;t see it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I didn&#039;t get another wink of sleep that night. Helping an alien -- what sort of human was I?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">-Chapter 2-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The day after that alien&#039;s visit was rough. I missed out on three hours of sleep while riding high on adrenaline and fear, so I crashed hard that afternoon. Multiple times, in fact. I fell asleep while emptying the water barrels into my underground storage. Damn near took a dip face first into one of them. Fell asleep laying on the floor, trying to fix the banister at the bottom step. Even took a snooze while standing under the bright basement lights, taking care of some server maintenance.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">But none of these little naps were restful in the least. Every time I closed my eyes I saw that snake -- that viper -- right in front of me, in this weird state between illusion and reality that felt more a hallucination than it did a dream. I couldn&#039;t get my mind away from our encounter. Every time I saw it, we were just having a friendly chat, our mouths moving but no sound coming out. Neither of us would notice, though. We would just keep on talking without a care in the world, disturbingly oblivious to each other&#039;s silence. I&#039;d wake up after what felt like talking for hours, feeling even more tired than before and with these strange thoughts in my head. What would it have sounded like? Did it use the ADVENT tongue or did vipers speak their own language? Did they speak at all?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">In my restless state I sometimes heard an insidiously reasonable voice in the far reaches of my mind asking me why I hadn&#039;t pulled the trigger, saying by all rights I should have shot that thing where it stood. The voice only grew in intensity as time went on, daring me to even hazard a guess at some answers to its uncomfortable questions. How many people had it killed? How many homes had it razed to the ground? How many lives might it have upended at the behest of its masters? This self-interrogation was only exacerbated by sleep deprivation and resultant irritability. And boy, did it get bad, because things only got rougher that night. And rougher still the next, and the one after that. Eventually, this apparent obsession began to spill over into my waking hours. I couldn&#039;t escape it, and I was frustratingly forced to accept a simple fact that I had convinced myself long, long ago just wasn&#039;t true.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I was devastatingly lonely.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I had spent twenty years -- just over half of my life -- on this farm with no meaningful contact with another soul for the past eight. Each day had just become a checklist of the same things, an unchanging routine of tasks that varied only in the order in which they might get done. Chickens. Garden. Eat. Wash. Clean. Maintain. After all this time, after telling myself for so long I was okay with this isolation for the sake of safety -- were the cracks beginning to show? Was that it? It was the only explanation I could come up with. Anybody could have visited me and I&#039;d have become obsessed with them, if only for the glimpse of society they may have brought with them, that desire to communicate and connect. How unlucky that it was one of the aliens that had happened upon my land. Someone who I could talk at, but not someone I could talk to. Someone that I was forced to greet at the barrel end of a gun because I didn&#039;t know who my friends or my enemies were anymore. I couldn&#039;t trust other people, human or alien, and now I realize it must be slowly but surely breaking me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">When my parents brought my brother and I out here during the initial invasion, we severed all contact with the world. We didn&#039;t tell anyone where we were going, what we were bringing with us, or what was already at our destination. Our parents drilled into us that in the coming catastrophe, people would only want what we had. Time and again, my parents were proven right. My father killed a few people who thought they could take from us. I never saw it with my own eyes, but I remember hearing the gunshots, the adrenaline-soaked shouting afterwards that everything was all clear. Until one time, things didn&#039;t go so well. Dad never gave the all-clear, so mom went to check on him. Two more gunshots, then total silence. We waited until the next morning to even dare to peek out the windows, and saw our parents and a third man laying in the grass. From then on, it was up to my brother and I to defend ourselves.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He had readily adopted our father&#039;s killer instinct. For him, taking life to protect us was easy. I lacked that resolve -- which was a constant point of contention between us -- and I think that&#039;s what has made me so afraid of other people now. I&#039;m just not sure I have it in me to do what might have to be done. Even when faced with an alien, a killer from the old regime, my first instinct was to give. That was not how I would survive in this day and age. Back then, my brother probably felt I was dead weight. We argued for years; he thought we should do more, while I thought simply staying put and living was good enough. Eight years ago, he up and left, leaving only a note speaking of some resistance group.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I suppose I can&#039;t be too mad at him anymore; the resistance won, after all. He was right. I was wrong.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I awoke to an ever-increasing buzz as my senses returned to me, the last remnants of the latest viper dream vanishing into memory. The perimeter alarm was going off again. I rolled over and saw daylight peeking through the curtains, realizing only then I had overslept. I must have turned off my clock alarm while half-asleep. I yawned, stretched, then took a look at the alert. My heart sank; three different breaches, all within seconds of each other and the outer two contacts equidistant from the center. It was a formation.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Had that viper returned with help? Hell, I might have if I was it. On the run, hurt, hungry and afraid, why not grab a few friends and go raid the guy that it knew had more than enough to go around? I threw my overalls on, grabbed my gun, and rushed to the window to draw the curtains just enough to peek outside with one eye. Based on the time since the alert and the direction of the breach, they should have come into view right about...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">They were humans. Laughing, talking, walking humans. Even with guns clearly visible in their hands, I couldn&#039;t seperate my excitement from my anxiety. After an incredibly unsatisfying glimpse of the outer world through the limited mannerisms of a giant snake, these guys would be what I had been looking for after all these years. Society, community, connection! I didn&#039;t need an alien after all. These guys would clear away the dreams, they would bring back a little bit of normalcy to my life.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">But despite these enticing possibilities, I heard my parents in my head: they will want to take.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I gathered my thoughts, and stopped before exiting the front door to make myself look a bit less threatening. I cradled my shotgun low in my arms, took some deep breaths in an effort to relax, and ambled on outside into full view. By then, they were about fifty yards from the front porch. They stopped when they saw me, but only for a moment. After that brief pause, all three of them were waving and smiling. I waited and let them approach, ready to tell them when they were close enough. They stopped well before that point. All three slung their weapons onto their backs before the lead stepped forward.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;How&#039;s it going, friend? Glorious kind of day, ain&#039;t it?&quot; He was a younger fellow, maybe early twenties. Asian, black hair, wearing an old army combat helmet and some sort of home-made armor by the looks of it. He had some wear-and-tear on him; a bullet had gone through the jacket&#039;s shoulder, but I couldn&#039;t tell if he wore the wound as well. He had a pouch on his hip carrying two magazines for a weapon that he didn&#039;t have; he had what appeared to be a shotgun -- maybe an old civilian model of something pre-invasion, I couldn&#039;t be certain. A brown bandage around his left arm hid a wound that must have been days old. His companions were dressed like he was, though the one on the left looked like he had rummaged through some military surplus; his gear looked straight out of an old world army, giving him the appearance of someone already battle-tested.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Sure is, friend,&quot; I said, trying the word out. I hadn&#039;t said it in years. Maybe I had -- a few times, in passing conversation to my chickens. It felt good to say it aloud to another person. &quot;What brings you out my way?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;m Eric, and my friends here behind me are Gerard and Donovan. We&#039;re from a small town about four, five days back that way,&quot; he said, pointing in the direction from which they had come. &quot;We had a very small ADVENT garrison within town limits. A dozen troopers and a few vipers. We finally decided to move on them earlier this week, but one of one of the snakes slipped away. Even with the aliens in a panic, we&#039;re worried she might call for some reinforcements, as improbable as it sounds. We&#039;ve been tracking her since that night. Have you by chance seen her come this way?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A hunting party. They must be the ones responsible for her -- &quot;What do you mean, her?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He looked at me like I was a total stranger. Well, even more of a stranger than what he had first thought. &quot;All vipers are female. You didn&#039;t know that?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Been here a while. There&#039;s probably a lot I don&#039;t know.&quot; I thought I might have unconsciously tipped my hand a bit by having said that. Maybe they might start wondering what I had out here would have let me survive on my own for so long. But they seemed friendly enough, and none of them grabbed onto that question I had left in the air.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You&#039;re one of them last-man-on-earth types, eh?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I guess you could say that.&quot; I nodded at his bandaged arm. &quot;You saw some action then, with this fight you had? How was it? Is the town safe now?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;It was fan-fuckin&#039;-tastic,&quot; said his friend, the tan-skinned one in the surplus gear. Donovan, I think his name was. His voice was loud and animated, like he didn&#039;t understand how obnoxious he sounded. &quot;We took the first squad on patrol by total surprise, ripped them to shreds in a crossfire. By the time the rest of the garrison mustered, we had them surrounded. Torched the building and picked off whoever came running out. The other guys skinned a couple of the snakes and now the bar has some real sweet, scaley-looking pennants hanging above the door as you walk in. I think they&#039;re gonna try to stuff another one -- you know, turn it into some trophy on a stand. I got myself a pair of fangs off one of them, check it out.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He held up a pair of large recurved fangs suspended on a necklace, in awe of his own handiwork while my blood slowly turned into sludge in my veins. Enemies, sure, I can understand hating your enemies. I can understand wanting to kill them, wanting to save the town. But that&#039;s where it should end, isn&#039;t it? Even the man that had killed my parents -- my brother and I buried him too. I hated him with every fiber of my being, I wished he had never been born, I wished I could have seen if I had had the guts to kill him myself...but we still buried him. And here these guys were, admiring their own barbaric tale like they were heroes instead of a bunch of butchers looking for the next thing to toss on the chopping block.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">This was not the chat I had been hoping for. I hid my disgust behind a facade of admiration. &quot;Sounds like you guys did quite the number on them.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;We sure fuckin&#039; did,&quot; Donovan said, stashing the fang necklace back into his jacket. &quot;Now we&#039;re just looking for the last one. We got some shots on her already but they&#039;re tougher than they look.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Birdshot, by any chance?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">All three heads whipped around to look at me, eyes full of hope and bloodlust. &quot;You saw her, then? Must have, to get close enough to see the holes we punched into her,&quot; Eric said.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yeah, she wandered by a few days ago. She stopped pretty close by, maybe thinking about looking for supplies in my place. But she just kept on truckin&#039;. Not sure where she is now, but I can point you in the right direction.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;We&#039;d be very appreciative, mister...?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I waved away his question. &quot;I prefer to keep to myself, if you don&#039;t mind,&quot; I said, to which Eric just shrugged his shoulders. &quot;She headed north. Nothing out that way but some dense forest. Lots of places to hide, so I&#039;d be careful if I were you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It felt so strange to lie to them. The first humans I had seen in nearly a decade, with no ill will towards me in their minds, and I lied to them -- for what? To save the life of an alien that I had talked to for a half hour? Where was the connection? Where were the people that would make me want to come back to the world?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The three of them thanked me and turned to be on their way, only for the third guy -- Gerard -- to stop and look back at me, waving a canteen around.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Don&#039;t mean to be a bother,&quot; he said through a thick foreign accent, &quot;but if you&#039;ve got some water, we wouldn&#039;t mind a top-off.&quot; The other two stopped and looked back, wondering what my answer would be as their hands drifted to their own canteens.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I guess my parents were right after all. Everyone always wants something. Were the actually asking? Or was it just a polite way of saying they needed water and they figured I had some? What would they do if I said no? Not that I could think of a reason to say no, but just -- what if? I guess I had frozen up a little because the three of them suddenly got nervous, which made me even more nervous. Nervous was bad when dealing with unknowns.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;ve got some water barrels out back; you&#039;ll probably want to boil it to be safe,&quot; I said. Their postures relaxed, though I shifted my gun to one hand, the barrel pointed at the ground but facing in their general direction. &quot;One of you can follow me; leave your gun with your pals but take their canteens and you can fill them all.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">My request was met without a single word of protest. Gerard hefted his rifle onto Eric&#039;s free shoulder before taking the groups&#039; canteens. He seemed to understand my caution. He made himself look as harmless as possible, stopping halfway between us to reveal a knife which he tossed back to his friends. That made me a little uneasy; did he show me that as a symbol of goodwill or as a way to make me feel a false sense of security? I couldn&#039;t figure him out, but either way he seemed a likable fellow. He walked very slowly and made no sudden movements. His arms were full with three canteens, so it&#039;s not as if he could have done anything without first dropping them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He followed me around the back of the house; I led him to the side opposite the chicken coop. I didn&#039;t want him smelling or hearing them. There we found my blue plastic water barrels, already partially emptied from my last collection a few days ago. Out of the corner of my eye I saw him stop, as if waiting for my permission again. I nodded at him and he got to work, submerging each container until it was full.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;So,&quot; I began, watching him fill the last one, &quot;what are you going to do this particular viper when you catch her?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Not sure, my man,&quot; Gerard said, offering a bright white smile that contrasted with his dark complexion. &quot;We&#039;re sure as hell not gonna lug three hundred pounds of muscle all the way back to town, so we&#039;ll probably clean her the moment she&#039;s down. We&#039;re thinking about leaving the fangs in and taking the whole head instead. An intact skull would look pretty wicked, yeah? Maybe put it on the ADVENT truck we took from the garrison, like a hood ornament. Tell me that wouldn&#039;t be awesome.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I swallowed hard, nodding with a smile that matched his. &quot;Yeah, that -- that does sound pretty neat,&quot; I said as he capped off all three canteens. He took point just a few steps ahead of me, allowing me to keep him in full view as we retraced our steps to the front of the house, where his buddies were waiting in the exact same spots we had left them. Gerard trotted up to them, passed out the canteens and took his weapon back from Eric, who afterwards shouldered his gear more comfortably before turning back to me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;We really appreciate your help, mister. If you like, I can send one of my guys back here with a piece of whatever we catch. You want a swatch of skin? It&#039;s got some nice colors to it, probably look good in a workshop or above a fireplace.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I fought back the acidic taste of bile that bubbled up in the back of my throat. &quot;That&#039;s quite all right. Thanks for the offer, though.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He shrugged, and the three of them went their way. I sat on my porch and watched them off, making sure they disappeared over the horizon before allowing myself to relax. Even alone again, winding down from my first bit of human contact in eight years was not easy. I was suddenly tired and even unhappier than I had been before. That whispering voice of reason that asked me why I had let the viper go was now asking me why I wanted anything to do with people if they were going to be like that. Was the whole world a slaughterhouse now? Would those men live on into old age and tell their children about the time they carved up intelligent things just to have a memento they could put on a necklace or fireplace mantle? Or would they possess even an ounce of regret for their actions, and omit that detail while playing themselves up as heroes of humanity? Either way just didn&#039;t sit right with me in the least.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I remembered to feed the chickens before heading back inside to feed myself. On my way back inside, I nearly tripped on two clean bowls I must have left outside by mistake, which was odd because I didn&#039;t remember--</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">My hair stood on end. In that moment I had that distinct feeling like I was being watched, like I could feel someone shooting daggers at the base of my neck. I had the inclination to wheel around and brandish my gun, but I reasoned I&#039;d be dead already if it -- if she wanted. I set my gun against the porch railing and slowly turned to see just an empty field, with the only other indicator of life being the bootprints my three visitors had left in the dirt and grass.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I couldn&#039;t wait for my fellow humans to hit the road, and now I was kind of sort of wishing this viper would show up again. I wasn&#039;t entirely sure what sort of company I was fit for anymore.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">-Chapter 3-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Those two bowls stayed on my kitchen counter all day. And all night. And into the next morning.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I didn&#039;t quite know what to do with them. I found myself passing by them on a whim, as if I wanted to still see them sitting there on the counter top where I had left them. In short order they became an extension of my obsession, of my desire to meet this viper once more and hope that she might bring a bit of something with her -- a connection to someone else, some communication beyond the talk of blood and butchery my fellow humans had offered. Despite the language barrier, maybe in time she could somehow tell me her name, where she was from, or what her life was like. Maybe she would ask these questions of me, if she had the interest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The more I thought about it, the deeper the chasm appeared between humanity and myself. Part of me wondered if it should be deeper, though. Beyond asking what had brought those three to my home, the first bit of curiosity I wanted to satisfy was about the fight. My stomach twisted itself into knots as I dwelt on it, as my thoughts stirred up painful arguments my brother and I had before he had ended up leaving. Was there a part of me that wanted to kill an alien, that wanted to have some trophy that I could show to other people and say &#039;look, I helped, too&#039;? Would there by some grand tribunal where people lined up with pieces of alien corpses as proof they deserved to exist as part of mankind?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;Ah, viper fangs? You pass. Viper skins? Pass. ADVENT helmets? Looking good.&#039; And then there&#039;d be me, cowering under the harsh glare of the judge and my fellow man as I show my empty hands, soiled not by alien blood but by dirt.  &#039;Hold on there, where&#039;s your pound of flesh? And you think you deserve to be called human?&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Maybe my brother was right; I feel too much for other people. I&#039;ve got too much empathy in me to do what he did -- to do what dad did. I pointed a gun at an alien snake and I never saw the predator, the killer instinct behind her eyes. I could only see the overwhelming fear, the primal driving force of hunger that led her to my doorstep even when wounded. Did that make me a good person, or did that make me weak?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I felt like I&#039;d never know unless I saw her again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I took my breakfast outside and sat on the porch steps. Between bites, my eyes would casually drift westward, hopefully looking at the hill that partially blocked my view of the treeline. My fork mostly meandered about aimlessly, turning over some eggs or potatoes like there was something else to find on the plate. Though every time I heard the slightest sound I subconsciously reached for my gun beside me, only remembering when I grasped empty air that I had left it inside in some foolish attempt to make myself seem approachable.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">My thoughts twisted and churned in my mind and I began to argue with myself. What if the gun had been the great equalizer? When I had found her in the chicken coop, she was scared; not of me, but of the gun. When I ordered her to put the chicken down, it was the gun that forced her compliance. When I told her to open the cellar and head down, it was the gun that guaranteed my safety. If she chose now to show up, it wouldn&#039;t be because I looked nice; it would be because I was no longer a threat. What if I had made myself a target? And it was only then I realized that if she came to me now with murder on her mind, she would almost certainly have the upper hand. After all, she was a weapon of the Elders; venom, a crushing tail, and long fangs made her formidable in her own right.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The sudden fluttering of wings made me tense, and once again my hand went to the imaginary gun beside me. I wish I could say it was reflexive, a movement trained into me by circumstances of my existence, but it wasn&#039;t. It was purely instinctual fear that kept me grabbing for a gun, that had me constantly forgetting there wasn&#039;t one there. I took a deep breath and let it go slowly and deliberately, hoping it might calm my nerves. Stop startling so easily, I told myself. It&#039;s just birds. It&#039;s just wind. It&#039;s just nothing. I took another bite and looked towards the horizon, wondering what else might be coming my way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And there my answer stood in front of me not ten yards away, tongue flickering in and out in a frenzy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Oh,&quot; I muttered, absolutely paralyzed by fear; every muscle in my body pulled taut like a steel cable to the point of snapping. It was odd to see her in broad daylight, in much the same way I imagine a kid would find it odd to see a monster anywhere but under the bed. In the natural light I could see her eyes that seemed amber in our first meeting were actually far darker -- nearly red. She was mostly yellow with concentric diamond shapes of black white, and orange. It was startling to see something so familiar in an unfamiliar shape; everything about her echoed Earth snakes, from the intricately scaled top side -- er, dorsal side, if I remember my old high scool classes -- to the white segmented scales that covered her neck and belly. Things got weirder the higher up I looked; arms and armored plate that looked like it hid a pair of breasts behind it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She looked around me, only minimally moving her head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;No gun,&quot; I said, doing my best to keep my voice from trembling. &quot;Not this time.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her eyes locked onto mine. In that exact moment I felt like a rabbit, frozen in place and waiting for the predator to make the first move so I would know exactly in which direction to juke and sprint. But it was just a passing glance at best, and her gaze fell down to the plate of half-finished food in my hands.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hungry again?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She could not have nodded any harder if she had tried; with that hood of hers, it&#039;s a wonder she didn&#039;t take to the air then and there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Follow me, then,&quot; I said as I got to my feet. She began to slither to the side of the house where the cellar door was. &quot;No, not that way. I&#039;ve got some fresh food inside.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">At this she stopped and seemed thoughtful, as if considering options. Even in my fear I laughed inwardly at the thought that she might believe I was the predator, that I was the one leading her into a trap. But what sort of trap would see me set her loose the first night I had met her? Either way, something was on her mind because he looked me dead-on and pointed northward.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I chewed on my lip some, trying to figure out what it was she was getting at. There was nothing out that way but trees for as far as I had ever traveled; dozens and dozens of miles of forest so thick it had sometimes been hard to even find my way through. Then it hit me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;What, those men from yesterday? You saw me send them that way?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She nodded again, then cocked her head at me. She might have been an alien but I could read the question in those eyes of hers just as easily as if she had been a human: why?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I don&#039;t know.&quot; She pointed to herself, still looking at me. &quot;Yeah, they were looking for you. They -- they had some bad things in mind. I don&#039;t want to see anyone get hurt, much less be the cause of it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She took another long look at the northern treeline. I guess my answer satisfied any other questions she had, because she seemed a little more relaxed afterwards. I made room for her to move by me into the house, and she accepted my invitation, slithering past close enough for me to see the wounds that still marred her body. Some of them looked better, some looked worse. The hole at the edge of her hood looked totally scabbed over, and I couldn&#039;t see any signs of infection -- if aliens showed infection the same way humans did. Some of the birdshot in her torso was close to the surface and wouldn&#039;t require much digging around, if any, to fish out. Others were deep and not immediately visible beyond the swollen skin beneath her scales, indicating something foreign was buried in her flesh. I thought it might be inflammation, but then again -- she&#039;s an alien. I had no idea how her body reacted to injuries.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her proximity also gave me a better understanding of just how immense she was. Even slightly slouched forward, she was much taller than I was; I had to guess she was over seven feet, probably closer to eight. Her maw was as big as the rest of her and seemed to stretch all the way across her face; the front seemed fixed into what looked like a permanent scowl or frown but I had seen her move the sides and corners of her mouth to emote. Her eyes also seemed to dip inward a bit which gave her a very intense gaze, completing the angry look that seemed natural for her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hey.&quot; She stopped right before entering the front door, but did not turn to look at me. I wondered if I was about to overstep but pressed onward with my question anyway. &quot;Some of those holes in you look pretty bad. If you need help treating them...I mean, I can do that for you. After you get something in your stomach, maybe?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her head dropped and I saw her hand -- four fingers, how odd -- slowly move to her midsection and chest, where her armor piece was missing. She briefly hesitated before delicately prodding the area. I saw her shudder and flinch from her own touch. She turned and gave me a single nod, then continued on into the house with me more than a step behind her. I had to be extra careful not to step on her winding tail as it followed her around. At its thickest point it must&#039;ve been the size of my chest. She really was deceptively massive, considering how easily she moved about in my home.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Kitchen&#039;s on your left -- no, the next left,&quot; I said, watching her correct her path. &quot;You can take a seat wherever you like.&quot; I turned the stove top up and threw a clean pan onto one of the burners, then flew to the fridge and grabbed half a dozen eggs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">An alien -- in my house! As a guest! My fear shrank, overtaken by the sheer absurdity of the situation. People the world over were hunting down what trophies they could, and here I was harboring a viper. I had told her it was because I didn&#039;t want to see anybody hurt, but that wasn&#039;t the entire truth, was it? I hadn&#039;t told her it was because I was lonely, because I wanted someone or something to interact with whose intelligence was greater than a chicken&#039;s. And yet, I felt my elation at the prospective end of loneliness being tugged down by the weight of expectations.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What would my parents have said, I thought to myself as I cracked the eggs one at a time into the hot pan. My parents, whose first instinct was to run away from it all in an attempt to protect their two sons -- would they be disappointed? Scared for me? I suppose the latter was a given; though my fear was less than it was the first time I had met this viper, it was still very much present. I&#039;d bet my dad was turning in his grave but I imagine mom might be proud of me for helping someone in need. Well, pre-invasion mom, anyway. I could never clearly tell how the invasion changed her, she was always good at putting on a smile. Looking back on it as an adult, I guess that meant things were pretty bad. She was just doing her best to shield us from it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And what about my brother? Oh, I could not imagine the fury he&#039;d feel if he could see me now. The anger he showed during our arguments, calling me weak, lazy, apathetic -- I&#039;m sure that anger was tempered by some amount of brotherly love, and I shudder to think what he would sound like truly unleashed. He left to make a difference, ostensibly to kill as many of the aliens as he could, and I simply invited one right into our home, told her to sit at the table while I cooked for her. I wonder if he would kill me. Would I be a collaborator in his eyes? Or rather, what if I was just living up to expectations? If he were here, would he just laugh and smile and say he knew I was a useless softie, then blow her brains out and act like nothing was different? I wondered if he showed up with a bunch of fellow fighters, would he defend me or leave me out to dry for my actions?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The smell of slightly burnt eggs brought me out of my thoughts. I took the pan off the burner and upended it, watching the scrambled eggs tumble out onto a plate. When I turned, I saw she had forgone using a chair. Which made sense, seeing as how chairs are made for human bodies. Not sure what I had been thinking when I told her to sit. Regardless, it still appeared as if she was sitting; she was coiled up a little like a spring, with enough of her body beneath her that she looked to be normal height while at the table.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She did not show a moment&#039;s hesitation the second I put her plate in front of her. I didn&#039;t even have time to grab her a fork. She took the plate in both hands, held it in the air, and let the pile of eggs just slide into her impressively, frighteningly huge mouth. If I had blinked I would&#039;ve have missed it. To be honest, I wished I had missed it. Seeing that gaping maw and fangs bigger than my fingers gave me the willies.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Uh, okay,&quot; I said as she gently put the plate down and looked at me, her forked tongue flicking past her lips, &quot;that took less time than I thought.&quot; I was left a little disappointed. I had been expecting her to slowly pick away at her plate with a fork, with me sitting at the opposite end of the table maybe trying to make conversation with some simple questions that wouldn&#039;t need more than a nod or shake of her head. I never even got to sit down. Maybe next time. If there was a next time, anyway. I still wasn&#039;t sure where this whole situation was going. Was she here for another dine and dash or did she come back for something a little longer term?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Well then, if you&#039;re satisfied, you can follow me to the basement and I&#039;ll do what I can for your wounds.&quot; I turned to make my way towards the basement stairs off the foyer, and I heard movement behind me,  like someone shuffling a heavy mat across the floor. Knowing she was there and hearing her move quickly to stay behind me set off the most primal, animalistic parts of my brain. In that moment I felt like the rabbit again, knowing the predator was there but unable to see it, wondering when it would strike. My heart quickened, my breath caught in my throat, and I damn near felt like I was about to have what I assumed to be a panic attack for the first time in my life. I was suddenly, inexplicably weak and short of breath, my chest seized by fears I didn&#039;t know how to suppress. I was forced to reach out and steady myself by leaning against the wall, nearly panting to catch my breath. I stayed there for a few moments, struggling to regain my composure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Imagine my surprise to see her face in my peripheral vision, her blood-red eyes and their slitted pupils a bit wider than normal and assessing my condition. Was it concern? Or maybe she hoped I was about to kick the bucket and the house would be hers?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;m fine, I&#039;m fine,&quot; I managed to stammer, feeling my way down the stair well. She followed me down a little more closely than before, maybe expecting to catch me if I fell. In all honesty it just made me a little more uncomfortable but I did my best not to let it bother me. We hit the bottom step and the motion-sensing lights came on. Still leaning a bit, I felt the wooden wall of the staircase transition into concrete, old and pitted. I paused for just a moment to finish collecting myself, then made my way to the opposite end of the basement, where a large table waited. On the way I grabbed three of the homemade first aid kits, an actual first aid kit, and a few vacuum-packed bags of surgical instruments.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hop up here and lie back,&quot; I said, patting the table. When I heard no movement I turned and saw her looking questionably at the bags in my hand. They were entirely plastic, with a solid white back and a translucent blue front that allowed one to see which instruments were inside. There was otherwise nothing remarkable about them that might draw such scrutiny. &quot;What&#039;s wrong?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She pointed at me, then used both hands to press a finger to either side of her head. She drew both fingers down an imaginary line that met in the center of her chest, where she then pat against her body to produce a rhythmic thumping that sounded a lot like a human heartbeat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I was a bit dumbfounded, at first. Heartbeat. Lines to either side of her head, like where ears might -- &quot;A stethoscope?&quot; She nodded and held her hands out, as if expecting more out of me. What would a stethoscope have to do with any of this? Why would I need one? Then I got to thinking who might wear one. &quot;A doctor? Are you trying to ask if I&#039;m a doctor?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Another timid nod, as if she were afraid of my answer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;No, I&#039;m not,&quot; I said, opening the real first aid kit and putting on the gloves found within, &quot;but I&#039;ve done this before. Not as many pellets, though. Trust me.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She didn&#039;t look all too satisfied with my answer, but I couldn&#039;t tell how much of that was her normal expression and how much of it was anxiety. Either way, she did as instructed and draped her upper body across the table, leaving most of her tail end beneath the table. I pulled up a chair and sat down before ripping open the instrument pack.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;If you used the alcohol I gave you the night we met, you know how much this is going to hurt. Are you ready?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She hesitated, but gave me her okay. I switched on the flashlight, splashed the forceps with alcohol, and set to work.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The injuries looked pretty good, as far as gunshots go. Many of them showed signs of advanced healing, which seemed strange given that she was shot about two weeks ago, two and a half at the most, if the timeline from those three men was accurate. Wounds such as hers should not look as good as they did this soon after occurring. In all I counted thirty-eight of them, eight of which still had pellets inside, two of which looked like they might need to be dug out. I guess the other pellets had all fallen out already; the empty wounds were not deep at all, indicating either her scales were harder or thicker than they appeared or that her assailants shot at her from well outside effective range.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I started with the ones easiest to reach first. They couldn&#039;t have been less than an inch or so in her flesh -- easy to reach with the long forceps I had. Still, I exercised as much caution as possible to avoid causing even more trauma or undue discomfort. The fiery sting of alcohol was enough to bear already, judging by her twitching, and the constant flicking of her tail. I had to be extra careful; sometimes her tail would whack against the legs of the table as I worked, startling me. One by one, the pellets came out. I had no dish for them so I just let them fall to the concrete floor with a soft, tiny click. Sort of like chicken feed hitting the aluminum bucket.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her silence was beginning to unnerve me. I didn&#039;t know if I was doing a good job or not. Even if I was doing poorly, would she show weakness by grimacing or hissing? Maybe she was like me; unsure of how to handle the situation, unsure of who was the threat to whom, and so she always thought to put on a strong facade. Either way, I didn&#039;t like the quiet, so I broke it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;My granddad -- you know, my father&#039;s father -- he and grandma built this house with their own hands way back when, before I was even born. He was a veterinarian. Took care of animals, I mean. That&#039;s where these instruments come from. He mostly took care of his own -- he used to have a couple cows, a horse, various other little critters.&quot; I pried out another pellet; her tail shifted angrily but her expression was unchanged. &quot;As weird as it seemed, he was also an avid fowl hunter. He and dad would sometimes go duck hunting in the marshlands that used to be a a few hours&#039; drive north. I went out there with them once, when I was old enough. It was great -- me, dad, and his dad -- three generations out for some bonding. Well, the day was spoiled pretty much the moment we got there. We found a duck another hunter had left. We didn&#039;t know why, maybe he couldn&#039;t find it after downing it or something -- but it appeared sort of okay. It was up and walking, quacking up a storm, but it just couldn&#039;t fly.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The last of the easy pellets was free, and I wiped down the forceps with alcohol-soaked gauze. Her blood on my hands was impossible to ignore; it was just as slick and warm as human blood, made different only by the golden yellow color. Fresh blood out of her agitated wounds was brighter. I saw her looking at me as I slid my fingers together and became embarrassed for some reason, then got back to work on the first of the deeper ones. &quot;It looked like the duck suffered a graze. The wing was torn up pretty bad, and there were entry wounds along the same side of the body. Dad wasn&#039;t about to let that spoil his day, but granddad was pretty upset. We ended up driving all the way back here, and I watched him pull every last pellet he could out of this bird. Dad told me that bird ended up living here. Even had a little pool built just for it. Ended up dying of old age.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I probed deeper with the forceps and felt the ends tap against a pellet. It was a careful business, using the forceps as an extension of my sense of touch and gauging where the edges of the pellet were, then firmly grasping it with the instrument and dragging it out. It was easy to tell this wound was worse because it appeared more inflamed, and her response to my touching was more pronounced. While digging this one out, I believe she may have mistook my leg for a table leg and squeezed pretty damn hard. She only realized when I said &#039;ouch&#039; and then my leg was free.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I watched my granddad the whole time as he picked out the birdshot. I thought it was pretty fascinating, you know?  And it was a good thing, too, because I ended up having to do this same thing for my brother way back when, when it was just us here.&quot; I grabbed hold of the second pellet, probably about two inches into her flesh, and gently began to pull it to the surface. Her tail slapped the wall so hard that even with her weight atop of it, she moved the table a good couple inches. I had to readjust to get a firm grip on the shot again, which just made her have to endure the poking and prodding a second time. A rivulet of yellow blood spilled out, staining the table, but with it came the last remnant of her attack. It fell to the ground with the others. I&#039;d pick them up later.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;That was the last one. I, uh -- I don&#039;t know if you want me to stitch them up? I don&#039;t have suture materials. Not to mention I don&#039;t know if a suture needle would get through the scales--&quot; She cut me off by holding up one of her hands, then relaxed again, breathing a little heavier than before. I guessed that was a no to the sutures. Not that it mattered anyway. I cleaned up what little blood had spilled down her side, wiping gently to not irritate the wounds -- or her -- any further.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She slowly sat up pressing one of her hands against her side as she did, and slid off the table in a singular motion, using her tail to support everything she did. She took a look down at my leg, then looked me right in the eye and bowed her head at me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yeah. You&#039;re -- you&#039;re welcome. Are you able to move okay? Yeah? All right, we can head back upstairs. I&#039;ll show you to your room. I mean, if you want a room. You&#039;re welcome to stay if you like, is what I&#039;m trying to say.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her eyes widened and she gave an me an energetic nod. I smiled at her, partly due to the nature of her answer, and partly just to see how it felt. Smiling seemed like such a human thing. Did it have the same meaning for aliens? If not, did they at least understand its significance? I hadn&#039;t done it in a long time, not even to the three humans that had shown up the other day. I&#039;ve just been on guard for ages, and to feel vulnerable again, to have let someone in my life literally and figuratively felt terrifying. Like at any moment the rug could be pulled out from under me and all this effort would be for nothing. I heard that awful whispering in the back of my mind saying this would be a mistake -- this longing to reconnect to someone, anyone at this point, would just be a long journey that ultimately proved why I shouldn&#039;t want to reconnect to anyone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I didn&#039;t want to think like that anymore. So I just smiled to try it out. In truth, it felt good.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She followed me to the ground floor, then up the stairs to the second floor. I showed her my brother&#039;s old room. Everything was unchanged since he had left; his clothes were still in the bureau. His pre-invasion sports posters still decorated the walls. Some plastic models of tanks and fighter jets lay scattered about the various bookshelves. She rushed right in and made herself at home on the bed, curling up as much of herself as she could beneath the heavy blanket. A few feet of her tail hung off the side, though, and she&#039;d probably get a few drops of blood on the sheets, but I could change them later. Before I left I showed her how to use the lock on the door in case she wanted privacy, but she was already comfortably settled and felt no inclination to get up to test the lock.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;ll wake you for dinner, if you&#039;re not up already.&quot; She nodded again, but before I closed the door, something else came to mind. &quot;Can I ask you something?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She waited, leaning towards me slightly as if to say she was listening.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Do you have a name? I mean -- hang on, that came off sort of rude. Let me start over on that. My name&#039;s Liam. What&#039;s yours?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her eyes fell to the floor and even with that natural scowl of hers, it seemed apparent she had something heavy on her mind. Slowly, she reached over with her right hand to the piece of shiny metal armor on her left arm. It split along a single seam and she slid it down her arm. She pointed at something on the inside, then grabbed it with her tail, which she snaked over to hand the armor to me. It was impossibly smooth in my hands and black, but so shiny it looked almost like silver. Up close I could see what she had pointed at, and it made my heart sink.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I only knew of the ADVENT language what I had seen on television, which was to say not a lot. But still, I knew enough to tell that the jumble of letters and numbers on the inside of her armor piece were entirely meaningless with regards to any syntax, let alone a name. It was a designation -- not a name. At the very end was a soul-crushing representation of everything she was and ever would be worth to her former masters: a barcode. The entirety of someone&#039;s life, able to be read by a handheld scanner. Something to be picked off of a shelf, consumed, and tossed away. Any fear left inside of me just gave way, replaced by overwhelming pity.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I put it as bluntly as I could. &quot;You know this isn&#039;t a name, right? This may have been how you were known then, but it isn&#039;t now. It shouldn&#039;t be, anyway. Do you want a name?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A hesitant, uncertain nod, but it was a yes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Viper, viper, viper...Vicky? Nah, mean old neighbor lady pre-invasion. Victoria? Probably a bad sentiment there, she was an ex from high school. I knew a Violet but she died in a car accident; that seemed like some bad luck to put on my guest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I had that itch in the back of my mind that usually told me I was overthinking, and reached up in vain to scratch it away. It seemed so dumb that every name I came up with had to start with a &#039;v&#039;, but I guess it was just one of those idiosyncrasies of the human mind, always trying to make patterns and and connections. The catalog of names in my head that started with &#039;v&#039; was short, so I thought screw it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Well, what about &#039;Vee&#039; for now?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She cocked her head at me, as though considering it. I saw her shift her jaw side to side, as if she was moving the name around her mouth, maybe testing it out in her imagination. But then I saw her jaw move a little more, the bottom lip curled inward as if preparing to make a sound, and she breathed -- not spoke -- the name back to me in a voice that seemed to know English sounds but was uncomfortable saying them. &quot;Vee.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">My heart jumped; so she could speak. Maybe it was hard for her to make human sounds, but it brought back the hope that maybe some day we actually could carry on a back and forth. &quot;Yeah! Yeah, that&#039;s it. I mean, you don&#039;t have to keep it. My grandma had a book of baby names in the house somewhere. I think I could find it for you if you like. I&#039;ll have it on the table when dinner&#039;s ready and you can find a name you might like better.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Vee.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I laughed. &quot;All right, then. Get some rest. Like I said, I&#039;ll let you know when dinner&#039;s ready.&quot; I watched her through the shrinking crack of the doorway curl up even tighter, shoving her head beneath the covers and settling into the place. The only part left of her I could see was a few feet of her tail hanging off the edge of the bed and spilling out from the covers onto the floor. The door clicked shut.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As I made my way back downstairs, my smile was so wide it made my face hurt. Alone no more. Please let her stay. I&#039;ll try to learn some ADVENT, I&#039;ll teach her English, I don&#039;t care what I have to do -- just please let her stay.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">-Chapter 4-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I had dinner all set before I even bothered heading upstairs; eggs and potatoes, same as ever. Very rarely would I get to enjoy actual meat, and potatoes were some of the only vegetables that would grow. I sometimes got lucky with carrots, tomatoes, and peas, but it was a total crap-shoot even when I planted at the right time of year. The cities looked nice and clean on television, but everybody seemed to have conveniently forgotten the dust, grime, and rubble that polluted the air and earth these days even this long after the invasion. The soil has gotten worse as time has gone on. I imagined it&#039;s the same everywhere else, and I doubt ADVENT even cared. After all, one of their objectives was population consolidation and control. I had figured that out when they started banning all livestock. Control the food, control the people. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hey, Vee.&quot; I paused in front of her door and knocked twice, giving her some long moments to protest or lock it. When nothing happened, I slowly cracked the door to have a peek inside. The covers looked like they were hiding a small boulder that gradually began to stir the further I let myself in. Her face slowly rose from underneath the sheets, followed by her hood, neck, and body; not unlike one of those stereotypical snake charming cartoons from way back when. She locked her hands in front of her and thrust her arms all the way out in a good stretch, then took what I guessed was a great big yawn, complete with a quiet hissing. Even as friendly as things seemed between us for the moment, I couldn&#039;t stop my brain from throwing up red flags upon seeing that huge mouth of hers wide open, white fangs clearly visible.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You&#039;ve been sleeping for a while. It&#039;s just past nine. Or, uh, 2100 hours for you soldier types.&quot; Her eyes widened a bit with mild surprise. She seemingly fell out of bed; her upper body was almost entirely over the edge before her tail end slipped out from the covers and gracefully stopped her fall. The entire motion looked as if someone had poured her out of bed tail-first.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I stepped aside to let her past. Her wounds were already looking better. Some of them had already shut entirely, leaving only minor scars. I didn&#039;t know whether such rapid healing was natural to her species or if it was ADVENT technology. They used to talk up gene clinics on the television all the time; cure cancer, congenital defects, other diseases. I don&#039;t see why they couldn&#039;t give their soldiers fast healing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I followed her downstairs. She remembered where the kitchen was and made a beeline for it, sliding around the edge of the table to one of the plates still softly steaming. Something in the back of my mind told me to ask her to wait, but I could only wish I had paid it any attention as she completely emptied her plate before I could even sit down. I had only just begun to plant my butt into a chair when she noticed the book of names I had found in the master bedroom, hidden beneath the bed among a treasure trove of artifacts from the good old days: children&#039;s books, doodles my brother and I had done, old birthday and get-well-soon cards addressed to our grandparents.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She looked thoughtfully at it, finally deciding to flip it open and skim through a handful of pages while downing the glass of water beside her empty plate in a single swig. I picked at my food but devoted most of my attention to watch her. She seemed only half-interested, never spending much time on any page before moving onto the next. Once or twice she would drag a finger down across a page, tap a dark claw against whatever it was that caught her attention, but then she&#039;d move on as if whatever had made her stop in the first place had never been interesting at all. She only bothered to look through the book for five minutes or so, then shut it and pushed it aside before taking in her surroundings.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;So then you&#039;re happy with just Vee?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She made her way into the living room, taking a moment to nod at me over her shoulder. She stopped in front of the television, cocking her head at it and then looking around. I had half a mind to tell her how it worked, but I was reminded how foolish that was when she found the remote and began hitting buttons. Despite my own isolation, I had to keep telling myself these aliens had been out and about on Earth for the past twenty years. They must have been intimately familiar with all the little technological comforts humanity had: radios, televisions, computers, whatever -- and that&#039;s not even mentioning all the high-tech stuff I&#039;m sure they brought with them. I doubted I would have to tell Vee how to use anything; she would know or be smart enough to figure it out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Sure enough, she managed to get the television on and she sat back on the couch, coiling her tail beneath her as she watched. It was an old 37-inch CRT my grandparents had bought, thinking they were modernizing. In truth, they got it because it was cheapened by the arrival of affordable flat-screens around the early 2000s. It&#039;s only lasted so long because it hardly ever got any use. It looked sleek for its time, but now it was just a big grey box that only got two channels: the big 24/7 former ADVENT news station that had now been repurposed by the resistance, and a year-long-running pirate broadcast that played nothing but old black-and-whites. I guess tracking down the latter was never high up on ADVENT&#039;s priority list once the resistance started making bigger and bigger waves.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I didn&#039;t feel like eating alone, so I took my plate and glass into the living room and sat down on the recliner beside the couch, making sure to step over her tail as I walked by the center table. She flipped through both channels, then quickly went back to the news, which was now talking about something called the &#039;psionic network&#039;. I listened as I ate. I had heard it mentioned once or twice before, but the name was about all I knew. Vee appeared rapt, however, her eyes glued to the screen while she languidly sprawled across the entire couch, leaving much of her tail hanging off of the far side. The way she sometimes moved her body while keeping her head still reminded me of a chicken.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;As resistance forces penetrate deeper and deeper into the defunct ADVENT network,&quot; said the field reporter, his face covered by a half-mask presumably meant to shield him from the smoke of the hellish scene behind him, &quot;there appears to be mounting evidence worldwide that the psionic network -- used by ADVENT to communicate with its forces -- was in fact an insidious method of mental influence. Retributive campaigns across the globe have come across startlingly ineffective opposition, raising the question of whether or not the aliens know how to fight without their masters, or whether they even want to fight at all. Under the condition of anonymity, a resistance cell member spoke to us, saying, &#039;it&#039;s like they&#039;re all confused. They don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on. Nobody&#039;s pulling their strings anymore&#039;. His claims appear to be backed up by numbers from X-COM itself, showing a sharp rise in alien detainees and concurrent drop in human casualties across the globe.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vee sighed. At least, it sounded like a sigh. Maybe a hiss was the same as a sigh. I had no clue. Either way, afterwards she looked as if someone had lifted a weight from her shoulders. She sat up just a little straighter, her tongue darting rapidly as the report went on. The news had caught my interest now, as well. So what was being said? The aliens were slaves? That the enforcers were themselves being forced?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Even now, there is a growing schism within resistance forces. An increasing number of fighters are advocating for attempts at rehabilitation, citing reports of some aliens striving to protect humans from the more violent of their kind, and of a place called City 31, where aliens and hybrids are allegedly being offered sanctuary among the primarily human population. We have been unable to gain access to this city, as thanks to its newfound publicity it has temporarily shut down all access in an attempt to keep out those who would seek to do harm. Other groups say to maintain the status quo and continue the campaign of extermination, that eliminating alien forces while they are seemingly disoriented is the way to permanent victory. For now it seems those wishing for extermination have the momentum, but for how long?  We just don&#039;t know. Daryl Weller, Resistance News Network.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The reporter cut away to one of the anchormen, who was interviewing someone that suddenly seemed unimportant in the wake of this new information. So all of the soldiers -- troopers, the vipers, the tall grinning ones with big eyes, everybody -- they were all forced labor?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Was that you, Vee? Was that your life?&quot; She spared me a quick glance, nothing more than an acknowledgement that she had heard me. After a moment&#039;s thought she looked again, her gaze lingering, and she slowly nodded. I finished the last of my dinner and asked, &quot;What did it feel like?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her eyes wandered aimlessly around the room as she struggled with her thoughts. I had probably asked a question that required too complex of an answer given her apparent difficulty in making english sounds. I suppose she gave up because she just looked around one last time and shrugged, but then must have had some idea because her face lit up. She grabbed an old wind-up alarm clock from the table -- another of my grandparent&#039;s relics -- and wound the mechanism over and over before setting it on the table. A moment later and it began its irritating ringing. Vee held a hand out to it, as though it were representative of her thoughts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I didn&#039;t quite understand what she was trying to tell me. Was it an irritating ringing in her head that told her to do this or that? Or was she just some sort of wind-up automaton that acted only when permitted by the Elders? Maybe the ringing was always there, and doing what she was told would lessen or eliminate it entirely. She must have seen my lack of understanding, the look of clueless thought on my face, because she just shrugged and left it at that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I slapped the reset atop the ringer. &quot;Well, you belong to nobody now. You&#039;re welcome to stay for as long as you like,&quot; I said, though my heart sank at the mere thought of her leaving.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Then immediately perked up again when I thought I saw what looked to be a hint of a smile. It was strange and different, but there was an unmistakable pull at the corners of her mouth. Maybe it really was a smile. Maybe it was some alien facial expression that was a smile-analogue, or maybe it was something else entirely, but it definitely looked like the start of a smile. It faded quickly and she instead bowed her head to me again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yeah, sure. Don&#039;t mention it.&quot; I put my dish on the accent table beside the recliner and sat back to see her pointing. &quot;What? Me? What about me?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She nodded, then started to look around again. She zeroed in on the wind-up clock again. Grabbing it, she took a moment to check the time in the corner of the newscast and then set it on the clock and showed it to me; 9:57. She then wound it back one hour and showed it to me again. She could tell I was thinking it over, so she repeated it several more times, winding it forward and back, forward and back, each time hoping what she was trying to say would click in my brain. Current time. Past. Current. Past. Past and present.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;My past? You want to know about me?&quot; She held her hands out as if expecting more. &quot;There&#039;s not a whole lot to me, I&#039;m afraid. I was born in Tennessee before the invasion, been here my whole life, and -- &quot; I stopped she she looked a little confused. &quot;Tennessee. It&#039;s a state. It used to be anyway, before ADVENT divvied up the country into three zones. Last time I saw a map on the television, it looked like this house was just outside the border of the, uh -- what do you call it -- I think I heard it referred to as the Eastern United States Trade Zone, or something else just as long-winded. Grew up pretty normal, went to school, fell into coding and programming, thought I was going to make a pretty good computer engineer or something before the invasion happened. Parents brought me and my brother out here once aliens started landing, and I&#039;ve been here since.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She pointed past me this time, and I followed her finger to an old family photo sitting atop a dusty bookshelf in the far corner of the room. My parents smiled, each with their hands on their sons&#039; shoulders. My grandparents stood on either side, smiling just as widely. I don&#039;t know why, but I think when that picture was taken -- that was when I first realized how old my grandparents were. How they wouldn&#039;t be around forever, how we had to try and make the good times last. Turns out they wouldn&#039;t last for much longer after that picture was taken.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;My family,&quot; I said as she made a grabbing motion. I handed it to her for a closer look. &quot;My mom and dad, dad&#039;s parents on the sides, and me and my brother are the short ones. I&#039;m the one with in the striped shirt. Grandparents never made it out here, and mom and dad died defending us.&quot; She waited for more, but when I kept quiet she tapped a claw against my brother&#039;s face. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I hesitated, something that drew her in even more. I didn&#039;t know whether or not to be honest about him. It wasn&#039;t only that I had little to say about him -- what if she harbored a grudge against the resistance and anyone even loosely associated with it? Even though I haven&#039;t seen him in so long, his decision might influence her attitude against me in some way. On the other hand, I was never a good liar, and being apart from other people for so long has surely made that even more noticeable. If I were to lie now, she would probably be able to tell. And then what questions might plague her? Why would I lie? What was I hiding?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I relented. &quot;He left eight years ago to join the resistance. Haven&#039;t seen him since then, and I don&#039;t even know if he&#039;s alive.&quot; She looked at the picture a little harder, and I started to wonder if she had run into him before. But she only shrugged and handed the photo back to me. This time, I pointed at her. &quot;What about you? What&#039;s in your past?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She held her hands apart with only a short distance between them; not much, she seemed to be saying. She went back to the kitchen, fished something about of the garbage can, and slithered back to her seat to show me. In her hands she held two halves of a broken egg I had made for dinner. She held them together and broke them apart several times to make sure I understood. I did, and she must have seen it in my eyes because she moved onto the next part of her life -- signified by finger guns.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You were hatched and then...they made you start fighting? Or they taught you to fight?&quot; She energetically pointed at me upon my second guess. &quot;How long ago were you hatched?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She thrust up two fingers and then a balled up fist. She was just twenty years old. That was when I realized she was only as old as the invasion. The horrible thought crossed my mind that she had been hatched specifically to fight a war. Hell, she had probably been born right here on Earth. She had not been a soldier by unfortunate circumstance, some poor child born at just the wrong time to be drafted to take part in a planetary occupation, who might&#039;ve led a normal life under different circumstances. No, her life had been laid out by the Elders well before she had ever been born. They had envisioned a soldier, and a soldier is what they had made. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Only now the war was over, and there were no more masters.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Well, nobody is going to force you to fight anymore, so what you do from here on out is for you to decide,&quot; I told her, getting up to wash my dish in the sink. I collected hers from the table as I passed it by. &quot;I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve heard it before, but there&#039;s an old saying: tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As I washed the dishes I threw a glance over my shoulder to see her looking at the floor, her hands folded in her lap. Or, I guess it would be her lap, since she had a tail instead of legs. I quietly chuckled to myself; she was more human than she knew, or perhaps the daunting prospect of figuring out one&#039;s purpose is a universal challenge that all intelligent beings grapple with.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Don&#039;t think so hard about it. You just sort of -- you know, take it day by day. I&#039;ll tell you what,&quot; I said as she looked up at me, &quot;go get yourself cleaned up. You&#039;ve been here a day, you must have been on the run for a couple weeks at the last. If you like there&#039;s a full bathroom across from the room you&#039;re staying--&quot; I stopped. That sounded wrong, so I tried again. &quot;Across from your room, I mean. Take a shower and get cleaned up. You&#039;ll feel better. Trust me.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She seemed to lighten up at the thought. Out there for as long as she was, she must have had a ton of grime between those scales of hers. I knew for a fact the only running water nearby was a small stream to the east, but the water wasn&#039;t exactly what I would call clean. I might&#039;ve used it to soak a rag and wipe my forehead or cool my neck, but I would never have submerged myself it in, nor used it near my eyes or mouth without boiling it for longer than usual. Even if she had found it during her escape, I doubted it would have made much difference. Clean water, though, could be therapeutic. Wash away the grit and grime, and sometimes wash away the weight of the day and the challenges it may have brought.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;There&#039;s towels already in there and the left knob is hot water,&quot; I said as she slid upstairs, &quot;but go easy on it. It never lasts as long as you want it to. The dresser in your room is chock full of clothes. My brother was sort of a tank of a man; as big as they are, I don&#039;t know if any of his shirts will fit over your hood. You may have to stretch or tear one, that&#039;s fine. If you need anything else, I&#039;ll still be up for a little while longer. I&#039;ve got to check the server in the basement, make sure the updates I fed it a few days ago are sticking. After that I&#039;ll head to bed.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She disappeared, and I continued to clean up. I had the dishes done and had just begun to package the left-overs when I heard the muffled roar of water rushing through the pipes, quickly followed by the patter of water. Next there were a series of heavy thuds that made me wince; I surmised she must have removed her armor pieces and they might have left a few dents in the tile with how heavy they sounded. I quickly decided it didn&#039;t matter in the least next to this indescribable relief I felt.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Relative to the deathly silence of living alone, this was an absolute delightful commotion. I couldn&#039;t have been happier. Doing some simple chores while another part of the house was noisy with life made the house feel lived in, instead of it simply being a place that I happened to live in. A part of me I had nearly forgotten slowly came to life again; a feeling I hadn&#039;t experienced since the last happy moment my brother and I had shared who knew how long ago. The rational side of my brain was shouting at me -- don&#039;t get attached, don&#039;t expect her here tomorrow, don&#039;t share so much of yourself -- but next to the racket I heard upstairs, it may as well have been barely a whisper.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">-Chapter 5-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I woke up feeling refreshed and well-rested for the first time in days. No hazy dreams that felt like hallucinations, no frustrating teasing of what it meant to belong to a bigger picture anymore -- just a deep, satisfying slumber. I slapped my alarm clock, then realized it was already silent. I had woken up five minutes early. Didn&#039;t matter to me. I cancelled the alarm, got dressed, and walked out into the hall.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vee&#039;s door was already open, though the room was still dark. I softly called her name but got no response, so I flicked the light on. The bed was neatly made, and some of the dresser drawers were open with a few unfolded shirts scattered inside. A sinking feeling in my gut began to spoil my good morning, but it was then I saw her armor methodically arranged in the corner of the room. The chest piece leaned against the wall, its oddly-shaped and segmented tail piece stretching out further onto the floor, while the segments that covered the top of her hood and neck seemed to fold down into the armor piece itself. The arms were arranged on each side, leaning against the chest. My gut-wrenching worry ebbed; if she had left, surely she would have taken her armor with her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I heard noise as I approached the top of the stairs, noise that became clearer as I descended; it was the television. I came down to find Vee curled up in front of the screen, close enough to make me think of all the times my parents had told me to sit back, lest I ruined my eyes. She was surrounded by a handful of books, all arranged around her such that she needed only turn her head to read any of them. I slowly crept up to take a peek and saw they were dictionaries, encyclopedias, and even a few children&#039;s books. She had to have gotten them from the bookcase in the corner, in front of which sat another pile taken from the shelves. Grandma never could let go of our kid stuff.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She was wearing one of my brother&#039;s old t-shirts; one of his favorites during his teenage metal phase -- influenced by dad, of course. The Metallica logo was emblazoned across the front in that ubiquitous chrome-looking font that seemed to grace every piece of branded clothing from around dad&#039;s time. In the television&#039;s soft glow I could see a few stretch marks around the neck. She must have fought with it a little bit to fit it over her hood but in all, the shirt seemed no worse for wear. It hung loosely on her chest and torso while her arms appeared unable to fully fill out the sleeves. Despite her overall size, I guess her upper body was just a bit smaller than my brother&#039;s.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You been up long?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said with a short hiss on the end, refusing to pull her attention from the screen. Her gaze seemed fixed on the mouth of whatever pundit was currently on-screen. She wasn&#039;t paying attention to headlines or the scrolling ticker at the bottom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I had been expecting a nod. Her answer caught me by complete surprise and left me momentarily stunned. &quot;You can talk now?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Better. Learn.&quot; She used her tail to spin some of the children&#039;s books to face me. One of which I recognized on closer inspection; my grandmother had used it to teach me how to speak more clearly as a young man. It had complex words for a child, along with some cut-away drawings of a person&#039;s mouth making the required sounds. Whether the tongue was pressing on the roof of the mouth or back of the teeth, what shape the lips should take -- it showed things like that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;So, how&#039;s it going?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She pointed at the talking head, her natural scowl shifting to a merely frustrated frown. &quot;Speaks fast.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I felt bad in that moment, like I had the upper hand in a one-sided relationship. A friendship was built on compromise and effort, neither of which I felt like I was putting forth. It shouldn&#039;t have been all on Vee to bridge the communication gap between us. &quot;I can learn more ADVENT. I know a little bit already from what used to be on the news--&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;ADVENT. Not mine,&quot; she stuttered. Each syllable was slow and very carefully thought out, as though she had to construct the word in her mouth before it made its way past her lips. Her speech was breathy and forced, as though she was exhaling every word instead of speaking it. It seemed she had an issue with hard consonants, specifically ones that required the tongue pressed against a full set of teeth. She could adapt, but it would require practice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Oh. So then, what&#039;s your language? Could I learn it?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Dowd. Full. Dowd -- doubt,&quot; she said, finally managing to get the hard &#039;t&#039; sound. &quot;Doubt. Full.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;All right then,&quot; I said, turning the books she had moved back around to face her, &quot;is there anything I can do to help?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vee looked at the television disapprovingly, then spun the coils of her body, shifting around to face me. She picked the dictionary up off the floor, handed it to me, and said &quot;Talk slow.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I started reading words at random. I felt like a fool, to be honest; a natural speaker&#039;s reaction to a non-native is usually to talk slowly, but I had always thought it was a useless gesture. Speaking English slowly to someone that did not understand English would not make things easier on them. Her issue was not one of understanding, however -- based on the ease with which she understood me, it was clear she had a good vocabulary. Her sole issue was vocalization. With a vastly different tongue and mouth, she would have to move them in slightly different ways to produce the same sounds as me. So for about the next hour, she just sat and watched -- maybe a little too close for comfort, not that I would say anything -- as I read from the dictionary. She asked me to repeat almost every word several times, not for lack of understanding but for getting a handle on what my mouth was doing. She would dissect each syllable into its component sounds, deconstructing difficult words piecemeal until she was able to string together each syllable almost as naturally as a native speaker.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She would copy as best she could, and I would attempt to explain what it was my tongue was doing behind my lips as I pronounced this syllable or that. I wasn&#039;t a great teacher, but it was obvious she was an excellent student. I began to suspect that her intelligence was not just equal to mine, but greater. If not in general than certainly with respect to language. I had Spanish-speaking friends during my middle- and high-school years for long enough to understand some of the vocabulary, but I was never able to sloppily string together more than a few words, even after a few classes. But here she was merely watching me speak and already she was getting a grasp on the specifics.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I would have been happy to sit there all day and help her, but when I glanced at the television and saw what time it was, I had to stop. The chickens were probably getting ornery. Ever since Vee&#039;s first visit their feeding times have been more and more inconsistent. I let her know and she shut off the television, slid all of the books -- still open to whatever page they were on -- to one side of the room, and uncoiled herself to follow me outside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We made our way to the chicken coop and I showed her how to read the display panel and all of its read-outs: temperature, water, air flow, humidity. Each of them had an acceptable range, and so long as the values were in those ranges, no changes were needed. While I was talking she quickly devised how to work the feed dispenser and filled the bucket up, then tried to hand it off to me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Be my guest,&quot; I said. She looked uneasily at the door. &quot;Don&#039;t worry about it. They&#039;re chickens. They&#039;ve got short memories, and whoever&#039;s got the food is their best friend. Just head on in, grab handfuls of the stuff and throw it around in little piles.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Of course I was right. The chickens didn&#039;t care one bit and seemed to have entirely forgotten the night they had met Vee, silently cowering in the corner as she and I had shared our tense initial greeting. Vee scooped out giant handfuls of feed and drew lines on the ground with it, observing with intense interest how the chickens would follow whatever shapes she created. It almost looked as if she was having fun. Usually her movements appeared reserved and calculated -- perhaps to avoid startling me or something -- but here she was lively and quick. I couldn&#039;t tell if she was trying to keep beaks and talons away from her tail or if she was just enjoying herself. She went back to being careful and slow around the chicks, though. I guess she was afraid of hurting them, small as they were.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">In short order the feed was all on the ground and we moved on, with me explaining that I liked to get most of my daily routine out of the way in the morning so I wouldn&#039;t be out during the hottest part of the day. We circled around to the back of the house, where I had some water barrels and my garden directly adjacent to them. The barrels were mostly empty -- it hadn&#039;t rained for about two weeks, so I was sparingly using reserves and the well -- but had more than enough in them to fill the pressure-pump container I used to water the garden. Vee seemed curious again, so I talked her through it, even as simple as it was. I didn&#039;t want to drown the plants; a simple drizzle would do, enough to wet the leaves and soak the dirt.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She gently took the pump from my hands and followed my lead, doing as I had done. As she worked I saw she would often steal quick glances my way, and when I would notice she would immediately turn her attention back to the task at hand. Her hesitant nature triggered a bothersome feeling I couldn&#039;t shake. Was she waiting for something? Did she want me to say good job, keep it up, you&#039;re doing great -- did she want approval? For what possible reason? My thoughts wormed their way into some dark places that I didn&#039;t like in the least.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Vee,&quot; I said, waiting for her to look at me, &quot;I&#039;m not going to say no to help around the house. I just want you to know my good will towards you does not hinge on you being useful to me. You get what I&#039;m saying?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She straightened up immediately, towering over me, and that natural scowl of hers cracked and softened into a blank stare that sure looked to me like shock. I wasn&#039;t certain if it was, but I knew I had caught her off guard. She had that deer-in-headlights look about her. She stood frozen to the spot for some moments, barely so much as swaying in the wind, before offering a timid nod.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;m just happy to have somebody -- anybody around,&quot; I said, looking down to kick the dirt. Admitting the obvious after almost a decade still took a chunk out of my pride. I spent all that time thinking I was some kind of strong for isolating myself -- that I didn&#039;t need anyone else, that I could take care of myself, that I could somehow outlast the horrors of alien occupation. Maybe I was in some way to have lasted as long as I did, but I guess I was also kind of stupid for thinking there&#039;d be no downsides, no side-effects. Even now, like termites constantly eating away at my insides, I still had the cavernous pit at the bottom of my gut and the persistent whispering in the back of my mind that made me wonder if I was weak for wanting to socialize again. I wondered when -- if ever -- I would get the chance to prove that side of me wrong. &quot;Being alone sucks, to be honest.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her posture slackened and her movements thereafter were carefree and languid, as if she were made of liquid. She must have felt like a freeloader all this time, afraid at any second I&#039;d just kick her out. Which itself was a funny thought; she was stronger than me in every way. I know from experience that people pushed too far in survival situations will do what they must, and I didn&#039;t feel like testing to see how much she liked me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">After breakfast, she still insisted on helping around the house. We emptied what was left of the water barrels into the reservoir in the basement and set them back outside; it looked like some rain was on the horizon, so that was good. Afterwards I took her to the generator on the opposite side of the house. I had her yank the tarp back to uncover the solar panel and she angled it to best capture the light from the sun, now nearly entirely in the air. I washed some clothes and had her take the ones already on the line down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The rest of the morning was spent doing chores inside. The server needed its daily maintenance, piece of garbage that it was. While I did that she picked up the pellets I had removed from her body last night -- marveling, no doubt, at how primitive a thing as a ball bearing was used as a weapon compared to the high-tech rifles I knew ADVENT had -- and straightened everything out on the shelves. It wasn&#039;t needed but she probably just wanted to look busy. Since we were already in the basement, I took inventory of how much food was left. Now that two people were living here, supplies would dwindle twice as quickly. Once I had the numbers I&#039;d see how much faster we were running through food and water and adjust the daily routines accordingly. Power was never an issue, thanks to the solar generator; it was more than enough to keep a light on or two while running the the various appliances in the house. I could count on one hand the number of times I had mistakenly drained it, and that was before I had learned what the generator&#039;s capabilities were.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We just relaxed for the rest of the day. Our chores done, I joined her in the living room where she had the television on again, but not so much interest in the books. I supposed she had grown tired of the news because she was watching the pirate broadcast -- the one of old black-and-whites. Casablanca, From Here to Eternity, and A Streetcar Named Desire were common reruns, but every few months the channel would run a new one. Currently they were running Frankenstein, which had an iron-grip on Vee&#039;s attention; she seemed more interested in the story than she did in watching how the character&#039;s mouths moved. Did she feel like a made monster, where Earth was the small sleepy village that hated her when all she wanted was to be left alone?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vee pretty much mainlined black-and-whites until dinner. While she was in the middle of Casablanca I made off to the basement to grab something very special from the freezers, which I took to the kitchen and left in a pot of lukewarm water. By the time the movie was over and the next had begun, the bag was mostly defrosted and I began pulling out a few ingredients that I made very sparse use of. Most of my garden space was taken up by essentials, so growing herbs and spices was a luxury I was seldom able to afford myself. I always wanted to expand the garden, but more gardening meant more water usage, so I always held off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I had barely started to prep the meal when I felt her presence behind me, shortly followed by her shadow ominously encroaching upon the kitchen counter, enveloping my workspace. I swore I could hear her tongue going crazy. I guess she used hers to smell, just like Earth snakes did.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Have you ever had chicken before?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;No.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I popped open each container, handing them to Vee for her to smell. &quot;Thyme, rosemary, garlic. Here, I think this one is basil. Or oregano. Shoot, now I&#039;ve got them mixed up. Anyway, any of them you don&#039;t like? Anything smell weird to you?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She went for another round of each, holding them below her face as her tongue lashed in and out. Her upper lip curled just slightly for two. &quot;Thyme. Garlic.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Okay, rosemary and basil it is.&quot; I stripped the leaves of the former from their stems and handed the dried, crumbling basil to Vee. She was unsure of what to do and stood there with a blank stare. &quot;It&#039;s dry because it lasts longer that way. You should just be able to crumble it up with your hands,&quot; I said, using tongs to pull chicken parts out of the bag and placing them on a baking sheet. &quot;Just put it between your hands and roll it like so -- like you&#039;re trying to start a fire with sticks. Do it over the chicken so you&#039;re sprinkling it all over as you go. But wait, before you do that--&quot; I took some leftover vegetable soup broth from the fridge and drizzled some over each piece. it would offer some mild flavor and would make the seasoning stick.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She did as I instructed while I diced the rosemary. She was keen to watch me as I moved the knife with practiced ease. My mother had been the family cook, and she taught the rest of us how to get things done in the kitchen. Dinner was always a family affair back in the day, before and after the invasion. Everybody was always happiest then, with mom running the kitchen like a head chef as the rest of us each manned a station. My brother and I usually dealt with chopping and dicing, while dad was on sauce duty. Mom was always the last one in the kitchen, combining everything we had made while we waited for it all to come together. That was the sole remnant my brother and I had clung to when our parents had died. No matter how much we argued, no matter what disagreement had dominated the day, all of our troubles just melted away in the kitchen, like butter. We might pick up our yelling and shouting afterwards, but dinner was sacred and neither of us wanted to ruin a good meal with any animosity.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The chicken, now sporting a healthy helping of herbs, went into the preheated oven. Vee stared expectantly, her eyes darting to the oven, to me, then back again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Relax. It&#039;ll take a little while. Let&#039;s just go back to the movie and it&#039;ll be done before you know it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Despite my advice, however, it was impossible to ignore the aroma that swept through the house, that seemed to so heavy it threatened to soak into the very walls. My mouth was watering the second I got my first whiff. Vee&#039;s...well, whatever her deal was, she couldn&#039;t keep her attention on the movie; she&#039;d lean back every five seconds to get a better look inside the kitchen, and I could all but hear her thinking &#039;is it done yet&#039; over and over. For her, it was the promise of something new and exciting that she hadn&#039;t even known existed. For me, it was the memories of a happy past that I had done my best to suppress to remind myself being alone wasn&#039;t so bad. I had been successful in doing just that when by myself, but with Vee in the house, those feelings became too much to ignore. It was times like this I realized how easy it was to confuse stoic strength with desolate denial.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The chicken was done after what felt like ages. Vee seemed coiled like a spring, and the moment I sat up she was right there beside me in lockstep -- or lock-slither. Whatever. I had the good sense to set the table before making a plate. Two plates, two forks. Maybe with the utensils out already she&#039;d be more inclined to use them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The chicken was most certainly done, and it could not have been more perfect. The skin was just beginning to turn golden brown, dry enough to have just a hint of crunch but still moist and holding in the flavor of the herbs and broth. They came right off the pan, their resting sides barely darker. We had nearly the whole chicken: two legs, thighs, wings, but just one breast. I had eaten that for my birthday two months ago. I split it up, giving her the lion&#039;s share; she was bigger anyway, never mind the fact I had already had some of the chicken. When she noticed the difference between her plate and mine, she paused.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Less,&quot; she said, pointing at my plate as I sidled past her to sit at the table.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;It&#039;s all right. I had some of my share earlier in the year.&quot; She stood rigidly, her eyes locked onto her plate. &quot;Vee, seriously. I&#039;ll be fine. Enjoy it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Only at my insistence did she finally relent, and she slid on over to the opposite side of the table with her dish. She carefully inspected the mound of chicken in front of her, poking and prodding as her tongue constantly tasted the air. She rubbed away the grease that stuck to her finger, then did it all over again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I watched as she slipped both hands under either side of the plate, and before she could shovel the whole thing into her mouth, I said, &quot;It&#039;ll last a lot longer if you just take little bites. And you don&#039;t want to eat the bones.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She stopped but only looked at the fork, as though still considering her options. Though with unexpected confidence, she picked it up and got right to it. I guess I had been expecting a moment of thought from her, some pause as she figured out what to do. There was, of course, only one way to use a fork, but I just hadn&#039;t expected her to know right away. I supposed it just added the surreality of it all. An alien snake in my house, eating chicken with a fork, while wearing a slightly over-sized Metallica t-shirt, while sitting at the table. With me. The part of my mind that had thought it had worked out long ago what was and wasn&#039;t normal was still trying to figure this one out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her first bite looked almost cathartic, and the overwhelming emotion in her reaction was so obvious I nearly laughed out loud. She savored the first bite for a while, then apparently decided that there was no way to get the rest in her stomach fast enough, and her pace quickened. She ate strangely. Every time she brought a forkful of chicken to her mouth, her forked tongue would slip out and wrap around it before it disappeared inside entirely.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;So, Vee,&quot; I said between bites, &quot;What did you do, y&#039;know -- during the war? Like, you understand me, we can talk pretty well, you&#039;ve got a handle on human gestures. Were you around humans a lot?&quot; She stopped, gulped down her latest mouthful, and seemed apprehensive. &quot;I&#039;m not asking -- I mean, I know. It was a war. That&#039;s not what I&#039;m getting at. I&#039;m just wondering--&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Tracker. Hunt. Observe. Engage,&quot; she said, downing her glass of water all at once. She held her hands in circles around her eyes. &quot;Observed. Long time.&quot; She added with a slight shrug before diving back into her dinner. She only got a few bites more before she stopped and asked, &quot;You? During war.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;m no fighter. My brother was, which caused a lot of tension between us. He wasn&#039;t happy just surviving; he wanted to join the resistance, which he did one day. Just up and left, leaving only a note behind explaining his intentions. I didn&#039;t know what to do with myself, so I just stayed put. Been here about twenty years, totally alone for the last eight before you came along. Just, you know -- taking it one day at a time.&quot; Her posture drooped and her features softened. What could it be? Pity? Ridicule? &quot;It wasn&#039;t all bad. Never had ADVENT come knocking on my door, never lost my chickens or my life. Waking up each day was a win in my book. Unlike my brother. Some people live to serve, and some just want to live.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">At that she let go of a sort of chuffing noise, a quick grunt-like sound that ended in a subdued hiss, and the corners of her mouth pulled back slightly. Was that a laugh? &quot;Hatched. To serve,&quot; she said with a hand on her chest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">An alien snake with the start of a sense of humor. Another thing to add to the list of surreality.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her head whipped up, her eyes tracking up the stairs before slowly scanning the kitchen ceiling. She pinpointed a spot and just kept staring, her eyes narrowing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;What?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Noise,&quot; she hissed. I cocked my head and listened, trying hard to separate the television from whatever it was she was hearing. After straining for a few moments, I heard it too. My heart stopped. It was the perimeter alarm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Shit, something&#039;s crossed the property line,&quot; I said, shooting up from my seat. normally I would not have been so alarmed, but the most recent breaches were all things far larger and more dangerous than a fox. I had only been lucky that no ill intentions had come with my recent visitors. Whatever it was out there, I had no clue how close it was. Was it walking or sprinting? Was it bee-lining for the house or just skirting along the edge of the property? Was there hostile intent this time or mere curiosity?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Get the hell out here, ADVENT!&quot; someone shouted at the top of their lungs. The color drained from my face. By the voice alone any idiot could tell there was hatred. What curdled my blood more was that I felt as if I recognized the voice, which could only have meant it was one of the men from days ago. Why would they have come back? What could possibly have them furious with me? Even considering the circumstances I had been kind, courteous, hospitable when we had met -- everything a person should be. Why would they call me ADVENT? Minus the server in the basement, I thought I came off pretty well as stereotypically simple countryfolk.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vee whipped herself out from around the table, her head sunken low to the floor like a predator on the hunt, or a soldier desperate for cover. She found the latter by pressing herself to the kitchen-living room adjoining wall, where she stayed low to the ground with her upper body seemingly perched upon her fingertips, trying her hardest to peek around the corner and through the front window. The pair of stark white lights shone through, scanning for anything inside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Vee,&quot; I whispered, my throat tight and hoarse from fear. Her attention snapped to me. &quot;Get my gun. In my room, beneath the bed, left side. It&#039;s fully loaded. Just in case.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She looked worriedly at the window painted by flashlight, then back to me. &quot;Don&#039;t.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That she could so easily infer my course of action spoke to a perception of hers that I had so far missed, or to the ease with which I spilled my guts to a stranger. Either way, her desperately shaking her head did nothing to deter me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;m not ADVENT,&quot; I shouted back, watching Vee slither noiseless across the floor to the stairs. &quot;I&#039;m coming out unarmed. Please don&#039;t shoot, okay? We can talk.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I slowly rose to my feet and approached the front door, where through the sidelights I could see the flashlights were now focused. That there were just two beams of light outside made me worry. If it was the three men from before -- and it had to be -- where was the third?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;m coming out,&quot; I said, cracking the door just enough to wave my hand outside. With no response I slid fully outdoors, shielding my eyes from the bright white lights. My eyes took what felt like hours to adjust, but sure enough two men stood not twenty yards off. I squinted to make use of what little light dusk had left to offer and saw exactly what I had expected. There were my last visitors. Eric, the asian fellow, and -- if memory served, the black man with the thick accent was Gerard. But one was missing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Where&#039;s Donovan?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You shut your goddamned mouth,&quot; Eric spat. He was clearly shaken. Not by anger, but something else had happened. His jacket had a few new holes in it, and his light blue jeans had a deep scarlet slash running down the outside of his left leg. He held his flashlight in his armpit, seemingly struggling with both hands to point his weapon directly at me. Gerard followed suit with aim just as shaky as his friends. He, too, looked like he&#039;d been through hell, dirt and mud caked into his clothing as if he&#039;d been crawling through it for days, and one of the shoulder straps of his backpack was hanging by a literal thread. The entire side of his left arm looked shredded pretty bad, like he&#039;d caught a bunch of birdshot. Or shrapnel.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;What the hell happened to you guys?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;As if you don&#039;t know,&quot; Eric said, venom coursing through his words. &quot;You sent us into an ambush. You knew!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Already I felt as if the situation had gotten away from me and I had the gnawing thought I had just bitten off more than I could ever hope to chew. &quot;Into a what? How could I have done that? God&#039;s sake, why would I have done that?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;&#039;Cause your a dirty collaborator, is why. The set-up was too perfect. They knew we were coming, and we know who you&#039;ve got inside,&quot; Gerard said, smiling as the worrying realization spread across my face. &quot;Yeah, that&#039;s right. We saw you playing house with your filthy alien master all morning. After popping open your skull, we&#039;ll skin that scaley bitch alive.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We&#039;d barely spoken for a minute. I didn&#039;t know where to start. My head swam with a thousand things to say and at the end of each sentence I just saw my own death. I thought I would have had more time, more chances, more things to say. I thought they would have been more reasonable. As the seconds passed, I suddenly couldn&#039;t believe I thought I ever had a chance. Vee had known from the start I was walking into a hopeless situation.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You guys have it all wrong! There was no -- I didn&#039;t know there was anyone north of here, let alone ADVENT! And she&#039;s not so bad, I swear she doesn&#039;t--&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Before I could even finish my life flashed before my eyes and the world seemed to freeze at the exact moment before my death. Gerard&#039;s stance changed; his body leaned forward and his arms braced, and his expression of grim determination gave way to a bared-tooth look of senseless fury. Eric&#039;s finger clawed for the trigger and I felt my body crumple and jerk backwards, as if I were being folded at the waist.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The house flew past me, and as I tumbled backwards I saw a myriad of holes punched into the door, splintering the wood and shattering the sidelights into tiny pieces. I hit the floor hard and immediately scrambled to find where I&#039;d been shot, tearing at my clothing like it was on fire. Was this how it was supposed to feel? Were gunshots that powerful that they could propel me halfway into my house? Where was the pain? Where was the blood? Was it shock dulling my reaction?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Torch it all!&quot; More broken glass. A muffled roar.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Cold metal thrust into my hands snapped me out of my confusion, and I saw Vee passing my gun off to me as an impossibly long tongue -- longer than I had ever even thought possible -- released my waist and snaked its way back entirely into her mouth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The gun was heavier than I remembered. I knew I had to use it. I knew that I knew how to use it. But it was so heavy, like I was trying to carry a boulder. I didn&#039;t have the effort. The effort wasn&#039;t -- wouldn&#039;t be needed, though. I was as human as they were. We had the same enemy. The fight was over. Why keep killing? I could fix this. I could fix it all, they can be reasonable. They would see. I don&#039;t need to kill anybody, nobody had to get hurt--</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">An angry-sounding hiss blew hotly against my face, and a pair of scaled hands snatched the gun back from me. A few more thunderous gunshots. Silence, then sounds like snapping twigs. A strangled cry. That dull roar only grew in intensity. All of this could be fixed. I knew it could. It might take time, but everything would work out. It had worked out for twenty years, I could make it last forever.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I gasped when a hand slapped against my shoulder, only to cough and sputter when the only thing I could breathe in was smoke. Vee dragged me around the corner into the foyer and towards the front door, past the living room entirely awash in blue and orange flames. The books my grandmother had saved from my childhood -- gone. The pictures arranged atop the fireplace, the faces I always tried to avoid looking at -- gone. The ancient television popped and crackled before its screen exploded outwards, showering the couch and recliner in glass and causing wisps of flame to jump into the kitchen. Everything I possessed and had ever known for two decades was going up in smoke.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The view from the yard was so much worse. The second floor was already on fire. I could see the hole that had been smashed through the window by whatever it was they had thrown inside. The chicken coop had probably lit up in an instant and burned even more furiously than the house; the burning electronics inside produced an acrid scent that stung my nose. The camo netting, with all the dead branches and foliage strewn throughout, was perfect tinder. Before Vee, those birds had been the only living things I had spoken to for years. Now they were gone, too. Holly, Marlene, Judy, Cathy, Iris, Penny, Harvey -- not to mention all the chicks. Poof. Gone in what I always imagined would be one of the worst ways to go.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vee swept her tail around my feet and yanked be back, forcing me onto the ground. I hadn&#039;t even known my legs were trying to carry me back inside. Twenty years of my life up in smoke in a heartbeat. If I had answered the door with a gun, would I still have it all? The pictures I couldn&#039;t stand looking at for the memories they stirred up -- would they still be there? Would all the trinkets and nonsense my grandparents had saved throughout the years still be there? Everything my parents had fought for to ensure our survival in a terrible and unfamiliar new world -- the chickens, the generator, the food, the garden -- could I have kept it all?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Ultimately, I guessed not. Answering the door with a gun I had no intention of using was just the same as answering without one at all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The raging fire&#039;s light kept the dark night from closing in. I couldn&#039;t do anything to stop the flames, nor could I hold back my tears any longer. They fell like rain, and clutching my knees to my chest as tightly as I could just made the sobbing hurt worse. I don&#039;t remember much beyond that; at some point I thought I felt Vee gently coil her tail around me as I watched the flames through watery eyes. I cried out every ounce of energy left in me, until exhaustion took hold and I fell asleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">-Chapter 6-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I couldn&#039;t believe I had fallen asleep at all. It had been deep and dreamless, like my body had shut down entirely to recharge and devoted every bit of effort only towards that end. When I woke and saw the ruins of my life still there waiting for me, I hopelessly wished I could have just stayed sleeping.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The entire house was gone. Nothing remained except a smoldering mess of wood. The only way anybody would ever be able to tell it was once a house was the front steps and rear face still partially stood, a charred, ghastly skeleton of its former self. The chicken coop was an even more total loss; nothing was left standing. It was mostly just a pile of ashes, the tallest piece left barely reaching up to my knees. The smoke still rose high into the blue, cloudless morning sky, and only then did I realize that the rain I thought I had saw coming yesterday never showed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Where did I go from here? What was I supposed to do? I bet Adam would have known. Then again, he never would have done what I had done. He would&#039;ve run upstairs, grabbed the gun, and nailed them both from an open window before they had even finished their first sentence. My brother, the eager killer. He always knew what to do, even if I never agreed with it. He would&#039;ve protected the house. But he also would have put Vee down the moment she had shown up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Would that have been so bad? Insidious whispers grew in the back of my mind, showing me images of false hope; Vee shows up and is immediately put down, those resistance guys drop by, collect her body, and the house remains. My life would remain.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Something slick and cool brushed against my ankle. Vee had encircled me with the end of her tail, as if I was sitting inside of a thick hula-hoop. She leaned over to check on me. I couldn&#039;t bear to look her in the eyes with those horrible thoughts swirling around in my head, and started to cry again. How could I think anything of the sort? She did not threaten me. She did not coerce or entice me. Everything up to now had been my own choices, my own mistakes. In fact, the only thing she had irrefutably done was save my life. I&#039;d have been riddled with bullets if she hadn&#039;t pulled me from the doorway when she did, with that unusual whip-like tongue of hers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">But what to do with that life?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I have nothing left.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vee looked at me with what I supposed was as much pity as she could squeeze out of that inherent frown of hers. She unmistakably sighed and joined me in looking at the ruins, then tried lifting me up by my arms. I didn&#039;t have much for energy and was loathe to rise to my feet, but did so at her insistence. Only when she began to pull me towards the smoking bones of the house did I feel the dam in my head breaking, straining too hard to hold back the awful mixed swell of emotion.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I have nothing!&quot; She stopped, recoiling at my sudden outburst. &quot;Nothing! It&#039;s gone, okay? The chickens, food, water, everything! There&#039;s nothing left. For me or for you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I hadn&#039;t meant to yell at her, but more at the universe in general. I wanted to say it was only because my throat was dry and tight that I felt as if I had to force the words out, but I knew better. So did she, which was why she immediately left me alone and dejectedly made her own way to the house. I just fell to my knees, looking at the dirt and wondering why things had to have happened as they did. The self-pity made me feel like even more of a weakling, a feeling that did not abate after getting back on my feet, so I began to shuffle forwards. Even though I knew where I was heading, it wasn&#039;t really on purpose. Everything just felt automatic at this point.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">My feet hit the bottom step of the front porch, the sudden jolt shifting a layer of ash across its surface. It took a moment to gather the strength I thought I would need to see it all up close, then slowly scanned over the debris. It was all a jagged mess of splintered wood burnt pitch black and sickly gray; at some point the supports must have given way and the entire second floor had just collapsed, bringing down the entire structure. Beneath the mess I thought I saw recognizable shapes: what remained of the old television, the fireplace mantel, the heavily-warped carcass of the refrigerator. I even saw a reflective sliver of the mirror that had decorated the foyer. It was dulled and charred, but the glinting light made it easier to spot.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Through a broken window on the still-standing rear-facing panel, I saw Vee disinterestedly digging around before continuing on. Thinking I may have owed her an apology, I left the porch and slowly walked around the house to join her, kicking little bits of wood along the way. She saw me coming, as much as she pretended not to. Whether to spite me or just to try and give me space, I couldn&#039;t tell. If the former, I deserved it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I didn&#039;t mean to yell,&quot; I said. Her look spoke volumes. &quot;Okay, but I didn&#039;t mean to yell at you. I&#039;ve got a lot going on in my head and I don&#039;t know what to do with it. I&#039;m sorry if it came off as being mad at you. I know you saved my life and despite how it looks right now, I am thankful for that. I mean -- thank you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Come,&quot; she hissed, gently pulling me by the arm towards the cellar doors already thrown open. Curiously, the interior side looked largely untouched by any sort of damage. The blue paint had bubbled in only a few places and the metal doors didn&#039;t show any sign of melting, nor they blackened in the least. On the far side of the cellar entrance was a small pile made up of flashlights, some blankets and clothing, and a few first aid kits, among other things one could label essential. Even an old hiking backpack I hadn&#039;t seen since the last time my brother and I had gone camping with granddad.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;This came out of the cellar?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, watching as I went down a couple steps to take a peek. At first glance, the inside looked like a complete disaster, same as the rest of the house. The concrete had done an admirable job, all things considered. There was an enormous hole in the ceiling where the house had caved in on itself, spilling down into and filling up most of the basement with wreckage. But the walls still held. Yellowed from the top down by the fire and most likely brittle, but they were still up. Around the perimeter of the basement was mostly more of the same mess, but a few shelves had merely been displaced, not crushed, and their contents lay scattered across the floor. I could see a few bins full of clothing and blankets, one of the large first-aid kits along with several of the home-made ones. A few packs of batteries lay scattered about, and I could even see one of my freezers looking in fair condition.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Food inside. Not good,&quot; Vee said, following my gaze. Just when I thought there&#039;d been some luck on our side, but of course the power had gone out. I saw the generator around back -- or what had been left of it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hang on, you went in there?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, and before I could get another word out she slipped past me and into the jagged jungle of wood and metal. I could scarcely breathe watching her fit through gaps and holes that seemed too small for her to maneuver, afraid that even the slightest sound would somehow disturb her concentration or maybe cause something else to collapse atop of her. She carefully slithered her way through, moving slowly to avoid catching her shirt on anything, scooping up loose items that could be of use. It was almost as if she could flatten or otherwise compress her body to fit through spaces that would otherwise be impassible. With her hands full she made her way back to me, and I realized I had actually been holding my breathe the entire time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Please don&#039;t go back in there.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She dropped her haul with the rest of the stuff. &quot;Useful.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Dangerous. You see the yellow coloring on the walls? That&#039;s what fire does to concrete - turns it brittle. It&#039;s standing now but you don&#039;t know for how long.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Safe.&quot; She slid past me yet again, too fast for me to catch her by the arm or shoulder, and I nearly had half a mind to try and yank her back by her tail. But again she crawled in, gliding over obstacles with ease as she collected everything she could into her arms, and again my breath hitched solidly in my throat like stone. She gently yanked on the tattered edges of what I first thought was a green blanket, but turned out to be a sleeping bag. It eventually gave, but not before the metal it had been pinned under groaned threateningly, like a beast slowly awakening. The sound gave her pause, and after a moment spent frozen in time, she took the continued silence as her cue to exit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Please stop. It&#039;s not worth it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She dropped her things onto the pile and took quick inventory, her eyes darting to every trinket gathered so far. &quot;Need it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;For what?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Travel.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">My heart sank into my gut. I had entertained the possibility, in the depths of my sadness and anger, that Vee would leave. It honestly made sense, no matter how much I wished it didn&#039;t. I had no more food, water, or shelter -- things she obviously wanted. As much as I wished she would stay, I knew she wouldn&#039;t. Now she was just taking what she needed to help her find the next spot to settle down at. Were these her true colors? Had I just been a rest stop with a continental breakfast this whole time? I was powerless to stop her, even if I wanted to. Her latest venture had turned out to be a bust, and now she was salvaging what she could to help her find her next place to call home.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Oh,&quot; I barely whispered, crossing my legs beneath me. &quot;Where will you go?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;We.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That woke me up about as well as a faceful of cold water. &quot;What do you mean, &#039;we&#039;?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She stopped counting the batteries and flashlights, and placed the last first-aid kit on the ground next to the others. Her eyes slowly flitted about, not really focusing on anything in particular but still seemingly searching. Her tongue slipped out to slowly taste the air, then she locked eyes with me. &quot;Being alone sucks.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She wasn&#039;t simply parroting me and her tone was deadly serious. I could tell she was honestly speaking for herself, but to hear my own words come back to me when I had least expected them left me speechless for ages. Food, water, shelter -- things she clearly wanted. Was company among them too? I wanted so badly to just say yes, I&#039;ll go, but my thoughts were tethered too strongly to my home of twenty years, to the place I had thought was a fortress, a hide-out from the horrors the rest of the world. Though now I saw it as a burnt-out husk, it was not hard to see what a fragile image that had been.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;We could rebuild, couldn&#039;t we?&quot; Simply phrasing that as a question seemed to be an answer in and of itself. She kept silent, maybe still trying to figure out if I was crazy or serious. Maybe a bit of both, to be honest, but I was a pragmatist, too. In some respects, anyway -- I guess being without people for so long has made me naive about them.  I knew there was no way I could stay and remake things as they had once been. I would need lumber, piping, concrete, tools I didn&#039;t have. The checklist in my head just grew longer and longer and the thought of a fixed-up home just got further and further away.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Where would we go?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She visibly relaxed, apparently relieved that I could still see reason. &quot;City 31.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The city the news report had mentioned. A supposed haven for aliens and hybrids freed from Elder control. &quot;Come on, are you serious? We hear about it just once on the news and suddenly you want to trek god-knows-where to find it? Besides, the reporter said they shut the city down to keep out the undesirables. There&#039;s no guarantee they&#039;d let us in even if we did find it. I mean, where would we even start? Is it north, south, west -- is it even on this continent?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Had map,&quot; she said with a worsening frown as she looked into the rubble. &quot;Inside armor. Far north. This continent.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;So that&#039;s all we&#039;ve got? What does that mean? Iowa? New York? Canada?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She slapped the dust and ash from her Metallica shirt, using the tip of her tail to reach where her arms couldn&#039;t on her back. &quot;Unsure. Someone. May know.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Who?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;North. In forest.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;What, where those guys said they got ambushed?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yes. Not ADVENT.&quot; That set off some quiet alarms that I didn&#039;t know what to make of. So resistance members were ambushed, but Vee sounded certain it wasn&#039;t ADVENT. What would that mean? Were the resistance cells splintering? Had humanity conquered its oppressors just to begin another war against itself? Or had Eric, Donovan, and Gerard been confused? I had seen ADVENT soldiers on television; the gleaming black armor with red highlights would be hard to mistake for something else.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You&#039;re not making sense, Vee. Those men said they were ambushed by ADVENT. How could anyone confuse them with anyone else?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She shook her head, pointing at her right side. &quot;One in jacket. Had small wounds. Bullets,&quot; she said, pausing to catch her breath. She would have to break that habit of breathing her words instead of speaking sooner or later. &quot;Not ADVENT issue. ADVENT rounds. Bigger exits.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I remembered when I had first seen Eric, a single hole in the shoulder of his jacket. When he had come back sporting a few more, it was impossible not to notice; dark red had stained his jeans and one of his arms had been so useless that he had to one-hand his gun and hold the flashlight in his armpit. Could she really tell what type of weaponry had caused his injuries? I supposed this was where her background as a tracker and hunter came into play. I had no leg to stand on -- it was clear she knew far more than me with regards to these sorts of things, but I couldn&#039;t shake the feeling we&#039;d be walking into the same trap as Eric and his men. Then again, we had no food and very little water, and the nearest town was four of five days away. Not that we could go there anyway; even if I left Vee on the outskirts, I felt like I&#039;d face too many questions about the fate of the hunting party. If what Vee was saying turned out to be true, then maybe we could score some supplies as well as directions. It was a big risk no matter how I looked at it. Either we go a different way and maybe die of starvation and dehydration, or we go north and get ourselves shot.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I guess getting shot was quicker, if worst came to worst.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Okay. Let&#039;s do it your way.&quot; Perhaps in anticipation of my answer, she had already jammed everything into my granddad&#039;s old hiking pack. Or maybe she was getting ready to completely ignore my answer. Either way worked. She laid out a blanket and messily threw some clothes into the middle, then folded the blanket&#039;s corners in to tie it all together in a makeshift sort of parcel. She handed it to me, shouldered the backpack herself, and began to leave. I heard the shuffling sound of her slithering away slowly come to a halt when she realized I wasn&#039;t following her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Just give me a second. Been here more than half of my life.&quot; I had expected her to give me a moment to myself, but instead she doubled-back and coiled herself up beside me, folding her hands together.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;We always came here for our family retreats. Granddad and grandma had built the place with their own hands, pouring sweat, blood, and tears into it -- not to mention what I always imagined was a hefty chunk of change for the fifties. Dad had spent most of his childhood here, and even after marrying mom he said the two of them would always come back every summer. He liked to joke that my brother and I were probably conceived here. Grandparents eventually had to move into a one-story ranch in another state due to their age, but all of us made it back here every summer. Games and barbeques almost every day -- fresh beef sizzling on the grill. It&#039;s so weird that with all the ash in the air, just the memory of dad&#039;s cooking overpowers it so easily. I swear, right now I can smell the burgers and steaks he would make. I remember breaking my arm falling down the stairs when I was nine. My brother got bowled over by a cow calf a month later and hit his head. He was laughing the whole drive to the ER even with blood pouring down his face -- mom had thought he had gotten a concussion or something. The laughing stopped when the doctor came in with the sutures.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">My mind was flooded by all these little memories that I never would have thought would come up again. I just kept talking and talking, whether or not Vee was really listening. I wasn&#039;t thinking about the kitchen, or my bed, or the chickens; I suddenly realized I wasn&#039;t crushed because of what I had lost. Instead it was more about what the house had given me. A blessed childhood, heaps of memories that I had fought so hard to keep tucked away in the recesses of my mind. Only now those memories were the only things left, and after twenty god forsaken years of keeping them locked away, I absolutely relished in them and whatever tears they brought.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Good home,&quot; Vee quietly said, as if it had been a faithful companion.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yes it was. Good home.&quot; I wiped my eyes before taking a look at Vee, who was already looking at me. I offered her a weak smile, something to show I was mostly okay. She stared a little too hard, and I felt almost as if she was trying to find something inside me. Maybe she may have found it if I had let her, but I rocked forward and onto my feet, clapping the dirt of my hands as I stood fully. &quot;We should get going, I guess. It&#039;ll probably take at least a day to get to wherever this supposed ambush happened, judging by how long it took Eric to find my place again after leaving the first time. Where is he, by the way? I mean -- the bodies.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She rose to her full height, but kept looking at the ground, clearly avoiding any sort of eye contact. &quot;Front,&quot; she said as I passed by her. I heard her following me at a respectable distance.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The bodies were exactly where she had said. I had woken up with the two of them not too far behind me. I swallowed and held my breath. They weren&#039;t the first bodies I had ever seen. Fear roiled to the surface of my mind upon closer inspection; they certainly were the gnarliest, though. Eric had a ragged, fist-sized hole in his neck and collar bone, full of splintered bone and a mess of torn flesh. He had clearly been shot at very close range. His torso was speckled with blood, like somebody had flicked a paintbrush at him, and I saw his weapon clutched tightly in his grasp; a great hole had been ripped clear through the receiver. I guess Vee got two shots off on him, and his weapon blocked some of the pellets.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Gerard, though -- I couldn&#039;t stand to look at him for more than a few moments. His must have been the strangled cry I had heard. His chest was oddly misshapen and one of his arms was bent in horrifying ways, while his rifle lay beside him nearly folded in half. I didn&#039;t even bother to look further up. I knew Vee had squeezed the life out of him, and I didn&#039;t have the stomach to see if he still had eyes in his head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Do me a favor,&quot; I said, my voice cracking. &quot;See if this guy has anything we can use on him. I&#039;ll check Eric.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We passed one another as I doubled back to check the first body; neither of us could look at each other. Eric&#039;s pockets and pouches had a plethora of things inside. I found two knives on his belt, one about eight inches tucked into a sheath and a smaller, four inch fold-out blade that simply clipped onto a belt. I also found four shells I could use for my gun, a few batteries we could use out of many more we couldn&#039;t, and a canteen of water already half-empty. His backpack was in okay shape, so I took that as well, and shoved in the blanket-parcel Vee had made. Already inside were two pairs of socks, a lighter, a pack of cigarettes with just two left, and something that looked and smelled like jerky in an interior pocket, stuffed within a plastic baggie.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vee finished searching Gerard and fell back in behind me. She seemed like she was waiting, or perhaps expecting something from me. She still avoided direct eye contact but would steal sidelong glances when she thought I wasn&#039;t paying attention. She looked away again, down at the dirt, and I looked up. Birds had begun to circle. Despite everything, despite their mistake and their rush to judgement, I couldn&#039;t just leave the bodies for the animals. Unfortunately all the tools I had, shovels included, were in the basement. Or what was left of it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;How many blankets have you got in that pack, Vee?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Four.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Take out two. Wrap him up and I&#039;ll get this one.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Waste,&quot; she nearly whispered, though she had already begun rummaging through her pack for what I asked.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;It&#039;s the right thing to do.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I laid out a blanket beside Eric&#039;s body and rolled him onto it, then continued rolling it around him until he was wrapped twice over. Vee seemed a little more haphazard with her movements. Or maybe the odd angles off Gerard&#039;s broken body were making it difficult for her. Either way, she did not seem to have the same reverence I did. I wasn&#039;t sure if she had a grudge against them, or if this was just her way of protesting my waste of resources, but I wasn&#039;t about to start an argument. Neither was she, apparently, judging by her persistent silence despite her slightly-angrier face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She had him wrapped like a mummy shortly after I was done. The two bodies just laid there, side by side, and I found myself staring. I was instantly reminded of the day Adam and I had buried our parents. Seeing it again so vividly threatened to bring tears to my eyes, so I pushed that memory deep down. I was already making a conscious effort not to visit their graves before leaving; if I did, I felt I might never be able to leave.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vee came back with some twigs and a few pieces of unburned wood from around the house. Small shards of the porch left untouched by fire should serve as enough kindling. Maybe. She scattered it over the corpses and after a minute or two, it all took a flame from Eric&#039;s lighter. My stomach twisted itself into knots. I didn&#039;t know either of them beyond our two conversations, and to be honest it may have been the beginnings of a grudge, but the scene was disturbing. Something about it just felt frighteningly relevant -- prescient, almost. Nobody was here to cry over them. Nobody was here to say they were in a better place or that their loved ones would see them again sooner or later. Just all encompassing silence. It hit me that this was how I would have died if I had stayed in this house. Nobody around to see me off, nobody to grieve for me. One morning I would have just not woken up and rotted in bed for the rest of time, the world totally indifferent to my absence. I had never given it much thought, but seeing it now so plainly chilled me to the bone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I just kept watching as the fire grew disappointingly. It sure as hell wasn&#039;t a proper cremation, but it should have been good enough to keep the animals from picking at what was left.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Liam.&quot; Hearing my name from someone else&#039;s mouth for the first time in damn near a decade snapped me out of my contemplative trance so quickly it nearly gave me whiplash. &quot;Come.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And that was it. I didn&#039;t even look back. I knew beyond a shadow of doubt that took some strength on my part. I wasn&#039;t entirely weak, after all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">-Chapter 7-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The warm morning inexorably transitioned into a hot afternoon, the sun mercilessly beating down with not a single cloud to block its light. Being out in the fields was terrible in the noon heat. It wasn&#039;t exactly scorching, but I would burn just the same with enough time. I took a spare shirt from Eric&#039;s -- from my backpack and draped it over my head, such that the body of it covered the back of my neck. Vee game me a funny sort of look when she saw, but I guess it was warranted; I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever heard of a snake getting sunburned, so maybe she didn&#039;t have much of a clue what I was doing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It was odd to be so far from the house. I knew there was no civilization for miles around but the excitement and anxiety of seeing how things were began to eat at me in equal parts. Every step I took, I expected some aspect of this horrifying new world waiting to swallow me up and spit me back out. Were there roving militia bands slaughtering every non-human they could find? Did packs of aliens, now leaderless, scour the land for anything they could use to survive? Any time the thoughts got to be too much, I reminded myself that Vee wasn&#039;t too worried about the world around her. Either she knew the dangers well or knew there weren&#039;t as many dangers as I kept imagining. I suppose carrying my shotgun also instilled some confidence in her. It was probably for the best, anyway; circumstances had shown I wasn&#039;t prepared to actually use the damn thing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We walked in relative silence, her leading the way by a few paces. It was very strange to see her move. In and around the house I never paid it much mind, nor could I since the distance traveled was never very far, but outside on a long trek it was impossible to ignore. Everything about her was liquid-smooth. Whereas a normal Earth snake would slide its body along the ground in a continuous squiggly pattern for forward motion, Vee&#039;s upright posture created some obvious differences. She was always hunched slightly forward which created a constant s-curve in her body. Her tail would move like I expected it to, constantly swiping back and forth. When she was moving slowly, like at a walking pace, her upper body lagged just a half-step behind her lower as her tail seemed to pull her into place. At a faster clip her upper body leaned forward, and it was as if her tail was trying to keep up with her. No matter how fast or slow she moved, her hips -- or where it looked like she had hips -- swayed hypnotically back and forth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Though beyond that mild curiosity, it was difficult to look at her. Every time I did, my mind instantly leapt to images of Gerard&#039;s body. The twisted arms, his ribs broken so badly it looked like his chest barely had a shape anymore -- even the gun, bent like a paperclip against his body as Vee probably squeezed him with every once of strength she had. Sometimes I&#039;d feel something bubble up from the pit of my stomach and I would be forced to loudly swallow it back down, loud enough that Vee would hear it and check on me from the corner of her eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I think she knew what I was hung up on; not that it was very hard for her to see, with how I would avert my eyes every time she looked back. She kept her distance, unsure yet of my new opinion of her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I knew I was being unfair, that I was being childish. I was six years old the first time I saw granddad slaughter a chicken. He grabbed old Gerta from the hen house, placed her down on the ground with a broomstick held firmly behind her neck, and yanked her body upwards -- all before I could even think about looking away. A tiny little pop was all I heard and then her lifeless body just fell to the ground like a rock. I was upset for weeks afterwards and pretty wary around granddad. He tried to help me understand, but it took a while for a suburbanite boy my age to get over it. Eventually I saw it for what it was; just a man doing what he could to survive on his own. For sustenance, for survival -- some things were necessary.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That was only reinforced when my dad took up killing to protect us in a post-invasion world. And after him, my brother took a few lives to protect us both. I knew the stakes, but I guess I never comprehended the violence of action that would be necessary. Gunshots were always so clean. All I heard was a sharp pop or two and then it was over. No screaming or strangled cries. And the first time I had ever seen someone killed with my own eyes was when my brother killed a wandering man in front of the house, clearly holding a gun behind his back. He was shouting angrily at the house, and as I peeked out the living room there was a loud boom from the second floor, and then he just dropped. That was all there was to it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Then there was Vee and the number she did on Gerard. The rib cage, misshapen like a sack of potatoes. The bones in his arms most likely splintered nearly into dust. And even though I couldn&#039;t bear to look at his face, I imagined it vividly; bloodshot eyes popped out of their sockets, teeth cracked as he tried to grit the pain away, blood dripping from his ears, nose, and eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I knew Vee was not a monster, but I could not deny what she did was monstrous. Like when the family dog gets a hold of a baby rabbit, and before anybody can tell him to drop it he just picks it up in his jaws and crunches down on it. It&#039;s tough not to see him in a different light. He&#039;s no monster, but it&#039;s hard not to be disgusted by him in that moment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I guess it all boiled down to my naivety. It&#039;s been a real ugly world for the past couple of decades, but I&#039;ve only known it through a television screen or by someone else&#039;s handiwork. I had the sinking feeling sooner or later, something would happen that would make my hands dirty. Vee wouldn&#039;t be there to take the gun from my hands, and it would be either me or whoever was on the other end of the barrel.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The sun had just passed the apex of its arc, and Vee and I were lucky to enter the woods at what was sure to be the hottest part of the day. The forest canopy blocked a substantial portion of the sunlight and immediately I could feel the air temperature drop beneath the trees. My bare feet were already aching and of everything I had lost in the last twenty-four hours, I really wished I still had my boots. That Vee needed no sleeve or padding or some other thing between her tail and the ground was momentarily interesting, but then again her scales probably acted as some sort of armor. Whereas she could probably barely feel the pine cones and needles and twigs that crunched beneath her, I was gingerly stepping over this and that while trying my best not to fall behind or slow her down. Whoever it was Vee thought we were going to run into, I sure hoped they had a spare pair of shoes I could trade for. That was if they didn&#039;t kill us first.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Stop,&quot; Vee said. I froze mid-stride, carefully putting my foot down avoid making any sound. She sank low to the ground, using her hands to support herself, and flicked her tongue several times over a particular spot. &quot;Blood.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It didn&#039;t look like any sort of fight had happened here. None of the tree trunks were splintered. There were no craters or dark patches of freshly-kicked up dirt. The forest as a whole seemed generally undisturbed. She was the tracker, however. If she says something happened here, it must&#039;ve have happened. &quot;Is this where they were ambushed?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She scanned her surroundings, zeroing in on a particularly unremarkable path through the trees directly ahead of us. &quot;No attack. Yet.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">There would only be blood if they had come back this way. &quot;Then you&#039;re saying we&#039;re on the right track?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yes.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Where before our silence was borne more from giving the other space, now it seemed much heavier. Vee appeared to be a different sort of person now. She was far more alert, her head swiveling about and her eyes focusing like lasers on the slightest disturbances, her tongue darting out to taste the air every dozen paces. After a little while I began to clue in on the things that grabbed her attention: a line of broken branches, a patch of flattened clovers, a line cut into the forest detritus like somebody had been dragging something. A shiver slipped down my spine when I realized this is what Vee had done during the war. She would find trails left by humans like me, find them, and kill them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She followed the little clues left in the earth like breadcrumbs for hours, pausing every so often to reacquire her line of travel with an eerily predatory, robotic whip of her head. She&#039;d stop, swing left or right, then stop precisely when she meant to and refocus. There was no wasted motion when she was like this. Every movement was measured and conserved, carefully considered before actually executed. I began to wonder if this was a leftover of her mental control by the Elders. She searched not like she wanted to find something, but more as if she needed to. As a soldier, was she rewarded for a job well done? Did she get some sort of buzz or mental high when picking up clues that would lead her to a kill? Just how far into the minds of its soldiers did the Elders reach?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Only when she began to lose the last bits of sunset light could I see her frustration began to set in. Her careful nature eroded bit by bit. Her tongue flew more wildly, she was never focused on more than one spot for a few seconds, and the rigid economy of motion she had previously stuck to went out the window as she scrambled around trying to reacquire the trail. Darkness fully fell as the sun slipped behind the horizon, dusk&#039;s hazy orange light vanishing from the forest canopy with startling quickness. Fireflies spotted the forest like stars while the chittering and screaming sounds of the night I had previously heard from the comfort of my house were now a little too close for comfort. I was careful once again of the noise I made with my footfalls, afraid something deeper in the forest might take notice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vee was unconcerned with nightfall or with the possibility something -- or someone -- else was in the forest and huffed loudly, disappointed by the loss of the trail when by all accounts the clues should have gotten more obvious. If we were going in the right direction we should have found more blood, more casings, more tracks the closer we got to the ambush site, but it all evaporated the further on we went.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Sleep,&quot; Vee said. She unhooked the sleeping bag from the top of the hiking pack and tossed it to me, then took out the remaining two blankets we had.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;ve got a lighter, you know. We could have a fire.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She curled as much of herself as she could beneath her blankets. A good portion of her tail still poked out from the side, which made me feel bad for her. &quot;No fire. Risky.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Do you want the sleeping bag? I can fit under those blankets.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We locked eyes for the first time since this morning, a moment of consideration in her slitted pupils, before she said, &quot;Too big.&quot; She curled up again, ducking her head out of sight beneath the covers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It was very hard to sleep. My backpack was about as good as a rock for a pillow, and between the constant chattering of whatever insects and creatures surrounded us and the inescapable truth that someone out here had attacked Eric and his men, any amount of shuteye seemed itself like a dream. Without a clock or the newscasts from the television the only way to tell time was by the passage of the half-moon overhead. Its glow just barely diffused through the treetops, spreading out to weakly light the forest floor. I just laid there for what I guessed was an hour, watching the hazy white move from one end of the canopy to the other. Before long I grew bored and turned on my side to see if sleep would come easier then.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The end of Vee&#039;s tail, the bit of her she could not fit beneath the blankets, seemed to glisten in the moonlight. Her diamond-shaped scales gave the impression of a bunch of pebbles still wet from a light rain. Between the arches of the blanket&#039;s edges I could only see an impenetrable pitch black, and from within there I wondered if Vee was looking back at me. I stared a little while longer, trying to convince myself that I wasn&#039;t just trying to keep an eye on her because now she scared me. And no matter how hard I tried, no matter how hard I truly, actually believed that she posed no threat to me, I couldn&#039;t help but imagine her squeezing me like a tube of toothpaste, snapping bones and crushing organs. Time and again I&#039;d told myself she could kill me whenever she wanted, that she had no actual reason to keep me alive, so why my mind kept replaying these imaginary events -- I had no idea.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I heard Vee&#039;s raspy voice in my mind -- being alone sucks. Repeating that in my head put me more at ease. She wanted company just as badly as I did.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I guess like humans, even aliens suffer from isolation. She claimed to have had a map to City 31 in her armor, but she had been content to stop at my house and apparently settle down. Her days would have consisted of nothing but watching television, helping around the house, and eating the occasional chicken. That had been good enough to make her stall, if not entirely skip going to City 31. Whatever she would have found in that city -- safety, community, a job for all I knew -- she was happy instead having found me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Despite the obvious physical differences, maybe she and I were more alike than either of us knew. It was honestly a comforting thought, and I felt myself slowly letting go, drifting to sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Until a bright light nearly blinded me through my eyelids and cold metal pressed into my forehead.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Get up,&quot; said a stern, startlingly dissonant voice; it sounded like two people were trying to speak over each other. &quot;Slowly.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vee was already emerging from her blankets. She had three guns trained on her, each with a flashlight attached near the barrel. I saw her eyes dart for just a moment towards the gun, but she immediately put any such thoughts out of mind and emerged fully to surrender herself. I followed her lead and didn&#039;t put up any fuss at all. She was relaxed somehow, which made me wonder if she had known what we were walking into.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Already smarter than the last group,&quot; said one of our captors. Two of them went around and collected our things, roughly stuffing it all into the sleeping bag I had just occupied. He grabbed the gun last, pumped it six times to clear the tube and chamber, gathered the shells, then safed it and slung it over his right shoulder. Each of our mystery captors certainly looked like ADVENT, but there was something undeniably off compared to what I had seen on television. The armor was just a little too ragtag relative to the gleaming black and red of the average trooper; some pieces looked held together by rags or duct tape, and what seemed like tribal or decorative marks adorned various places along their body. There didn&#039;t seem to be a standard of dress to them. One of them had an animal fur along his left forearm, while the others had mismatching insignia on their shoulders. The only thing they all shared was a full face helmet that had dimly-lit slits running horizontally across the eyes, and a pair of wicked blades coming off some sort of gauntlet on their left hands.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I was ushered sideways to stand beside Vee where both her arms and mine were bound behind our backs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;March.&quot; A gun barrel was gently pressed between my shoulder blades. &quot;Do not stop until instructed. Do not speak. Do not make sudden movements.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I stole a sidelong glance at Vee, which she met. I couldn&#039;t see any scheme being hatched behind those blood-red eyes. In fact, she seemed entirely at ease, as if this was just another step on our journey. This was her world, and I had to remind myself that for the moment, I was just a visitor. As hard as it was to keep my heart out of my throat and to suppress the instinct to flee, I followed her lead.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We trudged off through the woods in near pitch black, only barely sidestepping trees in our path and hoping our captors would not think we were trying anything funny. Besides the blood absolutely roaring through my ears, our footsteps crunching through the leaves and brush were the only sounds in the forest.  The chittering bugs had disappeared. The hooting and shrieking of owls and what I assumed to be foxes had fallen silent. Was everything quiet because of us, or did something else yet stalk us through the forest? All of this did nothing for the fear rapidly rising inside of me, seemingly displacing the air in my lungs and making it harder to breathe. I wondered if another panic attack was coming on -- or anxiety attack, or whatever that nonsense had been a couple days ago. I kept my focus by just staring at my feet -- right, left, right -- only looking up every so often to make sure I didn&#039;t run face first into a tree. I would also continue to watch Vee to remind myself that despite all of this, she appeared totally calm. If she was, I could be, too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Stop.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We must have gone about half a mile before arriving at some sort of camp sparsely lit by weak lighting, with what barely looked like the glow of a fire trapped within a cylinder to hide it from distant observers. I could only just make out a pair of tents and what looked like a truck, it&#039;s door half open but I couldn&#039;t see what -- if anything -- was inside. Vee looked a little disappointed. I wasn&#039;t sure why.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Take the viper to the left. The human goes to the right.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I watched them for a moment as Vee was led to the other tent, but another prod in my back pushed me in the right direction. I walked past the fire barrel -- it was mostly embers at this point -- and to the tent, pushing aside the entrance flaps. Inside were four chairs, and a table with yet another person on the other side of it, though obscured by shadows. I heard my escort step back a few paces and turned to see him posted up by the tent&#039;s opening, like he was standing guard.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Sit, please.&quot; The one at the table sounded just like the others -- that odd, two-voiced sort of speech that I swore I could almost feel vibrating in my bones. I timidly did as asked, using my foot to scoot one of the chairs out. Something on the table like a desk lamp was switched on; it wasn&#039;t too bright, but pointed directly at my face, it was hard to see much of anything else.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We sat in silence for much too long, and the tension began to twist my thoughts. And without Vee and her calm demeanor beside me, it was becoming too much to bear. Was this an interrogation? We hadn&#039;t done anything wrong. Was my captor waiting for me to offer something? Make the first move? Was this a test? Was I being allowed to stew in my own mind and crack like an egg?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;We were just passing through,&quot; I barely managed to stammer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Name?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Liam.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Occupation?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I was a farmer but, ah -- well, the property&#039;s gone now.&quot; That got a rise out of my interrogator. He cocked his head for a moment then went on with his questions.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Are you related to the previous three human men that wandered by approximately forty-eight hours ago?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;No. Wait, so you guys did ambush them?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;The two survivors reported back to you?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;No! They burnt my goddamn house down! Look, they -- like, a week ago or something these three guys find my house -- I mean, before that Vee did, but the guys , they were looking for her--&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Vee?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yes, that&#039;s her name. The viper I&#039;m with. She came by, tried to steal some food. I couldn&#039;t kill her, so I just gave her some stuff and sent her one way, but then these guys -- Eric, Gerard, and Donovan -- they came by a day later looking for her and said they wanted to skin her, take her fangs or her head or some other vile garbage, I don&#039;t care to recall. I sent told them she went north into the woods, so they went after her. Then they come back while we were having dinner--&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;We?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yes! Vee and I! Are you listening? They come back --or, Eric and Gerard do, anyway -- and scream that I sent them into an ADVENT ambush! The burn down my goddamn house and tried to shoot me despite what I was telling them, and I&#039;d be dead if it weren&#039;t for Vee. So we&#039;ve got no home, no food, everything we could salvage from my place is literally in that sleeping bag your guys took from us, and we&#039;d really like it back so we can be on our way to City 31.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I finished with a long, deep breath. Everything had sounded much more organized in my head, but I just couldn&#039;t keep it together. I was surrounded by aliens after twenty years of avoiding them and the only one that I would call a friend was being questioned, interrogated, beaten, tortured -- I didn&#039;t know what. I was tired, hungry, thirsty, and angry didn&#039;t even begin to describe the pent-up energy swelling inside me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Calm down, Liam. You and this &#039;Vee&#039; will not be harmed. Start again from the beginning, and take your time.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And with another deep, exasperated breath, I began again from the morning of the day I had met Vee. From her bewildered nature and vaguely grateful attitude, to the digusting things the three men had told me and shown me. I spilled it all -- Vee&#039;s return, her stay, her acommodations and her minor field surgery. Every little detail that had led Vee and I up to this moment I all but spelled out for him. When I finished, he leaned back into his chair, hiding a bit more of himself in darkness. Again he was content to let me stew in silence.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Bring in the viper,&quot; he said. The entrance split down the middle and Vee was ushered in by three escorts, her hands still bound as well. She pushed the chair next to me away so she could coil up beside me. &quot;What did she say?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Nothing, sir.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Shit,&quot; I hissed. Vee&#039;s look snapped to me. &quot;Was I not supposed to talk? I talked. Is that okay?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hurt?&quot; she said, ignoring my question.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;No. You?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;No.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The lamp focused on my face switched off, and a taller, stronger lamp in the far back of the tent flickered to life. In the dim yellow glow that now doused the interior, I could finally see the face of the man that was asking questions.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He had a pretty standard human shape, though he looked a little better built than your average man. It might have been the stark white armor which made him look bulkier; it was better kept than the armor his comrades wore, and on the shoulder there was what almost looked like some odd alteration of the ADVENT insignia. The pouches across his chest hung heavily, filled with magazines. A trio of impacts scarred the left breast, the paint there chipped and the material underneath slightly glossier than its surroundings, presumably by the heat of the impact. His neck was covered by what I guessed was an extension of the body suit he wore beneath his armor, and it reached up to cup his chin and cover the bottom half of his cheeks, though his mouth remained uncovered.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I was not prepared for the face. His eyes were large and deeply disturbing to look at with that threatening, ethereal shine they had, like a cat&#039;s eyes in the dark. His nose was reduced to barely anything, and I might not have noticed it were it not for the pair of slitted nostrils sitting in the approximately appropriate spot. His mouth appeared normal, though he had some sort of surgical implant on the left side that seemed to travel up his face, only intermittently diving beneath the skin before showing its metallic surface again further up. He had wrinkles that looked unreal, like laugh lines but multiplied to an absurd degree, and his forehead and bald scalp were also crisscrossed by odd furrows that I had never seen even on my grandparents, as old as they had been. His ears were slightly reduced and much closer to the sides of his head, almost like they were pinned back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">His focus shifted to Vee. &quot;Do you speak English? Hablas Espaol? Sprechen sie Deutsch? Balas ADVENT?&quot; he said.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;English,&quot; Vee replied.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Good. I&#039;d rather not speak in the false tongue of our former masters. Now, Liam, the men who engaged us were not ambushed. They crossed our perimeter and we interdicted them more gently than we did you. They chose not to come quietly despite our assurances, and opened fire on us,&quot; he said, tapping the three craters on his breastplate. &quot;As you know, one was killed in the firefight, and we allowed the other two to retreat. We know the closest town is approximately a week away on foot; even if they had returned with greater numbers for a counterattack, we will have been long gone by then.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Oh,&quot; I said, sort of wishing they had killed all three, but I squashed those thoughts the moment they sprung up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I must say, I have not yet heard of a human befriending a viper. Speak honestly and do not shield her; if she holds some sway over you, let it be known now and you will be protected. Despite all that you have said, are you her captive?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Her chef, actually,&quot; I sneered, angry that he had seemingly ignored all I had told him. That remark managed to pull a short, stuttering hiss from past Vee&#039;s lips. He looked at her with nothing short of amazement.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Nor have I ever heard a viper laugh. Today is certainly a day of firsts. Unbind them, please,&quot; he said. I heard a knife slip out from its sheath and the next moment, Vee&#039;s and my hands were free. &quot;You may call me Argo -- Commander of the Seventeeth Skirmisher cell, East Coast Division. My subordinates behind you are Edix, Jova, Sally, and Five.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The first two sounded alien or made-up enough, but the last two caught me off guard. &quot;Sally and Five?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Saved a human child from a Chryssalid,&quot; said one of the soldiers, whose oddly flanged voice had a distinctly female quality. &quot;She possessed a doll of an animal called a bear, which she called Sally. She transferred the name to me before we placed her in a refugee center.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;And Five,&quot; Argo interrupted, &quot;has yet to choose a name for herself. Now, if you please--&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hold on, I answered your questions,&quot; I said, feeling more than a little burst of courage for interrupting someone so intimidating. &quot;I&#039;ve got some of my own. What are Skirmishers? I&#039;ve never heard of your group. Are you resistance? Did humans press you into service or are you being blackmailed or what?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Argo smiled, the sort of patient, glowing smile a father would give his son for asking why the sky is blue. &quot;You would not have heard of us. We&#039;re not exactly widespread, and before the war we were ADVENT&#039;s dirtiest secret, even dirtier the black-sites that XCOM broadcast worldwide two months ago. We are living, breathing proof that Elder control is not absolute, nor is their technology infallible. Each of us was ADVENT at some point but somehow, the chip in our minds that fed their instructions to us through the psionic network malfunctioned. Freed from their control, we sought to liberate others and bring down their rule.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">This all seemed like an absolute load. So a hyper-advanced alien race enslaves others with an implanted chip, but doesn&#039;t program it with a fail-safe or something which prevents the slave from turning? Even in human engineering, if a circuit is interrupted or something, the entire machine can be made to shut down. And their technology, which has never before been shown to have fault, just starts turning up bugs and errors like any other bit of software? What, did it run on Windows?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I can see you still have a great many questions, Liam. My soldiers and I will be here for a day longer. I invite you and Vee to rest in our camp; the wilds are more dangerous these days as beasts kept in check by the Elders now run amok. We will discuss your journey in the morning and put to rest any lingering doubts or persistent questions. Should you both choose to stay, you will sleep in the truck with the door closed and locked from the outside -- for yours and our protection. Whoever is on watch will listen should you have need of anything during the night.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I deferred to Vee with an unsteady gaze. This was her world after all, full of things and people I knew nothing about. Skirmishers? Chryssalids? Mind-chips? She quickly agreed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Very well. Jova will have the first watch. Follow him and try to get some rest; do not burden yourself now with trying to form questions for tomorrow.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He motioned to the opening, permitting us our exit, where our guard Jova waiting for us to fall in behind him. Outside, the other three Skirmishers made for the second tent while we were instructed to enter the back of the truck. The stark black interior was more than just a little cramped. Either side had a brushed metal bench seemingly molded up from the floor, wide enough only to sit on. Spare pieces of armor lined the walls, and a few boxes of what looked like shell casings sat against the driver&#039;s cabin door, itself a solid piece of metal with just a barred window allowing one to see inside. A single red light was attached to each of the far corners, giving the inside an inoffensive glow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Here are your blankets and sleeping bag,&quot; said Jova, tossing our things in behind us. &quot;Your other belongings will be returned to you upon your departure. Should you require anything, knock on the door and the fire watch will assist you.&quot; He took our silence as permission to exuse himself and shut the door. What sounded like a series of internal locks clicked into place, and Vee and I were left on our own.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She wasted no time in getting back to sleep. Before I had even turned around she had already set up her blankets and was doing her best to squeeze as much of herself as possible beneath them in such close quarters. She ended up with her head facing the driver&#039;s cabin, so I laid my sleeping bag out to face in the opposite direction. It was certainly uncomfortable, and I found myself wishing that I had my backpack, even though it made for a terrible pillow. I curled up into a fetal position to bring more of my body into the sleeping bag, so that my head was resting on the softer material instead of the harshly cold metal floor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It wasn&#039;t bad, but I after laying there for twenty minutes I found it impossible to sleep. Nevermind the fact the primal parts of my brain were telling me not to sleep beside a giant snake, but what Commander Argo had said, that he had never heard of a human befriending a viper -- why was that? Sure, vipers were intimidating, and even having been around Vee so much, that feeling&#039;s not really gone away, but the fact was she had acted just like the refugees on television. She was hungry, on the run, looking for shelter. Was Argo trying to say that any other human would have just blown her away? Was it just in our nature to look at a viper and immediately think &#039;monster&#039;? And what about from their perspective? We must look pretty monstrous to them; no tail, brutishly thick arms, a big nose, hair, weirdly flat teeth, just to name a few things.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You awake, Vee?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I heard her body shifting as soon as I had spoken, and looked up to see her head poking up from the blanket pile she had made for herself. She craned her neck towards me. I guessed by now perhaps that was viper body language for &#039;I&#039;m listening&#039;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I wanted to say that -- the way things went down back at the house was bad. I know that. I know now it was going to be bad no matter what, and the end result would have been ugly no matter how it had happened. I mean -- I know you know that I -- look, we&#039;ve barely said a word to each other since this morning, let alone looked at one another. I feel we both know why, so I just wanted to say it plainly: I don&#039;t think you&#039;re a monster. I don&#039;t think you&#039;re evil. I don&#039;t want you to feel bad about defending yourself or saving me. Every second I&#039;m breathing after that night is thanks to you. I said it before, but you know, just for good measure -- thank you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She sighed and glanced down, aimlessly scanning the floor in that way people often do when lost inside of their own thoughts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Welcome.&quot; She dove again beneath the covers and said, &quot;Long trip. Tomorrow.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Sounds like it. Good night, Vee.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Good night. Liam.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">-Chapter 8-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Despite the odd, arguably harrowing circumstances, there had been no dreams or nightmares in my head. None that I could remember, anyway. Maybe I just didn&#039;t have enough in my head about the world as it was now, so I had no reference to draw on. It would be like asking someone to fill in the missing variables in an equation when they hadn&#039;t even heard of math. They just wouldn&#039;t comprehend what was being asked. Likewise, I just did not have a clue what I should or shouldn&#039;t be afraid of, and so my mind just kept coming up blank. I couldn&#039;t say it bothered me; it made for a deep sleep, after all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What did bother me was that somehow -- through the clouds, through the thick forest canopy, through the windshield and finally through the little tiny window in the door that separated the driver&#039;s cabin from the rear compartment  -- a perfect little beam of sunlight managed to find my eyes and rouse me awake.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vee seemed to have stretched out a bit in her sleep, and the tip of her tail extended out from the blankets and rested near my hand. I hesitated but couldn&#039;t figure out why. I had already put my hands on her while treating her wounds, and she&#039;s pulled me by my collar, wrapped up my legs so I didn&#039;t run back into my burning home, and lifted me by the arms. There shouldn&#039;t be a reason for me to hesitate, should there? Was I being too familiar?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I reached out and gently jostled her tail. Without gloves on, she certainly felt like an Earth snake -- cool and glossy, but with a firmness beneath that indicated how much damn muscle she must have had in her entire body. &quot;Vee,&quot; I said, watching as she began to stir, &quot;it&#039;s morning.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">While I wiped the sleep from my eyes and tried to swallow the dryness in my mouth, she was instantly alert from the moment she emerged from beneath her blankets. It was like I was still trying to rev my motor while she was already in fourth gear. She adjusted her shirt, smoothing out a wrinkle or two, and slid past me to knock on the door. She didn&#039;t even seem to have noticed I had touched her. It was exciting, in a &#039;giant step for mankind&#039; sort of way. How many humans could say they&#039;ve touched an alien and not been ripped apart? The last year has been nothing but conflict, resistance and ADVENT at each other&#039;s throats where the only things they were touching each other with was bullets and bombs. And here I was just shaking Vee awake like we were at a damn slumber party and I was the first one up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We waited for a moment longer before one of the troopers opened the door. The watch must have changed during the night because this one&#039;s armor was slightly different from Jova&#039;s, who had locked us in last night. This new trooper had bright blue line slashing down the right side of the breastplate, jumping out against the stark white armor. I wasn&#039;t sure yet which one this was, so I played dumb just a little to try and get a name.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Jova?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Five,&quot; said the trooper -- the one that hadn&#039;t chosen a name for herself yet. &quot;The others are hunting for breakfast and will return shortly. Until then, you are free to wander but do not expect any privacy. Should either of you need to relieve yourselves, you will be escorted to the field latrine. It bears repeating you will not be given privacy.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Uh, thanks. I&#039;ll hold it.&quot; I moved aside to let Vee out of the truck. She hit the ground and spun, twisting her back in a lot of different ways that made me start to feel older than I already was. She turned to Five, who was watching her far more keenly than she was me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Water?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Bucket by the fire barrel. Freshly boiled an hour ago.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The three of us sat in complete silence. I was listening to the sounds around us -- the birds mostly, who were going about their own morning routines. Though it was impossible not to notice that Five had not looked at me since she had let us out of the truck. I guess the viper was ten times the threat an unarmed human would ever be. It was something that Vee absolutely noticed as she took small sips from the water bucket, watching Five from the corner of her eye. I started to feel a little more tension than I felt was appropriate, given the fact that these skirmishers clearly meant us no harm. Maybe Vee didn&#039;t like being eyed with suspicion?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Why the name &#039;Five&#039;?&quot; Vee looked away once Five turned her attention to me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I was the fifth member of this cell, recently liberated from my garrison. I am unable to decide on a name.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Is that important to you?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;It shouldn&#039;t be, but it feels as such. Troopers were never given names within the ranks of ADVENT; only officers were, given how often they would liaise with civilian offices. Choosing a name is fully realizing one&#039;s freedom from the false gods -- the Elders, as humans came to know them.&quot; She turned again and nodded her head at Vee, who was now warming herself by the fire. I wondered if she was exothermic like Earth&#039;s reptiles. &quot;How did she choose her name? We have not met many vipers, and even fewer were approachable.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I asked if she had one. She only showed me a barcode, so I offered up Vee. She seemed to attach pretty quick to it, even though I had a whole book of alternatives she could have chosen from.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;A former soldier of ADVENT -- not even a biped -- shows up at your door and the first thing you do is offer her food, shelter, and clothing,&quot; Five said, grunting at her own apparent disbelief. &quot;You are a peculiar human.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Is it that odd?&quot; I asked, knowing full well what her answer would be. Keeping her attention on me seemed to keep Vee relaxed, so I would keep talking as long as I could.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;The war has been over for just two months. Even still, pockets of ADVENT forces still fight. Humans do not have much empathy these days for non-humans -- when have they ever had reason to? Even those of us sympathetic to their cause receive dirty looks and scandalous whispers as we pass by. Most of us choose to keep our helmets on, for many recoil in shock when seeing our faces; until XCOM&#039;s broadcast, many thought we were simply human volunteers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;For you act as you did towards a viper is even more surprising. Humans have no room at all in their hearts for things that crawl or slither. It&#039;s ingrained, some sort of evolutionary response. Even if a human is not afraid of a snake, he knows full well to avoid one. So you are quite peculiar; either very brave or very weak to allow her to control you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I supposed I was right then, about what Argo had said last night. Any other human would have shot Vee on sight. That explained his insistence on thinking of me as her captive, and his surprise when I confirmed she was in fact, a friend. To be honest, it sounded like most vipers were shoot-on-sight for a lot of the world. Skirmishers certainly seem to avoid them when able. Maybe Vee&#039;s surprise the night she and I had met was two-fold; not only had I helped an alien, but perhaps she couldn&#039;t understand why I had helped her specifically.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;But,&quot; she added, relaxing her grip on her rifle a little, &quot;I cannot say you don&#039;t spark a glimmer of hope within me. Jova said you did not recoil upon seeing the Commander&#039;s face. You do not attempt to avoid contact, nor treat us or even this Vee as less than yourself. Even having spoken to you for only ten minutes, it would be nice if more humans were like you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I didn&#039;t have the heart to tell her that I was practically frozen in fear when I saw Argo&#039;s face, nor could I immediately discount her appraisal of me as weak. I couldn&#039;t even bring myself to defend my own life. Vee had done it for me.  I was very weak in some respects, but I wouldn&#039;t admit it to anyone else. On the other hand, I was just beginning to find out in which ways I was strong. That was a short list at the moment, however.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It was then a second trooper emerged from the tent Vee had been held in last night, catching everybody&#039;s attention; I immediately recognized the armor as Jova&#039;s, the one that had taken first watch. He appeared to be struggling to carry a crate of some sort in his arms, his steps mostly shuffling through the dirt as he made his way to the open rear of the truck. It looked as if it took a lot of effort for him to heft it up chest high to get it onto the floor, then he hopped inside to slide it all the way in until it came to a stop against the cabin door. He went back to the tent and emerged with another crate just like it, though by how he moved that one must have been lighter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Could I help you at all?&quot; Jova didn&#039;t even realize I was speaking to him. He just kept at it, and only when I asked him again on his way back into the tent did he stop.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;What?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Can I help you?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">If I could have seen his face I imagined he might have had a deer-in-the-headlights sort of look; he was abnormally still, those glowing slits in his helmet focused intensely on me. After a few moments he looked at Five, who only shrugged in response.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I suppose so,&quot; he said.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I made my way into the tent with Jova. Everything was already neatly packed away into black and grey crates maybe half the size of my old television. Some were open and inside was a mixture of things I had no clue about. One box was filled with things that looked like tablets, neatly standing and compacted like papers in a filing cabinet&#039;s drawer. They were black and thinner than any tablet I had ever seen, with red screens sporting a faint honey-comb pattern that seemed to float on top of the display. Another crate was filled hallway with empty shell casings and on top of those were small bags of black and grey powder -- most likely materials used to make their own ammunition. More crates still had papers, computer parts, some odds and ends I did not immediately recognize. It was like emptying out an old office. If I had to guess, Argo and his soldiers had been here for several days at the least. This seemed like to much stuff to unpack and then put away again for a one or two day stay.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The first crate I tried to pick up felt like a ton. The next one was maybe half a ton. Not wanting to embarrass myself, I went around gently shoving different crates to see if they were easy to move or not. Upon finally finding one that I was able to scoot more than a couple inches, I heaved it up with a few deep breaths. My balance shifted and my feet instinctively spread wider to accommodate the extra load. I was leaning back pretty far to support most of the new weight on my chest; I wouldn&#039;t be able to carry more than a few like this. I wasn&#039;t that much smaller than Jova, and the constant work around the house kept me in shape. Not as much as constant warfare did, I&#039;m sure, but I wondered if the armor these skirmishers wore had something within to enhance their strength.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">When I went back for a second, lighter box, Vee followed me in without a word. We shared a momentary look before she set to work. Instead of using her arms, she slid her body around one of the boxes, catching it in the arch of an s-curve, then shuffled it across the floor with her as she slithered. Despite looking a little more complicated, it seemed effortless for her, and also appeared to confirm that her arms weren&#039;t exactly that strong even compared to a human&#039;s. She scooted it up to the truck, jumped inside, and lifted the crate inside -- all with her tail and lower body. The only thing she used her hands for was pulling her upper body into the truck and bracing them against the seats as she pulled the crate up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">This went on for a little while, the three of us going back and forth from tent to truck while Five stood watch, her rifle held low. Everything seemed all right at first, but something within her changed as we kept working. Where before she had kept her gaze trained thoroughly on Vee, now she could not stop staring my way. Her posture would noticeably shift and her movements became erratic, as though she were desperately trying not to fidget and would over-correct whenever she caught herself doing so. She flexed her hands around the grip of her weapon -- never did her finger go near the trigger but it made me nervous all the same.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Please stop,&quot; she hoarsely whispered, staring at the dirt between her feet. Though normally stern and authoritative, she spoke with a shakiness that made her two-tone voice almost sound like it had added a third to the mix. &quot;Please.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I froze dead in my tracks, unsure of what I had done wrong. Vee stood beside me just as perplexed as I was, though she slowly but subtly began to slide herself in front of me, as if putting herself between me and Five. I backtracked to the truck and sat down on the ground, out of the way of Jova who seemed unconcerned with what was happening. I wanted to ask Five what was wrong but every time I opened my mouth, something told me to stop, that her answer was either something she would not want to share or would be something I wouldn&#039;t want to hear. I kept trying to convince myself to ask, but before I could work up the courage, snapping branches and crunching leaves drew my attention to the forest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Commander has returned,&quot; Jova said, not even bothering to look up from his work. I wondered if his helmet had a communicator or something inside. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Either way, he was right. Commander Argo and the other two skirmishers -- Edix and Sally, if I recalled -- came trudging out from the woods into camp, their legs caked from the knees down in mud with streaks running through it, as if they had already tried to clean it off and had given up. I didn&#039;t know of any nearby streams nor had it rained for several days, so I wasn&#039;t sure where the mud had come from. Dead leaves stuck to them, though underneath I could see bright green flashes of some grass or reeds of some sort.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;C-sticks again, I&#039;m afraid. Another unsuccessful hunt,&quot; said Argo, clapping Five on the shoulder as he walked by. She straightened up immediately, like she hadn&#039;t just a moment ago been on the verge of some kind of breakdown. &quot;Liam, Vee, this way, please.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I took one more look at Five before Vee and I fell in behind Argo and we made our way into the tent I had been interrogated in last night. A few of those tablets  I had seen packed away laid scattered about, but only one had a soft glow emanating from its screen. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;C-sticks? What are those?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Calorie sticks,&quot; Argo said, taking a small bite of something that looked a lot like a stick of jerky. &quot;Standard ADVENT issue, ultra-dense nutrition made entirely of plant protein and synthetic vitamin supplements that provides all of a trooper&#039;s dietary needs. Suitable for human consumption as well, though they often complain it sits heavily on their stomachs -- like a ton of bricks, I&#039;ve heard one say.&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He broke off a tiny piece about half the size of my thumbnail and offered it to me. &quot;This is only to taste; a full portion is indicated by the indents on the stick  itself. It is imperishable and one stick lasts a human for a week.&quot; He gestured for me to try it before handing a much larger portion to Vee, who ate it without a second thought.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It was obnoxiously chewy and tough, like gum that was long, long overdue to be spat out. Just by how it looked, I was surprised to find it was nearly entirely bland and odorless; the one thing I could detect was a faint herbal scent that reminded me mostly of mint but it lacked the strength of the real thing. Even as small a piece as I had eaten, I swore I could feel it hit the bottom of my stomach like a rock. My morning hunger was sated almost instantly, though it sure wasn&#039;t as satisfying as getting real food into my belly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Argo put the rest of the C-stick away into one of the many pouches lining his belt. &quot;With breakfast taken care of, what questions might you have for me before we discuss your journey north? If you lived in seclusion as you describe, you must have many questions about the world today. And given by how little your viper friend speaks, I will hazard a guess that she is still coming to grips with speaking human languages instead of only understanding them and cannot ably answer all of your inquiries.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I had a few questions on my mind that felt more important, but one in particular had been nagging me since last night. &quot;Why do you all speak so -- what&#039;s the word I&#039;m looking for -- highly? Fancy? Like it&#039;s not how people talk anymore. All of you sound like something out of an old play.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He allowed himself a genuine laugh which put me well enough at ease, though the nature of his voice made it sound louder, more raucous. &quot;A remnant of our former servitude to the false gods. In all of Earth&#039;s languages, our vocabulary, articulation, grammar -- everything  was specifically designed to induce subservience during the earliest stages of the invasion and subsequent insertion into all levels of human society. When one speaks authoritatively, others tend to listen whether they submit to that authority or not. It was one of the myriad ways the false gods maintained careful control of ADVENT&#039;s image.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Insertion into all levels of human society? What are you getting at? Alien teachers, doctors? That sort of thing?&quot; I couldn&#039;t keep myself from chuckling at the thought. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yes. Initially, clone rejects and mutations were recycled -- broken down and reused in other projects,&quot; Argo said. I was surprised at first but I did seem to recall XCOM&#039;s broadcast exposing most of ADVENT as clones. I wondered if his subordinates looked the same as he did. &quot;But the false gods found a new use for them. Instead of breaking down the flawed viper that was hatched with a smaller hood or without venom sacs, she was instead put into a gene clinic as a nurse to care for the ill and injured. The trooper created with the wrong pigmentation was made into someone&#039;s friendly neighbor, meant to smile and wave when he saw you step out to your mailbox. Every seemingly insignificant action ADVENT ever took was at the direction of the false gods, meant to ingratiate their forces into human society.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Okay, hang on,&quot; I said, fighting back chills at the mention of sentient beings being recycled. &quot;So the most advanced alien beings we&#039;ve ever known are making clones and somehow things go wrong? Like with your brain chip for instance -- why was that not programmed with some sort of fail-safe? If a chip was broken off from the mind control network or whatever you call it, why not have it blow up or something to prevent the, er, slave from rebelling?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;The simple answer -- and one I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find lacking, as every human does -- is hubris. Though we cannot ask them ourselves now, one can only assume they believed their grand designs perfect, their biological machinations infallible. No fail-safes were made because their control would never fail. When they were producing millions of clones and only a handful turn up flawed, they must not have thought it was a design defect but merely a random act of the universe -- a short circuit, perhaps. Who can say at this point? We still are unsure of how the first skirmisher broke free.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So defects were not unheard of, but were never taken as evidence of a problem in the system. I guess that made sense, even if it did leave me unsatisfied like Argo had guessed it would. The same principle applied to engineering and manufacturing. If a process was made that churned out a million parts, the process would not be changed if just one part came out defective. They would just chuck the defect away and keep going. I decided to switch topics, given that Argo had just admitted nobody actually knew why defects existed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;How do you guys choose names?&quot; I asked with the point of eventually pivoting to Five&#039;s strange behavior. &quot;Five was telling me only officers were given them, so that means you guys are coming up with stuff like Argo and Jova on your own.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;It is nothing as ceremonial or sentimental as you may imagine. We simply comb through our knowledge of Earth&#039;s languages and combine sounds until we find something that strikes us. Many of us choose something short and simple, as it is easy to remember and easier for humans to pronounce. The name itself is mostly unimportant, outweighed by the symbolism of being designated as something other than one of the false gods&#039; rank-and-file.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I couldn&#039;t figure out how to connect his answer to Five, so I just strung his answer to my next question as best I could. &quot;Could a decision like that make you act strangely? Like the pressure was getting to you?&quot; Argo cocked his head and stared blankly, unsure of what I was getting at. I explained to him what had happened just before he returned to camp -- how I had barely begun to help Jova before Five suddenly became jittery and pleaded for me to stop.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Argo sighed heavily, swallowing away a lump in his throat. Even Vee was now paying attention, as curious as I was.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Five is our most recent addition, liberated just three weeks ago from her garrison further north. She held many positions during her servitude, but by far the longest and most grueling was her position at a labor camp -- a benign term for death camp, one of many where all dissidents, undesirables, rebels, and criminals would end up. Five would stand guard, watching humans work themselves to literal death. The work wasn&#039;t even important; ADVENT possessed enormously automated manufacturing capability already. It was simply torture. Squalid conditions, near daily killings -- it was not a place anyone would want to be, alien or human. Even though she was controlled, compelled...those memories did not disappear with the psionic network. She is deeply traumatized, and I imagine standing watch over you as you helped -- even out of the kindness of your own heart -- brought her past surging to the forefront of her mind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;All of us live with these memories. We come to terms with it in our own ways, but it&#039;s not easy. It took me months to reconcile my new life with all the human blood that stained my hands as a result of the false gods&#039; control over me.&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I looked uneasily at Vee, feeling something like doubt bubbling up in the pit of my stomach. She knew I was watching her because she conspicuously stared straight ahead. All I could see from her were the subtle starts of a frown. Why did it bother me? From the moment I had met her I had guessed she was responsible for some death. She even confirmed it over dinner, telling me that her job boiled down to being a hunter-killer. Being twenty years old, she had probably seen plenty of action during ADVENT&#039;s occupation of Earth. What bothered me was that I don&#039;t think I&#039;d heard her yet express an ounce of regret. Where I spilled my guts to the first person I had met in eight years, she still closely guarded herself -- as was her right, given that much of the world these days probably wanted her dead. She wasn&#039;t like Argo, telling me how long it had taken her to come to terms with what she had done. She wasn&#039;t like Five, visibly distressed over anything that brought up memories of her past life.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Argo&#039;s large eyes shifted between Vee and I as he crossed his arms. I guess even an idiot could have picked up on the sudden change in the tent, so it must have been incredibly obvious to him. &quot;But the past is past. Everyone must work through it. Some are lucky enough to have understanding company, and some must do it by their lonesome,&quot; he said as he grabbed a tablet from the table. He switched it on and spun it to face me; a map dominated its display. &quot;But I&#039;m afraid I must stop the questions now; our fuel drop will arrive shortly, and then we must be on our way. We must speak of your journey north.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He swiped his fingers across the screen before magnifying the east coast of the United States. Former United States, I guess. The borders of the formerly ADVENT-regulated zone popped up, and he pointed at a specific grid square. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;This is where we are now. And City 31,&quot; he said, sliding the map up and up and up, &quot;is over here. That&#039;s nearly one thousand kilometers if you followed the main thoroughfare, or about six hundred miles. If you had transport, it would be a days trip, even with frequent stops, but you would pass through reported ADVENT hotspots and heavily populated resistance zones. Given the chaos that now grips much of the world, I would avoid contact with others as much as possible. Vee, you&#039;re liable to be shot on sight, and you, Liam, are likely to be taken prisoner if not executed for being a suspected collaborator. Refugee zones are especially suspicious of aliens right now, so stay clear of them as well. Now, look here.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He slid the map a hair to the right and the image shifted, showing the glowing line that denoted the borders of the Eastern Trade Zone or whatever it was ADVENT had called it. &quot;A majority of Earth&#039;s population still resides in the formerly ADVENT-controlled trade zones. If you stay outside their borders, your chances improve dramatically. The only caveat being the wilds are patrolled by other aliens still just as ruthless as they were under ADVENT control. We tracked berserkers wandering here, here, and here, and further north of them was a pod of chryssalids. Though dangerous to all who cross their paths, they are more predictable in their animalistic tendencies than humans or other aliens.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He zoomed out again and highlighted several points along our intended path, jabbing each with his finger to make sure we understood what he was about to say. &quot;Under no circumstances should you ever attempt to traverse any cities outside of the trade zone&#039;s borders. I cannot possibly stress this enough. They are overrun by Lost, and a crumbling cityscape makes for long, treacherous traversal. Going around a dead city is preferable in all cases, even if it adds days or weeks to your travel.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Purifiers. Failed?&quot; Vee hissed, narrowing her eyes at the several glowing spots on the map. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;The purifier squads were never going to stop them. As far as we could tell, their only job was containment.&quot; I had no clue what either of them were talking about so I just kept my mouth shut and waited for Argo to move on. &quot;You have a long way to go, Liam and Vee. If you are able to cover twenty miles a day, you&#039;re looking at about a month of walking. Safely secure whatever transport you can whenever you can. Avoid the dead cities at all costs and the living ones if you are able. Your possessions are waiting by the truck, along with some provisions we can spare. You&#039;ll each have a month&#039;s worth of c-sticks, and Liam -- you&#039;ll have a pair of boots and two pairs of socks.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That picked me right up. Didn&#039;t even have to trade for them. I guess being clones, they all shared the same size and had plenty to spare. I wasn&#039;t worried about the hiking so long as I had some good boots. A month of walking was certainly more than I had ever done before in my life, but I was no stranger to the outdoors. Dad and granddad were both avid hikers and they&#039;d bring me along on their shorter trips.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You may take this datapad as well; the map is fully interactive and marked with suspected problem areas,&quot; he said, pushing the tablet across the table into Vee&#039;s hands. &quot;I wish the both of you best of luck. Truly, I do. Should you encounter any other skirmisher cells, bring up my name. I will vouch for you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Thank you, Commander Argo.&quot; I thought using his rank and name sounded more respectful. He walked us to the tent&#039;s opening and had Five bring us to our things by the truck. They had already packed up the rest of the camp. The other tent was gone, the fire barrel was in the truck and all evidence of a campsite had been practically erased. Not even the fire&#039;s ashes had been left behind, presumably scattered to the wind. With everything gone, the place looked like just another piece of nature. Were they actively trying to hide their trail? From what? These skirmishers seemed like professionals; what could possibly scare them into covering their tracks so thoroughly? It must be standard operating procedure for them, like some sort of special ops stuff. I wouldn&#039;t leave evidence behind if I was a super soldier-type in the wilderness. Maybe that was why Vee had lost the trail as we had gotten closer to their camp; they had done an impeccable job cleaning up the scene of the firefight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">All of our stuff was exactly where Argo had said, packed even more neatly than Vee had done. Even the shotgun was there, leaned against the hiking pack. Vee grabbed that first and checked to see if it was loaded while I took a look at the boots. They didn&#039;t appear the same as the skirmishers&#039; angular black boots beneath their armor. These were sort of nondescript with a tan color like sand; they were just regular hiking boots. Luckily they fit comfortably enough, but a faint spatter of blood across the top gave me pause, and it was then I remembered Eric and Gerard had been forced to leave Donovan&#039;s body behind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;We do not loot the dead,&quot; Five said, noticing the reason for my hesitation. &quot;Refugee centers are facing shortages of every kind. We gather everything that can be reused so that others do not go wanting.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I wondered if she thought I had been judging her. Not that I could, though. Half of our stuff was taken from Eric and Gerard. &quot;What did you do with him? His body, I mean.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;He was given a proper burial,&quot; she said. She returned my surprise with her own. &quot;It was the right thing to do.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vee paused for just a second, like a machine going through a negligible hitch. She just kept checking our bags, clearly faking indifference to my scrutiny in that moment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Before you go, Liam and Vee, I wanted to ask you both something.&quot; Five waited until she had our attention; it was a bit longer as Vee had to repack everything she had checked and seemed unwilling to stop even for a moment. &quot;I&#039;ve given some thought to a name. I feel meeting an...agreeable viper and a human unperturbed by our appearance is significant. And I enjoy how simple your names are. Would either of you be opposed if I took the name Veelee? I still haven&#039;t been able to choose a name, but this one could be a candidate.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Veelee. Vee. Liam, minus the second syllable. Sort of cute, to be honest. Sounded feminine enough, though I don&#039;t know if that was important to a skirmisher. Jova and Edix sounded unisex, so maybe masculinity and femininity didn&#039;t matter. I felt a smile growing across my face as I repeated the name in my head, taking some small amount of pride in unwittingly helping someone choose something so important to them. Vee looked at me and shrugged; she didn&#039;t seem to mind at all and made no objections as she shouldered the hiking pack and then slipped the smaller one onto my back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Go for it. Sounds like a good name. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be happy with whatever you choose.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I felt a rumbling in my bones and a shrill roar bordering on screaming grow louder and louder in mere seconds. Some sort of four-engine airship floated down low enough to just skim the top of the trees, obscuring the sun and casting the area in shade. It was hard to tell from the ground, but it looked like a side door opened, and a line dropped out to hit the dirt. Three canisters slid down the line by way of a motorized equipment harness. The moment they were in reach, the skirmishers grabbed them and emptied them into the truck&#039;s tank, and then the empty canisters were sent back up. The airship immediately departed and all was quiet once again. What surprised me most was the entire exchange had probably taken less than five minutes. By the time the airship had shrunk away again into the sky, all of the skirmishers were loaded up into the truck, the back door left wide open and waiting only for Five.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Good luck, Liam and Vee. I hope you make it to City 31. I hear things are nicer there for non-humans.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Thanks. For everything, I mean. Especially the boots.&quot; I wanted to offer her some sort of forgiveness, something that told her she couldn&#039;t hold herself responsible for a former life that had never been hers to begin with. I couldn&#039;t put it into words nor did I know if she would take me seriously, and on second thought I didn&#039;t know if it was even my forgiveness to give. I just offered my hand instead. She recoiled and I wondered for a moment if she even knew what I was doing. A second later she grabbed hold with crushing gusto and shook me comically hard, like it was the first handshake she&#039;d ever gotten. Those armored suits they wore must do something for their strength because she nearly took me off my feet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You are most welcome,&quot; she said. It was amusing that even with her two-tone voice, it was still easy to hear the smile behind her words.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A moment later she was gone and the truck disappeared roughly eastward on a dirt path that could barely be called a makeshift road, and only just wide enough to fit the vehicle. It looked frequently used; how many times throughout my isolation had others traveled so close to my home and I had never known? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Behind me, Vee had her face buried in the datapad. I stood on my toes to try and peer over her shoulder but still wasn&#039;t tall enough. She slightly hunched forward to give me a better look and I saw her making adjustments to the path Argo had laid out. Though it was a little different, I recognized the interstate system and saw the roads like capillaries running across the country. She traced a claw over the screen, moving the map further and further north until we saw our destination in front of us like a carrot on the end of the longest stick.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;No roads. At all,&quot; she said. &quot;Dangerous. Well-traveled. Stay in wilds. Just beyond.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Does your name bother you?&quot; That got her to look up from the screen, her features softening into a questioning look that asked me why we were revisiting this. &quot;Names were so important to them. Making one up on their own was like...the first step towards being their own person. I never meant to take that from you if you wanted it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Like Vee. Good name. Given by good--,&quot; she whispered like she was embarrassed to admit it, tearing her eyes from mine to look down at the screen again. I could tell she was about to choose her words carefully by how her jaw seemed to shift before she even spoke, as though we were back in the living room of the house with her learning how to move her mouth to make the right sounds. &quot;Name was offered. I chose to take -- it. I chose to take it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hey, pronouns! I was wondering when they were going to show up!&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She sighed, punctuating it with a low, angry-sounding hiss, and spun around to make her way through the forest at a faster than usual clip.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Come on, I didn&#039;t mean to make you feel bad. Hey, wait up! Seriously, I don&#039;t want to run into a chrysalis on my own, or whatever it was Argo said. Vee!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">-Chapter 9-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We stuck to the wilds just as told, skirting the edges of the East Coast trade zone&#039;s borders, according to the map on the datapad. Though still quite some distance from any real civilization, small, empty towns and derelict commercial zones a few miles off their highway exits littered our path for the first couple of days. Vee thought we wouldn&#039;t hit any true wilderness for at least a week. As such, moving around was still a tense, sometimes aggravatingly slow affair. I had quickly learned that Vee despised empty spaces, and would rather stick to a tree line that went around any wide open clearing even if it took us another couple of hours. The only time this rule didn&#039;t apply was if the field was full of tall grass, something for her to sink low into, and for me to crouch down and follow. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Our path was also unavoidably intersected by old residential roads long since unused, and crossing them was an even more stressful undertaking. Vee insisted we sit for a minimum of twenty minutes -- sometimes up to an hour -- just observing the road, watching for any disturbances before we committed to crossing. If there was cover while crossing a street, she was more comfortable. Wrecked cars, an overturned tanker, a old military barricade from the invasion days -- anything at all that could break up lines of sight from even one direction made her noticeably less anxious, but no less cautious.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We sat tight for thirty minutes, waiting to see if anyone or anything else was watching the same little stretch of dilapidated road as we were. Across the street was an old gas station. At least I thought it was old; it had no recharge stations for electric or hybrid vehicles. Between it and us was the road, clogged end to end for at least a quarter mile with burnt out vehicles decades old, blackened and browned by fires and the inevitable encroachment of rust. I didn&#039;t see a barricade or pile-up at the front, so I wasn&#039;t really sure why this line of cars existed out here in the middle of nowhere.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vee noticed where my focus was and said, &quot;Ambushed. Probably. Evacuated, then caught in the open. No time to reverse or accelerate. Possible bombardment, followed by deployment of troops.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her speech was quickly improving. She was beginning to actually talk normally instead of exhaling with every word, and could speak for a little longer each day without having to unnaturally and exaggeratedly pause for breaths between sentences. &quot;Why would aliens just descend on a traffic jam?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Terror,&quot; she said, her frown deepening. Her forked tongue lashed out to taste the air, longer than usual, like she was straining to pick up any scents she could. Her shoulders sagged and she let go of a quiet breath. I had learned now that meant she was relaxed. &quot;Structure across the street. Four walls, only one side with windows. Good rest stop; defensible.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A quick breather sounded good to me. The sun was high overhead and the heat was just on the verge of being unbearable. How much of an inconvenience the sun was, now that I couldn&#039;t just disappear into my home the moment things became hot and sticky. Vee never seemed bothered by the heat. I envied her for that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She broke cover first and I quickly followed, the both of us dashing to the line of wrecked cars in the street. I had to take care not to trip over the potholes mother nature had carved out, grass and vines uprooting every inch of asphalt that was left. We sidled along for a few moments until finding a vehicle with its doors open, offering cover on three sides when we nestled between them. It was an SUV, apparently loaded up with everything the occupants could have carried. It was so laden down with clothes, coolers, and boxes that it barely had any ground clearance; either that or the rust had caused the suspension to fail, having been out here in the elements for twenty years. The doors were swung as wide open as possible, which made me think whoever had been inside had flung them open and bolted when they saw whatever it was that had scorched the rest of the road.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">After a momentary pause and a quick scan of the gas station, Vee slid over the front passenger and driver seats, while I -- afraid of catching a sharp, rusty edge or something -- carefully squeezed myself between the SUV and the sedan in front of it. She moved incredibly fast, her body leaning forward so far it looked like she was perpetually falling as she dashed forward. By the time she was already well inside the gas station, I was just barely reaching the front doors which precariously hung from the frame on busted hinges.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The inside was just as much of a mess as could be expected after decades of isolation. The tiled floor had been uprooted just like the street outside; grass and weeds sprouted up as though they&#039;d found the perfect place to call home, eagerly filling in every crack and crevice that the elements had weathered into the ceramic and concrete beneath. The shelves -- all obviously bare now -- were moved away from the entrance, as though something big had crashed through and effortlessly shoved everything aside. The paint on the walls had long since faded. Among the ugly white now speckled by blank spots of chipped paint, a single faint red stripe ran around the interior at eye level, offering the only bit of color in the place. The coolers were all empty and the glass and plastic shattered, the previously refrigerated drink racks overtaken entirely by molds and an abundance of mushrooms. A sign hung from a chain above the checkout. Though mottled by dirt and much of the image flaked off, it was still just possible to read: free donut with purchase of a large coffee. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">If I could have remembered what either of those things tasted like, I might&#039;ve waxed nostalgic.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Slow progress,&quot; Vee said as she studied the map, coiling her body beneath her. &quot;Should be faster.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;We&#039;re shadowing the main highway, aren&#039;t we? Even as far as we are from it, we&#039;re bound to hit this many roads. Not to mention every clearing we come to has you spooked.&quot; She glanced up just to narrow her eyes at me. &quot;I&#039;m not poking fun. Better we move slow than end up dead, right? Like you said, it would be about a week until we hit actual wilderness. Until then, steady as she goes.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She put the datapad back into the hiking pack and decided that while she was in there, she&#039;d take out a small piece of a C-stick.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hang on, I&#039;ve got something better,&quot; I said. She paused right before eating it, frozen on the spot like she wasn&#039;t sure what I meant. &quot;Better tasting, anyway. You&#039;ll still probably want to eat that to get your daily calories.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">My backpack, made heavier by my exhaustion and the afternoon heat, was a welcome load off my shoulders, even if just for a few minutes. I dug past the blanket and clothing, past the batteries and first aid kit, and continued to root around. The backpack was so full I couldn&#039;t see around its other contents and I wasn&#039;t going to empty the bag entirely, so I was forced to rely on touch. Vee cautiously slithered over, perhaps tempering her excitement. The last time I had surprised her, it was something good she had never had before. I wasn&#039;t about to disappoint now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Here it is,&quot; I said, seizing upon the plastic baggie that I knew had been buried somewhere in there. It was the jerky, taken from Eric as he no longer had need of it. There were a handful of long pieces, enough to last two people a couple of weeks as a sparse, intermittent treat. I tore a small bit off for a taste test; it was peppery and with just a tinge of spiciness competing against an equally faint sugary sweetness, a hint of salt beneath it all that told me it had only been meant as a preservative and not as a flavor. Newbies had a tendency to make it too dry, bordering on crunchy. This was tender and soft -- perfectly chewy. Whoever had made it was no novice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I think it&#039;s venison. Not too sure. It&#039;s been a little while since I&#039;ve had deer or even seen one.&quot; She gingerly took the piece offered to her and tasted its aroma, soaking up its flavors through her tongue. It flickered faster and faster, like she couldn&#039;t get enough of the scent. It was hard for her to even put it in her mouth, as though she had to fight the temptation to just sit there and continue tasting the air. When she popped it into her mouth, she shot me a look of surprise; I figured I might&#039;ve known why.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;That&#039;s spice,&quot; I said, only just now wondering how a snake could actually taste. Then again -- aliens. Who was to say for sure how they worked? &quot;It&#039;s not strong so it&#039;ll pass in a moment. I know you don&#039;t really chew things, but just give it a second. The sweetness hits afterward.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She held it in her mouth, her jaw shifting as perhaps she was using her tongue to move it around. Her shoulders sagged and long, soft hiss slipped past her lips, all the while more and more of her body sank into her coils below. She was actually melting. I couldn&#039;t help laughing; I knew we were supposed to stay quiet, but holding it in hurt my sides too much.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Better than my chicken?&quot; She nodded without a moment&#039;s thought. &quot;Ouch,&quot; I said with a laugh, watching as she began to gain back control of herself. &quot;God, mankind could&#039;ve put everybody into a food coma if you had let us. The way my family ran a kitchen would&#039;ve blown your mind. I wish you guys had come in peace.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She swallowed, suddenly looking rather glum. &quot;I do too.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I thought it would be a good time to press her; did she? Did she regret her part in the invasion and occupation? Did she wish she could wash her hands of the blood that stained them? Was she still trying to overcome the memories and experiences forced onto her by the Elders or did she rationalize it all away by saying it couldn&#039;t have been her fault? That last possibility drew a hint of anger from somewhere inside of me that I couldn&#039;t figure out. It made sense, but for someone to just clap the responsibility from their hands like dust and move on seemed callous, cruel even. To not show a modicum of remorse, or even a second spent wishfully thinking it could have happened differently, even though one was mind-controlled into doing it...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vee tightened her coils around herself, as though she were closing herself off. Maybe she knew why I had grown silent. I wasn&#039;t angry at her, however. I hadn&#039;t known her for long, but I don&#039;t think anybody could call her callous or cruel now. And the regret was certainly there; she wished things could have happened differently. But most of humanity would not care. I wondered if maybe that&#039;s why she hadn&#039;t really opened up to me yet -- I was still &#039;most of humanity&#039; to her in some form or fashion.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She took out the datapad again and pretended to study the map even more intently than before, even though our path had not changed. &quot;We should move. Soon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yeah. Okay, just let me, uh, take care of business.&quot; Vee looked at me quizzically, motioning to the immediate surroundings. &quot;I&#039;m not a savage. if there&#039;s a room for it, I&#039;ll do it there.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">An open door in the back of the gas station still bore the universal blue-and-white signs of male and female above the frame. I made my way towards it, curiously noting how the empty shelves seemed pushed away from the most direct path to the restroom. Something big had stormed through the store and made a beeline to the restroom. The hair on the back of my neck began to tingle, but imagining even aliens feeling nature&#039;s call in the middle of an invasion got a little laugh out of me and the fear dissipated.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Only to rise again when three skeletons and their empty eye sockets stared at me from the darkest corner of the restroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Holy shit!&quot; I stumbled backwards, knocking into the closest shelf. In an instant Vee was beside me, her hand on my shoulder ready to yank me backward, though her grip loosened when she saw there was no immediate danger. &quot;I&#039;m fine, I&#039;m fine. They just startled me.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Two skeletons sat in the corner. A smaller skeleton sat between the two, and I had the overwhelming sense that I should not have looked, that I had walked in on an intensely private moment that no other person had ever been meant to see. A rusted revolver laid between the legs of one of the adults, resting against the pelvic bones, and a thick layer of moss or lichen or something grew up and over their legs like a blanket. They must have died defending themselves. I couldn&#039;t bear to look anymore and averted my gaze, only for my eyes to happen upon a child&#039;s backpack that bore the same brand as some of the luggage I had seen in the SUV still out in the street. Vee saw it too and slithered past me for a closer look, her focus sharpening like she was tracking another trail.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Ran from vehicle. Sheltered here,&quot; she said, running her hand across the crater in the thick wooden door. She stared long and hard at it before turning to look at the shelves all messily rearranged by whatever had crashed through the store. &quot;Plasma fire there and there; a muton pursued. Pushed shelving aside. Punched door open. Found family here.&quot; She picked up the revolver and checked the cylinder; I could hear it groan from the rust and grit caught in the mechanism, and the moment she finally managed to get the cylinder to move, it fell off entirely into her waiting hand. Her attention turned to the skeleton closest to the gun. She studied it, looking at it from every angle; dread flooded my mind when she pointed out a single hole in each of the skulls that I had failed to notice. &quot;Male. Shot other two, then himself.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I swallowed loudly enough to break Vee from her trance-like state. Shame flashed across her features for just a moment, but she added, &quot;Merciful. Plasma wounds painful. Muton&#039;s rage brutal.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I sure as hell didn&#039;t have the irreverence to do any business anywhere near them, nor did I want to be near such a scene at all; I was never the superstitious type but after hearing how things had gone down, the whole building suddenly felt cursed, the air itself heavy and choking. We packed up in silence, and after a quick stop by some bushes, we were on our way again through the woods behind the gas station.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That could have easily been me and my family. On our drive to the farmhouse, we could&#039;ve been caught in a convoy or traffic jam. We could have been descended upon by some hulking monstrosity, and try as we might to run, maybe we might&#039;ve ended up like those three skeletons. Dad had been so serious and taciturn when it came to defending the house, never saying a word when the time came but never backing away from any danger that threatened us. It had always been a fellow human, though. Would he still have had that resolve when faced with something that could wreck a store interior on its own, or knock a thick, heavy door right off its hinges? At the end of my questions I found one that seemed to overshadow all the rest: could there have been a point where he would have given up hope? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I had no clear answer, only an increasingly disturbing amount of hypothetical scenarios and gruesome ends. I distracted myself with the world around me; there were birds, alerting one another and endlessly bickering about territory or bragging how great a pick they were for a mate. Though still bright daylight, the moon was just visible in the sky, pale and faint, waiting for just a few more hours until it could glow as it always did. The crickets sensed the drop in temperature as the day wore on and began to chirp their own incessant songs. Things seemed so similar, like the invasion had never happened. As far as anyone could ever tell, this was a normal autumn day. Save for the giant, intelligent, two-armed snake keeping pace beside me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hey, Vee...&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I don&#039;t see any scars on you besides the two gunshots; how do you know plasma is painful? What would the muton had done to them that makes you think a father being forced to kill his own family is the merciful way out? Why did you have to explain what had happened? Why couldn&#039;t you have just let me think they had died fighting?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I sighed. &quot;What was your home like? Your planet, I mean.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Do not know. Earthborn.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I know, but there&#039;s records right? Pictures or video?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Possibly. Do not know. Information of all kinds. Closely guarded by Elders.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;What, like it&#039;s all secret?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Or erased.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So Vee actually had no place to truly call home. She didn&#039;t even know if they had a home planet. Maybe they never did. What if they were totally engineered as a species? Not just hatched for the singular purpose of fighting, but designed from the outset, the very first cell in their bodies grown with the intent of making the perfect war-fighter. With this, there&#039;d be a total lack of culture, of anything that defines them as a people. There&#039;d be no history, no heritage, no ancestry -- just an endless assembly line that spat out killers to enforce a regime as alien to them was they were to us. But that couldn&#039;t be the case -- if the Elders had made the perfect warrior, why would there be a need to mind control it? Should it not also been engineered to be loyal?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And they had language. Vee had said so, when I had asked if I could learn some of it. I&#039;ve heard her use different types of hissing, some with different pitches or intensity, some short and bursting with violent energy and others that seemed soft and inquisitive. Language implies some sort of culture. It&#039;s a means to communicate ideas and knowledge, to form identities and social groups. As far as I knew, no culture had ever existed without a language, and no language had ever existed that did not belong to a culture. They speak, therefore they are.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;ll bet you guys have a world just like ours. Forests and plains, oceans and deserts. Critters everywhere. Blue skies -- hell, green for all I know -- that stretch all the way to the horizon, some pink clouds or some other oddity. Maybe two suns or something else weird, like Tatooine -- damn, I can&#039;t use references on you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Good place to visit.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Right? Shoot, I&#039;d go.&quot; She turned, an odd little smirk tugging at the corners of her scaly lips. &quot;What?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Would not leave house for twenty years. Now you go to another planet?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hell, I&#039;m this far from home already. What&#039;s another couple hundred thousand or million light years?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She did it again; that slow, stuttering sort of hiss that Commander Argo had said was a viper&#039;s laugh. It was obviously different from what I was used to, but it seemed to hold the same power as any other human&#039;s laugh; the mood lightened and her guard was down even if for a moment. Vee was approachable, vulnerable. The soldier I knew she was disappeared and for a fleeting moment -- even with the scales, even with the snake body and large predatory eyes, even with the giant mouth and its two huge fangs -- she was more what I would call a normal person.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And in the next moment the soldier was back with a vengeance; her scowl deepened nearly to the point of actual anger, her hood seemed to flare wider than usual, and a short, harsh hiss froze me in place.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Don&#039;t move,&quot; she instructed. I was only vaguely aware of a line of pressure against my shin, as though I were about to trip over something. It was like an out-of-body experience, like I was watching someone else press their leg against a trap, feeling the tension knot my stomach as I waited for them to violently meet their end; I was watching a movie. It wasn&#039;t me. It couldn&#039;t be.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Don&#039;t move,&quot; she said again, sinking down to look. I wanted so badly to see what she saw, to just tilt my head down a few degrees to see how my death would come, but Vee&#039;s tone was commanding, assertive -- it was like she had a plan already. That little shred of hope was enough for me to grab hold of; sort of like trying to hold onto a fistful of sand, but it was better than nothing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Trip wire,&quot; she whispered. &quot;No effect. Yet. Must be tension-release. Old Earth military. Possibly. Don&#039;t move.&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her body gradually slipped from the edge of my peripheral vision and I heard her moving further and further away. My heart did it&#039;s best to jump up out of my throat but dread pulled it all the way back down into my gut; she was leaving me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Vee?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Wait.&quot; Wait for what? For her to get a head start and clear the blast radius? It was prudent, I guessed, though the logic did nothing for the cold sweat drenching my entire body. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;It&#039;s fine. It was a good run, wasn&#039;t it? If this is as far as I go, don&#039;t feel bad about it. I don&#039;t want you getting hurt if you can avoid it. Is it going to be quick?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">There was no answer, only the sound of her moving further away, oddly as if she were in the trees. My death was on my time now; it was a curiously comforting thought to know I would die only when I felt like moving my foot, and my breaths deepened and the tightness in my chest faded.So this was it. I survived an alien invasion for twenty years, was the last of my family as far as I knew, and in a week everything fell apart at the seams in the most absurd ways. Befriending an alien, being called a collaborator, having my house burnt down and being protected by alien clones afterwards. That was more excitement in the last week than I had experienced since the invasion, but I couldn&#039;t say it had been worth it if this was how I was going to go out. And after everything -- what had I done with my life? My parents died protecting their children. My brother helped fight and win a war against an overpowering alien force. And there was my life, sitting in the back of the proverbial bus hoping to escape notice, all the while not understanding it wasn&#039;t even worthy of any sort of notice to begin with.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Still, befriending an alien was something not too many people would get to look back on, I imagined. As strange a consolation as any in dire straits like mine, but I couldn&#039;t focus on anything else. I had said goodbye to my parents and come to to terms long ago with the probable death of my brother, Alex. and now, here at the end, I just found myself wishing I could&#039;ve known Vee a little longer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Done.&quot; Her voice beside me again nearly startled me enough to make me lose my balance.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Done what? What&#039;s done?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Trap disarmed,&quot; she said, holding up what looked like a haphazardly made chandelier of glass jars and bottles befitting an apocalyptic ballroom. &quot;Simple noise alarm. Suspended in the trees. No explosives.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I immediately doubled over, falling hard onto my hands and knees, and emptied out the scant contents of my stomach. Even when nothing was left I couldn&#039;t help but to keep heaving until my chest ached from the strain and burnt from the awful aftertaste of bile. I felt like crying but I didn&#039;t have the energy for even a single tear or sob after I had finally regained control of myself. Still panting, and with one or two more dry heaves, I wiped my mouth and sat up on my knees, suddenly feeling a lot lighter -- figuratively and literally.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Drink some water,&quot; Vee demanded as she collected the tripwire into a spool around her wrist. I unhooked the canteen from its loop on my overalls and took a small swig; she stared expectantly, so I took another drink and she went back to gathering the wire. When she was done, we were both looking at about twelve feet of strong, ultra-thin wire. I wasn&#039;t exactly an outdoor survivalist, but even I saw a myriad of uses for that. I could&#039;ve even used it around the house, so it was a no-brainer to take it with us out here. Fishing, snares, lashing things together -- we could use it for anything.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I wish you had said something sooner, holy hell. I was literally seconds away from moving my foot.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I said don&#039;t move.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yeah, but then you didn&#039;t answer and I heard you getting further away. I thought you were just getting to a safe distance.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Won&#039;t leave you,&quot; she quickly added, turning away to stash the wire in her hiking pack. Her voice in that moment was softer and trailed off at the end. It left me feeling very strange for reasons I couldn&#039;t pin down, but it wasn&#039;t something I had heard from her before. I wasn&#039;t so great with people these days, but I knew that when someone didn&#039;t want to look at me, they were usually hiding something; she took suspiciously long just to put some wire away.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Noise alarm,&quot; she said before I could get a word out, pointing at the bottles and jars on the ground. &quot;What does it mean?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;It means someone&#039;s been here before,&quot; I said, leaving behind her behavior from a moment ago. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Can you tell when?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It took me a moment to realize she was trying to teach me. After all, she had been a soldier; she could kill, track, deduce just as well as any detective, apparently. The only reasons for her questions were for my benefit. &quot;I guess sort of recently, right? The bottles look mostly clean. There&#039;s no mold or anything growing inside.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Good guess. If hung recently, what would that mean?&quot; I had to think on that for more than a moment; she could see I was getting hung up and changed her question. &quot;Type of alarm is noise. What is its purpose?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Alert someone to movement.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yes. Which means--&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Which means someone would have to be nearby to hear it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She took the datapad from her pack and switched it on, then pointed to a group of buildings a little ways off our current position. &quot;Good. Map marks a residential area. Half a mile north. Makes sense?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Placing an alarm that you&#039;ve got to be able to hear so far away doesn&#039;t seem right. Why would it be so far off?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Deterrent. Or perhaps somebody patrols the area. Understand?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I suddenly felt like I had more than one set of eyes on me, but Vee&#039;s attitude remained unchanged even with her revelation someone else may be nearby. She probably would have smelled them already if they were close. &quot;I think so. So do we want to go around or--&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;No. Open fields to the west; if it were me, I would watch fields for use. Dense commercial zone east, past major roads. Through residential zone risky, but arguably safer. Many vantage points, but plenty of cover. Stay very close, do exactly as instructed. Understand?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Crystal clear.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We crept along at a much slower pace than before. She still led the way on our approach to the neighborhood. It was a good thing too, because we came across three more of the same type of trap, more tightly clustered the further we went; she disarmed one more for another spool of wire -- just in case. We stopped at the edge of the treeline in the backyard of what looked like half of a house, the second floor mysteriously gone with the only hint it had ever been there was a staircase I could see through a rotted out wall. The back porch was entirely green with mold and mildew, wildly overgrown by weeds and vines that poked through every window and door, like mother nature herself was breaking and entering. The inside was no different; as we moved through the interior, each room was like its own ecosystem. A small patch dandelions in the corner of what looked to be the kitchen caught my attention; something moved from flower to flower. I thought it was just a mote of dust or pollen at first, but on closer inspection I had my breath stolen from me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Holy shit,&quot; I gasped. Vee&#039;s eyes snapped to me, then to where I was pointing. &quot;I haven&#039;t seen a bumblebee in years. I thought they went extinct.&quot; She was not nearly as impressed as I was and only reminded me to stay quiet by pressing a finger to her lips. &quot;Sorry.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We continued through the house, still wary of traps and of what laid beyond. We paused at the front door still tightly shut and peered through the sidelights. Again, I was dumbstruck by what waited for us outside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">There was not a single glimpse of black asphalt or white sidewalk to be seen. Every square inch of space in this abandoned neighborhood had been overtaken by nature, who had seen fit to plant a veritable garden smack dab in the middle of it all. From one end of the street to the other, porch to porch, the entire ground was overrun by the most breathtaking display of color I had seen outdoors since the invasion. Wildflowers of every kind and hue had sprung up in such chaos that the place seemed clogged to the point of being impassable. Bees swarmed everywhere, looking like specks of black from this distance that easily sprung out against the backdrops of reds, yellows, and whites. A single house down the street was recognizable only in shape; nature had seen fit to convert it to one giant flowerbed, though for some reason the other homes were left about as intact as the one we were in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I could see the change in Vee&#039;s posture, how she slouched and silently flicked her tongue as she looked out over the sea of color constantly shifting in the wind. I knew she saw the copious amounts of cover the tall grass and flowers would provide, but part of me wondered if she saw the same little paradise that I did -- the burst of color long overdue in a dreary world. Whether she did or not, I couldn&#039;t tell; she firmly pushed open the door and quickly slithered into the grass, seemingly swallowed up entirely by the vast green tide. I followed close behind, but no sooner had we made it halfway across when Vee suddenly stopped, her tongue furiously lashing out and her eyes wide open and alert. I silently mouthed &#039;what&#039; to her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Blood,&quot; she hissed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hello? Is somebody there?&quot; Another voice in the grass made my heart skip a beat; Vee&#039;s eyes focused like lasers in the direction it had come from, even though she could only see green. &quot;Please, I&#039;m hurt pretty bad. I was passing through and hit some kind of trap. I need help.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I rose to see what I could; a man in a red short-sleeved shirt trudged through the wildflowers with one hand up to shield his eyes from the sun. With a forceful hissing, Vee tugged me down by my arm. &quot;Don&#039;t.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;He says he&#039;s hurt, you said you smelled blood, and we know there are traps around. I can&#039;t just leave someone like that. What if he&#039;s bleeding out or something? We can help him. We haven&#039;t used any of the first aid stuff from the house.&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Before she could answer or tighten her grip, I sprang up to wave hello. He looked kind of middle-aged, maybe late forties or fifties; a salt-and-mostly-pepper beard covered the lower half of face. His red shirt was plaid, the sleeves torn off just a few inches down from his armpits. One hand waved back while the other stayed hidden below the grass-line; it moved limply, like it could only sway with the movements of his body. He wore a fisherman&#039;s vest, a few pockets stuffed full of odds and ends I couldn&#039;t make out from this distance. He had a bright smile on, happy to see another human in all this mess.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vee loosed another hiss, this one much louder and angrier sounding, before popping up beside me to assess the situation. Oddly, the man was unperturbed by her appearance and continued to approach.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Favors right side; possible weapon on waist,&quot; she whispered behind me. &quot;Left arm movements do not support injury; holding something heavy, possibly a long gun. Smile is disingenuous; lower eyelids do not move with the smile. Facial expression inconsistent; motor tics of the mouth and eyes. Don&#039;t.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A sound I hadn&#039;t hear before -- a sort of worrying groan -- drew my attention to Vee. &quot;Please just trust me on this. I&#039;ve been alone for a while but I&#039;m pretty sure I still know how normal people act. He&#039;s got a limp and a bum arm, and he&#039;s just trying to grin and bear it. I am human. I know humans.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">When I turned around, his other arm, previously hidden from sight was raised and pointed in my direction; a deafening boom just over my shoulder made my ears ring and all I could do was merely flinch away, too paralyzed by fear to duck or throw myself to the ground. The man crumpled backwards, his arm going high and a bullet cracked the air over my head like a whip. Vee advanced with the shotgun still at the ready, pushing me aside to storm ahead to where my would-be killer had fallen. I saw her look down into the grass and stand watch over him for just a few moments. Her shoulders sagged. That should have been it, but then she tensed up again, glaring at me as she returned to my side. The embarrassment was -- overwhelming couldn&#039;t even begin to describe it. I didn&#039;t even have time to be amazed at how quickly it all had gone down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;What did I say?&quot; She tersely whispered, barely moving her mouth as she angrily forced each word out. &quot;What did I say? Repeat it!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;m sorry, I won&#039;t--&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her eyes narrowed to slits so thin I couldn&#039;t even make out her pupils; just paper-thin red lines etched into her face through which all her fury seeped through. &quot;Repeat. It.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Do exactly as instructed,&quot; I said, meekly looking at the ground. My face burned even more; I was probably nothing more than a child to her, and she the disappointed parent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She sighed, but it was forced and sharp, like she was trying as hard as she could to vent the building wrath inside of her. &quot;I do not want to do this anymore,&quot; she said. &quot;Skills I never asked for and I do not want. Have made it too far from my burned-down garrison to go back to the way things were. Want a new life, understand? Free now! But what good is freedom when I still do the Elder&#039;s work for them? Try to avoid killing and the only human I befriend throws himself into trouble at every chance. I need you to--&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She stopped short, every inch of her body slouching just a little as whatever she was holding inside had finally dissipated. She had said her piece and and cleared her mind, and she was back to survival mode. &quot;I need you to search him. Rifle beside him, bullets in his jacket. Take what you can carry.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I wasn&#039;t sure if that was supposed to be a dig at me, a subtle reminder of the confrontation of the house where I had told her to get my gun, then turned it down in the dazed confusion of my first gunfight. I remember the shotgun feeling unbearably heavy in my hands, a boulder so heavy it would have been impossible to lift then. So what did she think I could carry? Was this a test? If I came back with a gun in my hands, I would be expected to use it wouldn&#039;t I? I knew how -- mechanically, anyway -- but even now, after two hostile encounters where I had skirted death by what felt like milliseconds, I still wasn&#039;t sure if I had it in me to pull the trigger on another person. At this point, way out here where Vee and I only had one another to rely on...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That was a weakness, wasn&#039;t it? I was holding myself back, and at some point it would endanger her or myself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The body was marred by too many pellets to count. Most of it had hit him square in the chest, a dark red constellation of entry wounds that spotted his shirt below the neck with holes. Much of what had been in his vest was useless now; some pistol rounds, an empty magazine, a knife, a canteen -- all damaged by the buckshot. On his waist, beneath his shirt, was a handgun, just like Vee had said. He had a full magazine for it strapped to one pouch on his left thigh, below which a large rust-colored stain colored his pant leg from the knee down; that must have been the blood Vee had smelled, old and crusted and belonging to someone else. On the right leg was another pouch with two magazines for his rifle, which looked like an M-16 or something similar. It even had the full auto sign on the selector which civilians were not typically allowed to have back in the day. I wondered if he had gotten it from an old military base or national guard depot, or maybe he had killed a soldier for it. Or maybe he used to be a soldier. Who knew now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What bothered me most was that Vee had been totally on the money. She laid this guy out on looks alone from a couple dozen feet, down to his intentions and the weapons he carried. The alien snake from a universe away could read humans better than me, the man that had walked this Earth among my own kind for thirty-seven years. It was hard not to be even further embarrassed, and feel even further apart from the rest of the human race. I tried to push those thoughts away as I gathered what I could.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">When I was done, something poked out of the grass and followed my face all the way as I stood back up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It was hard not to laugh at the bad luck, but all I could muster in my shock was a quiet, &quot;Hello.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It was a black woman, a foot shorter than me but looking twice as fierce as I&#039;ve ever felt even on my worst days. Her hazel eyes bored holes straight through my skull and her gun didn&#039;t waver for even a moment. She had her dirty hair swept back into a ponytail, a few short bangs dangling over her forehead marked by a shiny patch of some kind of mechanical grease. That she didn&#039;t pull the trigger immediately made me feel just a little better, for what it was worth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You kill this guy?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Uh, no. She did.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The woman peered around me, keeping the rest of her body eerily still and her gun still frozen inches from my face. &quot;Slowly turn around and tell her to back off.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I didn&#039;t even bother putting my hands up; my arms were full anyway, my intention having been to shove it all into my backpack once we had gotten inside of another house. I spun and saw Vee not three feet away, the shotgun held tight to her shoulder and one single blood-red eye peering down the sights. I couldn&#039;t tell if the anger she wore was at me or the situation in general. Despite my predicament, I found myself hoping she wasn&#039;t upset with me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Vee, can we bring the energy down a bit? Just a little? Please?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Is that her name?&quot; I nodded. The woman shouted, &quot;Vee, you killed this guy?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, slightly hissing the end of the her reply. Vee&#039;s eyes flickered from me, then back to the woman that I swore she could see through me. My mind raced between thoughts of this new woman and the man we had just met and killed within two minutes; were they related? Friends or lovers? Partners like Vee and I?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You lower your gun on three, I lower mine. We talk this out, yeah? You did me a favor, after all.&quot; Definitely not friends then. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vee stared at me. I kept waiting for a signal, a glance or some motion of her hands that told me to hit the dirt or duck or something, anything at all. There was nothing but the disappointment of resignation slowly spreading across her face. No matter what she did, no matter what I did, she could not bet on a sure outcome. No matter who pulled the trigger first, someone was going to end up dead. Probably me. Vee didn&#039;t even wait until the count of three. The shotgun fell to her side, and a moment later the barrel that had been pressing into my lower back fell away, too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You can call me Penny,&quot; said the woman, strolling out from behind me into plain view. &quot;And I know enough that no damn alien with a name&#039;s part of ADVENT anymore. Like I said, ya&#039;ll did me a favor; this dude was a psychopath and--&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A distant, chittering screech made all of our heads turn. I had no idea what had caused such a sound but for reasons I was unable to explain, it still froze my blood solid in my veins.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;We can&#039;t stay out here. This is chryssalid country and they probably heard the shots. My place is in the cul-de-sac down the street. Follow me there and I&#039;ll explain more.&quot; Penny saw Vee flash me an uneasy look. &quot;Or don&#039;t. Enjoy the chryssalids.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She walked away, leaving Vee and I to exchange glances with one another. I nodded my head towards Penny and started walking. Vee hesitated, but quickly caught up to walk beside me, a little ways behind our newest friend, inasmuch as she wasn&#039;t trying to kill us.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You know,&quot; I whispered, nudging Vee with my elbow, &quot;I&#039;d love to meet somebody and not have a gun involved. Just once, so I know what it feels like.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It was easy to see Vee was still upset with me; she refused to look at me with her still-narrowed eyes and silently slithered along as if I wasn&#039;t even there. But it was also easy to see the little grin she wore, and how she tried to hide it.</div></li></ol>        </div>

By Ago

I had to shut the television off. It was the same story all the time for the past couple of months. Humanity victorious, the Elders defeated, ADVENT in disarray. Everybody cheering and hollering, as if most of the planet wasn&#039;t still a smoking, smoldering heap that might never again know a touch of green or the flow of clean water. Sure, Earth was free, I guess. Some celebrations were in order. But how long were they going to wave that banner around before they realized things were still just as bad as they were before? Before they realized that the time for celebration was long past, and it was time to roll those sleeves up and get to the real ugly work of reconstruction and reclamation?

I&#039;d fume and rant some more about it to myself later. The clock said five in the morning, which meant it was feeding time. I slipped into my dirty overalls, slid on my ballcap and headed downstairs; the creak seemed to have gotten worse, and the banister wobbled just as badly. I kept telling myself I&#039;ll fix it but it just wasn&#039;t high on the list of priorities.  Feeding first, then feed myself, then I needed to work on the perimeter security system. Either the detection protocol was degraded or the foxes kept finding new ways in. Of all the animals ADVENT wiped out, foxes managed to slip under the radar. Somehow I wasn&#039;t surprised. 

I guess I couldn&#039;t be too mad at ADVENT&#039;s laxity. Had they been any more thorough, I would&#039;ve lost my animals.

I pushed through the camo netting, pausing for just a minute to rearrange some of the branches caught in the mesh entrance. I passed by the console and glanced at it to make sure everything was as it should&#039;ve been; temperature and humidity were good, airflow was holding steady, water collection systems were working perfectly. I wanted to build an automated dispenser to save myself a bit of time in the mornings, but I never seemed able to find the time. As such, the most advanced feeding method I had was a bucket underneath a manual dispenser. The boys and girls in the next room were already excited; they heard the feed plinking against the dented walls of the aluminum bucket. 

&quot;Hey guys, how&#039;s it goin&#039;?&quot; The chickens crowded around as I opened the door. They knew the routine. They&#039;ve known it their whole lives, for what little that encompassed. It&#039;s something I&#039;ve always felt bad about. They&#039;re animals after all; they should see the sun, get fresh air, be able to feel the elements on their bodies. Instead they&#039;ve got heat lamps on timers, water from drippers, and fans to fake a breeze. Truth be told I&#039;m not sure they would know what to do with a damn worm if they saw one. But I had to do this. I&#039;ve always had to do this. We&#039;ve been hiding ever since the invasion, but the ADVENT ban on animals only made our concealment that much more important. Even now, with humanity back in control, I couldn&#039;t risk letting them be seen. What if some passing &#039;resistance&#039; guys decided to take them for the greater good? Screw that, what&#039;s the greater good ever done for me? No, best to just live out the rest of my life here, alone -- what little that encompassed. Things were simple here. Everywhere else was chaos.

I took stock of them as I scattered the feed by hand. Marlene looked a little thin. Holly&#039;s bald spot was still there; I don&#039;t think she&#039;s sick, so another hen must be bickering with her. Judy was looking plump, and she&#039;s getting to be that age; she could be the next one on my table. Cathy&#039;s seemed to have lost interest in her chicks; I guess it was time to move them to the second enclosure. Iris and Penny were getting along again, so that&#039;s good, unless one of them just moved onto bugging Holly. And then there&#039;s Harvey; he seemed to have calmed down, so I&#039;ll keep him in here. The hens liked to have a rooster strutting about. I was thinking about building a third enclosure for him, he can get a little testy sometimes. 

The sharp snap of a popped light bulb brought me out of my thoughts; one of the heat lamps called it quits. I&#039;ll have to get another bulb from the basement. Another thing to add to my list.

After the hens and rooster have had their fill, the chicks were next in line. They get fed in their own enclosure, so an agitated adult doesn&#039;t get too ornery with them. So far all of the little guys appeared healthy. I sure hope they stayed that way since they were going to be the next generation. I checked their water drippers, and before I left I noticed a dip by the far wall of the enclosure, like someone had been digging. But the straw inside was undisturbed, so it must have been from the outside. It&#039;s got to be a damn fox. I&#039;ll have to add some chickenwire before filling that hole in tonight. Yet another thing on my to-do list.

Collected eggs. Tended to the garden. Had breakfast. Beat the unused eggs and froze them in the basement. Kept the left-over veggies for dinner. Morning routine over.

The perimeter detection software was the next big thing. It&#039;s always the biggest pain in in the ass I have to deal with. I have to drag an old laptop out to the invisible fence line and spend hours debugging the code. I&#039;ll be on the verge of fixing it, only to find some new error&#039;s popped up in the code in a place I never even changed. Sometimes the laptop loses its wireless connection to the basement server and I have to spend forever walking up and down the fence line looking for a spot with good signal. Almost reminds me of what most people would call the goold old days, where we only had little problems in our day-to-day lives. For all the frustration this crap caused me, it&#039;s worth it. Haven&#039;t lost a chicken to a predator in years, so I haven&#039;t given up on it, even with its myriad bugs. Couldn&#039;t afford to if I wanted to stay here by my lonesome and survive.

By the time the software was fixed -- for the time being -- the sun had begun to set. My stomach grumbled angrily, so I headed back inside. Dinner&#039;s just more eggs and veggies. When I was done eating, my anger over the morning broadcasts had subsided and I switched the television back on. Surprise, surprise -- more hoohawing about how humanity has won. Footage abounded of alien forces still being routed across the globe, of the resistance forces waving their flags and shouting &#039;vigilo confido&#039; while the news anchors play up the pride-of-humanity angle for the fighters. They damn near televised an execution before they realized what was happening and the camera panned around. Still heard the gunshots, though -- that made my skin crawl. It was at that point I had had enough. Switched everything off.

Settling in was a strange ritual in that every time I paused at the sink to brush my teeth, I said a little prayer to god that the plumbing still worked. The property has its own well, but the pipes were old -- like, older than dirt.  I anxiously turned the handle, wondering if today was going to be the day; regardless of what curses I spat during my daily chores, the powers that be saw fit to keep the water running for the time being. I brushed my teeth, stripped to my boxers, and climbed into bed. Only to remember then that I had forgotten to fill in that hole by the chicks&#039; enclosure. I agonized for a few torturous moments, tossing and turning. I even switched the light back on a few times, ready to crawl back outside. Screw it, I thought. I decided to take care of it tomorrow morning, and drifted off to sleep.

A shrill buzzing woke me up about two in the morning. It wasn&#039;t my clock but the fence alarm I&#039;ve got wired up to my basement server, the one that tells me if the perimeter&#039;s been crossed by something roughly fox-sized. The thought briefly crossed my mind that if I hadn&#039;t fixed the software I&#039;d have gotten a full night&#039;s rest, but then again I could be down a chicken or more. I threw on old ratty t-shirt, grabbed the shotgun from beneath my bed, and rushed into the pitch black. The moment I set foot outdoors I could already hear the commotion coming from my chickens and my heart sank. I flicked on the muzzle flashlight, checked my gun, saw the flashy red of a loaded shell, and made a beeline for the coop.

I stopped dead in my tracks. The latch on the door was open. Foxes didn&#039;t do that. They can&#039;t. I mean, they could -- they can be pretty smart -- but why would it dig one night and then suddenly know how to use the door latch the next? And the tracks going into the coop were real weird. No paw prints, just a deep gouge in the dirt. Did it drag something inside? Of all the places to store a kill, it&#039;s got to use my chicken coop? And why the hell was the light on? The adrenaline surging through me left no time for useless questions and I barged in, leveling my gun at what I supposed was a fox&#039;s height.

Only to see a long, long tail that went deathly still the moment I entered. My jaw dropped and I tracked up, and up, and up further until I was staring eye to eye with by all accounts was just a giant freakin&#039; snake -- with arms.

Its whole body was frozen, its amber eyes focused on me, one of my chickens in its grasp throwing an absolute fit. In the lifetimes this snake and I spent staring at one other, I remembered what I had seen on television: alien soldiers. Used to look different during the initial invasion. Spat venom. Newsfeeds called&#039;em vipers, though with the hood they looked more like cobras. Lackeys of the Elders, instruments of death and malcontent, perpetrators of unspeakable acts of cruelty against humankind. At least, that&#039;s what the television said. They were fearless and always on the move, impossible to pin down and even harder to kill.

This one looked nothing like that. Creepy as all hell, sure. But with my shotgun pointed at its chest, I absolutely saw fear in its eyes. A desire to run, to preserve itself. A piece of its armor was missing, exposing half its chest and what looked like some birdshot wounds around what appeared to be a human-shaped torso. A fist-sized chunk of flesh was missing from the bottom right edge of its hood; dark yellow blood dripped intermittently from its wounds. They must have been fairly recent.

I could kill it. It would have been so easy. Wasn&#039;t that my duty? As a member of humankind, shouldn&#039;t I? One of the many tools of our former oppressors -- why shouldn&#039;t I kill it?

&quot;Drop my chicken.&quot; Part of me hoped it wouldn&#039;t understand, that it simply couldn&#039;t. I hoped it would just make a threatening move and give me an excuse to pull the trigger. For all I knew it had just been in a fight; maybe it had just killed someone before being forced to retreat.

Unfortunately, it immediately obeyed. Judy fell to the ground, angry and noisy before quieting down and joining the rest of the chickens cowering in the far corner. The alien&#039;s gaze flickered to my gun before it seemed to recoil, sliding backwards a couple of feet. Was it cowering, too? What happened to the fearless killer the newsfeeds always showed? Where was the predatory instinct that made them vicious beasts? Where was the animal that I wouldn&#039;t feel bad about killing?

&quot;You understand english?&quot; It nodded near imperceptibly, perhaps afraid anything more might set me off. &quot;Do you speak it?&quot; It shook its head just once; again, a blink-and-you&#039;ll-miss-it sort of movement. 

It was not immediately threatening, even for how imposing it looked. It was clearly wounded. I watched the tongue flick out past its lips and its eyes would try as hard as they could to glance at my chickens without moving its head; it was obviously hungry. 

If I pulled the trigger now, I&#039;d just be an executioner.

&quot;You can&#039;t have a chicken. I can&#039;t do that,&quot; I said, lowering my gun to my hip but with the barrel still pointed at it. The cat was out of the bag now; what harm would there be in taking it down to my basement? I&#039;ve got plenty of eggs and veggies in freezers. &quot;I can give you something else and send you on your way. That fair?&quot;

It nodded earnestly. I jerked my head towards the door and began to step backwards, still keeping my weapon pointed in its direction. It understood and began to follow me out, keeping a healthy distance between it and myself. I kept walking backwards towards the house until reaching the cellar, where I kicked the latch open. The doors were too heavy to just lift with my foot, though. I motioned with my gun at the entrance.

&quot;Open it and I&#039;ll follow you down.&quot;

At this it hesitated. I suppose I might, too; a stranger behind me with a gun wanted me to descend into an underground bunker. Lots of old horror films or crime dramas might end or start this way. But hunger is a very powerful motivator -- I would know. The alien only thought for a moment longer before slithering up to the cellar doors and throwing them open, then carefully wound its way down the stone steps. The motion-sensing lights flickered on, bathing the basement in a strong white glow, and I followed down after it. This was where I kept damn near everything; food, water, spare clothing and bedding, my freezers, generators and fuel, my server for the various electronics around the property. It knew I had chickens; everything else seemed insignificant by comparison.

&quot;Here,&quot; I said, circling around it to open one of the freezers. With my gun still trained on the snake, I reached in with my free hand and fished out two large bowls of beaten eggs then placed them both on the floor. Each bowl was probably about five or six eggs worth -- not that it mattered. I had plenty to spare. &quot;This is all I&#039;ve got for protein. You&#039;ll have to wait for it to defrost. Afterwards you could drink it if you wanted to, or heat it up and scramble them. You know, heat it up until it starts to turn solid. Whitish-yellow and brown are good, any darker and you&#039;re burning them.&quot;

I backed away and it came forward, gingerly picking up each bowl as if it were some sort of trap. In all honesty, it did seem thoroughly confused. It was almost like it was unable to process what was happening. Had it not known an ounce of kindness before? I figured ADVENT never treated its footsoldiers as anything other than tools, and I highly doubt any aliens got much courtesy from humans. Maybe it actually was confused. 

I grabbed a tiny package -- one of many -- about half the size of a child&#039;s lunchbox, from one of the central shelves and slid it across the ground. &quot;Home-made first-aid kit. It&#039;s only got clean rags and alcohol in it. Clean your wounds. Fair warning: the alcohol will hurt like a bitch. I mean -- it&#039;s going to hurt a lot.&quot; I couldn&#039;t spare antibiotics. I didn&#039;t know a damn thing about dosage for an alien, or if it would even be effective. The rags and alcohol would have to do.

&quot;And here,&quot; I said. I flipped the lid on a plastic container and grabbed a light blanket, then dropped it on the ground between us. The snake cautiously inched its tail forward and wrapped it around the blanket and first-aid kit before dragging it back. &quot;This time of year, days are always nice but the nights can get chilly. You can stay warm with that. From here, you head west and you&#039;ll crest a small hill. A few dozen yards past that is the edge of my property line. Do you get what I&#039;m saying? I&#039;m not going to see you again, am I?&quot;

Those amber eyes still wide with confusion couldn&#039;t tear themselves away from the eggs, kit, and blanket. I had to repeat myself before those slitted pupils turned towards me. The alien slowly shook its head.

&quot;Go on, then,&quot; I said, using my hands to motion towards the stairs. &quot;And don&#039;t -- don&#039;t get yourself killed, I guess. That&#039;s good food and a good blanket. I&#039;d hate for it to go to waste.&quot;

Its tail twitched over and over, like some sort of anxious habit. It turned slowly and slithered up the stairs, carefully so as not to drop the lifelines I had given it. I followed a short ways behind, just to keep it within eyesight as it made its own way off into the impenetrable black again. For as dark as it was -- it must&#039;ve been close to three -- I didn&#039;t have to watch long before it seemed to dissolve into the night. Despite our...amiable meeting, it still made my hair stand up to know a giant, intelligent snake was out there and I couldn&#039;t see it.

I didn&#039;t get another wink of sleep that night. Helping an alien -- what sort of human was I?

-Chapter 2-
 
The day after that alien&#039;s visit was rough. I missed out on three hours of sleep while riding high on adrenaline and fear, so I crashed hard that afternoon. Multiple times, in fact. I fell asleep while emptying the water barrels into my underground storage. Damn near took a dip face first into one of them. Fell asleep laying on the floor, trying to fix the banister at the bottom step. Even took a snooze while standing under the bright basement lights, taking care of some server maintenance.
 
But none of these little naps were restful in the least. Every time I closed my eyes I saw that snake -- that viper -- right in front of me, in this weird state between illusion and reality that felt more a hallucination than it did a dream. I couldn&#039;t get my mind away from our encounter. Every time I saw it, we were just having a friendly chat, our mouths moving but no sound coming out. Neither of us would notice, though. We would just keep on talking without a care in the world, disturbingly oblivious to each other&#039;s silence. I&#039;d wake up after what felt like talking for hours, feeling even more tired than before and with these strange thoughts in my head. What would it have sounded like? Did it use the ADVENT tongue or did vipers speak their own language? Did they speak at all?
 
In my restless state I sometimes heard an insidiously reasonable voice in the far reaches of my mind asking me why I hadn&#039;t pulled the trigger, saying by all rights I should have shot that thing where it stood. The voice only grew in intensity as time went on, daring me to even hazard a guess at some answers to its uncomfortable questions. How many people had it killed? How many homes had it razed to the ground? How many lives might it have upended at the behest of its masters? This self-interrogation was only exacerbated by sleep deprivation and resultant irritability. And boy, did it get bad, because things only got rougher that night. And rougher still the next, and the one after that. Eventually, this apparent obsession began to spill over into my waking hours. I couldn&#039;t escape it, and I was frustratingly forced to accept a simple fact that I had convinced myself long, long ago just wasn&#039;t true.
 
I was devastatingly lonely.
 
I had spent twenty years -- just over half of my life -- on this farm with no meaningful contact with another soul for the past eight. Each day had just become a checklist of the same things, an unchanging routine of tasks that varied only in the order in which they might get done. Chickens. Garden. Eat. Wash. Clean. Maintain. After all this time, after telling myself for so long I was okay with this isolation for the sake of safety -- were the cracks beginning to show? Was that it? It was the only explanation I could come up with. Anybody could have visited me and I&#039;d have become obsessed with them, if only for the glimpse of society they may have brought with them, that desire to communicate and connect. How unlucky that it was one of the aliens that had happened upon my land. Someone who I could talk at, but not someone I could talk to. Someone that I was forced to greet at the barrel end of a gun because I didn&#039;t know who my friends or my enemies were anymore. I couldn&#039;t trust other people, human or alien, and now I realize it must be slowly but surely breaking me.
 
When my parents brought my brother and I out here during the initial invasion, we severed all contact with the world. We didn&#039;t tell anyone where we were going, what we were bringing with us, or what was already at our destination. Our parents drilled into us that in the coming catastrophe, people would only want what we had. Time and again, my parents were proven right. My father killed a few people who thought they could take from us. I never saw it with my own eyes, but I remember hearing the gunshots, the adrenaline-soaked shouting afterwards that everything was all clear. Until one time, things didn&#039;t go so well. Dad never gave the all-clear, so mom went to check on him. Two more gunshots, then total silence. We waited until the next morning to even dare to peek out the windows, and saw our parents and a third man laying in the grass. From then on, it was up to my brother and I to defend ourselves.
 
He had readily adopted our father&#039;s killer instinct. For him, taking life to protect us was easy. I lacked that resolve -- which was a constant point of contention between us -- and I think that&#039;s what has made me so afraid of other people now. I&#039;m just not sure I have it in me to do what might have to be done. Even when faced with an alien, a killer from the old regime, my first instinct was to give. That was not how I would survive in this day and age. Back then, my brother probably felt I was dead weight. We argued for years; he thought we should do more, while I thought simply staying put and living was good enough. Eight years ago, he up and left, leaving only a note speaking of some resistance group.
 
I suppose I can&#039;t be too mad at him anymore; the resistance won, after all. He was right. I was wrong.
 
I awoke to an ever-increasing buzz as my senses returned to me, the last remnants of the latest viper dream vanishing into memory. The perimeter alarm was going off again. I rolled over and saw daylight peeking through the curtains, realizing only then I had overslept. I must have turned off my clock alarm while half-asleep. I yawned, stretched, then took a look at the alert. My heart sank; three different breaches, all within seconds of each other and the outer two contacts equidistant from the center. It was a formation.
 
Had that viper returned with help? Hell, I might have if I was it. On the run, hurt, hungry and afraid, why not grab a few friends and go raid the guy that it knew had more than enough to go around? I threw my overalls on, grabbed my gun, and rushed to the window to draw the curtains just enough to peek outside with one eye. Based on the time since the alert and the direction of the breach, they should have come into view right about...
 
They were humans. Laughing, talking, walking humans. Even with guns clearly visible in their hands, I couldn&#039;t seperate my excitement from my anxiety. After an incredibly unsatisfying glimpse of the outer world through the limited mannerisms of a giant snake, these guys would be what I had been looking for after all these years. Society, community, connection! I didn&#039;t need an alien after all. These guys would clear away the dreams, they would bring back a little bit of normalcy to my life.
 
But despite these enticing possibilities, I heard my parents in my head: they will want to take.
 
I gathered my thoughts, and stopped before exiting the front door to make myself look a bit less threatening. I cradled my shotgun low in my arms, took some deep breaths in an effort to relax, and ambled on outside into full view. By then, they were about fifty yards from the front porch. They stopped when they saw me, but only for a moment. After that brief pause, all three of them were waving and smiling. I waited and let them approach, ready to tell them when they were close enough. They stopped well before that point. All three slung their weapons onto their backs before the lead stepped forward.
 
&quot;How&#039;s it going, friend? Glorious kind of day, ain&#039;t it?&quot; He was a younger fellow, maybe early twenties. Asian, black hair, wearing an old army combat helmet and some sort of home-made armor by the looks of it. He had some wear-and-tear on him; a bullet had gone through the jacket&#039;s shoulder, but I couldn&#039;t tell if he wore the wound as well. He had a pouch on his hip carrying two magazines for a weapon that he didn&#039;t have; he had what appeared to be a shotgun -- maybe an old civilian model of something pre-invasion, I couldn&#039;t be certain. A brown bandage around his left arm hid a wound that must have been days old. His companions were dressed like he was, though the one on the left looked like he had rummaged through some military surplus; his gear looked straight out of an old world army, giving him the appearance of someone already battle-tested.
 
&quot;Sure is, friend,&quot; I said, trying the word out. I hadn&#039;t said it in years. Maybe I had -- a few times, in passing conversation to my chickens. It felt good to say it aloud to another person. &quot;What brings you out my way?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#039;m Eric, and my friends here behind me are Gerard and Donovan. We&#039;re from a small town about four, five days back that way,&quot; he said, pointing in the direction from which they had come. &quot;We had a very small ADVENT garrison within town limits. A dozen troopers and a few vipers. We finally decided to move on them earlier this week, but one of one of the snakes slipped away. Even with the aliens in a panic, we&#039;re worried she might call for some reinforcements, as improbable as it sounds. We&#039;ve been tracking her since that night. Have you by chance seen her come this way?&quot;
 
A hunting party. They must be the ones responsible for her -- &quot;What do you mean, her?&quot;
 
He looked at me like I was a total stranger. Well, even more of a stranger than what he had first thought. &quot;All vipers are female. You didn&#039;t know that?&quot;
 
&quot;Been here a while. There&#039;s probably a lot I don&#039;t know.&quot; I thought I might have unconsciously tipped my hand a bit by having said that. Maybe they might start wondering what I had out here would have let me survive on my own for so long. But they seemed friendly enough, and none of them grabbed onto that question I had left in the air.
 
&quot;You&#039;re one of them last-man-on-earth types, eh?&quot;
 
&quot;I guess you could say that.&quot; I nodded at his bandaged arm. &quot;You saw some action then, with this fight you had? How was it? Is the town safe now?&quot;
 
&quot;It was fan-fuckin&#039;-tastic,&quot; said his friend, the tan-skinned one in the surplus gear. Donovan, I think his name was. His voice was loud and animated, like he didn&#039;t understand how obnoxious he sounded. &quot;We took the first squad on patrol by total surprise, ripped them to shreds in a crossfire. By the time the rest of the garrison mustered, we had them surrounded. Torched the building and picked off whoever came running out. The other guys skinned a couple of the snakes and now the bar has some real sweet, scaley-looking pennants hanging above the door as you walk in. I think they&#039;re gonna try to stuff another one -- you know, turn it into some trophy on a stand. I got myself a pair of fangs off one of them, check it out.&quot;
 
He held up a pair of large recurved fangs suspended on a necklace, in awe of his own handiwork while my blood slowly turned into sludge in my veins. Enemies, sure, I can understand hating your enemies. I can understand wanting to kill them, wanting to save the town. But that&#039;s where it should end, isn&#039;t it? Even the man that had killed my parents -- my brother and I buried him too. I hated him with every fiber of my being, I wished he had never been born, I wished I could have seen if I had had the guts to kill him myself...but we still buried him. And here these guys were, admiring their own barbaric tale like they were heroes instead of a bunch of butchers looking for the next thing to toss on the chopping block.
 
This was not the chat I had been hoping for. I hid my disgust behind a facade of admiration. &quot;Sounds like you guys did quite the number on them.&quot;
 
&quot;We sure fuckin&#039; did,&quot; Donovan said, stashing the fang necklace back into his jacket. &quot;Now we&#039;re just looking for the last one. We got some shots on her already but they&#039;re tougher than they look.&quot;
 
&quot;Birdshot, by any chance?&quot;
 
All three heads whipped around to look at me, eyes full of hope and bloodlust. &quot;You saw her, then? Must have, to get close enough to see the holes we punched into her,&quot; Eric said.
 
&quot;Yeah, she wandered by a few days ago. She stopped pretty close by, maybe thinking about looking for supplies in my place. But she just kept on truckin&#039;. Not sure where she is now, but I can point you in the right direction.&quot;
 
&quot;We&#039;d be very appreciative, mister...?&quot;
 
I waved away his question. &quot;I prefer to keep to myself, if you don&#039;t mind,&quot; I said, to which Eric just shrugged his shoulders. &quot;She headed north. Nothing out that way but some dense forest. Lots of places to hide, so I&#039;d be careful if I were you.&quot;
 
It felt so strange to lie to them. The first humans I had seen in nearly a decade, with no ill will towards me in their minds, and I lied to them -- for what? To save the life of an alien that I had talked to for a half hour? Where was the connection? Where were the people that would make me want to come back to the world?
 
The three of them thanked me and turned to be on their way, only for the third guy -- Gerard -- to stop and look back at me, waving a canteen around.
 
&quot;Don&#039;t mean to be a bother,&quot; he said through a thick foreign accent, &quot;but if you&#039;ve got some water, we wouldn&#039;t mind a top-off.&quot; The other two stopped and looked back, wondering what my answer would be as their hands drifted to their own canteens.
 
I guess my parents were right after all. Everyone always wants something. Were the actually asking? Or was it just a polite way of saying they needed water and they figured I had some? What would they do if I said no? Not that I could think of a reason to say no, but just -- what if? I guess I had frozen up a little because the three of them suddenly got nervous, which made me even more nervous. Nervous was bad when dealing with unknowns.
 
&quot;I&#039;ve got some water barrels out back; you&#039;ll probably want to boil it to be safe,&quot; I said. Their postures relaxed, though I shifted my gun to one hand, the barrel pointed at the ground but facing in their general direction. &quot;One of you can follow me; leave your gun with your pals but take their canteens and you can fill them all.&quot;
 
My request was met without a single word of protest. Gerard hefted his rifle onto Eric&#039;s free shoulder before taking the groups&#039; canteens. He seemed to understand my caution. He made himself look as harmless as possible, stopping halfway between us to reveal a knife which he tossed back to his friends. That made me a little uneasy; did he show me that as a symbol of goodwill or as a way to make me feel a false sense of security? I couldn&#039;t figure him out, but either way he seemed a likable fellow. He walked very slowly and made no sudden movements. His arms were full with three canteens, so it&#039;s not as if he could have done anything without first dropping them.
 
He followed me around the back of the house; I led him to the side opposite the chicken coop. I didn&#039;t want him smelling or hearing them. There we found my blue plastic water barrels, already partially emptied from my last collection a few days ago. Out of the corner of my eye I saw him stop, as if waiting for my permission again. I nodded at him and he got to work, submerging each container until it was full.
 
&quot;So,&quot; I began, watching him fill the last one, &quot;what are you going to do this particular viper when you catch her?&quot;
 
&quot;Not sure, my man,&quot; Gerard said, offering a bright white smile that contrasted with his dark complexion. &quot;We&#039;re sure as hell not gonna lug three hundred pounds of muscle all the way back to town, so we&#039;ll probably clean her the moment she&#039;s down. We&#039;re thinking about leaving the fangs in and taking the whole head instead. An intact skull would look pretty wicked, yeah? Maybe put it on the ADVENT truck we took from the garrison, like a hood ornament. Tell me that wouldn&#039;t be awesome.&quot;
 
I swallowed hard, nodding with a smile that matched his. &quot;Yeah, that -- that does sound pretty neat,&quot; I said as he capped off all three canteens. He took point just a few steps ahead of me, allowing me to keep him in full view as we retraced our steps to the front of the house, where his buddies were waiting in the exact same spots we had left them. Gerard trotted up to them, passed out the canteens and took his weapon back from Eric, who afterwards shouldered his gear more comfortably before turning back to me.
 
&quot;We really appreciate your help, mister. If you like, I can send one of my guys back here with a piece of whatever we catch. You want a swatch of skin? It&#039;s got some nice colors to it, probably look good in a workshop or above a fireplace.&quot;
 
I fought back the acidic taste of bile that bubbled up in the back of my throat. &quot;That&#039;s quite all right. Thanks for the offer, though.&quot;
 
He shrugged, and the three of them went their way. I sat on my porch and watched them off, making sure they disappeared over the horizon before allowing myself to relax. Even alone again, winding down from my first bit of human contact in eight years was not easy. I was suddenly tired and even unhappier than I had been before. That whispering voice of reason that asked me why I had let the viper go was now asking me why I wanted anything to do with people if they were going to be like that. Was the whole world a slaughterhouse now? Would those men live on into old age and tell their children about the time they carved up intelligent things just to have a memento they could put on a necklace or fireplace mantle? Or would they possess even an ounce of regret for their actions, and omit that detail while playing themselves up as heroes of humanity? Either way just didn&#039;t sit right with me in the least.
 
I remembered to feed the chickens before heading back inside to feed myself. On my way back inside, I nearly tripped on two clean bowls I must have left outside by mistake, which was odd because I didn&#039;t remember--
 
My hair stood on end. In that moment I had that distinct feeling like I was being watched, like I could feel someone shooting daggers at the base of my neck. I had the inclination to wheel around and brandish my gun, but I reasoned I&#039;d be dead already if it -- if she wanted. I set my gun against the porch railing and slowly turned to see just an empty field, with the only other indicator of life being the bootprints my three visitors had left in the dirt and grass.
 
I couldn&#039;t wait for my fellow humans to hit the road, and now I was kind of sort of wishing this viper would show up again. I wasn&#039;t entirely sure what sort of company I was fit for anymore.

-Chapter 3-
 
Those two bowls stayed on my kitchen counter all day. And all night. And into the next morning.
 
I didn&#039;t quite know what to do with them. I found myself passing by them on a whim, as if I wanted to still see them sitting there on the counter top where I had left them. In short order they became an extension of my obsession, of my desire to meet this viper once more and hope that she might bring a bit of something with her -- a connection to someone else, some communication beyond the talk of blood and butchery my fellow humans had offered. Despite the language barrier, maybe in time she could somehow tell me her name, where she was from, or what her life was like. Maybe she would ask these questions of me, if she had the interest.
 
The more I thought about it, the deeper the chasm appeared between humanity and myself. Part of me wondered if it should be deeper, though. Beyond asking what had brought those three to my home, the first bit of curiosity I wanted to satisfy was about the fight. My stomach twisted itself into knots as I dwelt on it, as my thoughts stirred up painful arguments my brother and I had before he had ended up leaving. Was there a part of me that wanted to kill an alien, that wanted to have some trophy that I could show to other people and say &#039;look, I helped, too&#039;? Would there by some grand tribunal where people lined up with pieces of alien corpses as proof they deserved to exist as part of mankind?
 
&#039;Ah, viper fangs? You pass. Viper skins? Pass. ADVENT helmets? Looking good.&#039; And then there&#039;d be me, cowering under the harsh glare of the judge and my fellow man as I show my empty hands, soiled not by alien blood but by dirt.  &#039;Hold on there, where&#039;s your pound of flesh? And you think you deserve to be called human?&#039;
 
Maybe my brother was right; I feel too much for other people. I&#039;ve got too much empathy in me to do what he did -- to do what dad did. I pointed a gun at an alien snake and I never saw the predator, the killer instinct behind her eyes. I could only see the overwhelming fear, the primal driving force of hunger that led her to my doorstep even when wounded. Did that make me a good person, or did that make me weak?
 
I felt like I&#039;d never know unless I saw her again.
 
I took my breakfast outside and sat on the porch steps. Between bites, my eyes would casually drift westward, hopefully looking at the hill that partially blocked my view of the treeline. My fork mostly meandered about aimlessly, turning over some eggs or potatoes like there was something else to find on the plate. Though every time I heard the slightest sound I subconsciously reached for my gun beside me, only remembering when I grasped empty air that I had left it inside in some foolish attempt to make myself seem approachable.
 
My thoughts twisted and churned in my mind and I began to argue with myself. What if the gun had been the great equalizer? When I had found her in the chicken coop, she was scared; not of me, but of the gun. When I ordered her to put the chicken down, it was the gun that forced her compliance. When I told her to open the cellar and head down, it was the gun that guaranteed my safety. If she chose now to show up, it wouldn&#039;t be because I looked nice; it would be because I was no longer a threat. What if I had made myself a target? And it was only then I realized that if she came to me now with murder on her mind, she would almost certainly have the upper hand. After all, she was a weapon of the Elders; venom, a crushing tail, and long fangs made her formidable in her own right.
 
The sudden fluttering of wings made me tense, and once again my hand went to the imaginary gun beside me. I wish I could say it was reflexive, a movement trained into me by circumstances of my existence, but it wasn&#039;t. It was purely instinctual fear that kept me grabbing for a gun, that had me constantly forgetting there wasn&#039;t one there. I took a deep breath and let it go slowly and deliberately, hoping it might calm my nerves. Stop startling so easily, I told myself. It&#039;s just birds. It&#039;s just wind. It&#039;s just nothing. I took another bite and looked towards the horizon, wondering what else might be coming my way.
 
And there my answer stood in front of me not ten yards away, tongue flickering in and out in a frenzy.
 
&quot;Oh,&quot; I muttered, absolutely paralyzed by fear; every muscle in my body pulled taut like a steel cable to the point of snapping. It was odd to see her in broad daylight, in much the same way I imagine a kid would find it odd to see a monster anywhere but under the bed. In the natural light I could see her eyes that seemed amber in our first meeting were actually far darker -- nearly red. She was mostly yellow with concentric diamond shapes of black white, and orange. It was startling to see something so familiar in an unfamiliar shape; everything about her echoed Earth snakes, from the intricately scaled top side -- er, dorsal side, if I remember my old high scool classes -- to the white segmented scales that covered her neck and belly. Things got weirder the higher up I looked; arms and armored plate that looked like it hid a pair of breasts behind it.
 
She looked around me, only minimally moving her head.
 
&quot;No gun,&quot; I said, doing my best to keep my voice from trembling. &quot;Not this time.&quot;
 
Her eyes locked onto mine. In that exact moment I felt like a rabbit, frozen in place and waiting for the predator to make the first move so I would know exactly in which direction to juke and sprint. But it was just a passing glance at best, and her gaze fell down to the plate of half-finished food in my hands.
 
&quot;Hungry again?&quot;
 
She could not have nodded any harder if she had tried; with that hood of hers, it&#039;s a wonder she didn&#039;t take to the air then and there.
 
&quot;Follow me, then,&quot; I said as I got to my feet. She began to slither to the side of the house where the cellar door was. &quot;No, not that way. I&#039;ve got some fresh food inside.&quot;
 
At this she stopped and seemed thoughtful, as if considering options. Even in my fear I laughed inwardly at the thought that she might believe I was the predator, that I was the one leading her into a trap. But what sort of trap would see me set her loose the first night I had met her? Either way, something was on her mind because he looked me dead-on and pointed northward.
 
I chewed on my lip some, trying to figure out what it was she was getting at. There was nothing out that way but trees for as far as I had ever traveled; dozens and dozens of miles of forest so thick it had sometimes been hard to even find my way through. Then it hit me.
 
&quot;What, those men from yesterday? You saw me send them that way?&quot;
 
She nodded again, then cocked her head at me. She might have been an alien but I could read the question in those eyes of hers just as easily as if she had been a human: why?
 
&quot;I don&#039;t know.&quot; She pointed to herself, still looking at me. &quot;Yeah, they were looking for you. They -- they had some bad things in mind. I don&#039;t want to see anyone get hurt, much less be the cause of it.&quot;
 
She took another long look at the northern treeline. I guess my answer satisfied any other questions she had, because she seemed a little more relaxed afterwards. I made room for her to move by me into the house, and she accepted my invitation, slithering past close enough for me to see the wounds that still marred her body. Some of them looked better, some looked worse. The hole at the edge of her hood looked totally scabbed over, and I couldn&#039;t see any signs of infection -- if aliens showed infection the same way humans did. Some of the birdshot in her torso was close to the surface and wouldn&#039;t require much digging around, if any, to fish out. Others were deep and not immediately visible beyond the swollen skin beneath her scales, indicating something foreign was buried in her flesh. I thought it might be inflammation, but then again -- she&#039;s an alien. I had no idea how her body reacted to injuries.
 
Her proximity also gave me a better understanding of just how immense she was. Even slightly slouched forward, she was much taller than I was; I had to guess she was over seven feet, probably closer to eight. Her maw was as big as the rest of her and seemed to stretch all the way across her face; the front seemed fixed into what looked like a permanent scowl or frown but I had seen her move the sides and corners of her mouth to emote. Her eyes also seemed to dip inward a bit which gave her a very intense gaze, completing the angry look that seemed natural for her.
 
&quot;Hey.&quot; She stopped right before entering the front door, but did not turn to look at me. I wondered if I was about to overstep but pressed onward with my question anyway. &quot;Some of those holes in you look pretty bad. If you need help treating them...I mean, I can do that for you. After you get something in your stomach, maybe?&quot;
 
Her head dropped and I saw her hand -- four fingers, how odd -- slowly move to her midsection and chest, where her armor piece was missing. She briefly hesitated before delicately prodding the area. I saw her shudder and flinch from her own touch. She turned and gave me a single nod, then continued on into the house with me more than a step behind her. I had to be extra careful not to step on her winding tail as it followed her around. At its thickest point it must&#039;ve been the size of my chest. She really was deceptively massive, considering how easily she moved about in my home.
 
&quot;Kitchen&#039;s on your left -- no, the next left,&quot; I said, watching her correct her path. &quot;You can take a seat wherever you like.&quot; I turned the stove top up and threw a clean pan onto one of the burners, then flew to the fridge and grabbed half a dozen eggs.
 
An alien -- in my house! As a guest! My fear shrank, overtaken by the sheer absurdity of the situation. People the world over were hunting down what trophies they could, and here I was harboring a viper. I had told her it was because I didn&#039;t want to see anybody hurt, but that wasn&#039;t the entire truth, was it? I hadn&#039;t told her it was because I was lonely, because I wanted someone or something to interact with whose intelligence was greater than a chicken&#039;s. And yet, I felt my elation at the prospective end of loneliness being tugged down by the weight of expectations.
 
What would my parents have said, I thought to myself as I cracked the eggs one at a time into the hot pan. My parents, whose first instinct was to run away from it all in an attempt to protect their two sons -- would they be disappointed? Scared for me? I suppose the latter was a given; though my fear was less than it was the first time I had met this viper, it was still very much present. I&#039;d bet my dad was turning in his grave but I imagine mom might be proud of me for helping someone in need. Well, pre-invasion mom, anyway. I could never clearly tell how the invasion changed her, she was always good at putting on a smile. Looking back on it as an adult, I guess that meant things were pretty bad. She was just doing her best to shield us from it.
 
And what about my brother? Oh, I could not imagine the fury he&#039;d feel if he could see me now. The anger he showed during our arguments, calling me weak, lazy, apathetic -- I&#039;m sure that anger was tempered by some amount of brotherly love, and I shudder to think what he would sound like truly unleashed. He left to make a difference, ostensibly to kill as many of the aliens as he could, and I simply invited one right into our home, told her to sit at the table while I cooked for her. I wonder if he would kill me. Would I be a collaborator in his eyes? Or rather, what if I was just living up to expectations? If he were here, would he just laugh and smile and say he knew I was a useless softie, then blow her brains out and act like nothing was different? I wondered if he showed up with a bunch of fellow fighters, would he defend me or leave me out to dry for my actions?
 
The smell of slightly burnt eggs brought me out of my thoughts. I took the pan off the burner and upended it, watching the scrambled eggs tumble out onto a plate. When I turned, I saw she had forgone using a chair. Which made sense, seeing as how chairs are made for human bodies. Not sure what I had been thinking when I told her to sit. Regardless, it still appeared as if she was sitting; she was coiled up a little like a spring, with enough of her body beneath her that she looked to be normal height while at the table.
 
She did not show a moment&#039;s hesitation the second I put her plate in front of her. I didn&#039;t even have time to grab her a fork. She took the plate in both hands, held it in the air, and let the pile of eggs just slide into her impressively, frighteningly huge mouth. If I had blinked I would&#039;ve have missed it. To be honest, I wished I had missed it. Seeing that gaping maw and fangs bigger than my fingers gave me the willies.
 
&quot;Uh, okay,&quot; I said as she gently put the plate down and looked at me, her forked tongue flicking past her lips, &quot;that took less time than I thought.&quot; I was left a little disappointed. I had been expecting her to slowly pick away at her plate with a fork, with me sitting at the opposite end of the table maybe trying to make conversation with some simple questions that wouldn&#039;t need more than a nod or shake of her head. I never even got to sit down. Maybe next time. If there was a next time, anyway. I still wasn&#039;t sure where this whole situation was going. Was she here for another dine and dash or did she come back for something a little longer term?
 
&quot;Well then, if you&#039;re satisfied, you can follow me to the basement and I&#039;ll do what I can for your wounds.&quot; I turned to make my way towards the basement stairs off the foyer, and I heard movement behind me,  like someone shuffling a heavy mat across the floor. Knowing she was there and hearing her move quickly to stay behind me set off the most primal, animalistic parts of my brain. In that moment I felt like the rabbit again, knowing the predator was there but unable to see it, wondering when it would strike. My heart quickened, my breath caught in my throat, and I damn near felt like I was about to have what I assumed to be a panic attack for the first time in my life. I was suddenly, inexplicably weak and short of breath, my chest seized by fears I didn&#039;t know how to suppress. I was forced to reach out and steady myself by leaning against the wall, nearly panting to catch my breath. I stayed there for a few moments, struggling to regain my composure.
 
Imagine my surprise to see her face in my peripheral vision, her blood-red eyes and their slitted pupils a bit wider than normal and assessing my condition. Was it concern? Or maybe she hoped I was about to kick the bucket and the house would be hers?
 
&quot;I&#039;m fine, I&#039;m fine,&quot; I managed to stammer, feeling my way down the stair well. She followed me down a little more closely than before, maybe expecting to catch me if I fell. In all honesty it just made me a little more uncomfortable but I did my best not to let it bother me. We hit the bottom step and the motion-sensing lights came on. Still leaning a bit, I felt the wooden wall of the staircase transition into concrete, old and pitted. I paused for just a moment to finish collecting myself, then made my way to the opposite end of the basement, where a large table waited. On the way I grabbed three of the homemade first aid kits, an actual first aid kit, and a few vacuum-packed bags of surgical instruments.
 
&quot;Hop up here and lie back,&quot; I said, patting the table. When I heard no movement I turned and saw her looking questionably at the bags in my hand. They were entirely plastic, with a solid white back and a translucent blue front that allowed one to see which instruments were inside. There was otherwise nothing remarkable about them that might draw such scrutiny. &quot;What&#039;s wrong?&quot;
 
She pointed at me, then used both hands to press a finger to either side of her head. She drew both fingers down an imaginary line that met in the center of her chest, where she then pat against her body to produce a rhythmic thumping that sounded a lot like a human heartbeat.
 
I was a bit dumbfounded, at first. Heartbeat. Lines to either side of her head, like where ears might -- &quot;A stethoscope?&quot; She nodded and held her hands out, as if expecting more out of me. What would a stethoscope have to do with any of this? Why would I need one? Then I got to thinking who might wear one. &quot;A doctor? Are you trying to ask if I&#039;m a doctor?&quot;
 
Another timid nod, as if she were afraid of my answer.
 
&quot;No, I&#039;m not,&quot; I said, opening the real first aid kit and putting on the gloves found within, &quot;but I&#039;ve done this before. Not as many pellets, though. Trust me.&quot;
 
She didn&#039;t look all too satisfied with my answer, but I couldn&#039;t tell how much of that was her normal expression and how much of it was anxiety. Either way, she did as instructed and draped her upper body across the table, leaving most of her tail end beneath the table. I pulled up a chair and sat down before ripping open the instrument pack.
 
&quot;If you used the alcohol I gave you the night we met, you know how much this is going to hurt. Are you ready?&quot;
 
She hesitated, but gave me her okay. I switched on the flashlight, splashed the forceps with alcohol, and set to work.
 
The injuries looked pretty good, as far as gunshots go. Many of them showed signs of advanced healing, which seemed strange given that she was shot about two weeks ago, two and a half at the most, if the timeline from those three men was accurate. Wounds such as hers should not look as good as they did this soon after occurring. In all I counted thirty-eight of them, eight of which still had pellets inside, two of which looked like they might need to be dug out. I guess the other pellets had all fallen out already; the empty wounds were not deep at all, indicating either her scales were harder or thicker than they appeared or that her assailants shot at her from well outside effective range.
 
I started with the ones easiest to reach first. They couldn&#039;t have been less than an inch or so in her flesh -- easy to reach with the long forceps I had. Still, I exercised as much caution as possible to avoid causing even more trauma or undue discomfort. The fiery sting of alcohol was enough to bear already, judging by her twitching, and the constant flicking of her tail. I had to be extra careful; sometimes her tail would whack against the legs of the table as I worked, startling me. One by one, the pellets came out. I had no dish for them so I just let them fall to the concrete floor with a soft, tiny click. Sort of like chicken feed hitting the aluminum bucket.
 
Her silence was beginning to unnerve me. I didn&#039;t know if I was doing a good job or not. Even if I was doing poorly, would she show weakness by grimacing or hissing? Maybe she was like me; unsure of how to handle the situation, unsure of who was the threat to whom, and so she always thought to put on a strong facade. Either way, I didn&#039;t like the quiet, so I broke it.
 
&quot;My granddad -- you know, my father&#039;s father -- he and grandma built this house with their own hands way back when, before I was even born. He was a veterinarian. Took care of animals, I mean. That&#039;s where these instruments come from. He mostly took care of his own -- he used to have a couple cows, a horse, various other little critters.&quot; I pried out another pellet; her tail shifted angrily but her expression was unchanged. &quot;As weird as it seemed, he was also an avid fowl hunter. He and dad would sometimes go duck hunting in the marshlands that used to be a a few hours&#039; drive north. I went out there with them once, when I was old enough. It was great -- me, dad, and his dad -- three generations out for some bonding. Well, the day was spoiled pretty much the moment we got there. We found a duck another hunter had left. We didn&#039;t know why, maybe he couldn&#039;t find it after downing it or something -- but it appeared sort of okay. It was up and walking, quacking up a storm, but it just couldn&#039;t fly.&quot;
 
The last of the easy pellets was free, and I wiped down the forceps with alcohol-soaked gauze. Her blood on my hands was impossible to ignore; it was just as slick and warm as human blood, made different only by the golden yellow color. Fresh blood out of her agitated wounds was brighter. I saw her looking at me as I slid my fingers together and became embarrassed for some reason, then got back to work on the first of the deeper ones. &quot;It looked like the duck suffered a graze. The wing was torn up pretty bad, and there were entry wounds along the same side of the body. Dad wasn&#039;t about to let that spoil his day, but granddad was pretty upset. We ended up driving all the way back here, and I watched him pull every last pellet he could out of this bird. Dad told me that bird ended up living here. Even had a little pool built just for it. Ended up dying of old age.&quot;
 
I probed deeper with the forceps and felt the ends tap against a pellet. It was a careful business, using the forceps as an extension of my sense of touch and gauging where the edges of the pellet were, then firmly grasping it with the instrument and dragging it out. It was easy to tell this wound was worse because it appeared more inflamed, and her response to my touching was more pronounced. While digging this one out, I believe she may have mistook my leg for a table leg and squeezed pretty damn hard. She only realized when I said &#039;ouch&#039; and then my leg was free.
 
&quot;I watched my granddad the whole time as he picked out the birdshot. I thought it was pretty fascinating, you know?  And it was a good thing, too, because I ended up having to do this same thing for my brother way back when, when it was just us here.&quot; I grabbed hold of the second pellet, probably about two inches into her flesh, and gently began to pull it to the surface. Her tail slapped the wall so hard that even with her weight atop of it, she moved the table a good couple inches. I had to readjust to get a firm grip on the shot again, which just made her have to endure the poking and prodding a second time. A rivulet of yellow blood spilled out, staining the table, but with it came the last remnant of her attack. It fell to the ground with the others. I&#039;d pick them up later.
 
&quot;That was the last one. I, uh -- I don&#039;t know if you want me to stitch them up? I don&#039;t have suture materials. Not to mention I don&#039;t know if a suture needle would get through the scales--&quot; She cut me off by holding up one of her hands, then relaxed again, breathing a little heavier than before. I guessed that was a no to the sutures. Not that it mattered anyway. I cleaned up what little blood had spilled down her side, wiping gently to not irritate the wounds -- or her -- any further.
 
She slowly sat up pressing one of her hands against her side as she did, and slid off the table in a singular motion, using her tail to support everything she did. She took a look down at my leg, then looked me right in the eye and bowed her head at me.
 
&quot;Yeah. You&#039;re -- you&#039;re welcome. Are you able to move okay? Yeah? All right, we can head back upstairs. I&#039;ll show you to your room. I mean, if you want a room. You&#039;re welcome to stay if you like, is what I&#039;m trying to say.&quot;
 
Her eyes widened and she gave an me an energetic nod. I smiled at her, partly due to the nature of her answer, and partly just to see how it felt. Smiling seemed like such a human thing. Did it have the same meaning for aliens? If not, did they at least understand its significance? I hadn&#039;t done it in a long time, not even to the three humans that had shown up the other day. I&#039;ve just been on guard for ages, and to feel vulnerable again, to have let someone in my life literally and figuratively felt terrifying. Like at any moment the rug could be pulled out from under me and all this effort would be for nothing. I heard that awful whispering in the back of my mind saying this would be a mistake -- this longing to reconnect to someone, anyone at this point, would just be a long journey that ultimately proved why I shouldn&#039;t want to reconnect to anyone.
 
I didn&#039;t want to think like that anymore. So I just smiled to try it out. In truth, it felt good.
 
She followed me to the ground floor, then up the stairs to the second floor. I showed her my brother&#039;s old room. Everything was unchanged since he had left; his clothes were still in the bureau. His pre-invasion sports posters still decorated the walls. Some plastic models of tanks and fighter jets lay scattered about the various bookshelves. She rushed right in and made herself at home on the bed, curling up as much of herself as she could beneath the heavy blanket. A few feet of her tail hung off the side, though, and she&#039;d probably get a few drops of blood on the sheets, but I could change them later. Before I left I showed her how to use the lock on the door in case she wanted privacy, but she was already comfortably settled and felt no inclination to get up to test the lock.
 
&quot;I&#039;ll wake you for dinner, if you&#039;re not up already.&quot; She nodded again, but before I closed the door, something else came to mind. &quot;Can I ask you something?&quot;
 
She waited, leaning towards me slightly as if to say she was listening.
 
&quot;Do you have a name? I mean -- hang on, that came off sort of rude. Let me start over on that. My name&#039;s Liam. What&#039;s yours?&quot;
 
Her eyes fell to the floor and even with that natural scowl of hers, it seemed apparent she had something heavy on her mind. Slowly, she reached over with her right hand to the piece of shiny metal armor on her left arm. It split along a single seam and she slid it down her arm. She pointed at something on the inside, then grabbed it with her tail, which she snaked over to hand the armor to me. It was impossibly smooth in my hands and black, but so shiny it looked almost like silver. Up close I could see what she had pointed at, and it made my heart sink.
 
I only knew of the ADVENT language what I had seen on television, which was to say not a lot. But still, I knew enough to tell that the jumble of letters and numbers on the inside of her armor piece were entirely meaningless with regards to any syntax, let alone a name. It was a designation -- not a name. At the very end was a soul-crushing representation of everything she was and ever would be worth to her former masters: a barcode. The entirety of someone&#039;s life, able to be read by a handheld scanner. Something to be picked off of a shelf, consumed, and tossed away. Any fear left inside of me just gave way, replaced by overwhelming pity.
 
I put it as bluntly as I could. &quot;You know this isn&#039;t a name, right? This may have been how you were known then, but it isn&#039;t now. It shouldn&#039;t be, anyway. Do you want a name?&quot;
 
A hesitant, uncertain nod, but it was a yes.
 
Viper, viper, viper...Vicky? Nah, mean old neighbor lady pre-invasion. Victoria? Probably a bad sentiment there, she was an ex from high school. I knew a Violet but she died in a car accident; that seemed like some bad luck to put on my guest.
 
I had that itch in the back of my mind that usually told me I was overthinking, and reached up in vain to scratch it away. It seemed so dumb that every name I came up with had to start with a &#039;v&#039;, but I guess it was just one of those idiosyncrasies of the human mind, always trying to make patterns and and connections. The catalog of names in my head that started with &#039;v&#039; was short, so I thought screw it.
 
&quot;Well, what about &#039;Vee&#039; for now?&quot;
 
She cocked her head at me, as though considering it. I saw her shift her jaw side to side, as if she was moving the name around her mouth, maybe testing it out in her imagination. But then I saw her jaw move a little more, the bottom lip curled inward as if preparing to make a sound, and she breathed -- not spoke -- the name back to me in a voice that seemed to know English sounds but was uncomfortable saying them. &quot;Vee.&quot;
 
My heart jumped; so she could speak. Maybe it was hard for her to make human sounds, but it brought back the hope that maybe some day we actually could carry on a back and forth. &quot;Yeah! Yeah, that&#039;s it. I mean, you don&#039;t have to keep it. My grandma had a book of baby names in the house somewhere. I think I could find it for you if you like. I&#039;ll have it on the table when dinner&#039;s ready and you can find a name you might like better.&quot;
 
&quot;Vee.&quot;
 
I laughed. &quot;All right, then. Get some rest. Like I said, I&#039;ll let you know when dinner&#039;s ready.&quot; I watched her through the shrinking crack of the doorway curl up even tighter, shoving her head beneath the covers and settling into the place. The only part left of her I could see was a few feet of her tail hanging off the edge of the bed and spilling out from the covers onto the floor. The door clicked shut.
 
As I made my way back downstairs, my smile was so wide it made my face hurt. Alone no more. Please let her stay. I&#039;ll try to learn some ADVENT, I&#039;ll teach her English, I don&#039;t care what I have to do -- just please let her stay.

-Chapter 4-

I had dinner all set before I even bothered heading upstairs; eggs and potatoes, same as ever. Very rarely would I get to enjoy actual meat, and potatoes were some of the only vegetables that would grow. I sometimes got lucky with carrots, tomatoes, and peas, but it was a total crap-shoot even when I planted at the right time of year. The cities looked nice and clean on television, but everybody seemed to have conveniently forgotten the dust, grime, and rubble that polluted the air and earth these days even this long after the invasion. The soil has gotten worse as time has gone on. I imagined it&#039;s the same everywhere else, and I doubt ADVENT even cared. After all, one of their objectives was population consolidation and control. I had figured that out when they started banning all livestock. Control the food, control the people. 

&quot;Hey, Vee.&quot; I paused in front of her door and knocked twice, giving her some long moments to protest or lock it. When nothing happened, I slowly cracked the door to have a peek inside. The covers looked like they were hiding a small boulder that gradually began to stir the further I let myself in. Her face slowly rose from underneath the sheets, followed by her hood, neck, and body; not unlike one of those stereotypical snake charming cartoons from way back when. She locked her hands in front of her and thrust her arms all the way out in a good stretch, then took what I guessed was a great big yawn, complete with a quiet hissing. Even as friendly as things seemed between us for the moment, I couldn&#039;t stop my brain from throwing up red flags upon seeing that huge mouth of hers wide open, white fangs clearly visible.

&quot;You&#039;ve been sleeping for a while. It&#039;s just past nine. Or, uh, 2100 hours for you soldier types.&quot; Her eyes widened a bit with mild surprise. She seemingly fell out of bed; her upper body was almost entirely over the edge before her tail end slipped out from the covers and gracefully stopped her fall. The entire motion looked as if someone had poured her out of bed tail-first.

I stepped aside to let her past. Her wounds were already looking better. Some of them had already shut entirely, leaving only minor scars. I didn&#039;t know whether such rapid healing was natural to her species or if it was ADVENT technology. They used to talk up gene clinics on the television all the time; cure cancer, congenital defects, other diseases. I don&#039;t see why they couldn&#039;t give their soldiers fast healing.

I followed her downstairs. She remembered where the kitchen was and made a beeline for it, sliding around the edge of the table to one of the plates still softly steaming. Something in the back of my mind told me to ask her to wait, but I could only wish I had paid it any attention as she completely emptied her plate before I could even sit down. I had only just begun to plant my butt into a chair when she noticed the book of names I had found in the master bedroom, hidden beneath the bed among a treasure trove of artifacts from the good old days: children&#039;s books, doodles my brother and I had done, old birthday and get-well-soon cards addressed to our grandparents.

She looked thoughtfully at it, finally deciding to flip it open and skim through a handful of pages while downing the glass of water beside her empty plate in a single swig. I picked at my food but devoted most of my attention to watch her. She seemed only half-interested, never spending much time on any page before moving onto the next. Once or twice she would drag a finger down across a page, tap a dark claw against whatever it was that caught her attention, but then she&#039;d move on as if whatever had made her stop in the first place had never been interesting at all. She only bothered to look through the book for five minutes or so, then shut it and pushed it aside before taking in her surroundings.

&quot;So then you&#039;re happy with just Vee?&quot;

She made her way into the living room, taking a moment to nod at me over her shoulder. She stopped in front of the television, cocking her head at it and then looking around. I had half a mind to tell her how it worked, but I was reminded how foolish that was when she found the remote and began hitting buttons. Despite my own isolation, I had to keep telling myself these aliens had been out and about on Earth for the past twenty years. They must have been intimately familiar with all the little technological comforts humanity had: radios, televisions, computers, whatever -- and that&#039;s not even mentioning all the high-tech stuff I&#039;m sure they brought with them. I doubted I would have to tell Vee how to use anything; she would know or be smart enough to figure it out.

Sure enough, she managed to get the television on and she sat back on the couch, coiling her tail beneath her as she watched. It was an old 37-inch CRT my grandparents had bought, thinking they were modernizing. In truth, they got it because it was cheapened by the arrival of affordable flat-screens around the early 2000s. It&#039;s only lasted so long because it hardly ever got any use. It looked sleek for its time, but now it was just a big grey box that only got two channels: the big 24/7 former ADVENT news station that had now been repurposed by the resistance, and a year-long-running pirate broadcast that played nothing but old black-and-whites. I guess tracking down the latter was never high up on ADVENT&#039;s priority list once the resistance started making bigger and bigger waves.

I didn&#039;t feel like eating alone, so I took my plate and glass into the living room and sat down on the recliner beside the couch, making sure to step over her tail as I walked by the center table. She flipped through both channels, then quickly went back to the news, which was now talking about something called the &#039;psionic network&#039;. I listened as I ate. I had heard it mentioned once or twice before, but the name was about all I knew. Vee appeared rapt, however, her eyes glued to the screen while she languidly sprawled across the entire couch, leaving much of her tail hanging off of the far side. The way she sometimes moved her body while keeping her head still reminded me of a chicken.

&quot;As resistance forces penetrate deeper and deeper into the defunct ADVENT network,&quot; said the field reporter, his face covered by a half-mask presumably meant to shield him from the smoke of the hellish scene behind him, &quot;there appears to be mounting evidence worldwide that the psionic network -- used by ADVENT to communicate with its forces -- was in fact an insidious method of mental influence. Retributive campaigns across the globe have come across startlingly ineffective opposition, raising the question of whether or not the aliens know how to fight without their masters, or whether they even want to fight at all. Under the condition of anonymity, a resistance cell member spoke to us, saying, &#039;it&#039;s like they&#039;re all confused. They don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on. Nobody&#039;s pulling their strings anymore&#039;. His claims appear to be backed up by numbers from X-COM itself, showing a sharp rise in alien detainees and concurrent drop in human casualties across the globe.&quot;

Vee sighed. At least, it sounded like a sigh. Maybe a hiss was the same as a sigh. I had no clue. Either way, afterwards she looked as if someone had lifted a weight from her shoulders. She sat up just a little straighter, her tongue darting rapidly as the report went on. The news had caught my interest now, as well. So what was being said? The aliens were slaves? That the enforcers were themselves being forced?

&quot;Even now, there is a growing schism within resistance forces. An increasing number of fighters are advocating for attempts at rehabilitation, citing reports of some aliens striving to protect humans from the more violent of their kind, and of a place called City 31, where aliens and hybrids are allegedly being offered sanctuary among the primarily human population. We have been unable to gain access to this city, as thanks to its newfound publicity it has temporarily shut down all access in an attempt to keep out those who would seek to do harm. Other groups say to maintain the status quo and continue the campaign of extermination, that eliminating alien forces while they are seemingly disoriented is the way to permanent victory. For now it seems those wishing for extermination have the momentum, but for how long?  We just don&#039;t know. Daryl Weller, Resistance News Network.&quot;

The reporter cut away to one of the anchormen, who was interviewing someone that suddenly seemed unimportant in the wake of this new information. So all of the soldiers -- troopers, the vipers, the tall grinning ones with big eyes, everybody -- they were all forced labor?

&quot;Was that you, Vee? Was that your life?&quot; She spared me a quick glance, nothing more than an acknowledgement that she had heard me. After a moment&#039;s thought she looked again, her gaze lingering, and she slowly nodded. I finished the last of my dinner and asked, &quot;What did it feel like?&quot;

Her eyes wandered aimlessly around the room as she struggled with her thoughts. I had probably asked a question that required too complex of an answer given her apparent difficulty in making english sounds. I suppose she gave up because she just looked around one last time and shrugged, but then must have had some idea because her face lit up. She grabbed an old wind-up alarm clock from the table -- another of my grandparent&#039;s relics -- and wound the mechanism over and over before setting it on the table. A moment later and it began its irritating ringing. Vee held a hand out to it, as though it were representative of her thoughts.

I didn&#039;t quite understand what she was trying to tell me. Was it an irritating ringing in her head that told her to do this or that? Or was she just some sort of wind-up automaton that acted only when permitted by the Elders? Maybe the ringing was always there, and doing what she was told would lessen or eliminate it entirely. She must have seen my lack of understanding, the look of clueless thought on my face, because she just shrugged and left it at that.

I slapped the reset atop the ringer. &quot;Well, you belong to nobody now. You&#039;re welcome to stay for as long as you like,&quot; I said, though my heart sank at the mere thought of her leaving.

Then immediately perked up again when I thought I saw what looked to be a hint of a smile. It was strange and different, but there was an unmistakable pull at the corners of her mouth. Maybe it really was a smile. Maybe it was some alien facial expression that was a smile-analogue, or maybe it was something else entirely, but it definitely looked like the start of a smile. It faded quickly and she instead bowed her head to me again.

&quot;Yeah, sure. Don&#039;t mention it.&quot; I put my dish on the accent table beside the recliner and sat back to see her pointing. &quot;What? Me? What about me?&quot;

She nodded, then started to look around again. She zeroed in on the wind-up clock again. Grabbing it, she took a moment to check the time in the corner of the newscast and then set it on the clock and showed it to me; 9:57. She then wound it back one hour and showed it to me again. She could tell I was thinking it over, so she repeated it several more times, winding it forward and back, forward and back, each time hoping what she was trying to say would click in my brain. Current time. Past. Current. Past. Past and present.

&quot;My past? You want to know about me?&quot; She held her hands out as if expecting more. &quot;There&#039;s not a whole lot to me, I&#039;m afraid. I was born in Tennessee before the invasion, been here my whole life, and -- &quot; I stopped she she looked a little confused. &quot;Tennessee. It&#039;s a state. It used to be anyway, before ADVENT divvied up the country into three zones. Last time I saw a map on the television, it looked like this house was just outside the border of the, uh -- what do you call it -- I think I heard it referred to as the Eastern United States Trade Zone, or something else just as long-winded. Grew up pretty normal, went to school, fell into coding and programming, thought I was going to make a pretty good computer engineer or something before the invasion happened. Parents brought me and my brother out here once aliens started landing, and I&#039;ve been here since.&quot;

She pointed past me this time, and I followed her finger to an old family photo sitting atop a dusty bookshelf in the far corner of the room. My parents smiled, each with their hands on their sons&#039; shoulders. My grandparents stood on either side, smiling just as widely. I don&#039;t know why, but I think when that picture was taken -- that was when I first realized how old my grandparents were. How they wouldn&#039;t be around forever, how we had to try and make the good times last. Turns out they wouldn&#039;t last for much longer after that picture was taken.

&quot;My family,&quot; I said as she made a grabbing motion. I handed it to her for a closer look. &quot;My mom and dad, dad&#039;s parents on the sides, and me and my brother are the short ones. I&#039;m the one with in the striped shirt. Grandparents never made it out here, and mom and dad died defending us.&quot; She waited for more, but when I kept quiet she tapped a claw against my brother&#039;s face. 

I hesitated, something that drew her in even more. I didn&#039;t know whether or not to be honest about him. It wasn&#039;t only that I had little to say about him -- what if she harbored a grudge against the resistance and anyone even loosely associated with it? Even though I haven&#039;t seen him in so long, his decision might influence her attitude against me in some way. On the other hand, I was never a good liar, and being apart from other people for so long has surely made that even more noticeable. If I were to lie now, she would probably be able to tell. And then what questions might plague her? Why would I lie? What was I hiding?

I relented. &quot;He left eight years ago to join the resistance. Haven&#039;t seen him since then, and I don&#039;t even know if he&#039;s alive.&quot; She looked at the picture a little harder, and I started to wonder if she had run into him before. But she only shrugged and handed the photo back to me. This time, I pointed at her. &quot;What about you? What&#039;s in your past?&quot;

She held her hands apart with only a short distance between them; not much, she seemed to be saying. She went back to the kitchen, fished something about of the garbage can, and slithered back to her seat to show me. In her hands she held two halves of a broken egg I had made for dinner. She held them together and broke them apart several times to make sure I understood. I did, and she must have seen it in my eyes because she moved onto the next part of her life -- signified by finger guns.

&quot;You were hatched and then...they made you start fighting? Or they taught you to fight?&quot; She energetically pointed at me upon my second guess. &quot;How long ago were you hatched?&quot;

She thrust up two fingers and then a balled up fist. She was just twenty years old. That was when I realized she was only as old as the invasion. The horrible thought crossed my mind that she had been hatched specifically to fight a war. Hell, she had probably been born right here on Earth. She had not been a soldier by unfortunate circumstance, some poor child born at just the wrong time to be drafted to take part in a planetary occupation, who might&#039;ve led a normal life under different circumstances. No, her life had been laid out by the Elders well before she had ever been born. They had envisioned a soldier, and a soldier is what they had made. 

Only now the war was over, and there were no more masters.

&quot;Well, nobody is going to force you to fight anymore, so what you do from here on out is for you to decide,&quot; I told her, getting up to wash my dish in the sink. I collected hers from the table as I passed it by. &quot;I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve heard it before, but there&#039;s an old saying: tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life.&quot;

As I washed the dishes I threw a glance over my shoulder to see her looking at the floor, her hands folded in her lap. Or, I guess it would be her lap, since she had a tail instead of legs. I quietly chuckled to myself; she was more human than she knew, or perhaps the daunting prospect of figuring out one&#039;s purpose is a universal challenge that all intelligent beings grapple with.

&quot;Don&#039;t think so hard about it. You just sort of -- you know, take it day by day. I&#039;ll tell you what,&quot; I said as she looked up at me, &quot;go get yourself cleaned up. You&#039;ve been here a day, you must have been on the run for a couple weeks at the last. If you like there&#039;s a full bathroom across from the room you&#039;re staying--&quot; I stopped. That sounded wrong, so I tried again. &quot;Across from your room, I mean. Take a shower and get cleaned up. You&#039;ll feel better. Trust me.&quot;

She seemed to lighten up at the thought. Out there for as long as she was, she must have had a ton of grime between those scales of hers. I knew for a fact the only running water nearby was a small stream to the east, but the water wasn&#039;t exactly what I would call clean. I might&#039;ve used it to soak a rag and wipe my forehead or cool my neck, but I would never have submerged myself it in, nor used it near my eyes or mouth without boiling it for longer than usual. Even if she had found it during her escape, I doubted it would have made much difference. Clean water, though, could be therapeutic. Wash away the grit and grime, and sometimes wash away the weight of the day and the challenges it may have brought.

&quot;There&#039;s towels already in there and the left knob is hot water,&quot; I said as she slid upstairs, &quot;but go easy on it. It never lasts as long as you want it to. The dresser in your room is chock full of clothes. My brother was sort of a tank of a man; as big as they are, I don&#039;t know if any of his shirts will fit over your hood. You may have to stretch or tear one, that&#039;s fine. If you need anything else, I&#039;ll still be up for a little while longer. I&#039;ve got to check the server in the basement, make sure the updates I fed it a few days ago are sticking. After that I&#039;ll head to bed.&quot;

She disappeared, and I continued to clean up. I had the dishes done and had just begun to package the left-overs when I heard the muffled roar of water rushing through the pipes, quickly followed by the patter of water. Next there were a series of heavy thuds that made me wince; I surmised she must have removed her armor pieces and they might have left a few dents in the tile with how heavy they sounded. I quickly decided it didn&#039;t matter in the least next to this indescribable relief I felt.

Relative to the deathly silence of living alone, this was an absolute delightful commotion. I couldn&#039;t have been happier. Doing some simple chores while another part of the house was noisy with life made the house feel lived in, instead of it simply being a place that I happened to live in. A part of me I had nearly forgotten slowly came to life again; a feeling I hadn&#039;t experienced since the last happy moment my brother and I had shared who knew how long ago. The rational side of my brain was shouting at me -- don&#039;t get attached, don&#039;t expect her here tomorrow, don&#039;t share so much of yourself -- but next to the racket I heard upstairs, it may as well have been barely a whisper.

-Chapter 5-
 
I woke up feeling refreshed and well-rested for the first time in days. No hazy dreams that felt like hallucinations, no frustrating teasing of what it meant to belong to a bigger picture anymore -- just a deep, satisfying slumber. I slapped my alarm clock, then realized it was already silent. I had woken up five minutes early. Didn&#039;t matter to me. I cancelled the alarm, got dressed, and walked out into the hall.
 
Vee&#039;s door was already open, though the room was still dark. I softly called her name but got no response, so I flicked the light on. The bed was neatly made, and some of the dresser drawers were open with a few unfolded shirts scattered inside. A sinking feeling in my gut began to spoil my good morning, but it was then I saw her armor methodically arranged in the corner of the room. The chest piece leaned against the wall, its oddly-shaped and segmented tail piece stretching out further onto the floor, while the segments that covered the top of her hood and neck seemed to fold down into the armor piece itself. The arms were arranged on each side, leaning against the chest. My gut-wrenching worry ebbed; if she had left, surely she would have taken her armor with her.
 
I heard noise as I approached the top of the stairs, noise that became clearer as I descended; it was the television. I came down to find Vee curled up in front of the screen, close enough to make me think of all the times my parents had told me to sit back, lest I ruined my eyes. She was surrounded by a handful of books, all arranged around her such that she needed only turn her head to read any of them. I slowly crept up to take a peek and saw they were dictionaries, encyclopedias, and even a few children&#039;s books. She had to have gotten them from the bookcase in the corner, in front of which sat another pile taken from the shelves. Grandma never could let go of our kid stuff.
 
She was wearing one of my brother&#039;s old t-shirts; one of his favorites during his teenage metal phase -- influenced by dad, of course. The Metallica logo was emblazoned across the front in that ubiquitous chrome-looking font that seemed to grace every piece of branded clothing from around dad&#039;s time. In the television&#039;s soft glow I could see a few stretch marks around the neck. She must have fought with it a little bit to fit it over her hood but in all, the shirt seemed no worse for wear. It hung loosely on her chest and torso while her arms appeared unable to fully fill out the sleeves. Despite her overall size, I guess her upper body was just a bit smaller than my brother&#039;s.
 
&quot;You been up long?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said with a short hiss on the end, refusing to pull her attention from the screen. Her gaze seemed fixed on the mouth of whatever pundit was currently on-screen. She wasn&#039;t paying attention to headlines or the scrolling ticker at the bottom.
 
I had been expecting a nod. Her answer caught me by complete surprise and left me momentarily stunned. &quot;You can talk now?&quot;
 
&quot;Better. Learn.&quot; She used her tail to spin some of the children&#039;s books to face me. One of which I recognized on closer inspection; my grandmother had used it to teach me how to speak more clearly as a young man. It had complex words for a child, along with some cut-away drawings of a person&#039;s mouth making the required sounds. Whether the tongue was pressing on the roof of the mouth or back of the teeth, what shape the lips should take -- it showed things like that.
 
&quot;So, how&#039;s it going?&quot;
 
She pointed at the talking head, her natural scowl shifting to a merely frustrated frown. &quot;Speaks fast.&quot;
 
I felt bad in that moment, like I had the upper hand in a one-sided relationship. A friendship was built on compromise and effort, neither of which I felt like I was putting forth. It shouldn&#039;t have been all on Vee to bridge the communication gap between us. &quot;I can learn more ADVENT. I know a little bit already from what used to be on the news--&quot;
 
&quot;ADVENT. Not mine,&quot; she stuttered. Each syllable was slow and very carefully thought out, as though she had to construct the word in her mouth before it made its way past her lips. Her speech was breathy and forced, as though she was exhaling every word instead of speaking it. It seemed she had an issue with hard consonants, specifically ones that required the tongue pressed against a full set of teeth. She could adapt, but it would require practice.
 
&quot;Oh. So then, what&#039;s your language? Could I learn it?&quot;
 
&quot;Dowd. Full. Dowd -- doubt,&quot; she said, finally managing to get the hard &#039;t&#039; sound. &quot;Doubt. Full.&quot;
 
&quot;All right then,&quot; I said, turning the books she had moved back around to face her, &quot;is there anything I can do to help?&quot;
 
Vee looked at the television disapprovingly, then spun the coils of her body, shifting around to face me. She picked the dictionary up off the floor, handed it to me, and said &quot;Talk slow.&quot;
 
I started reading words at random. I felt like a fool, to be honest; a natural speaker&#039;s reaction to a non-native is usually to talk slowly, but I had always thought it was a useless gesture. Speaking English slowly to someone that did not understand English would not make things easier on them. Her issue was not one of understanding, however -- based on the ease with which she understood me, it was clear she had a good vocabulary. Her sole issue was vocalization. With a vastly different tongue and mouth, she would have to move them in slightly different ways to produce the same sounds as me. So for about the next hour, she just sat and watched -- maybe a little too close for comfort, not that I would say anything -- as I read from the dictionary. She asked me to repeat almost every word several times, not for lack of understanding but for getting a handle on what my mouth was doing. She would dissect each syllable into its component sounds, deconstructing difficult words piecemeal until she was able to string together each syllable almost as naturally as a native speaker.
 
She would copy as best she could, and I would attempt to explain what it was my tongue was doing behind my lips as I pronounced this syllable or that. I wasn&#039;t a great teacher, but it was obvious she was an excellent student. I began to suspect that her intelligence was not just equal to mine, but greater. If not in general than certainly with respect to language. I had Spanish-speaking friends during my middle- and high-school years for long enough to understand some of the vocabulary, but I was never able to sloppily string together more than a few words, even after a few classes. But here she was merely watching me speak and already she was getting a grasp on the specifics.
 
I would have been happy to sit there all day and help her, but when I glanced at the television and saw what time it was, I had to stop. The chickens were probably getting ornery. Ever since Vee&#039;s first visit their feeding times have been more and more inconsistent. I let her know and she shut off the television, slid all of the books -- still open to whatever page they were on -- to one side of the room, and uncoiled herself to follow me outside.
 
We made our way to the chicken coop and I showed her how to read the display panel and all of its read-outs: temperature, water, air flow, humidity. Each of them had an acceptable range, and so long as the values were in those ranges, no changes were needed. While I was talking she quickly devised how to work the feed dispenser and filled the bucket up, then tried to hand it off to me.
 
&quot;Be my guest,&quot; I said. She looked uneasily at the door. &quot;Don&#039;t worry about it. They&#039;re chickens. They&#039;ve got short memories, and whoever&#039;s got the food is their best friend. Just head on in, grab handfuls of the stuff and throw it around in little piles.&quot;
 
Of course I was right. The chickens didn&#039;t care one bit and seemed to have entirely forgotten the night they had met Vee, silently cowering in the corner as she and I had shared our tense initial greeting. Vee scooped out giant handfuls of feed and drew lines on the ground with it, observing with intense interest how the chickens would follow whatever shapes she created. It almost looked as if she was having fun. Usually her movements appeared reserved and calculated -- perhaps to avoid startling me or something -- but here she was lively and quick. I couldn&#039;t tell if she was trying to keep beaks and talons away from her tail or if she was just enjoying herself. She went back to being careful and slow around the chicks, though. I guess she was afraid of hurting them, small as they were.
 
In short order the feed was all on the ground and we moved on, with me explaining that I liked to get most of my daily routine out of the way in the morning so I wouldn&#039;t be out during the hottest part of the day. We circled around to the back of the house, where I had some water barrels and my garden directly adjacent to them. The barrels were mostly empty -- it hadn&#039;t rained for about two weeks, so I was sparingly using reserves and the well -- but had more than enough in them to fill the pressure-pump container I used to water the garden. Vee seemed curious again, so I talked her through it, even as simple as it was. I didn&#039;t want to drown the plants; a simple drizzle would do, enough to wet the leaves and soak the dirt.
 
She gently took the pump from my hands and followed my lead, doing as I had done. As she worked I saw she would often steal quick glances my way, and when I would notice she would immediately turn her attention back to the task at hand. Her hesitant nature triggered a bothersome feeling I couldn&#039;t shake. Was she waiting for something? Did she want me to say good job, keep it up, you&#039;re doing great -- did she want approval? For what possible reason? My thoughts wormed their way into some dark places that I didn&#039;t like in the least.
 
&quot;Vee,&quot; I said, waiting for her to look at me, &quot;I&#039;m not going to say no to help around the house. I just want you to know my good will towards you does not hinge on you being useful to me. You get what I&#039;m saying?&quot;
 
She straightened up immediately, towering over me, and that natural scowl of hers cracked and softened into a blank stare that sure looked to me like shock. I wasn&#039;t certain if it was, but I knew I had caught her off guard. She had that deer-in-headlights look about her. She stood frozen to the spot for some moments, barely so much as swaying in the wind, before offering a timid nod.
 
&quot;I&#039;m just happy to have somebody -- anybody around,&quot; I said, looking down to kick the dirt. Admitting the obvious after almost a decade still took a chunk out of my pride. I spent all that time thinking I was some kind of strong for isolating myself -- that I didn&#039;t need anyone else, that I could take care of myself, that I could somehow outlast the horrors of alien occupation. Maybe I was in some way to have lasted as long as I did, but I guess I was also kind of stupid for thinking there&#039;d be no downsides, no side-effects. Even now, like termites constantly eating away at my insides, I still had the cavernous pit at the bottom of my gut and the persistent whispering in the back of my mind that made me wonder if I was weak for wanting to socialize again. I wondered when -- if ever -- I would get the chance to prove that side of me wrong. &quot;Being alone sucks, to be honest.&quot;
 
Her posture slackened and her movements thereafter were carefree and languid, as if she were made of liquid. She must have felt like a freeloader all this time, afraid at any second I&#039;d just kick her out. Which itself was a funny thought; she was stronger than me in every way. I know from experience that people pushed too far in survival situations will do what they must, and I didn&#039;t feel like testing to see how much she liked me.
 
After breakfast, she still insisted on helping around the house. We emptied what was left of the water barrels into the reservoir in the basement and set them back outside; it looked like some rain was on the horizon, so that was good. Afterwards I took her to the generator on the opposite side of the house. I had her yank the tarp back to uncover the solar panel and she angled it to best capture the light from the sun, now nearly entirely in the air. I washed some clothes and had her take the ones already on the line down.
 
The rest of the morning was spent doing chores inside. The server needed its daily maintenance, piece of garbage that it was. While I did that she picked up the pellets I had removed from her body last night -- marveling, no doubt, at how primitive a thing as a ball bearing was used as a weapon compared to the high-tech rifles I knew ADVENT had -- and straightened everything out on the shelves. It wasn&#039;t needed but she probably just wanted to look busy. Since we were already in the basement, I took inventory of how much food was left. Now that two people were living here, supplies would dwindle twice as quickly. Once I had the numbers I&#039;d see how much faster we were running through food and water and adjust the daily routines accordingly. Power was never an issue, thanks to the solar generator; it was more than enough to keep a light on or two while running the the various appliances in the house. I could count on one hand the number of times I had mistakenly drained it, and that was before I had learned what the generator&#039;s capabilities were.
 
We just relaxed for the rest of the day. Our chores done, I joined her in the living room where she had the television on again, but not so much interest in the books. I supposed she had grown tired of the news because she was watching the pirate broadcast -- the one of old black-and-whites. Casablanca, From Here to Eternity, and A Streetcar Named Desire were common reruns, but every few months the channel would run a new one. Currently they were running Frankenstein, which had an iron-grip on Vee&#039;s attention; she seemed more interested in the story than she did in watching how the character&#039;s mouths moved. Did she feel like a made monster, where Earth was the small sleepy village that hated her when all she wanted was to be left alone?
 
Vee pretty much mainlined black-and-whites until dinner. While she was in the middle of Casablanca I made off to the basement to grab something very special from the freezers, which I took to the kitchen and left in a pot of lukewarm water. By the time the movie was over and the next had begun, the bag was mostly defrosted and I began pulling out a few ingredients that I made very sparse use of. Most of my garden space was taken up by essentials, so growing herbs and spices was a luxury I was seldom able to afford myself. I always wanted to expand the garden, but more gardening meant more water usage, so I always held off.
 
I had barely started to prep the meal when I felt her presence behind me, shortly followed by her shadow ominously encroaching upon the kitchen counter, enveloping my workspace. I swore I could hear her tongue going crazy. I guess she used hers to smell, just like Earth snakes did.
 
&quot;Have you ever had chicken before?&quot;
 
&quot;No.&quot;
 
I popped open each container, handing them to Vee for her to smell. &quot;Thyme, rosemary, garlic. Here, I think this one is basil. Or oregano. Shoot, now I&#039;ve got them mixed up. Anyway, any of them you don&#039;t like? Anything smell weird to you?&quot;
 
She went for another round of each, holding them below her face as her tongue lashed in and out. Her upper lip curled just slightly for two. &quot;Thyme. Garlic.&quot;
 
&quot;Okay, rosemary and basil it is.&quot; I stripped the leaves of the former from their stems and handed the dried, crumbling basil to Vee. She was unsure of what to do and stood there with a blank stare. &quot;It&#039;s dry because it lasts longer that way. You should just be able to crumble it up with your hands,&quot; I said, using tongs to pull chicken parts out of the bag and placing them on a baking sheet. &quot;Just put it between your hands and roll it like so -- like you&#039;re trying to start a fire with sticks. Do it over the chicken so you&#039;re sprinkling it all over as you go. But wait, before you do that--&quot; I took some leftover vegetable soup broth from the fridge and drizzled some over each piece. it would offer some mild flavor and would make the seasoning stick.
 
She did as I instructed while I diced the rosemary. She was keen to watch me as I moved the knife with practiced ease. My mother had been the family cook, and she taught the rest of us how to get things done in the kitchen. Dinner was always a family affair back in the day, before and after the invasion. Everybody was always happiest then, with mom running the kitchen like a head chef as the rest of us each manned a station. My brother and I usually dealt with chopping and dicing, while dad was on sauce duty. Mom was always the last one in the kitchen, combining everything we had made while we waited for it all to come together. That was the sole remnant my brother and I had clung to when our parents had died. No matter how much we argued, no matter what disagreement had dominated the day, all of our troubles just melted away in the kitchen, like butter. We might pick up our yelling and shouting afterwards, but dinner was sacred and neither of us wanted to ruin a good meal with any animosity.
 
The chicken, now sporting a healthy helping of herbs, went into the preheated oven. Vee stared expectantly, her eyes darting to the oven, to me, then back again.
 
&quot;Relax. It&#039;ll take a little while. Let&#039;s just go back to the movie and it&#039;ll be done before you know it.&quot;
 
Despite my advice, however, it was impossible to ignore the aroma that swept through the house, that seemed to so heavy it threatened to soak into the very walls. My mouth was watering the second I got my first whiff. Vee&#039;s...well, whatever her deal was, she couldn&#039;t keep her attention on the movie; she&#039;d lean back every five seconds to get a better look inside the kitchen, and I could all but hear her thinking &#039;is it done yet&#039; over and over. For her, it was the promise of something new and exciting that she hadn&#039;t even known existed. For me, it was the memories of a happy past that I had done my best to suppress to remind myself being alone wasn&#039;t so bad. I had been successful in doing just that when by myself, but with Vee in the house, those feelings became too much to ignore. It was times like this I realized how easy it was to confuse stoic strength with desolate denial.
 
The chicken was done after what felt like ages. Vee seemed coiled like a spring, and the moment I sat up she was right there beside me in lockstep -- or lock-slither. Whatever. I had the good sense to set the table before making a plate. Two plates, two forks. Maybe with the utensils out already she&#039;d be more inclined to use them.
 
The chicken was most certainly done, and it could not have been more perfect. The skin was just beginning to turn golden brown, dry enough to have just a hint of crunch but still moist and holding in the flavor of the herbs and broth. They came right off the pan, their resting sides barely darker. We had nearly the whole chicken: two legs, thighs, wings, but just one breast. I had eaten that for my birthday two months ago. I split it up, giving her the lion&#039;s share; she was bigger anyway, never mind the fact I had already had some of the chicken. When she noticed the difference between her plate and mine, she paused.
 
&quot;Less,&quot; she said, pointing at my plate as I sidled past her to sit at the table.
 
&quot;It&#039;s all right. I had some of my share earlier in the year.&quot; She stood rigidly, her eyes locked onto her plate. &quot;Vee, seriously. I&#039;ll be fine. Enjoy it.&quot;
 
Only at my insistence did she finally relent, and she slid on over to the opposite side of the table with her dish. She carefully inspected the mound of chicken in front of her, poking and prodding as her tongue constantly tasted the air. She rubbed away the grease that stuck to her finger, then did it all over again.
 
I watched as she slipped both hands under either side of the plate, and before she could shovel the whole thing into her mouth, I said, &quot;It&#039;ll last a lot longer if you just take little bites. And you don&#039;t want to eat the bones.&quot;
 
She stopped but only looked at the fork, as though still considering her options. Though with unexpected confidence, she picked it up and got right to it. I guess I had been expecting a moment of thought from her, some pause as she figured out what to do. There was, of course, only one way to use a fork, but I just hadn&#039;t expected her to know right away. I supposed it just added the surreality of it all. An alien snake in my house, eating chicken with a fork, while wearing a slightly over-sized Metallica t-shirt, while sitting at the table. With me. The part of my mind that had thought it had worked out long ago what was and wasn&#039;t normal was still trying to figure this one out.
 
Her first bite looked almost cathartic, and the overwhelming emotion in her reaction was so obvious I nearly laughed out loud. She savored the first bite for a while, then apparently decided that there was no way to get the rest in her stomach fast enough, and her pace quickened. She ate strangely. Every time she brought a forkful of chicken to her mouth, her forked tongue would slip out and wrap around it before it disappeared inside entirely.
 
&quot;So, Vee,&quot; I said between bites, &quot;What did you do, y&#039;know -- during the war? Like, you understand me, we can talk pretty well, you&#039;ve got a handle on human gestures. Were you around humans a lot?&quot; She stopped, gulped down her latest mouthful, and seemed apprehensive. &quot;I&#039;m not asking -- I mean, I know. It was a war. That&#039;s not what I&#039;m getting at. I&#039;m just wondering--&quot;
 
&quot;Tracker. Hunt. Observe. Engage,&quot; she said, downing her glass of water all at once. She held her hands in circles around her eyes. &quot;Observed. Long time.&quot; She added with a slight shrug before diving back into her dinner. She only got a few bites more before she stopped and asked, &quot;You? During war.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#039;m no fighter. My brother was, which caused a lot of tension between us. He wasn&#039;t happy just surviving; he wanted to join the resistance, which he did one day. Just up and left, leaving only a note behind explaining his intentions. I didn&#039;t know what to do with myself, so I just stayed put. Been here about twenty years, totally alone for the last eight before you came along. Just, you know -- taking it one day at a time.&quot; Her posture drooped and her features softened. What could it be? Pity? Ridicule? &quot;It wasn&#039;t all bad. Never had ADVENT come knocking on my door, never lost my chickens or my life. Waking up each day was a win in my book. Unlike my brother. Some people live to serve, and some just want to live.&quot;
 
At that she let go of a sort of chuffing noise, a quick grunt-like sound that ended in a subdued hiss, and the corners of her mouth pulled back slightly. Was that a laugh? &quot;Hatched. To serve,&quot; she said with a hand on her chest.
 
An alien snake with the start of a sense of humor. Another thing to add to the list of surreality.
 
Her head whipped up, her eyes tracking up the stairs before slowly scanning the kitchen ceiling. She pinpointed a spot and just kept staring, her eyes narrowing.
 
&quot;What?&quot;
 
&quot;Noise,&quot; she hissed. I cocked my head and listened, trying hard to separate the television from whatever it was she was hearing. After straining for a few moments, I heard it too. My heart stopped. It was the perimeter alarm.
 
&quot;Shit, something&#039;s crossed the property line,&quot; I said, shooting up from my seat. normally I would not have been so alarmed, but the most recent breaches were all things far larger and more dangerous than a fox. I had only been lucky that no ill intentions had come with my recent visitors. Whatever it was out there, I had no clue how close it was. Was it walking or sprinting? Was it bee-lining for the house or just skirting along the edge of the property? Was there hostile intent this time or mere curiosity?
 
&quot;Get the hell out here, ADVENT!&quot; someone shouted at the top of their lungs. The color drained from my face. By the voice alone any idiot could tell there was hatred. What curdled my blood more was that I felt as if I recognized the voice, which could only have meant it was one of the men from days ago. Why would they have come back? What could possibly have them furious with me? Even considering the circumstances I had been kind, courteous, hospitable when we had met -- everything a person should be. Why would they call me ADVENT? Minus the server in the basement, I thought I came off pretty well as stereotypically simple countryfolk.
 
Vee whipped herself out from around the table, her head sunken low to the floor like a predator on the hunt, or a soldier desperate for cover. She found the latter by pressing herself to the kitchen-living room adjoining wall, where she stayed low to the ground with her upper body seemingly perched upon her fingertips, trying her hardest to peek around the corner and through the front window. The pair of stark white lights shone through, scanning for anything inside.
 
&quot;Vee,&quot; I whispered, my throat tight and hoarse from fear. Her attention snapped to me. &quot;Get my gun. In my room, beneath the bed, left side. It&#039;s fully loaded. Just in case.&quot;
 
She looked worriedly at the window painted by flashlight, then back to me. &quot;Don&#039;t.&quot;
 
That she could so easily infer my course of action spoke to a perception of hers that I had so far missed, or to the ease with which I spilled my guts to a stranger. Either way, her desperately shaking her head did nothing to deter me.
 
&quot;I&#039;m not ADVENT,&quot; I shouted back, watching Vee slither noiseless across the floor to the stairs. &quot;I&#039;m coming out unarmed. Please don&#039;t shoot, okay? We can talk.&quot;
 
I slowly rose to my feet and approached the front door, where through the sidelights I could see the flashlights were now focused. That there were just two beams of light outside made me worry. If it was the three men from before -- and it had to be -- where was the third?
 
&quot;I&#039;m coming out,&quot; I said, cracking the door just enough to wave my hand outside. With no response I slid fully outdoors, shielding my eyes from the bright white lights. My eyes took what felt like hours to adjust, but sure enough two men stood not twenty yards off. I squinted to make use of what little light dusk had left to offer and saw exactly what I had expected. There were my last visitors. Eric, the asian fellow, and -- if memory served, the black man with the thick accent was Gerard. But one was missing.
 
&quot;Where&#039;s Donovan?&quot;
 
&quot;You shut your goddamned mouth,&quot; Eric spat. He was clearly shaken. Not by anger, but something else had happened. His jacket had a few new holes in it, and his light blue jeans had a deep scarlet slash running down the outside of his left leg. He held his flashlight in his armpit, seemingly struggling with both hands to point his weapon directly at me. Gerard followed suit with aim just as shaky as his friends. He, too, looked like he&#039;d been through hell, dirt and mud caked into his clothing as if he&#039;d been crawling through it for days, and one of the shoulder straps of his backpack was hanging by a literal thread. The entire side of his left arm looked shredded pretty bad, like he&#039;d caught a bunch of birdshot. Or shrapnel.
 
&quot;What the hell happened to you guys?&quot;
 
&quot;As if you don&#039;t know,&quot; Eric said, venom coursing through his words. &quot;You sent us into an ambush. You knew!&quot;
 
Already I felt as if the situation had gotten away from me and I had the gnawing thought I had just bitten off more than I could ever hope to chew. &quot;Into a what? How could I have done that? God&#039;s sake, why would I have done that?&quot;
 
&quot;&#039;Cause your a dirty collaborator, is why. The set-up was too perfect. They knew we were coming, and we know who you&#039;ve got inside,&quot; Gerard said, smiling as the worrying realization spread across my face. &quot;Yeah, that&#039;s right. We saw you playing house with your filthy alien master all morning. After popping open your skull, we&#039;ll skin that scaley bitch alive.&quot;
 
We&#039;d barely spoken for a minute. I didn&#039;t know where to start. My head swam with a thousand things to say and at the end of each sentence I just saw my own death. I thought I would have had more time, more chances, more things to say. I thought they would have been more reasonable. As the seconds passed, I suddenly couldn&#039;t believe I thought I ever had a chance. Vee had known from the start I was walking into a hopeless situation.
 
&quot;You guys have it all wrong! There was no -- I didn&#039;t know there was anyone north of here, let alone ADVENT! And she&#039;s not so bad, I swear she doesn&#039;t--&quot;
 
Before I could even finish my life flashed before my eyes and the world seemed to freeze at the exact moment before my death. Gerard&#039;s stance changed; his body leaned forward and his arms braced, and his expression of grim determination gave way to a bared-tooth look of senseless fury. Eric&#039;s finger clawed for the trigger and I felt my body crumple and jerk backwards, as if I were being folded at the waist.
 
The house flew past me, and as I tumbled backwards I saw a myriad of holes punched into the door, splintering the wood and shattering the sidelights into tiny pieces. I hit the floor hard and immediately scrambled to find where I&#039;d been shot, tearing at my clothing like it was on fire. Was this how it was supposed to feel? Were gunshots that powerful that they could propel me halfway into my house? Where was the pain? Where was the blood? Was it shock dulling my reaction?
 
&quot;Torch it all!&quot; More broken glass. A muffled roar.
 
Cold metal thrust into my hands snapped me out of my confusion, and I saw Vee passing my gun off to me as an impossibly long tongue -- longer than I had ever even thought possible -- released my waist and snaked its way back entirely into her mouth.
 
The gun was heavier than I remembered. I knew I had to use it. I knew that I knew how to use it. But it was so heavy, like I was trying to carry a boulder. I didn&#039;t have the effort. The effort wasn&#039;t -- wouldn&#039;t be needed, though. I was as human as they were. We had the same enemy. The fight was over. Why keep killing? I could fix this. I could fix it all, they can be reasonable. They would see. I don&#039;t need to kill anybody, nobody had to get hurt--
 
An angry-sounding hiss blew hotly against my face, and a pair of scaled hands snatched the gun back from me. A few more thunderous gunshots. Silence, then sounds like snapping twigs. A strangled cry. That dull roar only grew in intensity. All of this could be fixed. I knew it could. It might take time, but everything would work out. It had worked out for twenty years, I could make it last forever.
 
I gasped when a hand slapped against my shoulder, only to cough and sputter when the only thing I could breathe in was smoke. Vee dragged me around the corner into the foyer and towards the front door, past the living room entirely awash in blue and orange flames. The books my grandmother had saved from my childhood -- gone. The pictures arranged atop the fireplace, the faces I always tried to avoid looking at -- gone. The ancient television popped and crackled before its screen exploded outwards, showering the couch and recliner in glass and causing wisps of flame to jump into the kitchen. Everything I possessed and had ever known for two decades was going up in smoke.
 
The view from the yard was so much worse. The second floor was already on fire. I could see the hole that had been smashed through the window by whatever it was they had thrown inside. The chicken coop had probably lit up in an instant and burned even more furiously than the house; the burning electronics inside produced an acrid scent that stung my nose. The camo netting, with all the dead branches and foliage strewn throughout, was perfect tinder. Before Vee, those birds had been the only living things I had spoken to for years. Now they were gone, too. Holly, Marlene, Judy, Cathy, Iris, Penny, Harvey -- not to mention all the chicks. Poof. Gone in what I always imagined would be one of the worst ways to go.
 
Vee swept her tail around my feet and yanked be back, forcing me onto the ground. I hadn&#039;t even known my legs were trying to carry me back inside. Twenty years of my life up in smoke in a heartbeat. If I had answered the door with a gun, would I still have it all? The pictures I couldn&#039;t stand looking at for the memories they stirred up -- would they still be there? Would all the trinkets and nonsense my grandparents had saved throughout the years still be there? Everything my parents had fought for to ensure our survival in a terrible and unfamiliar new world -- the chickens, the generator, the food, the garden -- could I have kept it all?
 
Ultimately, I guessed not. Answering the door with a gun I had no intention of using was just the same as answering without one at all.
 
The raging fire&#039;s light kept the dark night from closing in. I couldn&#039;t do anything to stop the flames, nor could I hold back my tears any longer. They fell like rain, and clutching my knees to my chest as tightly as I could just made the sobbing hurt worse. I don&#039;t remember much beyond that; at some point I thought I felt Vee gently coil her tail around me as I watched the flames through watery eyes. I cried out every ounce of energy left in me, until exhaustion took hold and I fell asleep.

-Chapter 6-
 
I couldn&#039;t believe I had fallen asleep at all. It had been deep and dreamless, like my body had shut down entirely to recharge and devoted every bit of effort only towards that end. When I woke and saw the ruins of my life still there waiting for me, I hopelessly wished I could have just stayed sleeping.
 
The entire house was gone. Nothing remained except a smoldering mess of wood. The only way anybody would ever be able to tell it was once a house was the front steps and rear face still partially stood, a charred, ghastly skeleton of its former self. The chicken coop was an even more total loss; nothing was left standing. It was mostly just a pile of ashes, the tallest piece left barely reaching up to my knees. The smoke still rose high into the blue, cloudless morning sky, and only then did I realize that the rain I thought I had saw coming yesterday never showed.
 
Where did I go from here? What was I supposed to do? I bet Adam would have known. Then again, he never would have done what I had done. He would&#039;ve run upstairs, grabbed the gun, and nailed them both from an open window before they had even finished their first sentence. My brother, the eager killer. He always knew what to do, even if I never agreed with it. He would&#039;ve protected the house. But he also would have put Vee down the moment she had shown up.
 
Would that have been so bad? Insidious whispers grew in the back of my mind, showing me images of false hope; Vee shows up and is immediately put down, those resistance guys drop by, collect her body, and the house remains. My life would remain.
 
Something slick and cool brushed against my ankle. Vee had encircled me with the end of her tail, as if I was sitting inside of a thick hula-hoop. She leaned over to check on me. I couldn&#039;t bear to look her in the eyes with those horrible thoughts swirling around in my head, and started to cry again. How could I think anything of the sort? She did not threaten me. She did not coerce or entice me. Everything up to now had been my own choices, my own mistakes. In fact, the only thing she had irrefutably done was save my life. I&#039;d have been riddled with bullets if she hadn&#039;t pulled me from the doorway when she did, with that unusual whip-like tongue of hers.
 
But what to do with that life?
 
&quot;I have nothing left.&quot;
 
Vee looked at me with what I supposed was as much pity as she could squeeze out of that inherent frown of hers. She unmistakably sighed and joined me in looking at the ruins, then tried lifting me up by my arms. I didn&#039;t have much for energy and was loathe to rise to my feet, but did so at her insistence. Only when she began to pull me towards the smoking bones of the house did I feel the dam in my head breaking, straining too hard to hold back the awful mixed swell of emotion.
 
&quot;I have nothing!&quot; She stopped, recoiling at my sudden outburst. &quot;Nothing! It&#039;s gone, okay? The chickens, food, water, everything! There&#039;s nothing left. For me or for you.&quot;
 
I hadn&#039;t meant to yell at her, but more at the universe in general. I wanted to say it was only because my throat was dry and tight that I felt as if I had to force the words out, but I knew better. So did she, which was why she immediately left me alone and dejectedly made her own way to the house. I just fell to my knees, looking at the dirt and wondering why things had to have happened as they did. The self-pity made me feel like even more of a weakling, a feeling that did not abate after getting back on my feet, so I began to shuffle forwards. Even though I knew where I was heading, it wasn&#039;t really on purpose. Everything just felt automatic at this point.
 
My feet hit the bottom step of the front porch, the sudden jolt shifting a layer of ash across its surface. It took a moment to gather the strength I thought I would need to see it all up close, then slowly scanned over the debris. It was all a jagged mess of splintered wood burnt pitch black and sickly gray; at some point the supports must have given way and the entire second floor had just collapsed, bringing down the entire structure. Beneath the mess I thought I saw recognizable shapes: what remained of the old television, the fireplace mantel, the heavily-warped carcass of the refrigerator. I even saw a reflective sliver of the mirror that had decorated the foyer. It was dulled and charred, but the glinting light made it easier to spot.
 
Through a broken window on the still-standing rear-facing panel, I saw Vee disinterestedly digging around before continuing on. Thinking I may have owed her an apology, I left the porch and slowly walked around the house to join her, kicking little bits of wood along the way. She saw me coming, as much as she pretended not to. Whether to spite me or just to try and give me space, I couldn&#039;t tell. If the former, I deserved it.
 
&quot;I didn&#039;t mean to yell,&quot; I said. Her look spoke volumes. &quot;Okay, but I didn&#039;t mean to yell at you. I&#039;ve got a lot going on in my head and I don&#039;t know what to do with it. I&#039;m sorry if it came off as being mad at you. I know you saved my life and despite how it looks right now, I am thankful for that. I mean -- thank you.&quot;
 
&quot;Come,&quot; she hissed, gently pulling me by the arm towards the cellar doors already thrown open. Curiously, the interior side looked largely untouched by any sort of damage. The blue paint had bubbled in only a few places and the metal doors didn&#039;t show any sign of melting, nor they blackened in the least. On the far side of the cellar entrance was a small pile made up of flashlights, some blankets and clothing, and a few first aid kits, among other things one could label essential. Even an old hiking backpack I hadn&#039;t seen since the last time my brother and I had gone camping with granddad.
 
&quot;This came out of the cellar?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, watching as I went down a couple steps to take a peek. At first glance, the inside looked like a complete disaster, same as the rest of the house. The concrete had done an admirable job, all things considered. There was an enormous hole in the ceiling where the house had caved in on itself, spilling down into and filling up most of the basement with wreckage. But the walls still held. Yellowed from the top down by the fire and most likely brittle, but they were still up. Around the perimeter of the basement was mostly more of the same mess, but a few shelves had merely been displaced, not crushed, and their contents lay scattered across the floor. I could see a few bins full of clothing and blankets, one of the large first-aid kits along with several of the home-made ones. A few packs of batteries lay scattered about, and I could even see one of my freezers looking in fair condition.
 
&quot;Food inside. Not good,&quot; Vee said, following my gaze. Just when I thought there&#039;d been some luck on our side, but of course the power had gone out. I saw the generator around back -- or what had been left of it.
 
&quot;Hang on, you went in there?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, and before I could get another word out she slipped past me and into the jagged jungle of wood and metal. I could scarcely breathe watching her fit through gaps and holes that seemed too small for her to maneuver, afraid that even the slightest sound would somehow disturb her concentration or maybe cause something else to collapse atop of her. She carefully slithered her way through, moving slowly to avoid catching her shirt on anything, scooping up loose items that could be of use. It was almost as if she could flatten or otherwise compress her body to fit through spaces that would otherwise be impassible. With her hands full she made her way back to me, and I realized I had actually been holding my breathe the entire time.
 
&quot;Please don&#039;t go back in there.&quot;
 
She dropped her haul with the rest of the stuff. &quot;Useful.&quot;
 
&quot;Dangerous. You see the yellow coloring on the walls? That&#039;s what fire does to concrete - turns it brittle. It&#039;s standing now but you don&#039;t know for how long.&quot;
 
&quot;Safe.&quot; She slid past me yet again, too fast for me to catch her by the arm or shoulder, and I nearly had half a mind to try and yank her back by her tail. But again she crawled in, gliding over obstacles with ease as she collected everything she could into her arms, and again my breath hitched solidly in my throat like stone. She gently yanked on the tattered edges of what I first thought was a green blanket, but turned out to be a sleeping bag. It eventually gave, but not before the metal it had been pinned under groaned threateningly, like a beast slowly awakening. The sound gave her pause, and after a moment spent frozen in time, she took the continued silence as her cue to exit.
 
&quot;Please stop. It&#039;s not worth it.&quot;
 
She dropped her things onto the pile and took quick inventory, her eyes darting to every trinket gathered so far. &quot;Need it.&quot;
 
&quot;For what?&quot;
 
&quot;Travel.&quot;
 
My heart sank into my gut. I had entertained the possibility, in the depths of my sadness and anger, that Vee would leave. It honestly made sense, no matter how much I wished it didn&#039;t. I had no more food, water, or shelter -- things she obviously wanted. As much as I wished she would stay, I knew she wouldn&#039;t. Now she was just taking what she needed to help her find the next spot to settle down at. Were these her true colors? Had I just been a rest stop with a continental breakfast this whole time? I was powerless to stop her, even if I wanted to. Her latest venture had turned out to be a bust, and now she was salvaging what she could to help her find her next place to call home.
 
&quot;Oh,&quot; I barely whispered, crossing my legs beneath me. &quot;Where will you go?&quot;
 
&quot;We.&quot;
 
That woke me up about as well as a faceful of cold water. &quot;What do you mean, &#039;we&#039;?&quot;
 
She stopped counting the batteries and flashlights, and placed the last first-aid kit on the ground next to the others. Her eyes slowly flitted about, not really focusing on anything in particular but still seemingly searching. Her tongue slipped out to slowly taste the air, then she locked eyes with me. &quot;Being alone sucks.&quot;
 
She wasn&#039;t simply parroting me and her tone was deadly serious. I could tell she was honestly speaking for herself, but to hear my own words come back to me when I had least expected them left me speechless for ages. Food, water, shelter -- things she clearly wanted. Was company among them too? I wanted so badly to just say yes, I&#039;ll go, but my thoughts were tethered too strongly to my home of twenty years, to the place I had thought was a fortress, a hide-out from the horrors the rest of the world. Though now I saw it as a burnt-out husk, it was not hard to see what a fragile image that had been.
 
&quot;We could rebuild, couldn&#039;t we?&quot; Simply phrasing that as a question seemed to be an answer in and of itself. She kept silent, maybe still trying to figure out if I was crazy or serious. Maybe a bit of both, to be honest, but I was a pragmatist, too. In some respects, anyway -- I guess being without people for so long has made me naive about them.  I knew there was no way I could stay and remake things as they had once been. I would need lumber, piping, concrete, tools I didn&#039;t have. The checklist in my head just grew longer and longer and the thought of a fixed-up home just got further and further away.
 
&quot;Where would we go?&quot;
 
She visibly relaxed, apparently relieved that I could still see reason. &quot;City 31.&quot;
 
The city the news report had mentioned. A supposed haven for aliens and hybrids freed from Elder control. &quot;Come on, are you serious? We hear about it just once on the news and suddenly you want to trek god-knows-where to find it? Besides, the reporter said they shut the city down to keep out the undesirables. There&#039;s no guarantee they&#039;d let us in even if we did find it. I mean, where would we even start? Is it north, south, west -- is it even on this continent?&quot;
 
&quot;Had map,&quot; she said with a worsening frown as she looked into the rubble. &quot;Inside armor. Far north. This continent.&quot;
 
&quot;So that&#039;s all we&#039;ve got? What does that mean? Iowa? New York? Canada?&quot;
 
She slapped the dust and ash from her Metallica shirt, using the tip of her tail to reach where her arms couldn&#039;t on her back. &quot;Unsure. Someone. May know.&quot;
 
&quot;Who?&quot;
 
&quot;North. In forest.&quot;
 
&quot;What, where those guys said they got ambushed?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes. Not ADVENT.&quot; That set off some quiet alarms that I didn&#039;t know what to make of. So resistance members were ambushed, but Vee sounded certain it wasn&#039;t ADVENT. What would that mean? Were the resistance cells splintering? Had humanity conquered its oppressors just to begin another war against itself? Or had Eric, Donovan, and Gerard been confused? I had seen ADVENT soldiers on television; the gleaming black armor with red highlights would be hard to mistake for something else.
 
&quot;You&#039;re not making sense, Vee. Those men said they were ambushed by ADVENT. How could anyone confuse them with anyone else?&quot;
 
She shook her head, pointing at her right side. &quot;One in jacket. Had small wounds. Bullets,&quot; she said, pausing to catch her breath. She would have to break that habit of breathing her words instead of speaking sooner or later. &quot;Not ADVENT issue. ADVENT rounds. Bigger exits.&quot;
 
I remembered when I had first seen Eric, a single hole in the shoulder of his jacket. When he had come back sporting a few more, it was impossible not to notice; dark red had stained his jeans and one of his arms had been so useless that he had to one-hand his gun and hold the flashlight in his armpit. Could she really tell what type of weaponry had caused his injuries? I supposed this was where her background as a tracker and hunter came into play. I had no leg to stand on -- it was clear she knew far more than me with regards to these sorts of things, but I couldn&#039;t shake the feeling we&#039;d be walking into the same trap as Eric and his men. Then again, we had no food and very little water, and the nearest town was four of five days away. Not that we could go there anyway; even if I left Vee on the outskirts, I felt like I&#039;d face too many questions about the fate of the hunting party. If what Vee was saying turned out to be true, then maybe we could score some supplies as well as directions. It was a big risk no matter how I looked at it. Either we go a different way and maybe die of starvation and dehydration, or we go north and get ourselves shot.
 
I guess getting shot was quicker, if worst came to worst.
 
&quot;Okay. Let&#039;s do it your way.&quot; Perhaps in anticipation of my answer, she had already jammed everything into my granddad&#039;s old hiking pack. Or maybe she was getting ready to completely ignore my answer. Either way worked. She laid out a blanket and messily threw some clothes into the middle, then folded the blanket&#039;s corners in to tie it all together in a makeshift sort of parcel. She handed it to me, shouldered the backpack herself, and began to leave. I heard the shuffling sound of her slithering away slowly come to a halt when she realized I wasn&#039;t following her.
 
&quot;Just give me a second. Been here more than half of my life.&quot; I had expected her to give me a moment to myself, but instead she doubled-back and coiled herself up beside me, folding her hands together.
 
&quot;We always came here for our family retreats. Granddad and grandma had built the place with their own hands, pouring sweat, blood, and tears into it -- not to mention what I always imagined was a hefty chunk of change for the fifties. Dad had spent most of his childhood here, and even after marrying mom he said the two of them would always come back every summer. He liked to joke that my brother and I were probably conceived here. Grandparents eventually had to move into a one-story ranch in another state due to their age, but all of us made it back here every summer. Games and barbeques almost every day -- fresh beef sizzling on the grill. It&#039;s so weird that with all the ash in the air, just the memory of dad&#039;s cooking overpowers it so easily. I swear, right now I can smell the burgers and steaks he would make. I remember breaking my arm falling down the stairs when I was nine. My brother got bowled over by a cow calf a month later and hit his head. He was laughing the whole drive to the ER even with blood pouring down his face -- mom had thought he had gotten a concussion or something. The laughing stopped when the doctor came in with the sutures.&quot;
 
My mind was flooded by all these little memories that I never would have thought would come up again. I just kept talking and talking, whether or not Vee was really listening. I wasn&#039;t thinking about the kitchen, or my bed, or the chickens; I suddenly realized I wasn&#039;t crushed because of what I had lost. Instead it was more about what the house had given me. A blessed childhood, heaps of memories that I had fought so hard to keep tucked away in the recesses of my mind. Only now those memories were the only things left, and after twenty god forsaken years of keeping them locked away, I absolutely relished in them and whatever tears they brought.
 
&quot;Good home,&quot; Vee quietly said, as if it had been a faithful companion.
 
&quot;Yes it was. Good home.&quot; I wiped my eyes before taking a look at Vee, who was already looking at me. I offered her a weak smile, something to show I was mostly okay. She stared a little too hard, and I felt almost as if she was trying to find something inside me. Maybe she may have found it if I had let her, but I rocked forward and onto my feet, clapping the dirt of my hands as I stood fully. &quot;We should get going, I guess. It&#039;ll probably take at least a day to get to wherever this supposed ambush happened, judging by how long it took Eric to find my place again after leaving the first time. Where is he, by the way? I mean -- the bodies.&quot;
 
She rose to her full height, but kept looking at the ground, clearly avoiding any sort of eye contact. &quot;Front,&quot; she said as I passed by her. I heard her following me at a respectable distance.
 
The bodies were exactly where she had said. I had woken up with the two of them not too far behind me. I swallowed and held my breath. They weren&#039;t the first bodies I had ever seen. Fear roiled to the surface of my mind upon closer inspection; they certainly were the gnarliest, though. Eric had a ragged, fist-sized hole in his neck and collar bone, full of splintered bone and a mess of torn flesh. He had clearly been shot at very close range. His torso was speckled with blood, like somebody had flicked a paintbrush at him, and I saw his weapon clutched tightly in his grasp; a great hole had been ripped clear through the receiver. I guess Vee got two shots off on him, and his weapon blocked some of the pellets.
 
Gerard, though -- I couldn&#039;t stand to look at him for more than a few moments. His must have been the strangled cry I had heard. His chest was oddly misshapen and one of his arms was bent in horrifying ways, while his rifle lay beside him nearly folded in half. I didn&#039;t even bother to look further up. I knew Vee had squeezed the life out of him, and I didn&#039;t have the stomach to see if he still had eyes in his head.
 
&quot;Do me a favor,&quot; I said, my voice cracking. &quot;See if this guy has anything we can use on him. I&#039;ll check Eric.&quot;
 
We passed one another as I doubled back to check the first body; neither of us could look at each other. Eric&#039;s pockets and pouches had a plethora of things inside. I found two knives on his belt, one about eight inches tucked into a sheath and a smaller, four inch fold-out blade that simply clipped onto a belt. I also found four shells I could use for my gun, a few batteries we could use out of many more we couldn&#039;t, and a canteen of water already half-empty. His backpack was in okay shape, so I took that as well, and shoved in the blanket-parcel Vee had made. Already inside were two pairs of socks, a lighter, a pack of cigarettes with just two left, and something that looked and smelled like jerky in an interior pocket, stuffed within a plastic baggie.
 
Vee finished searching Gerard and fell back in behind me. She seemed like she was waiting, or perhaps expecting something from me. She still avoided direct eye contact but would steal sidelong glances when she thought I wasn&#039;t paying attention. She looked away again, down at the dirt, and I looked up. Birds had begun to circle. Despite everything, despite their mistake and their rush to judgement, I couldn&#039;t just leave the bodies for the animals. Unfortunately all the tools I had, shovels included, were in the basement. Or what was left of it.
 
&quot;How many blankets have you got in that pack, Vee?&quot;
 
&quot;Four.&quot;
 
&quot;Take out two. Wrap him up and I&#039;ll get this one.&quot;
 
&quot;Waste,&quot; she nearly whispered, though she had already begun rummaging through her pack for what I asked.
 
&quot;It&#039;s the right thing to do.&quot;
 
I laid out a blanket beside Eric&#039;s body and rolled him onto it, then continued rolling it around him until he was wrapped twice over. Vee seemed a little more haphazard with her movements. Or maybe the odd angles off Gerard&#039;s broken body were making it difficult for her. Either way, she did not seem to have the same reverence I did. I wasn&#039;t sure if she had a grudge against them, or if this was just her way of protesting my waste of resources, but I wasn&#039;t about to start an argument. Neither was she, apparently, judging by her persistent silence despite her slightly-angrier face.
 
She had him wrapped like a mummy shortly after I was done. The two bodies just laid there, side by side, and I found myself staring. I was instantly reminded of the day Adam and I had buried our parents. Seeing it again so vividly threatened to bring tears to my eyes, so I pushed that memory deep down. I was already making a conscious effort not to visit their graves before leaving; if I did, I felt I might never be able to leave.
 
Vee came back with some twigs and a few pieces of unburned wood from around the house. Small shards of the porch left untouched by fire should serve as enough kindling. Maybe. She scattered it over the corpses and after a minute or two, it all took a flame from Eric&#039;s lighter. My stomach twisted itself into knots. I didn&#039;t know either of them beyond our two conversations, and to be honest it may have been the beginnings of a grudge, but the scene was disturbing. Something about it just felt frighteningly relevant -- prescient, almost. Nobody was here to cry over them. Nobody was here to say they were in a better place or that their loved ones would see them again sooner or later. Just all encompassing silence. It hit me that this was how I would have died if I had stayed in this house. Nobody around to see me off, nobody to grieve for me. One morning I would have just not woken up and rotted in bed for the rest of time, the world totally indifferent to my absence. I had never given it much thought, but seeing it now so plainly chilled me to the bone.
 
I just kept watching as the fire grew disappointingly. It sure as hell wasn&#039;t a proper cremation, but it should have been good enough to keep the animals from picking at what was left.
 
&quot;Liam.&quot; Hearing my name from someone else&#039;s mouth for the first time in damn near a decade snapped me out of my contemplative trance so quickly it nearly gave me whiplash. &quot;Come.&quot;
 
And that was it. I didn&#039;t even look back. I knew beyond a shadow of doubt that took some strength on my part. I wasn&#039;t entirely weak, after all.

-Chapter 7-
 
The warm morning inexorably transitioned into a hot afternoon, the sun mercilessly beating down with not a single cloud to block its light. Being out in the fields was terrible in the noon heat. It wasn&#039;t exactly scorching, but I would burn just the same with enough time. I took a spare shirt from Eric&#039;s -- from my backpack and draped it over my head, such that the body of it covered the back of my neck. Vee game me a funny sort of look when she saw, but I guess it was warranted; I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever heard of a snake getting sunburned, so maybe she didn&#039;t have much of a clue what I was doing.
 
It was odd to be so far from the house. I knew there was no civilization for miles around but the excitement and anxiety of seeing how things were began to eat at me in equal parts. Every step I took, I expected some aspect of this horrifying new world waiting to swallow me up and spit me back out. Were there roving militia bands slaughtering every non-human they could find? Did packs of aliens, now leaderless, scour the land for anything they could use to survive? Any time the thoughts got to be too much, I reminded myself that Vee wasn&#039;t too worried about the world around her. Either she knew the dangers well or knew there weren&#039;t as many dangers as I kept imagining. I suppose carrying my shotgun also instilled some confidence in her. It was probably for the best, anyway; circumstances had shown I wasn&#039;t prepared to actually use the damn thing.
 
We walked in relative silence, her leading the way by a few paces. It was very strange to see her move. In and around the house I never paid it much mind, nor could I since the distance traveled was never very far, but outside on a long trek it was impossible to ignore. Everything about her was liquid-smooth. Whereas a normal Earth snake would slide its body along the ground in a continuous squiggly pattern for forward motion, Vee&#039;s upright posture created some obvious differences. She was always hunched slightly forward which created a constant s-curve in her body. Her tail would move like I expected it to, constantly swiping back and forth. When she was moving slowly, like at a walking pace, her upper body lagged just a half-step behind her lower as her tail seemed to pull her into place. At a faster clip her upper body leaned forward, and it was as if her tail was trying to keep up with her. No matter how fast or slow she moved, her hips -- or where it looked like she had hips -- swayed hypnotically back and forth.
 
Though beyond that mild curiosity, it was difficult to look at her. Every time I did, my mind instantly leapt to images of Gerard&#039;s body. The twisted arms, his ribs broken so badly it looked like his chest barely had a shape anymore -- even the gun, bent like a paperclip against his body as Vee probably squeezed him with every once of strength she had. Sometimes I&#039;d feel something bubble up from the pit of my stomach and I would be forced to loudly swallow it back down, loud enough that Vee would hear it and check on me from the corner of her eyes.
 
I think she knew what I was hung up on; not that it was very hard for her to see, with how I would avert my eyes every time she looked back. She kept her distance, unsure yet of my new opinion of her.
 
I knew I was being unfair, that I was being childish. I was six years old the first time I saw granddad slaughter a chicken. He grabbed old Gerta from the hen house, placed her down on the ground with a broomstick held firmly behind her neck, and yanked her body upwards -- all before I could even think about looking away. A tiny little pop was all I heard and then her lifeless body just fell to the ground like a rock. I was upset for weeks afterwards and pretty wary around granddad. He tried to help me understand, but it took a while for a suburbanite boy my age to get over it. Eventually I saw it for what it was; just a man doing what he could to survive on his own. For sustenance, for survival -- some things were necessary.
 
That was only reinforced when my dad took up killing to protect us in a post-invasion world. And after him, my brother took a few lives to protect us both. I knew the stakes, but I guess I never comprehended the violence of action that would be necessary. Gunshots were always so clean. All I heard was a sharp pop or two and then it was over. No screaming or strangled cries. And the first time I had ever seen someone killed with my own eyes was when my brother killed a wandering man in front of the house, clearly holding a gun behind his back. He was shouting angrily at the house, and as I peeked out the living room there was a loud boom from the second floor, and then he just dropped. That was all there was to it.
 
Then there was Vee and the number she did on Gerard. The rib cage, misshapen like a sack of potatoes. The bones in his arms most likely splintered nearly into dust. And even though I couldn&#039;t bear to look at his face, I imagined it vividly; bloodshot eyes popped out of their sockets, teeth cracked as he tried to grit the pain away, blood dripping from his ears, nose, and eyes.
 
I knew Vee was not a monster, but I could not deny what she did was monstrous. Like when the family dog gets a hold of a baby rabbit, and before anybody can tell him to drop it he just picks it up in his jaws and crunches down on it. It&#039;s tough not to see him in a different light. He&#039;s no monster, but it&#039;s hard not to be disgusted by him in that moment.
 
I guess it all boiled down to my naivety. It&#039;s been a real ugly world for the past couple of decades, but I&#039;ve only known it through a television screen or by someone else&#039;s handiwork. I had the sinking feeling sooner or later, something would happen that would make my hands dirty. Vee wouldn&#039;t be there to take the gun from my hands, and it would be either me or whoever was on the other end of the barrel.
 
The sun had just passed the apex of its arc, and Vee and I were lucky to enter the woods at what was sure to be the hottest part of the day. The forest canopy blocked a substantial portion of the sunlight and immediately I could feel the air temperature drop beneath the trees. My bare feet were already aching and of everything I had lost in the last twenty-four hours, I really wished I still had my boots. That Vee needed no sleeve or padding or some other thing between her tail and the ground was momentarily interesting, but then again her scales probably acted as some sort of armor. Whereas she could probably barely feel the pine cones and needles and twigs that crunched beneath her, I was gingerly stepping over this and that while trying my best not to fall behind or slow her down. Whoever it was Vee thought we were going to run into, I sure hoped they had a spare pair of shoes I could trade for. That was if they didn&#039;t kill us first.
 
&quot;Stop,&quot; Vee said. I froze mid-stride, carefully putting my foot down avoid making any sound. She sank low to the ground, using her hands to support herself, and flicked her tongue several times over a particular spot. &quot;Blood.&quot;
 
It didn&#039;t look like any sort of fight had happened here. None of the tree trunks were splintered. There were no craters or dark patches of freshly-kicked up dirt. The forest as a whole seemed generally undisturbed. She was the tracker, however. If she says something happened here, it must&#039;ve have happened. &quot;Is this where they were ambushed?&quot;
 
She scanned her surroundings, zeroing in on a particularly unremarkable path through the trees directly ahead of us. &quot;No attack. Yet.&quot;
 
There would only be blood if they had come back this way. &quot;Then you&#039;re saying we&#039;re on the right track?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes.&quot;
 
Where before our silence was borne more from giving the other space, now it seemed much heavier. Vee appeared to be a different sort of person now. She was far more alert, her head swiveling about and her eyes focusing like lasers on the slightest disturbances, her tongue darting out to taste the air every dozen paces. After a little while I began to clue in on the things that grabbed her attention: a line of broken branches, a patch of flattened clovers, a line cut into the forest detritus like somebody had been dragging something. A shiver slipped down my spine when I realized this is what Vee had done during the war. She would find trails left by humans like me, find them, and kill them.
 
She followed the little clues left in the earth like breadcrumbs for hours, pausing every so often to reacquire her line of travel with an eerily predatory, robotic whip of her head. She&#039;d stop, swing left or right, then stop precisely when she meant to and refocus. There was no wasted motion when she was like this. Every movement was measured and conserved, carefully considered before actually executed. I began to wonder if this was a leftover of her mental control by the Elders. She searched not like she wanted to find something, but more as if she needed to. As a soldier, was she rewarded for a job well done? Did she get some sort of buzz or mental high when picking up clues that would lead her to a kill? Just how far into the minds of its soldiers did the Elders reach?
 
Only when she began to lose the last bits of sunset light could I see her frustration began to set in. Her careful nature eroded bit by bit. Her tongue flew more wildly, she was never focused on more than one spot for a few seconds, and the rigid economy of motion she had previously stuck to went out the window as she scrambled around trying to reacquire the trail. Darkness fully fell as the sun slipped behind the horizon, dusk&#039;s hazy orange light vanishing from the forest canopy with startling quickness. Fireflies spotted the forest like stars while the chittering and screaming sounds of the night I had previously heard from the comfort of my house were now a little too close for comfort. I was careful once again of the noise I made with my footfalls, afraid something deeper in the forest might take notice.
 
Vee was unconcerned with nightfall or with the possibility something -- or someone -- else was in the forest and huffed loudly, disappointed by the loss of the trail when by all accounts the clues should have gotten more obvious. If we were going in the right direction we should have found more blood, more casings, more tracks the closer we got to the ambush site, but it all evaporated the further on we went.
 
&quot;Sleep,&quot; Vee said. She unhooked the sleeping bag from the top of the hiking pack and tossed it to me, then took out the remaining two blankets we had.
 
&quot;I&#039;ve got a lighter, you know. We could have a fire.&quot;
 
She curled as much of herself as she could beneath her blankets. A good portion of her tail still poked out from the side, which made me feel bad for her. &quot;No fire. Risky.&quot;
 
&quot;Do you want the sleeping bag? I can fit under those blankets.&quot;
 
We locked eyes for the first time since this morning, a moment of consideration in her slitted pupils, before she said, &quot;Too big.&quot; She curled up again, ducking her head out of sight beneath the covers.
 
It was very hard to sleep. My backpack was about as good as a rock for a pillow, and between the constant chattering of whatever insects and creatures surrounded us and the inescapable truth that someone out here had attacked Eric and his men, any amount of shuteye seemed itself like a dream. Without a clock or the newscasts from the television the only way to tell time was by the passage of the half-moon overhead. Its glow just barely diffused through the treetops, spreading out to weakly light the forest floor. I just laid there for what I guessed was an hour, watching the hazy white move from one end of the canopy to the other. Before long I grew bored and turned on my side to see if sleep would come easier then.
 
The end of Vee&#039;s tail, the bit of her she could not fit beneath the blankets, seemed to glisten in the moonlight. Her diamond-shaped scales gave the impression of a bunch of pebbles still wet from a light rain. Between the arches of the blanket&#039;s edges I could only see an impenetrable pitch black, and from within there I wondered if Vee was looking back at me. I stared a little while longer, trying to convince myself that I wasn&#039;t just trying to keep an eye on her because now she scared me. And no matter how hard I tried, no matter how hard I truly, actually believed that she posed no threat to me, I couldn&#039;t help but imagine her squeezing me like a tube of toothpaste, snapping bones and crushing organs. Time and again I&#039;d told myself she could kill me whenever she wanted, that she had no actual reason to keep me alive, so why my mind kept replaying these imaginary events -- I had no idea.
 
I heard Vee&#039;s raspy voice in my mind -- being alone sucks. Repeating that in my head put me more at ease. She wanted company just as badly as I did.
 
I guess like humans, even aliens suffer from isolation. She claimed to have had a map to City 31 in her armor, but she had been content to stop at my house and apparently settle down. Her days would have consisted of nothing but watching television, helping around the house, and eating the occasional chicken. That had been good enough to make her stall, if not entirely skip going to City 31. Whatever she would have found in that city -- safety, community, a job for all I knew -- she was happy instead having found me.
 
Despite the obvious physical differences, maybe she and I were more alike than either of us knew. It was honestly a comforting thought, and I felt myself slowly letting go, drifting to sleep.
 
Until a bright light nearly blinded me through my eyelids and cold metal pressed into my forehead.
 
&quot;Get up,&quot; said a stern, startlingly dissonant voice; it sounded like two people were trying to speak over each other. &quot;Slowly.&quot;
 
Vee was already emerging from her blankets. She had three guns trained on her, each with a flashlight attached near the barrel. I saw her eyes dart for just a moment towards the gun, but she immediately put any such thoughts out of mind and emerged fully to surrender herself. I followed her lead and didn&#039;t put up any fuss at all. She was relaxed somehow, which made me wonder if she had known what we were walking into.
 
&quot;Already smarter than the last group,&quot; said one of our captors. Two of them went around and collected our things, roughly stuffing it all into the sleeping bag I had just occupied. He grabbed the gun last, pumped it six times to clear the tube and chamber, gathered the shells, then safed it and slung it over his right shoulder. Each of our mystery captors certainly looked like ADVENT, but there was something undeniably off compared to what I had seen on television. The armor was just a little too ragtag relative to the gleaming black and red of the average trooper; some pieces looked held together by rags or duct tape, and what seemed like tribal or decorative marks adorned various places along their body. There didn&#039;t seem to be a standard of dress to them. One of them had an animal fur along his left forearm, while the others had mismatching insignia on their shoulders. The only thing they all shared was a full face helmet that had dimly-lit slits running horizontally across the eyes, and a pair of wicked blades coming off some sort of gauntlet on their left hands.
 
I was ushered sideways to stand beside Vee where both her arms and mine were bound behind our backs.
 
&quot;March.&quot; A gun barrel was gently pressed between my shoulder blades. &quot;Do not stop until instructed. Do not speak. Do not make sudden movements.&quot;
 
I stole a sidelong glance at Vee, which she met. I couldn&#039;t see any scheme being hatched behind those blood-red eyes. In fact, she seemed entirely at ease, as if this was just another step on our journey. This was her world, and I had to remind myself that for the moment, I was just a visitor. As hard as it was to keep my heart out of my throat and to suppress the instinct to flee, I followed her lead.
 
We trudged off through the woods in near pitch black, only barely sidestepping trees in our path and hoping our captors would not think we were trying anything funny. Besides the blood absolutely roaring through my ears, our footsteps crunching through the leaves and brush were the only sounds in the forest.  The chittering bugs had disappeared. The hooting and shrieking of owls and what I assumed to be foxes had fallen silent. Was everything quiet because of us, or did something else yet stalk us through the forest? All of this did nothing for the fear rapidly rising inside of me, seemingly displacing the air in my lungs and making it harder to breathe. I wondered if another panic attack was coming on -- or anxiety attack, or whatever that nonsense had been a couple days ago. I kept my focus by just staring at my feet -- right, left, right -- only looking up every so often to make sure I didn&#039;t run face first into a tree. I would also continue to watch Vee to remind myself that despite all of this, she appeared totally calm. If she was, I could be, too.
 
&quot;Stop.&quot;
 
We must have gone about half a mile before arriving at some sort of camp sparsely lit by weak lighting, with what barely looked like the glow of a fire trapped within a cylinder to hide it from distant observers. I could only just make out a pair of tents and what looked like a truck, it&#039;s door half open but I couldn&#039;t see what -- if anything -- was inside. Vee looked a little disappointed. I wasn&#039;t sure why.
 
&quot;Take the viper to the left. The human goes to the right.&quot;
 
I watched them for a moment as Vee was led to the other tent, but another prod in my back pushed me in the right direction. I walked past the fire barrel -- it was mostly embers at this point -- and to the tent, pushing aside the entrance flaps. Inside were four chairs, and a table with yet another person on the other side of it, though obscured by shadows. I heard my escort step back a few paces and turned to see him posted up by the tent&#039;s opening, like he was standing guard.
 
&quot;Sit, please.&quot; The one at the table sounded just like the others -- that odd, two-voiced sort of speech that I swore I could almost feel vibrating in my bones. I timidly did as asked, using my foot to scoot one of the chairs out. Something on the table like a desk lamp was switched on; it wasn&#039;t too bright, but pointed directly at my face, it was hard to see much of anything else.
 
We sat in silence for much too long, and the tension began to twist my thoughts. And without Vee and her calm demeanor beside me, it was becoming too much to bear. Was this an interrogation? We hadn&#039;t done anything wrong. Was my captor waiting for me to offer something? Make the first move? Was this a test? Was I being allowed to stew in my own mind and crack like an egg?
 
&quot;We were just passing through,&quot; I barely managed to stammer.
 
&quot;Name?&quot;
 
&quot;Liam.&quot;
 
&quot;Occupation?&quot;
 
&quot;I was a farmer but, ah -- well, the property&#039;s gone now.&quot; That got a rise out of my interrogator. He cocked his head for a moment then went on with his questions.
 
&quot;Are you related to the previous three human men that wandered by approximately forty-eight hours ago?&quot;
 
&quot;No. Wait, so you guys did ambush them?&quot;
 
&quot;The two survivors reported back to you?&quot;
 
&quot;No! They burnt my goddamn house down! Look, they -- like, a week ago or something these three guys find my house -- I mean, before that Vee did, but the guys , they were looking for her--&quot;
 
&quot;Vee?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, that&#039;s her name. The viper I&#039;m with. She came by, tried to steal some food. I couldn&#039;t kill her, so I just gave her some stuff and sent her one way, but then these guys -- Eric, Gerard, and Donovan -- they came by a day later looking for her and said they wanted to skin her, take her fangs or her head or some other vile garbage, I don&#039;t care to recall. I sent told them she went north into the woods, so they went after her. Then they come back while we were having dinner--&quot;
 
&quot;We?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes! Vee and I! Are you listening? They come back --or, Eric and Gerard do, anyway -- and scream that I sent them into an ADVENT ambush! The burn down my goddamn house and tried to shoot me despite what I was telling them, and I&#039;d be dead if it weren&#039;t for Vee. So we&#039;ve got no home, no food, everything we could salvage from my place is literally in that sleeping bag your guys took from us, and we&#039;d really like it back so we can be on our way to City 31.&quot;
 
I finished with a long, deep breath. Everything had sounded much more organized in my head, but I just couldn&#039;t keep it together. I was surrounded by aliens after twenty years of avoiding them and the only one that I would call a friend was being questioned, interrogated, beaten, tortured -- I didn&#039;t know what. I was tired, hungry, thirsty, and angry didn&#039;t even begin to describe the pent-up energy swelling inside me.
 
&quot;Calm down, Liam. You and this &#039;Vee&#039; will not be harmed. Start again from the beginning, and take your time.&quot;
 
And with another deep, exasperated breath, I began again from the morning of the day I had met Vee. From her bewildered nature and vaguely grateful attitude, to the digusting things the three men had told me and shown me. I spilled it all -- Vee&#039;s return, her stay, her acommodations and her minor field surgery. Every little detail that had led Vee and I up to this moment I all but spelled out for him. When I finished, he leaned back into his chair, hiding a bit more of himself in darkness. Again he was content to let me stew in silence.
 
&quot;Bring in the viper,&quot; he said. The entrance split down the middle and Vee was ushered in by three escorts, her hands still bound as well. She pushed the chair next to me away so she could coil up beside me. &quot;What did she say?&quot;
 
&quot;Nothing, sir.&quot;
 
&quot;Shit,&quot; I hissed. Vee&#039;s look snapped to me. &quot;Was I not supposed to talk? I talked. Is that okay?&quot;
 
&quot;Hurt?&quot; she said, ignoring my question.
 
&quot;No. You?&quot;
 
&quot;No.&quot;
 
The lamp focused on my face switched off, and a taller, stronger lamp in the far back of the tent flickered to life. In the dim yellow glow that now doused the interior, I could finally see the face of the man that was asking questions.
 
He had a pretty standard human shape, though he looked a little better built than your average man. It might have been the stark white armor which made him look bulkier; it was better kept than the armor his comrades wore, and on the shoulder there was what almost looked like some odd alteration of the ADVENT insignia. The pouches across his chest hung heavily, filled with magazines. A trio of impacts scarred the left breast, the paint there chipped and the material underneath slightly glossier than its surroundings, presumably by the heat of the impact. His neck was covered by what I guessed was an extension of the body suit he wore beneath his armor, and it reached up to cup his chin and cover the bottom half of his cheeks, though his mouth remained uncovered.
 
I was not prepared for the face. His eyes were large and deeply disturbing to look at with that threatening, ethereal shine they had, like a cat&#039;s eyes in the dark. His nose was reduced to barely anything, and I might not have noticed it were it not for the pair of slitted nostrils sitting in the approximately appropriate spot. His mouth appeared normal, though he had some sort of surgical implant on the left side that seemed to travel up his face, only intermittently diving beneath the skin before showing its metallic surface again further up. He had wrinkles that looked unreal, like laugh lines but multiplied to an absurd degree, and his forehead and bald scalp were also crisscrossed by odd furrows that I had never seen even on my grandparents, as old as they had been. His ears were slightly reduced and much closer to the sides of his head, almost like they were pinned back.
 
His focus shifted to Vee. &quot;Do you speak English? Hablas Espaol? Sprechen sie Deutsch? Balas ADVENT?&quot; he said.
 
&quot;English,&quot; Vee replied.
 
&quot;Good. I&#039;d rather not speak in the false tongue of our former masters. Now, Liam, the men who engaged us were not ambushed. They crossed our perimeter and we interdicted them more gently than we did you. They chose not to come quietly despite our assurances, and opened fire on us,&quot; he said, tapping the three craters on his breastplate. &quot;As you know, one was killed in the firefight, and we allowed the other two to retreat. We know the closest town is approximately a week away on foot; even if they had returned with greater numbers for a counterattack, we will have been long gone by then.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh,&quot; I said, sort of wishing they had killed all three, but I squashed those thoughts the moment they sprung up.
 
&quot;I must say, I have not yet heard of a human befriending a viper. Speak honestly and do not shield her; if she holds some sway over you, let it be known now and you will be protected. Despite all that you have said, are you her captive?&quot;
 
&quot;Her chef, actually,&quot; I sneered, angry that he had seemingly ignored all I had told him. That remark managed to pull a short, stuttering hiss from past Vee&#039;s lips. He looked at her with nothing short of amazement.
 
&quot;Nor have I ever heard a viper laugh. Today is certainly a day of firsts. Unbind them, please,&quot; he said. I heard a knife slip out from its sheath and the next moment, Vee&#039;s and my hands were free. &quot;You may call me Argo -- Commander of the Seventeeth Skirmisher cell, East Coast Division. My subordinates behind you are Edix, Jova, Sally, and Five.&quot;
 
The first two sounded alien or made-up enough, but the last two caught me off guard. &quot;Sally and Five?&quot;
 
&quot;Saved a human child from a Chryssalid,&quot; said one of the soldiers, whose oddly flanged voice had a distinctly female quality. &quot;She possessed a doll of an animal called a bear, which she called Sally. She transferred the name to me before we placed her in a refugee center.&quot;
 
&quot;And Five,&quot; Argo interrupted, &quot;has yet to choose a name for herself. Now, if you please--&quot;
 
&quot;Hold on, I answered your questions,&quot; I said, feeling more than a little burst of courage for interrupting someone so intimidating. &quot;I&#039;ve got some of my own. What are Skirmishers? I&#039;ve never heard of your group. Are you resistance? Did humans press you into service or are you being blackmailed or what?&quot;
 
Argo smiled, the sort of patient, glowing smile a father would give his son for asking why the sky is blue. &quot;You would not have heard of us. We&#039;re not exactly widespread, and before the war we were ADVENT&#039;s dirtiest secret, even dirtier the black-sites that XCOM broadcast worldwide two months ago. We are living, breathing proof that Elder control is not absolute, nor is their technology infallible. Each of us was ADVENT at some point but somehow, the chip in our minds that fed their instructions to us through the psionic network malfunctioned. Freed from their control, we sought to liberate others and bring down their rule.&quot;
 
This all seemed like an absolute load. So a hyper-advanced alien race enslaves others with an implanted chip, but doesn&#039;t program it with a fail-safe or something which prevents the slave from turning? Even in human engineering, if a circuit is interrupted or something, the entire machine can be made to shut down. And their technology, which has never before been shown to have fault, just starts turning up bugs and errors like any other bit of software? What, did it run on Windows?
 
&quot;I can see you still have a great many questions, Liam. My soldiers and I will be here for a day longer. I invite you and Vee to rest in our camp; the wilds are more dangerous these days as beasts kept in check by the Elders now run amok. We will discuss your journey in the morning and put to rest any lingering doubts or persistent questions. Should you both choose to stay, you will sleep in the truck with the door closed and locked from the outside -- for yours and our protection. Whoever is on watch will listen should you have need of anything during the night.&quot;
 
I deferred to Vee with an unsteady gaze. This was her world after all, full of things and people I knew nothing about. Skirmishers? Chryssalids? Mind-chips? She quickly agreed.
 
&quot;Very well. Jova will have the first watch. Follow him and try to get some rest; do not burden yourself now with trying to form questions for tomorrow.&quot;
 
He motioned to the opening, permitting us our exit, where our guard Jova waiting for us to fall in behind him. Outside, the other three Skirmishers made for the second tent while we were instructed to enter the back of the truck. The stark black interior was more than just a little cramped. Either side had a brushed metal bench seemingly molded up from the floor, wide enough only to sit on. Spare pieces of armor lined the walls, and a few boxes of what looked like shell casings sat against the driver&#039;s cabin door, itself a solid piece of metal with just a barred window allowing one to see inside. A single red light was attached to each of the far corners, giving the inside an inoffensive glow.
 
&quot;Here are your blankets and sleeping bag,&quot; said Jova, tossing our things in behind us. &quot;Your other belongings will be returned to you upon your departure. Should you require anything, knock on the door and the fire watch will assist you.&quot; He took our silence as permission to exuse himself and shut the door. What sounded like a series of internal locks clicked into place, and Vee and I were left on our own.
 
She wasted no time in getting back to sleep. Before I had even turned around she had already set up her blankets and was doing her best to squeeze as much of herself as possible beneath them in such close quarters. She ended up with her head facing the driver&#039;s cabin, so I laid my sleeping bag out to face in the opposite direction. It was certainly uncomfortable, and I found myself wishing that I had my backpack, even though it made for a terrible pillow. I curled up into a fetal position to bring more of my body into the sleeping bag, so that my head was resting on the softer material instead of the harshly cold metal floor.
 
It wasn&#039;t bad, but I after laying there for twenty minutes I found it impossible to sleep. Nevermind the fact the primal parts of my brain were telling me not to sleep beside a giant snake, but what Commander Argo had said, that he had never heard of a human befriending a viper -- why was that? Sure, vipers were intimidating, and even having been around Vee so much, that feeling&#039;s not really gone away, but the fact was she had acted just like the refugees on television. She was hungry, on the run, looking for shelter. Was Argo trying to say that any other human would have just blown her away? Was it just in our nature to look at a viper and immediately think &#039;monster&#039;? And what about from their perspective? We must look pretty monstrous to them; no tail, brutishly thick arms, a big nose, hair, weirdly flat teeth, just to name a few things.
 
&quot;You awake, Vee?&quot;
 
I heard her body shifting as soon as I had spoken, and looked up to see her head poking up from the blanket pile she had made for herself. She craned her neck towards me. I guessed by now perhaps that was viper body language for &#039;I&#039;m listening&#039;.
 
&quot;I wanted to say that -- the way things went down back at the house was bad. I know that. I know now it was going to be bad no matter what, and the end result would have been ugly no matter how it had happened. I mean -- I know you know that I -- look, we&#039;ve barely said a word to each other since this morning, let alone looked at one another. I feel we both know why, so I just wanted to say it plainly: I don&#039;t think you&#039;re a monster. I don&#039;t think you&#039;re evil. I don&#039;t want you to feel bad about defending yourself or saving me. Every second I&#039;m breathing after that night is thanks to you. I said it before, but you know, just for good measure -- thank you.&quot;
 
She sighed and glanced down, aimlessly scanning the floor in that way people often do when lost inside of their own thoughts.
 
&quot;Welcome.&quot; She dove again beneath the covers and said, &quot;Long trip. Tomorrow.&quot;
 
&quot;Sounds like it. Good night, Vee.&quot;
 
&quot;Good night. Liam.&quot;

-Chapter 8-

Despite the odd, arguably harrowing circumstances, there had been no dreams or nightmares in my head. None that I could remember, anyway. Maybe I just didn&#039;t have enough in my head about the world as it was now, so I had no reference to draw on. It would be like asking someone to fill in the missing variables in an equation when they hadn&#039;t even heard of math. They just wouldn&#039;t comprehend what was being asked. Likewise, I just did not have a clue what I should or shouldn&#039;t be afraid of, and so my mind just kept coming up blank. I couldn&#039;t say it bothered me; it made for a deep sleep, after all.
 
What did bother me was that somehow -- through the clouds, through the thick forest canopy, through the windshield and finally through the little tiny window in the door that separated the driver&#039;s cabin from the rear compartment  -- a perfect little beam of sunlight managed to find my eyes and rouse me awake.
 
Vee seemed to have stretched out a bit in her sleep, and the tip of her tail extended out from the blankets and rested near my hand. I hesitated but couldn&#039;t figure out why. I had already put my hands on her while treating her wounds, and she&#039;s pulled me by my collar, wrapped up my legs so I didn&#039;t run back into my burning home, and lifted me by the arms. There shouldn&#039;t be a reason for me to hesitate, should there? Was I being too familiar?
 
I reached out and gently jostled her tail. Without gloves on, she certainly felt like an Earth snake -- cool and glossy, but with a firmness beneath that indicated how much damn muscle she must have had in her entire body. &quot;Vee,&quot; I said, watching as she began to stir, &quot;it&#039;s morning.&quot;
 
While I wiped the sleep from my eyes and tried to swallow the dryness in my mouth, she was instantly alert from the moment she emerged from beneath her blankets. It was like I was still trying to rev my motor while she was already in fourth gear. She adjusted her shirt, smoothing out a wrinkle or two, and slid past me to knock on the door. She didn&#039;t even seem to have noticed I had touched her. It was exciting, in a &#039;giant step for mankind&#039; sort of way. How many humans could say they&#039;ve touched an alien and not been ripped apart? The last year has been nothing but conflict, resistance and ADVENT at each other&#039;s throats where the only things they were touching each other with was bullets and bombs. And here I was just shaking Vee awake like we were at a damn slumber party and I was the first one up.
 
We waited for a moment longer before one of the troopers opened the door. The watch must have changed during the night because this one&#039;s armor was slightly different from Jova&#039;s, who had locked us in last night. This new trooper had bright blue line slashing down the right side of the breastplate, jumping out against the stark white armor. I wasn&#039;t sure yet which one this was, so I played dumb just a little to try and get a name.
 
&quot;Jova?&quot;
 
&quot;Five,&quot; said the trooper -- the one that hadn&#039;t chosen a name for herself yet. &quot;The others are hunting for breakfast and will return shortly. Until then, you are free to wander but do not expect any privacy. Should either of you need to relieve yourselves, you will be escorted to the field latrine. It bears repeating you will not be given privacy.&quot;
 
&quot;Uh, thanks. I&#039;ll hold it.&quot; I moved aside to let Vee out of the truck. She hit the ground and spun, twisting her back in a lot of different ways that made me start to feel older than I already was. She turned to Five, who was watching her far more keenly than she was me.
 
&quot;Water?&quot;
 
&quot;Bucket by the fire barrel. Freshly boiled an hour ago.&quot;
 
The three of us sat in complete silence. I was listening to the sounds around us -- the birds mostly, who were going about their own morning routines. Though it was impossible not to notice that Five had not looked at me since she had let us out of the truck. I guess the viper was ten times the threat an unarmed human would ever be. It was something that Vee absolutely noticed as she took small sips from the water bucket, watching Five from the corner of her eye. I started to feel a little more tension than I felt was appropriate, given the fact that these skirmishers clearly meant us no harm. Maybe Vee didn&#039;t like being eyed with suspicion?
 
&quot;Why the name &#039;Five&#039;?&quot; Vee looked away once Five turned her attention to me.
 
&quot;I was the fifth member of this cell, recently liberated from my garrison. I am unable to decide on a name.&quot;
 
&quot;Is that important to you?&quot;
 
&quot;It shouldn&#039;t be, but it feels as such. Troopers were never given names within the ranks of ADVENT; only officers were, given how often they would liaise with civilian offices. Choosing a name is fully realizing one&#039;s freedom from the false gods -- the Elders, as humans came to know them.&quot; She turned again and nodded her head at Vee, who was now warming herself by the fire. I wondered if she was exothermic like Earth&#039;s reptiles. &quot;How did she choose her name? We have not met many vipers, and even fewer were approachable.&quot;
 
&quot;I asked if she had one. She only showed me a barcode, so I offered up Vee. She seemed to attach pretty quick to it, even though I had a whole book of alternatives she could have chosen from.&quot;
 
&quot;A former soldier of ADVENT -- not even a biped -- shows up at your door and the first thing you do is offer her food, shelter, and clothing,&quot; Five said, grunting at her own apparent disbelief. &quot;You are a peculiar human.&quot;
 
&quot;Is it that odd?&quot; I asked, knowing full well what her answer would be. Keeping her attention on me seemed to keep Vee relaxed, so I would keep talking as long as I could.&quot;
 
&quot;The war has been over for just two months. Even still, pockets of ADVENT forces still fight. Humans do not have much empathy these days for non-humans -- when have they ever had reason to? Even those of us sympathetic to their cause receive dirty looks and scandalous whispers as we pass by. Most of us choose to keep our helmets on, for many recoil in shock when seeing our faces; until XCOM&#039;s broadcast, many thought we were simply human volunteers.
 
&quot;For you act as you did towards a viper is even more surprising. Humans have no room at all in their hearts for things that crawl or slither. It&#039;s ingrained, some sort of evolutionary response. Even if a human is not afraid of a snake, he knows full well to avoid one. So you are quite peculiar; either very brave or very weak to allow her to control you.&quot;
 
I supposed I was right then, about what Argo had said last night. Any other human would have shot Vee on sight. That explained his insistence on thinking of me as her captive, and his surprise when I confirmed she was in fact, a friend. To be honest, it sounded like most vipers were shoot-on-sight for a lot of the world. Skirmishers certainly seem to avoid them when able. Maybe Vee&#039;s surprise the night she and I had met was two-fold; not only had I helped an alien, but perhaps she couldn&#039;t understand why I had helped her specifically.
 
&quot;But,&quot; she added, relaxing her grip on her rifle a little, &quot;I cannot say you don&#039;t spark a glimmer of hope within me. Jova said you did not recoil upon seeing the Commander&#039;s face. You do not attempt to avoid contact, nor treat us or even this Vee as less than yourself. Even having spoken to you for only ten minutes, it would be nice if more humans were like you.&quot;
 
I didn&#039;t have the heart to tell her that I was practically frozen in fear when I saw Argo&#039;s face, nor could I immediately discount her appraisal of me as weak. I couldn&#039;t even bring myself to defend my own life. Vee had done it for me.  I was very weak in some respects, but I wouldn&#039;t admit it to anyone else. On the other hand, I was just beginning to find out in which ways I was strong. That was a short list at the moment, however.
 
It was then a second trooper emerged from the tent Vee had been held in last night, catching everybody&#039;s attention; I immediately recognized the armor as Jova&#039;s, the one that had taken first watch. He appeared to be struggling to carry a crate of some sort in his arms, his steps mostly shuffling through the dirt as he made his way to the open rear of the truck. It looked as if it took a lot of effort for him to heft it up chest high to get it onto the floor, then he hopped inside to slide it all the way in until it came to a stop against the cabin door. He went back to the tent and emerged with another crate just like it, though by how he moved that one must have been lighter.
 
&quot;Could I help you at all?&quot; Jova didn&#039;t even realize I was speaking to him. He just kept at it, and only when I asked him again on his way back into the tent did he stop.
 
&quot;What?&quot;
 
&quot;Can I help you?&quot;
 
If I could have seen his face I imagined he might have had a deer-in-the-headlights sort of look; he was abnormally still, those glowing slits in his helmet focused intensely on me. After a few moments he looked at Five, who only shrugged in response.
 
&quot;I suppose so,&quot; he said.
 
I made my way into the tent with Jova. Everything was already neatly packed away into black and grey crates maybe half the size of my old television. Some were open and inside was a mixture of things I had no clue about. One box was filled with things that looked like tablets, neatly standing and compacted like papers in a filing cabinet&#039;s drawer. They were black and thinner than any tablet I had ever seen, with red screens sporting a faint honey-comb pattern that seemed to float on top of the display. Another crate was filled hallway with empty shell casings and on top of those were small bags of black and grey powder -- most likely materials used to make their own ammunition. More crates still had papers, computer parts, some odds and ends I did not immediately recognize. It was like emptying out an old office. If I had to guess, Argo and his soldiers had been here for several days at the least. This seemed like to much stuff to unpack and then put away again for a one or two day stay.
 
The first crate I tried to pick up felt like a ton. The next one was maybe half a ton. Not wanting to embarrass myself, I went around gently shoving different crates to see if they were easy to move or not. Upon finally finding one that I was able to scoot more than a couple inches, I heaved it up with a few deep breaths. My balance shifted and my feet instinctively spread wider to accommodate the extra load. I was leaning back pretty far to support most of the new weight on my chest; I wouldn&#039;t be able to carry more than a few like this. I wasn&#039;t that much smaller than Jova, and the constant work around the house kept me in shape. Not as much as constant warfare did, I&#039;m sure, but I wondered if the armor these skirmishers wore had something within to enhance their strength.
 
When I went back for a second, lighter box, Vee followed me in without a word. We shared a momentary look before she set to work. Instead of using her arms, she slid her body around one of the boxes, catching it in the arch of an s-curve, then shuffled it across the floor with her as she slithered. Despite looking a little more complicated, it seemed effortless for her, and also appeared to confirm that her arms weren&#039;t exactly that strong even compared to a human&#039;s. She scooted it up to the truck, jumped inside, and lifted the crate inside -- all with her tail and lower body. The only thing she used her hands for was pulling her upper body into the truck and bracing them against the seats as she pulled the crate up.
 
This went on for a little while, the three of us going back and forth from tent to truck while Five stood watch, her rifle held low. Everything seemed all right at first, but something within her changed as we kept working. Where before she had kept her gaze trained thoroughly on Vee, now she could not stop staring my way. Her posture would noticeably shift and her movements became erratic, as though she were desperately trying not to fidget and would over-correct whenever she caught herself doing so. She flexed her hands around the grip of her weapon -- never did her finger go near the trigger but it made me nervous all the same.
 
&quot;Please stop,&quot; she hoarsely whispered, staring at the dirt between her feet. Though normally stern and authoritative, she spoke with a shakiness that made her two-tone voice almost sound like it had added a third to the mix. &quot;Please.&quot;
 
I froze dead in my tracks, unsure of what I had done wrong. Vee stood beside me just as perplexed as I was, though she slowly but subtly began to slide herself in front of me, as if putting herself between me and Five. I backtracked to the truck and sat down on the ground, out of the way of Jova who seemed unconcerned with what was happening. I wanted to ask Five what was wrong but every time I opened my mouth, something told me to stop, that her answer was either something she would not want to share or would be something I wouldn&#039;t want to hear. I kept trying to convince myself to ask, but before I could work up the courage, snapping branches and crunching leaves drew my attention to the forest.
 
&quot;Commander has returned,&quot; Jova said, not even bothering to look up from his work. I wondered if his helmet had a communicator or something inside. 
 
Either way, he was right. Commander Argo and the other two skirmishers -- Edix and Sally, if I recalled -- came trudging out from the woods into camp, their legs caked from the knees down in mud with streaks running through it, as if they had already tried to clean it off and had given up. I didn&#039;t know of any nearby streams nor had it rained for several days, so I wasn&#039;t sure where the mud had come from. Dead leaves stuck to them, though underneath I could see bright green flashes of some grass or reeds of some sort.
 
&quot;C-sticks again, I&#039;m afraid. Another unsuccessful hunt,&quot; said Argo, clapping Five on the shoulder as he walked by. She straightened up immediately, like she hadn&#039;t just a moment ago been on the verge of some kind of breakdown. &quot;Liam, Vee, this way, please.&quot;
 
I took one more look at Five before Vee and I fell in behind Argo and we made our way into the tent I had been interrogated in last night. A few of those tablets  I had seen packed away laid scattered about, but only one had a soft glow emanating from its screen. 
 
&quot;C-sticks? What are those?&quot;
 
&quot;Calorie sticks,&quot; Argo said, taking a small bite of something that looked a lot like a stick of jerky. &quot;Standard ADVENT issue, ultra-dense nutrition made entirely of plant protein and synthetic vitamin supplements that provides all of a trooper&#039;s dietary needs. Suitable for human consumption as well, though they often complain it sits heavily on their stomachs -- like a ton of bricks, I&#039;ve heard one say.&quot; 
 
He broke off a tiny piece about half the size of my thumbnail and offered it to me. &quot;This is only to taste; a full portion is indicated by the indents on the stick  itself. It is imperishable and one stick lasts a human for a week.&quot; He gestured for me to try it before handing a much larger portion to Vee, who ate it without a second thought.
 
It was obnoxiously chewy and tough, like gum that was long, long overdue to be spat out. Just by how it looked, I was surprised to find it was nearly entirely bland and odorless; the one thing I could detect was a faint herbal scent that reminded me mostly of mint but it lacked the strength of the real thing. Even as small a piece as I had eaten, I swore I could feel it hit the bottom of my stomach like a rock. My morning hunger was sated almost instantly, though it sure wasn&#039;t as satisfying as getting real food into my belly.
 
Argo put the rest of the C-stick away into one of the many pouches lining his belt. &quot;With breakfast taken care of, what questions might you have for me before we discuss your journey north? If you lived in seclusion as you describe, you must have many questions about the world today. And given by how little your viper friend speaks, I will hazard a guess that she is still coming to grips with speaking human languages instead of only understanding them and cannot ably answer all of your inquiries.&quot;
 
I had a few questions on my mind that felt more important, but one in particular had been nagging me since last night. &quot;Why do you all speak so -- what&#039;s the word I&#039;m looking for -- highly? Fancy? Like it&#039;s not how people talk anymore. All of you sound like something out of an old play.&quot;
 
He allowed himself a genuine laugh which put me well enough at ease, though the nature of his voice made it sound louder, more raucous. &quot;A remnant of our former servitude to the false gods. In all of Earth&#039;s languages, our vocabulary, articulation, grammar -- everything  was specifically designed to induce subservience during the earliest stages of the invasion and subsequent insertion into all levels of human society. When one speaks authoritatively, others tend to listen whether they submit to that authority or not. It was one of the myriad ways the false gods maintained careful control of ADVENT&#039;s image.&quot;
 
&quot;Insertion into all levels of human society? What are you getting at? Alien teachers, doctors? That sort of thing?&quot; I couldn&#039;t keep myself from chuckling at the thought. 
 
&quot;Yes. Initially, clone rejects and mutations were recycled -- broken down and reused in other projects,&quot; Argo said. I was surprised at first but I did seem to recall XCOM&#039;s broadcast exposing most of ADVENT as clones. I wondered if his subordinates looked the same as he did. &quot;But the false gods found a new use for them. Instead of breaking down the flawed viper that was hatched with a smaller hood or without venom sacs, she was instead put into a gene clinic as a nurse to care for the ill and injured. The trooper created with the wrong pigmentation was made into someone&#039;s friendly neighbor, meant to smile and wave when he saw you step out to your mailbox. Every seemingly insignificant action ADVENT ever took was at the direction of the false gods, meant to ingratiate their forces into human society.&quot;
 
&quot;Okay, hang on,&quot; I said, fighting back chills at the mention of sentient beings being recycled. &quot;So the most advanced alien beings we&#039;ve ever known are making clones and somehow things go wrong? Like with your brain chip for instance -- why was that not programmed with some sort of fail-safe? If a chip was broken off from the mind control network or whatever you call it, why not have it blow up or something to prevent the, er, slave from rebelling?&quot;
 
&quot;The simple answer -- and one I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find lacking, as every human does -- is hubris. Though we cannot ask them ourselves now, one can only assume they believed their grand designs perfect, their biological machinations infallible. No fail-safes were made because their control would never fail. When they were producing millions of clones and only a handful turn up flawed, they must not have thought it was a design defect but merely a random act of the universe -- a short circuit, perhaps. Who can say at this point? We still are unsure of how the first skirmisher broke free.&quot;
 
So defects were not unheard of, but were never taken as evidence of a problem in the system. I guess that made sense, even if it did leave me unsatisfied like Argo had guessed it would. The same principle applied to engineering and manufacturing. If a process was made that churned out a million parts, the process would not be changed if just one part came out defective. They would just chuck the defect away and keep going. I decided to switch topics, given that Argo had just admitted nobody actually knew why defects existed.
 
&quot;How do you guys choose names?&quot; I asked with the point of eventually pivoting to Five&#039;s strange behavior. &quot;Five was telling me only officers were given them, so that means you guys are coming up with stuff like Argo and Jova on your own.&quot;
 
&quot;It is nothing as ceremonial or sentimental as you may imagine. We simply comb through our knowledge of Earth&#039;s languages and combine sounds until we find something that strikes us. Many of us choose something short and simple, as it is easy to remember and easier for humans to pronounce. The name itself is mostly unimportant, outweighed by the symbolism of being designated as something other than one of the false gods&#039; rank-and-file.&quot;
 
I couldn&#039;t figure out how to connect his answer to Five, so I just strung his answer to my next question as best I could. &quot;Could a decision like that make you act strangely? Like the pressure was getting to you?&quot; Argo cocked his head and stared blankly, unsure of what I was getting at. I explained to him what had happened just before he returned to camp -- how I had barely begun to help Jova before Five suddenly became jittery and pleaded for me to stop.
 
Argo sighed heavily, swallowing away a lump in his throat. Even Vee was now paying attention, as curious as I was.
 
&quot;Five is our most recent addition, liberated just three weeks ago from her garrison further north. She held many positions during her servitude, but by far the longest and most grueling was her position at a labor camp -- a benign term for death camp, one of many where all dissidents, undesirables, rebels, and criminals would end up. Five would stand guard, watching humans work themselves to literal death. The work wasn&#039;t even important; ADVENT possessed enormously automated manufacturing capability already. It was simply torture. Squalid conditions, near daily killings -- it was not a place anyone would want to be, alien or human. Even though she was controlled, compelled...those memories did not disappear with the psionic network. She is deeply traumatized, and I imagine standing watch over you as you helped -- even out of the kindness of your own heart -- brought her past surging to the forefront of her mind.
 
&quot;All of us live with these memories. We come to terms with it in our own ways, but it&#039;s not easy. It took me months to reconcile my new life with all the human blood that stained my hands as a result of the false gods&#039; control over me.&quot; 
 
I looked uneasily at Vee, feeling something like doubt bubbling up in the pit of my stomach. She knew I was watching her because she conspicuously stared straight ahead. All I could see from her were the subtle starts of a frown. Why did it bother me? From the moment I had met her I had guessed she was responsible for some death. She even confirmed it over dinner, telling me that her job boiled down to being a hunter-killer. Being twenty years old, she had probably seen plenty of action during ADVENT&#039;s occupation of Earth. What bothered me was that I don&#039;t think I&#039;d heard her yet express an ounce of regret. Where I spilled my guts to the first person I had met in eight years, she still closely guarded herself -- as was her right, given that much of the world these days probably wanted her dead. She wasn&#039;t like Argo, telling me how long it had taken her to come to terms with what she had done. She wasn&#039;t like Five, visibly distressed over anything that brought up memories of her past life.
 
Argo&#039;s large eyes shifted between Vee and I as he crossed his arms. I guess even an idiot could have picked up on the sudden change in the tent, so it must have been incredibly obvious to him. &quot;But the past is past. Everyone must work through it. Some are lucky enough to have understanding company, and some must do it by their lonesome,&quot; he said as he grabbed a tablet from the table. He switched it on and spun it to face me; a map dominated its display. &quot;But I&#039;m afraid I must stop the questions now; our fuel drop will arrive shortly, and then we must be on our way. We must speak of your journey north.&quot;
 
He swiped his fingers across the screen before magnifying the east coast of the United States. Former United States, I guess. The borders of the formerly ADVENT-regulated zone popped up, and he pointed at a specific grid square. 
 
&quot;This is where we are now. And City 31,&quot; he said, sliding the map up and up and up, &quot;is over here. That&#039;s nearly one thousand kilometers if you followed the main thoroughfare, or about six hundred miles. If you had transport, it would be a days trip, even with frequent stops, but you would pass through reported ADVENT hotspots and heavily populated resistance zones. Given the chaos that now grips much of the world, I would avoid contact with others as much as possible. Vee, you&#039;re liable to be shot on sight, and you, Liam, are likely to be taken prisoner if not executed for being a suspected collaborator. Refugee zones are especially suspicious of aliens right now, so stay clear of them as well. Now, look here.&quot;
 
He slid the map a hair to the right and the image shifted, showing the glowing line that denoted the borders of the Eastern Trade Zone or whatever it was ADVENT had called it. &quot;A majority of Earth&#039;s population still resides in the formerly ADVENT-controlled trade zones. If you stay outside their borders, your chances improve dramatically. The only caveat being the wilds are patrolled by other aliens still just as ruthless as they were under ADVENT control. We tracked berserkers wandering here, here, and here, and further north of them was a pod of chryssalids. Though dangerous to all who cross their paths, they are more predictable in their animalistic tendencies than humans or other aliens.&quot;
 
He zoomed out again and highlighted several points along our intended path, jabbing each with his finger to make sure we understood what he was about to say. &quot;Under no circumstances should you ever attempt to traverse any cities outside of the trade zone&#039;s borders. I cannot possibly stress this enough. They are overrun by Lost, and a crumbling cityscape makes for long, treacherous traversal. Going around a dead city is preferable in all cases, even if it adds days or weeks to your travel.&quot;
 
&quot;Purifiers. Failed?&quot; Vee hissed, narrowing her eyes at the several glowing spots on the map. 
 
&quot;The purifier squads were never going to stop them. As far as we could tell, their only job was containment.&quot; I had no clue what either of them were talking about so I just kept my mouth shut and waited for Argo to move on. &quot;You have a long way to go, Liam and Vee. If you are able to cover twenty miles a day, you&#039;re looking at about a month of walking. Safely secure whatever transport you can whenever you can. Avoid the dead cities at all costs and the living ones if you are able. Your possessions are waiting by the truck, along with some provisions we can spare. You&#039;ll each have a month&#039;s worth of c-sticks, and Liam -- you&#039;ll have a pair of boots and two pairs of socks.
 
That picked me right up. Didn&#039;t even have to trade for them. I guess being clones, they all shared the same size and had plenty to spare. I wasn&#039;t worried about the hiking so long as I had some good boots. A month of walking was certainly more than I had ever done before in my life, but I was no stranger to the outdoors. Dad and granddad were both avid hikers and they&#039;d bring me along on their shorter trips.
 
&quot;You may take this datapad as well; the map is fully interactive and marked with suspected problem areas,&quot; he said, pushing the tablet across the table into Vee&#039;s hands. &quot;I wish the both of you best of luck. Truly, I do. Should you encounter any other skirmisher cells, bring up my name. I will vouch for you.&quot;
 
&quot;Thank you, Commander Argo.&quot; I thought using his rank and name sounded more respectful. He walked us to the tent&#039;s opening and had Five bring us to our things by the truck. They had already packed up the rest of the camp. The other tent was gone, the fire barrel was in the truck and all evidence of a campsite had been practically erased. Not even the fire&#039;s ashes had been left behind, presumably scattered to the wind. With everything gone, the place looked like just another piece of nature. Were they actively trying to hide their trail? From what? These skirmishers seemed like professionals; what could possibly scare them into covering their tracks so thoroughly? It must be standard operating procedure for them, like some sort of special ops stuff. I wouldn&#039;t leave evidence behind if I was a super soldier-type in the wilderness. Maybe that was why Vee had lost the trail as we had gotten closer to their camp; they had done an impeccable job cleaning up the scene of the firefight.
 
All of our stuff was exactly where Argo had said, packed even more neatly than Vee had done. Even the shotgun was there, leaned against the hiking pack. Vee grabbed that first and checked to see if it was loaded while I took a look at the boots. They didn&#039;t appear the same as the skirmishers&#039; angular black boots beneath their armor. These were sort of nondescript with a tan color like sand; they were just regular hiking boots. Luckily they fit comfortably enough, but a faint spatter of blood across the top gave me pause, and it was then I remembered Eric and Gerard had been forced to leave Donovan&#039;s body behind.
 
&quot;We do not loot the dead,&quot; Five said, noticing the reason for my hesitation. &quot;Refugee centers are facing shortages of every kind. We gather everything that can be reused so that others do not go wanting.&quot;
 
I wondered if she thought I had been judging her. Not that I could, though. Half of our stuff was taken from Eric and Gerard. &quot;What did you do with him? His body, I mean.&quot;
 
&quot;He was given a proper burial,&quot; she said. She returned my surprise with her own. &quot;It was the right thing to do.&quot;
 
Vee paused for just a second, like a machine going through a negligible hitch. She just kept checking our bags, clearly faking indifference to my scrutiny in that moment.
 
&quot;Before you go, Liam and Vee, I wanted to ask you both something.&quot; Five waited until she had our attention; it was a bit longer as Vee had to repack everything she had checked and seemed unwilling to stop even for a moment. &quot;I&#039;ve given some thought to a name. I feel meeting an...agreeable viper and a human unperturbed by our appearance is significant. And I enjoy how simple your names are. Would either of you be opposed if I took the name Veelee? I still haven&#039;t been able to choose a name, but this one could be a candidate.&quot;
 
Veelee. Vee. Liam, minus the second syllable. Sort of cute, to be honest. Sounded feminine enough, though I don&#039;t know if that was important to a skirmisher. Jova and Edix sounded unisex, so maybe masculinity and femininity didn&#039;t matter. I felt a smile growing across my face as I repeated the name in my head, taking some small amount of pride in unwittingly helping someone choose something so important to them. Vee looked at me and shrugged; she didn&#039;t seem to mind at all and made no objections as she shouldered the hiking pack and then slipped the smaller one onto my back.
 
&quot;Go for it. Sounds like a good name. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be happy with whatever you choose.&quot;
 
I felt a rumbling in my bones and a shrill roar bordering on screaming grow louder and louder in mere seconds. Some sort of four-engine airship floated down low enough to just skim the top of the trees, obscuring the sun and casting the area in shade. It was hard to tell from the ground, but it looked like a side door opened, and a line dropped out to hit the dirt. Three canisters slid down the line by way of a motorized equipment harness. The moment they were in reach, the skirmishers grabbed them and emptied them into the truck&#039;s tank, and then the empty canisters were sent back up. The airship immediately departed and all was quiet once again. What surprised me most was the entire exchange had probably taken less than five minutes. By the time the airship had shrunk away again into the sky, all of the skirmishers were loaded up into the truck, the back door left wide open and waiting only for Five.
 
&quot;Good luck, Liam and Vee. I hope you make it to City 31. I hear things are nicer there for non-humans.&quot;
 
&quot;Thanks. For everything, I mean. Especially the boots.&quot; I wanted to offer her some sort of forgiveness, something that told her she couldn&#039;t hold herself responsible for a former life that had never been hers to begin with. I couldn&#039;t put it into words nor did I know if she would take me seriously, and on second thought I didn&#039;t know if it was even my forgiveness to give. I just offered my hand instead. She recoiled and I wondered for a moment if she even knew what I was doing. A second later she grabbed hold with crushing gusto and shook me comically hard, like it was the first handshake she&#039;d ever gotten. Those armored suits they wore must do something for their strength because she nearly took me off my feet.
 
&quot;You are most welcome,&quot; she said. It was amusing that even with her two-tone voice, it was still easy to hear the smile behind her words.
 
A moment later she was gone and the truck disappeared roughly eastward on a dirt path that could barely be called a makeshift road, and only just wide enough to fit the vehicle. It looked frequently used; how many times throughout my isolation had others traveled so close to my home and I had never known? 
 
Behind me, Vee had her face buried in the datapad. I stood on my toes to try and peer over her shoulder but still wasn&#039;t tall enough. She slightly hunched forward to give me a better look and I saw her making adjustments to the path Argo had laid out. Though it was a little different, I recognized the interstate system and saw the roads like capillaries running across the country. She traced a claw over the screen, moving the map further and further north until we saw our destination in front of us like a carrot on the end of the longest stick.
 
&quot;No roads. At all,&quot; she said. &quot;Dangerous. Well-traveled. Stay in wilds. Just beyond.&quot;
 
&quot;Does your name bother you?&quot; That got her to look up from the screen, her features softening into a questioning look that asked me why we were revisiting this. &quot;Names were so important to them. Making one up on their own was like...the first step towards being their own person. I never meant to take that from you if you wanted it.&quot;
 
&quot;Like Vee. Good name. Given by good--,&quot; she whispered like she was embarrassed to admit it, tearing her eyes from mine to look down at the screen again. I could tell she was about to choose her words carefully by how her jaw seemed to shift before she even spoke, as though we were back in the living room of the house with her learning how to move her mouth to make the right sounds. &quot;Name was offered. I chose to take -- it. I chose to take it.&quot;
 
&quot;Hey, pronouns! I was wondering when they were going to show up!&quot; 
 
She sighed, punctuating it with a low, angry-sounding hiss, and spun around to make her way through the forest at a faster than usual clip.
 
&quot;Come on, I didn&#039;t mean to make you feel bad. Hey, wait up! Seriously, I don&#039;t want to run into a chrysalis on my own, or whatever it was Argo said. Vee!&quot;

-Chapter 9-

We stuck to the wilds just as told, skirting the edges of the East Coast trade zone&#039;s borders, according to the map on the datapad. Though still quite some distance from any real civilization, small, empty towns and derelict commercial zones a few miles off their highway exits littered our path for the first couple of days. Vee thought we wouldn&#039;t hit any true wilderness for at least a week. As such, moving around was still a tense, sometimes aggravatingly slow affair. I had quickly learned that Vee despised empty spaces, and would rather stick to a tree line that went around any wide open clearing even if it took us another couple of hours. The only time this rule didn&#039;t apply was if the field was full of tall grass, something for her to sink low into, and for me to crouch down and follow. 
 
Our path was also unavoidably intersected by old residential roads long since unused, and crossing them was an even more stressful undertaking. Vee insisted we sit for a minimum of twenty minutes -- sometimes up to an hour -- just observing the road, watching for any disturbances before we committed to crossing. If there was cover while crossing a street, she was more comfortable. Wrecked cars, an overturned tanker, a old military barricade from the invasion days -- anything at all that could break up lines of sight from even one direction made her noticeably less anxious, but no less cautious.
 
We sat tight for thirty minutes, waiting to see if anyone or anything else was watching the same little stretch of dilapidated road as we were. Across the street was an old gas station. At least I thought it was old; it had no recharge stations for electric or hybrid vehicles. Between it and us was the road, clogged end to end for at least a quarter mile with burnt out vehicles decades old, blackened and browned by fires and the inevitable encroachment of rust. I didn&#039;t see a barricade or pile-up at the front, so I wasn&#039;t really sure why this line of cars existed out here in the middle of nowhere.
 
Vee noticed where my focus was and said, &quot;Ambushed. Probably. Evacuated, then caught in the open. No time to reverse or accelerate. Possible bombardment, followed by deployment of troops.&quot;
 
Her speech was quickly improving. She was beginning to actually talk normally instead of exhaling with every word, and could speak for a little longer each day without having to unnaturally and exaggeratedly pause for breaths between sentences. &quot;Why would aliens just descend on a traffic jam?&quot;
 
&quot;Terror,&quot; she said, her frown deepening. Her forked tongue lashed out to taste the air, longer than usual, like she was straining to pick up any scents she could. Her shoulders sagged and she let go of a quiet breath. I had learned now that meant she was relaxed. &quot;Structure across the street. Four walls, only one side with windows. Good rest stop; defensible.&quot;
 
A quick breather sounded good to me. The sun was high overhead and the heat was just on the verge of being unbearable. How much of an inconvenience the sun was, now that I couldn&#039;t just disappear into my home the moment things became hot and sticky. Vee never seemed bothered by the heat. I envied her for that.
 
She broke cover first and I quickly followed, the both of us dashing to the line of wrecked cars in the street. I had to take care not to trip over the potholes mother nature had carved out, grass and vines uprooting every inch of asphalt that was left. We sidled along for a few moments until finding a vehicle with its doors open, offering cover on three sides when we nestled between them. It was an SUV, apparently loaded up with everything the occupants could have carried. It was so laden down with clothes, coolers, and boxes that it barely had any ground clearance; either that or the rust had caused the suspension to fail, having been out here in the elements for twenty years. The doors were swung as wide open as possible, which made me think whoever had been inside had flung them open and bolted when they saw whatever it was that had scorched the rest of the road.
 
After a momentary pause and a quick scan of the gas station, Vee slid over the front passenger and driver seats, while I -- afraid of catching a sharp, rusty edge or something -- carefully squeezed myself between the SUV and the sedan in front of it. She moved incredibly fast, her body leaning forward so far it looked like she was perpetually falling as she dashed forward. By the time she was already well inside the gas station, I was just barely reaching the front doors which precariously hung from the frame on busted hinges.
 
The inside was just as much of a mess as could be expected after decades of isolation. The tiled floor had been uprooted just like the street outside; grass and weeds sprouted up as though they&#039;d found the perfect place to call home, eagerly filling in every crack and crevice that the elements had weathered into the ceramic and concrete beneath. The shelves -- all obviously bare now -- were moved away from the entrance, as though something big had crashed through and effortlessly shoved everything aside. The paint on the walls had long since faded. Among the ugly white now speckled by blank spots of chipped paint, a single faint red stripe ran around the interior at eye level, offering the only bit of color in the place. The coolers were all empty and the glass and plastic shattered, the previously refrigerated drink racks overtaken entirely by molds and an abundance of mushrooms. A sign hung from a chain above the checkout. Though mottled by dirt and much of the image flaked off, it was still just possible to read: free donut with purchase of a large coffee. 
 
If I could have remembered what either of those things tasted like, I might&#039;ve waxed nostalgic.
 
&quot;Slow progress,&quot; Vee said as she studied the map, coiling her body beneath her. &quot;Should be faster.&quot;
 
&quot;We&#039;re shadowing the main highway, aren&#039;t we? Even as far as we are from it, we&#039;re bound to hit this many roads. Not to mention every clearing we come to has you spooked.&quot; She glanced up just to narrow her eyes at me. &quot;I&#039;m not poking fun. Better we move slow than end up dead, right? Like you said, it would be about a week until we hit actual wilderness. Until then, steady as she goes.&quot;
 
She put the datapad back into the hiking pack and decided that while she was in there, she&#039;d take out a small piece of a C-stick.
 
&quot;Hang on, I&#039;ve got something better,&quot; I said. She paused right before eating it, frozen on the spot like she wasn&#039;t sure what I meant. &quot;Better tasting, anyway. You&#039;ll still probably want to eat that to get your daily calories.&quot;
 
My backpack, made heavier by my exhaustion and the afternoon heat, was a welcome load off my shoulders, even if just for a few minutes. I dug past the blanket and clothing, past the batteries and first aid kit, and continued to root around. The backpack was so full I couldn&#039;t see around its other contents and I wasn&#039;t going to empty the bag entirely, so I was forced to rely on touch. Vee cautiously slithered over, perhaps tempering her excitement. The last time I had surprised her, it was something good she had never had before. I wasn&#039;t about to disappoint now.
 
&quot;Here it is,&quot; I said, seizing upon the plastic baggie that I knew had been buried somewhere in there. It was the jerky, taken from Eric as he no longer had need of it. There were a handful of long pieces, enough to last two people a couple of weeks as a sparse, intermittent treat. I tore a small bit off for a taste test; it was peppery and with just a tinge of spiciness competing against an equally faint sugary sweetness, a hint of salt beneath it all that told me it had only been meant as a preservative and not as a flavor. Newbies had a tendency to make it too dry, bordering on crunchy. This was tender and soft -- perfectly chewy. Whoever had made it was no novice.
 
&quot;I think it&#039;s venison. Not too sure. It&#039;s been a little while since I&#039;ve had deer or even seen one.&quot; She gingerly took the piece offered to her and tasted its aroma, soaking up its flavors through her tongue. It flickered faster and faster, like she couldn&#039;t get enough of the scent. It was hard for her to even put it in her mouth, as though she had to fight the temptation to just sit there and continue tasting the air. When she popped it into her mouth, she shot me a look of surprise; I figured I might&#039;ve known why.
 
&quot;That&#039;s spice,&quot; I said, only just now wondering how a snake could actually taste. Then again -- aliens. Who was to say for sure how they worked? &quot;It&#039;s not strong so it&#039;ll pass in a moment. I know you don&#039;t really chew things, but just give it a second. The sweetness hits afterward.&quot;
 
She held it in her mouth, her jaw shifting as perhaps she was using her tongue to move it around. Her shoulders sagged and long, soft hiss slipped past her lips, all the while more and more of her body sank into her coils below. She was actually melting. I couldn&#039;t help laughing; I knew we were supposed to stay quiet, but holding it in hurt my sides too much.
 
&quot;Better than my chicken?&quot; She nodded without a moment&#039;s thought. &quot;Ouch,&quot; I said with a laugh, watching as she began to gain back control of herself. &quot;God, mankind could&#039;ve put everybody into a food coma if you had let us. The way my family ran a kitchen would&#039;ve blown your mind. I wish you guys had come in peace.&quot;
 
She swallowed, suddenly looking rather glum. &quot;I do too.&quot;
 
I thought it would be a good time to press her; did she? Did she regret her part in the invasion and occupation? Did she wish she could wash her hands of the blood that stained them? Was she still trying to overcome the memories and experiences forced onto her by the Elders or did she rationalize it all away by saying it couldn&#039;t have been her fault? That last possibility drew a hint of anger from somewhere inside of me that I couldn&#039;t figure out. It made sense, but for someone to just clap the responsibility from their hands like dust and move on seemed callous, cruel even. To not show a modicum of remorse, or even a second spent wishfully thinking it could have happened differently, even though one was mind-controlled into doing it...
 
Vee tightened her coils around herself, as though she were closing herself off. Maybe she knew why I had grown silent. I wasn&#039;t angry at her, however. I hadn&#039;t known her for long, but I don&#039;t think anybody could call her callous or cruel now. And the regret was certainly there; she wished things could have happened differently. But most of humanity would not care. I wondered if maybe that&#039;s why she hadn&#039;t really opened up to me yet -- I was still &#039;most of humanity&#039; to her in some form or fashion.
 
She took out the datapad again and pretended to study the map even more intently than before, even though our path had not changed. &quot;We should move. Soon.&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah. Okay, just let me, uh, take care of business.&quot; Vee looked at me quizzically, motioning to the immediate surroundings. &quot;I&#039;m not a savage. if there&#039;s a room for it, I&#039;ll do it there.&quot;
 
An open door in the back of the gas station still bore the universal blue-and-white signs of male and female above the frame. I made my way towards it, curiously noting how the empty shelves seemed pushed away from the most direct path to the restroom. Something big had stormed through the store and made a beeline to the restroom. The hair on the back of my neck began to tingle, but imagining even aliens feeling nature&#039;s call in the middle of an invasion got a little laugh out of me and the fear dissipated.
 
Only to rise again when three skeletons and their empty eye sockets stared at me from the darkest corner of the restroom.
 
&quot;Holy shit!&quot; I stumbled backwards, knocking into the closest shelf. In an instant Vee was beside me, her hand on my shoulder ready to yank me backward, though her grip loosened when she saw there was no immediate danger. &quot;I&#039;m fine, I&#039;m fine. They just startled me.&quot;
 
Two skeletons sat in the corner. A smaller skeleton sat between the two, and I had the overwhelming sense that I should not have looked, that I had walked in on an intensely private moment that no other person had ever been meant to see. A rusted revolver laid between the legs of one of the adults, resting against the pelvic bones, and a thick layer of moss or lichen or something grew up and over their legs like a blanket. They must have died defending themselves. I couldn&#039;t bear to look anymore and averted my gaze, only for my eyes to happen upon a child&#039;s backpack that bore the same brand as some of the luggage I had seen in the SUV still out in the street. Vee saw it too and slithered past me for a closer look, her focus sharpening like she was tracking another trail.
 
&quot;Ran from vehicle. Sheltered here,&quot; she said, running her hand across the crater in the thick wooden door. She stared long and hard at it before turning to look at the shelves all messily rearranged by whatever had crashed through the store. &quot;Plasma fire there and there; a muton pursued. Pushed shelving aside. Punched door open. Found family here.&quot; She picked up the revolver and checked the cylinder; I could hear it groan from the rust and grit caught in the mechanism, and the moment she finally managed to get the cylinder to move, it fell off entirely into her waiting hand. Her attention turned to the skeleton closest to the gun. She studied it, looking at it from every angle; dread flooded my mind when she pointed out a single hole in each of the skulls that I had failed to notice. &quot;Male. Shot other two, then himself.&quot;
 
I swallowed loudly enough to break Vee from her trance-like state. Shame flashed across her features for just a moment, but she added, &quot;Merciful. Plasma wounds painful. Muton&#039;s rage brutal.&quot;
 
I sure as hell didn&#039;t have the irreverence to do any business anywhere near them, nor did I want to be near such a scene at all; I was never the superstitious type but after hearing how things had gone down, the whole building suddenly felt cursed, the air itself heavy and choking. We packed up in silence, and after a quick stop by some bushes, we were on our way again through the woods behind the gas station.
 
That could have easily been me and my family. On our drive to the farmhouse, we could&#039;ve been caught in a convoy or traffic jam. We could have been descended upon by some hulking monstrosity, and try as we might to run, maybe we might&#039;ve ended up like those three skeletons. Dad had been so serious and taciturn when it came to defending the house, never saying a word when the time came but never backing away from any danger that threatened us. It had always been a fellow human, though. Would he still have had that resolve when faced with something that could wreck a store interior on its own, or knock a thick, heavy door right off its hinges? At the end of my questions I found one that seemed to overshadow all the rest: could there have been a point where he would have given up hope? 
 
I had no clear answer, only an increasingly disturbing amount of hypothetical scenarios and gruesome ends. I distracted myself with the world around me; there were birds, alerting one another and endlessly bickering about territory or bragging how great a pick they were for a mate. Though still bright daylight, the moon was just visible in the sky, pale and faint, waiting for just a few more hours until it could glow as it always did. The crickets sensed the drop in temperature as the day wore on and began to chirp their own incessant songs. Things seemed so similar, like the invasion had never happened. As far as anyone could ever tell, this was a normal autumn day. Save for the giant, intelligent, two-armed snake keeping pace beside me.
 
&quot;Hey, Vee...&quot; 
 
I don&#039;t see any scars on you besides the two gunshots; how do you know plasma is painful? What would the muton had done to them that makes you think a father being forced to kill his own family is the merciful way out? Why did you have to explain what had happened? Why couldn&#039;t you have just let me think they had died fighting?
 
I sighed. &quot;What was your home like? Your planet, I mean.&quot;
 
&quot;Do not know. Earthborn.&quot;
 
&quot;I know, but there&#039;s records right? Pictures or video?&quot;
 
&quot;Possibly. Do not know. Information of all kinds. Closely guarded by Elders.&quot;
 
&quot;What, like it&#039;s all secret?&quot;
 
&quot;Or erased.&quot;
 
So Vee actually had no place to truly call home. She didn&#039;t even know if they had a home planet. Maybe they never did. What if they were totally engineered as a species? Not just hatched for the singular purpose of fighting, but designed from the outset, the very first cell in their bodies grown with the intent of making the perfect war-fighter. With this, there&#039;d be a total lack of culture, of anything that defines them as a people. There&#039;d be no history, no heritage, no ancestry -- just an endless assembly line that spat out killers to enforce a regime as alien to them was they were to us. But that couldn&#039;t be the case -- if the Elders had made the perfect warrior, why would there be a need to mind control it? Should it not also been engineered to be loyal?
 
And they had language. Vee had said so, when I had asked if I could learn some of it. I&#039;ve heard her use different types of hissing, some with different pitches or intensity, some short and bursting with violent energy and others that seemed soft and inquisitive. Language implies some sort of culture. It&#039;s a means to communicate ideas and knowledge, to form identities and social groups. As far as I knew, no culture had ever existed without a language, and no language had ever existed that did not belong to a culture. They speak, therefore they are.
 
&quot;I&#039;ll bet you guys have a world just like ours. Forests and plains, oceans and deserts. Critters everywhere. Blue skies -- hell, green for all I know -- that stretch all the way to the horizon, some pink clouds or some other oddity. Maybe two suns or something else weird, like Tatooine -- damn, I can&#039;t use references on you.&quot;
 
&quot;Good place to visit.&quot;
 
&quot;Right? Shoot, I&#039;d go.&quot; She turned, an odd little smirk tugging at the corners of her scaly lips. &quot;What?&quot;
 
&quot;Would not leave house for twenty years. Now you go to another planet?&quot;
 
&quot;Hell, I&#039;m this far from home already. What&#039;s another couple hundred thousand or million light years?&quot;
 
She did it again; that slow, stuttering sort of hiss that Commander Argo had said was a viper&#039;s laugh. It was obviously different from what I was used to, but it seemed to hold the same power as any other human&#039;s laugh; the mood lightened and her guard was down even if for a moment. Vee was approachable, vulnerable. The soldier I knew she was disappeared and for a fleeting moment -- even with the scales, even with the snake body and large predatory eyes, even with the giant mouth and its two huge fangs -- she was more what I would call a normal person.
 
And in the next moment the soldier was back with a vengeance; her scowl deepened nearly to the point of actual anger, her hood seemed to flare wider than usual, and a short, harsh hiss froze me in place.
 
&quot;Don&#039;t move,&quot; she instructed. I was only vaguely aware of a line of pressure against my shin, as though I were about to trip over something. It was like an out-of-body experience, like I was watching someone else press their leg against a trap, feeling the tension knot my stomach as I waited for them to violently meet their end; I was watching a movie. It wasn&#039;t me. It couldn&#039;t be.
 
&quot;Don&#039;t move,&quot; she said again, sinking down to look. I wanted so badly to see what she saw, to just tilt my head down a few degrees to see how my death would come, but Vee&#039;s tone was commanding, assertive -- it was like she had a plan already. That little shred of hope was enough for me to grab hold of; sort of like trying to hold onto a fistful of sand, but it was better than nothing.
 
&quot;Trip wire,&quot; she whispered. &quot;No effect. Yet. Must be tension-release. Old Earth military. Possibly. Don&#039;t move.&quot; 
 
Her body gradually slipped from the edge of my peripheral vision and I heard her moving further and further away. My heart did it&#039;s best to jump up out of my throat but dread pulled it all the way back down into my gut; she was leaving me.
 
&quot;Vee?&quot;
 
&quot;Wait.&quot; Wait for what? For her to get a head start and clear the blast radius? It was prudent, I guessed, though the logic did nothing for the cold sweat drenching my entire body. 
 
&quot;It&#039;s fine. It was a good run, wasn&#039;t it? If this is as far as I go, don&#039;t feel bad about it. I don&#039;t want you getting hurt if you can avoid it. Is it going to be quick?&quot;
 
There was no answer, only the sound of her moving further away, oddly as if she were in the trees. My death was on my time now; it was a curiously comforting thought to know I would die only when I felt like moving my foot, and my breaths deepened and the tightness in my chest faded.So this was it. I survived an alien invasion for twenty years, was the last of my family as far as I knew, and in a week everything fell apart at the seams in the most absurd ways. Befriending an alien, being called a collaborator, having my house burnt down and being protected by alien clones afterwards. That was more excitement in the last week than I had experienced since the invasion, but I couldn&#039;t say it had been worth it if this was how I was going to go out. And after everything -- what had I done with my life? My parents died protecting their children. My brother helped fight and win a war against an overpowering alien force. And there was my life, sitting in the back of the proverbial bus hoping to escape notice, all the while not understanding it wasn&#039;t even worthy of any sort of notice to begin with.
 
Still, befriending an alien was something not too many people would get to look back on, I imagined. As strange a consolation as any in dire straits like mine, but I couldn&#039;t focus on anything else. I had said goodbye to my parents and come to to terms long ago with the probable death of my brother, Alex. and now, here at the end, I just found myself wishing I could&#039;ve known Vee a little longer.
 
&quot;Done.&quot; Her voice beside me again nearly startled me enough to make me lose my balance.
 
&quot;Done what? What&#039;s done?&quot;
 
&quot;Trap disarmed,&quot; she said, holding up what looked like a haphazardly made chandelier of glass jars and bottles befitting an apocalyptic ballroom. &quot;Simple noise alarm. Suspended in the trees. No explosives.&quot;
 
I immediately doubled over, falling hard onto my hands and knees, and emptied out the scant contents of my stomach. Even when nothing was left I couldn&#039;t help but to keep heaving until my chest ached from the strain and burnt from the awful aftertaste of bile. I felt like crying but I didn&#039;t have the energy for even a single tear or sob after I had finally regained control of myself. Still panting, and with one or two more dry heaves, I wiped my mouth and sat up on my knees, suddenly feeling a lot lighter -- figuratively and literally.
 
&quot;Drink some water,&quot; Vee demanded as she collected the tripwire into a spool around her wrist. I unhooked the canteen from its loop on my overalls and took a small swig; she stared expectantly, so I took another drink and she went back to gathering the wire. When she was done, we were both looking at about twelve feet of strong, ultra-thin wire. I wasn&#039;t exactly an outdoor survivalist, but even I saw a myriad of uses for that. I could&#039;ve even used it around the house, so it was a no-brainer to take it with us out here. Fishing, snares, lashing things together -- we could use it for anything.
 
&quot;I wish you had said something sooner, holy hell. I was literally seconds away from moving my foot.&quot;
 
&quot;I said don&#039;t move.&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, but then you didn&#039;t answer and I heard you getting further away. I thought you were just getting to a safe distance.&quot;
 
&quot;Won&#039;t leave you,&quot; she quickly added, turning away to stash the wire in her hiking pack. Her voice in that moment was softer and trailed off at the end. It left me feeling very strange for reasons I couldn&#039;t pin down, but it wasn&#039;t something I had heard from her before. I wasn&#039;t so great with people these days, but I knew that when someone didn&#039;t want to look at me, they were usually hiding something; she took suspiciously long just to put some wire away.
 
&quot;Noise alarm,&quot; she said before I could get a word out, pointing at the bottles and jars on the ground. &quot;What does it mean?&quot;
 
&quot;It means someone&#039;s been here before,&quot; I said, leaving behind her behavior from a moment ago. 
 
&quot;Can you tell when?&quot;
 
It took me a moment to realize she was trying to teach me. After all, she had been a soldier; she could kill, track, deduce just as well as any detective, apparently. The only reasons for her questions were for my benefit. &quot;I guess sort of recently, right? The bottles look mostly clean. There&#039;s no mold or anything growing inside.&quot;
 
&quot;Good guess. If hung recently, what would that mean?&quot; I had to think on that for more than a moment; she could see I was getting hung up and changed her question. &quot;Type of alarm is noise. What is its purpose?&quot;
 
&quot;Alert someone to movement.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes. Which means--&quot;
 
&quot;Which means someone would have to be nearby to hear it.&quot;
 
She took the datapad from her pack and switched it on, then pointed to a group of buildings a little ways off our current position. &quot;Good. Map marks a residential area. Half a mile north. Makes sense?&quot;
 
&quot;Placing an alarm that you&#039;ve got to be able to hear so far away doesn&#039;t seem right. Why would it be so far off?&quot;
 
&quot;Deterrent. Or perhaps somebody patrols the area. Understand?&quot;
 
I suddenly felt like I had more than one set of eyes on me, but Vee&#039;s attitude remained unchanged even with her revelation someone else may be nearby. She probably would have smelled them already if they were close. &quot;I think so. So do we want to go around or--&quot;
 
&quot;No. Open fields to the west; if it were me, I would watch fields for use. Dense commercial zone east, past major roads. Through residential zone risky, but arguably safer. Many vantage points, but plenty of cover. Stay very close, do exactly as instructed. Understand?&quot;
 
&quot;Crystal clear.&quot;
 
We crept along at a much slower pace than before. She still led the way on our approach to the neighborhood. It was a good thing too, because we came across three more of the same type of trap, more tightly clustered the further we went; she disarmed one more for another spool of wire -- just in case. We stopped at the edge of the treeline in the backyard of what looked like half of a house, the second floor mysteriously gone with the only hint it had ever been there was a staircase I could see through a rotted out wall. The back porch was entirely green with mold and mildew, wildly overgrown by weeds and vines that poked through every window and door, like mother nature herself was breaking and entering. The inside was no different; as we moved through the interior, each room was like its own ecosystem. A small patch dandelions in the corner of what looked to be the kitchen caught my attention; something moved from flower to flower. I thought it was just a mote of dust or pollen at first, but on closer inspection I had my breath stolen from me.
 
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; I gasped. Vee&#039;s eyes snapped to me, then to where I was pointing. &quot;I haven&#039;t seen a bumblebee in years. I thought they went extinct.&quot; She was not nearly as impressed as I was and only reminded me to stay quiet by pressing a finger to her lips. &quot;Sorry.&quot;
 
We continued through the house, still wary of traps and of what laid beyond. We paused at the front door still tightly shut and peered through the sidelights. Again, I was dumbstruck by what waited for us outside.
 
There was not a single glimpse of black asphalt or white sidewalk to be seen. Every square inch of space in this abandoned neighborhood had been overtaken by nature, who had seen fit to plant a veritable garden smack dab in the middle of it all. From one end of the street to the other, porch to porch, the entire ground was overrun by the most breathtaking display of color I had seen outdoors since the invasion. Wildflowers of every kind and hue had sprung up in such chaos that the place seemed clogged to the point of being impassable. Bees swarmed everywhere, looking like specks of black from this distance that easily sprung out against the backdrops of reds, yellows, and whites. A single house down the street was recognizable only in shape; nature had seen fit to convert it to one giant flowerbed, though for some reason the other homes were left about as intact as the one we were in.
 
I could see the change in Vee&#039;s posture, how she slouched and silently flicked her tongue as she looked out over the sea of color constantly shifting in the wind. I knew she saw the copious amounts of cover the tall grass and flowers would provide, but part of me wondered if she saw the same little paradise that I did -- the burst of color long overdue in a dreary world. Whether she did or not, I couldn&#039;t tell; she firmly pushed open the door and quickly slithered into the grass, seemingly swallowed up entirely by the vast green tide. I followed close behind, but no sooner had we made it halfway across when Vee suddenly stopped, her tongue furiously lashing out and her eyes wide open and alert. I silently mouthed &#039;what&#039; to her.
 
&quot;Blood,&quot; she hissed.
 
&quot;Hello? Is somebody there?&quot; Another voice in the grass made my heart skip a beat; Vee&#039;s eyes focused like lasers in the direction it had come from, even though she could only see green. &quot;Please, I&#039;m hurt pretty bad. I was passing through and hit some kind of trap. I need help.&quot;
 
I rose to see what I could; a man in a red short-sleeved shirt trudged through the wildflowers with one hand up to shield his eyes from the sun. With a forceful hissing, Vee tugged me down by my arm. &quot;Don&#039;t.&quot;
 
&quot;He says he&#039;s hurt, you said you smelled blood, and we know there are traps around. I can&#039;t just leave someone like that. What if he&#039;s bleeding out or something? We can help him. We haven&#039;t used any of the first aid stuff from the house.&quot; 
 
Before she could answer or tighten her grip, I sprang up to wave hello. He looked kind of middle-aged, maybe late forties or fifties; a salt-and-mostly-pepper beard covered the lower half of face. His red shirt was plaid, the sleeves torn off just a few inches down from his armpits. One hand waved back while the other stayed hidden below the grass-line; it moved limply, like it could only sway with the movements of his body. He wore a fisherman&#039;s vest, a few pockets stuffed full of odds and ends I couldn&#039;t make out from this distance. He had a bright smile on, happy to see another human in all this mess.
 
Vee loosed another hiss, this one much louder and angrier sounding, before popping up beside me to assess the situation. Oddly, the man was unperturbed by her appearance and continued to approach.
 
&quot;Favors right side; possible weapon on waist,&quot; she whispered behind me. &quot;Left arm movements do not support injury; holding something heavy, possibly a long gun. Smile is disingenuous; lower eyelids do not move with the smile. Facial expression inconsistent; motor tics of the mouth and eyes. Don&#039;t.&quot;
 
A sound I hadn&#039;t hear before -- a sort of worrying groan -- drew my attention to Vee. &quot;Please just trust me on this. I&#039;ve been alone for a while but I&#039;m pretty sure I still know how normal people act. He&#039;s got a limp and a bum arm, and he&#039;s just trying to grin and bear it. I am human. I know humans.&quot;
 
When I turned around, his other arm, previously hidden from sight was raised and pointed in my direction; a deafening boom just over my shoulder made my ears ring and all I could do was merely flinch away, too paralyzed by fear to duck or throw myself to the ground. The man crumpled backwards, his arm going high and a bullet cracked the air over my head like a whip. Vee advanced with the shotgun still at the ready, pushing me aside to storm ahead to where my would-be killer had fallen. I saw her look down into the grass and stand watch over him for just a few moments. Her shoulders sagged. That should have been it, but then she tensed up again, glaring at me as she returned to my side. The embarrassment was -- overwhelming couldn&#039;t even begin to describe it. I didn&#039;t even have time to be amazed at how quickly it all had gone down.
 
&quot;What did I say?&quot; She tersely whispered, barely moving her mouth as she angrily forced each word out. &quot;What did I say? Repeat it!&quot;
 
&quot;I&#039;m sorry, I won&#039;t--&quot;
 
Her eyes narrowed to slits so thin I couldn&#039;t even make out her pupils; just paper-thin red lines etched into her face through which all her fury seeped through. &quot;Repeat. It.&quot;
 
&quot;Do exactly as instructed,&quot; I said, meekly looking at the ground. My face burned even more; I was probably nothing more than a child to her, and she the disappointed parent.
 
She sighed, but it was forced and sharp, like she was trying as hard as she could to vent the building wrath inside of her. &quot;I do not want to do this anymore,&quot; she said. &quot;Skills I never asked for and I do not want. Have made it too far from my burned-down garrison to go back to the way things were. Want a new life, understand? Free now! But what good is freedom when I still do the Elder&#039;s work for them? Try to avoid killing and the only human I befriend throws himself into trouble at every chance. I need you to--&quot;
 
She stopped short, every inch of her body slouching just a little as whatever she was holding inside had finally dissipated. She had said her piece and and cleared her mind, and she was back to survival mode. &quot;I need you to search him. Rifle beside him, bullets in his jacket. Take what you can carry.&quot;
 
I wasn&#039;t sure if that was supposed to be a dig at me, a subtle reminder of the confrontation of the house where I had told her to get my gun, then turned it down in the dazed confusion of my first gunfight. I remember the shotgun feeling unbearably heavy in my hands, a boulder so heavy it would have been impossible to lift then. So what did she think I could carry? Was this a test? If I came back with a gun in my hands, I would be expected to use it wouldn&#039;t I? I knew how -- mechanically, anyway -- but even now, after two hostile encounters where I had skirted death by what felt like milliseconds, I still wasn&#039;t sure if I had it in me to pull the trigger on another person. At this point, way out here where Vee and I only had one another to rely on...
 
That was a weakness, wasn&#039;t it? I was holding myself back, and at some point it would endanger her or myself.
 
The body was marred by too many pellets to count. Most of it had hit him square in the chest, a dark red constellation of entry wounds that spotted his shirt below the neck with holes. Much of what had been in his vest was useless now; some pistol rounds, an empty magazine, a knife, a canteen -- all damaged by the buckshot. On his waist, beneath his shirt, was a handgun, just like Vee had said. He had a full magazine for it strapped to one pouch on his left thigh, below which a large rust-colored stain colored his pant leg from the knee down; that must have been the blood Vee had smelled, old and crusted and belonging to someone else. On the right leg was another pouch with two magazines for his rifle, which looked like an M-16 or something similar. It even had the full auto sign on the selector which civilians were not typically allowed to have back in the day. I wondered if he had gotten it from an old military base or national guard depot, or maybe he had killed a soldier for it. Or maybe he used to be a soldier. Who knew now.
 
What bothered me most was that Vee had been totally on the money. She laid this guy out on looks alone from a couple dozen feet, down to his intentions and the weapons he carried. The alien snake from a universe away could read humans better than me, the man that had walked this Earth among my own kind for thirty-seven years. It was hard not to be even further embarrassed, and feel even further apart from the rest of the human race. I tried to push those thoughts away as I gathered what I could.
 
When I was done, something poked out of the grass and followed my face all the way as I stood back up. 
 
It was hard not to laugh at the bad luck, but all I could muster in my shock was a quiet, &quot;Hello.&quot;
 
It was a black woman, a foot shorter than me but looking twice as fierce as I&#039;ve ever felt even on my worst days. Her hazel eyes bored holes straight through my skull and her gun didn&#039;t waver for even a moment. She had her dirty hair swept back into a ponytail, a few short bangs dangling over her forehead marked by a shiny patch of some kind of mechanical grease. That she didn&#039;t pull the trigger immediately made me feel just a little better, for what it was worth.
 
&quot;You kill this guy?&quot;
 
&quot;Uh, no. She did.&quot;
 
The woman peered around me, keeping the rest of her body eerily still and her gun still frozen inches from my face. &quot;Slowly turn around and tell her to back off.&quot;
 
I didn&#039;t even bother putting my hands up; my arms were full anyway, my intention having been to shove it all into my backpack once we had gotten inside of another house. I spun and saw Vee not three feet away, the shotgun held tight to her shoulder and one single blood-red eye peering down the sights. I couldn&#039;t tell if the anger she wore was at me or the situation in general. Despite my predicament, I found myself hoping she wasn&#039;t upset with me.
 
&quot;Vee, can we bring the energy down a bit? Just a little? Please?&quot;
 
&quot;Is that her name?&quot; I nodded. The woman shouted, &quot;Vee, you killed this guy?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, slightly hissing the end of the her reply. Vee&#039;s eyes flickered from me, then back to the woman that I swore she could see through me. My mind raced between thoughts of this new woman and the man we had just met and killed within two minutes; were they related? Friends or lovers? Partners like Vee and I?
 
&quot;You lower your gun on three, I lower mine. We talk this out, yeah? You did me a favor, after all.&quot; Definitely not friends then. 
 
Vee stared at me. I kept waiting for a signal, a glance or some motion of her hands that told me to hit the dirt or duck or something, anything at all. There was nothing but the disappointment of resignation slowly spreading across her face. No matter what she did, no matter what I did, she could not bet on a sure outcome. No matter who pulled the trigger first, someone was going to end up dead. Probably me. Vee didn&#039;t even wait until the count of three. The shotgun fell to her side, and a moment later the barrel that had been pressing into my lower back fell away, too.
 
&quot;You can call me Penny,&quot; said the woman, strolling out from behind me into plain view. &quot;And I know enough that no damn alien with a name&#039;s part of ADVENT anymore. Like I said, ya&#039;ll did me a favor; this dude was a psychopath and--&quot;
 
A distant, chittering screech made all of our heads turn. I had no idea what had caused such a sound but for reasons I was unable to explain, it still froze my blood solid in my veins.
 
&quot;We can&#039;t stay out here. This is chryssalid country and they probably heard the shots. My place is in the cul-de-sac down the street. Follow me there and I&#039;ll explain more.&quot; Penny saw Vee flash me an uneasy look. &quot;Or don&#039;t. Enjoy the chryssalids.&quot;
 
She walked away, leaving Vee and I to exchange glances with one another. I nodded my head towards Penny and started walking. Vee hesitated, but quickly caught up to walk beside me, a little ways behind our newest friend, inasmuch as she wasn&#039;t trying to kill us.
 
&quot;You know,&quot; I whispered, nudging Vee with my elbow, &quot;I&#039;d love to meet somebody and not have a gun involved. Just once, so I know what it feels like.&quot;
 
It was easy to see Vee was still upset with me; she refused to look at me with her still-narrowed eyes and silently slithered along as if I wasn&#039;t even there. But it was also easy to see the little grin she wore, and how she tried to hide it.</textarea>
