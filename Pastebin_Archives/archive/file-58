        <textarea class="textarea">Chapter 1: Rocket man
&gt;You are Anon, average man in every way
&gt;One day, you decided to be a little less average though
&gt;So a few months back you decided to go to get a gym Membership and google a workout plan
&gt;The gym was only a half mile from your house too so you could jog a bit before and after your workouts
&gt;Except leg day and the day after leg day
&gt;But you never skipped it!
&gt;Right now you were jogging home to your apartment thinking about what to make for dinner 
&gt;Chicken Quesadillas? Maybe
&gt;You stop to jog in place at an intersection and wipe your brow
&gt;Wew Lad you were sweaty, definitely needed a shower before dinner
&gt;A quick look left and right and you’re back running
&gt;Maybe you coul-
&gt;A flash, you&#039;re blinded, your body feels weightless
&gt;You feel your body convulsing before the world goes black

&gt;White light fills your eyes
&gt;Where are you? Are you dead? You can&#039;t move
&gt;The light pulls away from you, leaving you blinking and confused
&gt;What happened?
&gt;Everything is blurry
&gt;&quot;Can you hear me? Can you undersstand what I&#039;m sssaying?&quot;
&gt;A raspy yet feminine voice talks to you
&gt;You blink furiously, a shadowy form in your vision waves in front of you
&gt;&quot;I wha? Who are you? Wha happened?&quot; you choke out
&gt;You hear what sounds like long fingernails hitting a tablet
&gt;&quot;The ssspecies, while under evolved seem to be handle to handle basic translator implantsss&quot;
&gt;What? Under evolved? Translator implants? Why is there so much hissing?
&gt;You shake your head and let your eyes focus
&gt;What you see defies belief
&gt;Blinking a few times you attempt to push what you’re seeing away to something that makes sense
&gt;a Snake, a cobra, with arms and in a white coat is tip tapping away on a tablet of some kind
&gt;It has arms but no legs to speak of
&gt;You attempt to move your arms to rub your face and wipe away the terror in your mind
&gt;Except they don&#039;t respond
&gt;Or at least they are heavily restrained
&gt;You look down at your body to find it&#039;s on a table and what appears to be blue bands of light are holding you down
&gt;Struggling against the bonds, you feel like a caged animal, your tired muscle working overtime to get you out of your bonds
&gt;&quot;Ssstop trying to Escape, you will only injure yourself&quot;
&gt;A clawed hand rests on your shirt
&gt;You look up at the Snake thing, still trying to break free
&gt;Boobs, the snake thing has boobs
&gt;She in turn is looking at her hand on your chest
&gt;&quot;what is this warmth? How are you ssso warm?” she mumbles 
&gt;A forked tongue pokes out from her mouth
&gt;&quot;Uh I&#039;m a Human what are you&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s silent, her forked tongue still poking out and her nostrils flaring quickly
&gt;&quot;We are vipers, how are you creating such heat Human?&quot;
&gt;You look at her a bit confused
&gt;&quot;Uh I&#039;m warm blooded so we create our own body heat&quot;
&gt;First contact with an alien and you have to explain why you&#039;re warm
&gt;&quot;And what&quot; She inhales deeply &quot;Is this scent?&quot;
&gt;More tongue action and sharp sniffs
&gt;&quot;Uh I was working out, and running home when I guess you took me, so I&#039;m sweaty&quot;
&gt;her deep amber eyes look you over
&gt;&quot;sssuch an unevolved thing, rid yourself of this scent!&quot;
&gt;you frown
&gt;&quot;Look I don&#039;t know what you want from me, but Can you just let me go?&quot;
&gt;&quot;No...You are useful, more than you might imagine to my kind; I will take you to the high council to see what we will do with your species&quot;
&gt;There goes that plan
&gt;Also FUCK you were being abducted by snake people
&gt;You struggle more against your bonds
&gt;&quot;SSSTOP!&quot;
&gt;The hissing shout snaps you away from your attempted escape, you look at her to see both her hands held fast against her nose and mouth
&gt;&quot;Your movements release more of this Smell you unevolved thing! Rid yourself of it at once!&quot;
&gt;You frown 
&gt;&quot;If you mean you want me to shower than I need to be free&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ssshower? What does this mean?&quot;
&gt;if you could facepalm you would
&gt;&quot;Uh get clean, you know water and soap and stuff&quot;
&gt;She pauses for a moment
&gt;&quot;Yes of course, water and soaps&quot;
&gt;She looks around hastily before slithering off, behind where you could look
&gt;You hear rummaging around behind you
&gt;She appears , still with one hand over her nose and mouth with the other holding what looked like it could be a weapon
&gt;&quot;I will take you to the cleaning room but of you try anything I will shoot you&quot; she says raising the weapon at you
&gt;As she pulls her hand away from her nose you see her shudder slightly only to have it snap back over her nose
&gt;You don&#039;t think you smelled THAT bad
&gt;She pushes a button and the bands of light disappear
&gt;You slide off the table and stretch then look at her
&gt;Jesus fuck she&#039;s big
&gt;9 feet tall easily with at least 12 feet of tail trailing behind her
&gt;As well her breasts are large and proportional to her body would be maybe a D cup
&gt;Wait what are you thinking?! BAD BRAIN
&gt;&quot;Ok lead on Viper&quot;
&gt;She motions with her gun towards a tall door, you go to it and stand there waiting for something to happen
&gt;&quot;Move aside you unevolved beast, can&#039;t even open a door!&quot;
&gt;She pushes up to you and presses a button, you see her tail spasm slightly out of the corner of your eye
&gt;What&#039;s going on with her?
&gt;&quot;GO Breast just... move away from me&quot; She pants heavily recovering her nose and mouth
&gt;You quickly hurry away, not wanting to piss off a snek woman with a gun
&gt;&quot;In here!&quot;
&gt;She motions to a door you walks past
&gt;Inside is what looks like a large room with spouts on the Ceiling,
&gt;Right it would need to be big to accommodate her size
&gt;&quot;There *Ha* is soap *ha* over there&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s really panting hard for some reason
&gt;You go over to where is motioned and find several bottle looking things filled with various colored liquids
&gt;Huh alright then, might not be brand name soap but space sap had to count for something right?
&gt;&quot;Ok how do I turn it on?&quot; you ask as you pull off your shirt
&gt;She retreats further away from you
&gt;&quot;Thosssse buttons! Stay Away from me you beast!&quot; She hisses both pathetically and angrily
&gt;Geez what&#039;s with her?
&gt;You walk to the buttons and look at them before remember there is a snake woman in the room with you and you are about to undress
&gt;&quot;Uh can I have privacy? Also if I&#039;m your prisoner I&#039;ll need clothes and something to dry off&quot;
&gt;She hisses angrily 
&gt;&quot;We will handle that AFTER you clean that scent off you and we dispose of those garments! Hurry on with it!&quot;
&gt;Guess no privacy then
&gt;You strip off your Shorts and Underwear then stand in front of the four buttons wondering which did what
&gt;Ignore the Snake lady
&gt;But a clattering sound from where she was caused you to look up
&gt;She was squirming and writhing her arms wrapped around herself 
&gt;The gun was on the floor
&gt;You ran over to her to see what was wrong
&gt;Why? Instinct? Concern?
&gt;She was your only way back home
&gt;&quot;HEY ARE YOU OK?!&quot; you shout as you approach her
&gt;Without warning she Strikes
&gt;Or at least you thought she did
&gt;Instead she&#039;s coiling herself around you, locking your arms to your sides and your legs together
&gt;you&#039;re lifted off the ground completely and easily
&gt;&quot;HEY WH-&quot; Her tail wraps around your mouth cutting you off
&gt;&quot;WHAT IS THIS HUMAN, WHY DOES YOUR SCENT DRIVE ME WILD?&quot;
&gt;You attempt to struggle but you can&#039;t even move an inch as her steel muscles are coiled around you
&gt;&quot;Is this defense mechanism? Your bestial scent?&quot;
&gt;She levels her head with you, those Amber eyes boring into you
&gt;Her tongue pokes out and her nostrils flare in sharp sniffs
&gt;Moving place to place on your body, she sniffs and you can feel her long tongue lap at the air
&gt;Down your chest, she pauses at your Crotch
&gt;Oh god no
&gt;&quot;It comes from here, your defense comes from whatever this thing is&quot;
&gt;You feel a swish of the air right near it
&gt;&quot;This Smell! This TASTE! It&#039;s Intoxicating!&quot;
&gt;You try to struggle more only to have her tighten her muscles sharply causing you to involuntarily gasp out
&gt;&quot;SsssTop Struggling beast!&quot;
&gt;You can&#039;t see what&#039;s going on but you can feel it
&gt;Several strong sniffs at your base and Balls
&gt;The light flick of a Tongue 
&gt;A warm wet something wraps around your base, coiling around and covering every inch of your member in wetness
&gt;Much to your distress your body betrays you
&gt;You can feel your Cock slowly getting erect from the constant licking and rubbing of rub smooth scaly nose
&gt;&quot;What issss this? The scent is ssstronger as this thing grows, It’ssss driving me crazy&quot;
&gt;A warm sensation envelopes your member, her long tongue still wrapped around you as she takes your whole shaft down her throat with ease
&gt;It&#039;s not like you were small either, but she IS a snake 
&gt;Her tongue moves independently of her head as she uses it to pump up and down your shaft
&gt;Meanwhile her head pumps on the opposite rhythm to her tongue giving you a constant barrage of sensations from her tongue and mouth
&gt;She slowly for a moment before releasing your member from her mouth
&gt;Her tongue unravels from you and she licks up and down you
&gt;Clawed hands rub up and down your sides as she almost absentmindedly licks and caresses you
&gt;&quot;I-I must Sssstop this, but...Once I relieve these desires, I will ssstart the journey home&quot; She says more to herself than to you
&gt;Stronger licks and the occasional suck on the tip of your member
&gt;&gt;&quot;Yessss I am Not A beast like you, I can indulge my desiressss&quot;
&gt;All at once she takes you back into her throat
&gt;Her tongue wrapped around you once again
&gt;She pumps her head quickly, having no skill or technique just raw sensational overload
&gt;Her long tongue pumps faster than her head, pistoning along your shaft
&gt;You can’t even struggle against it, your breathing slightly restricted from her long muscular body coiled around you
&gt;Clawed hands rub your body as she holds you aloft, slurping and suckling on your member 
&gt;Sharp hissing moans come from her as your legs twitch and spasm uncontrollably
&gt;Your limit draws close but she doesn&#039;t relent her assault,
&gt;Her long tongue wraps all along your shaft pumping and coiling tight
&gt;One final Spasm and you release everything into her mouth 
&gt;This causes her to stop the barrage of incredible sensations
&gt;Her tongue continues pumping up and down as she drinks it all down
&gt;Finally she opens her mouth and uncoils her tongue
&gt;&quot;What is this poison you has unleashed? Surely it must be a trick to have a toxin so delicious&quot;
&gt;She licks the tip of your sensitive cock again
&gt;&quot;Perhaps another sampling...”
&gt;As much as you like getting your dick sucked, this wasn&#039;t the way you had in mind
&gt;You might not be able to move but you had a secret weapon
&gt;Wiggling your head a bit gives you just enough space to open your mouth and Bite down on the snake’s tail
&gt;The result is angry pained hissing and you getting dropped onto the floor unceremoniously
&gt;The Snake lady retreats to the other side of the room, hissing angrily
&gt;&quot;BEASSSST HOW DARE YOU&quot;
&gt;You back up against the opposite wall
&gt;&quot;Look I don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on but if you let me get clean, I&#039;m sure I can get my scent away so you can think straight&quot;
&gt;With that, you slide over and press one of the buttons the alien had shown you causing warm water to spray down from the ceiling
&gt;The angry hissing doubles but she stays away from you as you quickly and thoroughly wash yourself
&gt;Eh, better do it again just for good measure
&gt;After to finish you press the button once more and the water shuts off leaving you soaked and shivering
&gt;&quot;Anything I can use to dry off?&quot;
&gt;The water seems to have allowed her to regain her composure because she slithers over and presses another button causing warm jets of air to blow from the ceiling, drying you and her.
&gt;She slithers over to her weapon which had also gotten a through soaking and picks it up then points it at you
&gt;&quot;Thisss changes Nothing Human, you are still my prisoner&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yea yea, Look can I have some clothes? And my Name is Anon by the way not human, what do I call you?&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re actually surprised at yourself and how well you&#039;re taking being abducted by an alien then getting sucked off by said alien
&gt;Well it&#039;s not like you had anything really back on earth
&gt;&quot;You may call me Celeste Knes Sclaria&quot;
&gt;You shake your head
&gt;&quot;Too long, how about just Celeste?&quot;
&gt;Her hood puffs outwards in anger
&gt;&quot;You will address me by my full name Beast!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Regardless can I have some clothes and food, or am I going to be starved and naked?&quot;
&gt;She lowers her weapon and looks you up and down, staring for a particularly long time at your crotch again
&gt;The staring makes you oddly self-conscious
&gt;&quot;Very well, follow me Ano- Beast er, prisoner&quot;
&gt;She looks away from you
&gt;&quot;Follow me&quot; she Hisses once more before slithering out the door
&gt;You follow her and she leads you to a small room where a machine is waiting
&gt;&quot;Get onto that platform, this machine will scan your biology into the ships database so it can synthesize proper clothes and food for your species&quot; She says pointing at a platform in the center of the room
&gt;While you are somewhat suspicious, you have no other choice, or at least you can&#039;t think of one
&gt;You get onto the platform and wait as she sets down her weapon then tinkers with a panel
&gt;A red beams scans you up and down, slightly warming you before white clothing materializes on you
&gt;Not bad, at least you aren&#039;t naked anymore
&gt;She looks at a screen slightly confused
&gt;&quot;Your species is Omnivorous? How odd&quot;
&gt;You stroll over to her only to have her hastily snatch up her weapon again
&gt;Backing away slowly, you affirm what she said &quot;Yes we are, why that is odd?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Omnivores are very very rare in the galaxy, your unevolved species is quite odd&quot;
&gt;You frown at her words
&gt;But your grumbling stomach distracts you and her
&gt;She looks at your stomach perplexed
&gt;You answer the question that you can already see forming
&gt;&quot;It means I&#039;m hungry&quot;
&gt;She looks at you once more before her tongue flickers out of her mouth
&gt;&quot;I too desire nourishment. Come, we will eat and then I will decide where I will keep you for the journey home&quot;
&gt;She keeps going between being amicable and being mean; for lack of a better word
&gt;She leads you out of the room and down the hallway
&gt;&quot;Celeste where is your crew? Aren&#039;t spaceship supposed to have full crews?&quot; you ask as you walk
&gt;Might as well get to know about her
&gt;&quot;This is a research vessel, I am alone on it. This is my punishment, and call me by my full name Beast!&quot;
&gt;Punishment? You weren’t going to ask
&gt;You follow her into another room where a large Heater is above what appears to be a nest of fabrics
&gt;&quot;We will eat here, then I will use your body to warm myself&quot;
&gt;you back up slowly
&gt;&quot;Huh? You don&#039;t have a brig or prison or whatever on this ship?&quot;
&gt;She looks you up and down 
&gt;&quot;Do not question me Beast!&quot;
&gt;You frown and look for a chair when the thought hits you
&gt;Snake person means no chairs
&gt;Guess you&#039;re sitting on the floor
&gt;She slithers over to another machine, presses a few buttons and waits for the machine to work
&gt;It whirs gently before making a slight ding 
&gt;She pulls a tray out of it and sets it on the table
&gt;&quot;Eat, my biossssscanner said you need appropriate nourishment to maintain your heat&quot;
&gt;On the tray is very basic looking meat like substance and what looks like lettuce compressed into the size of an apple
&gt;You look at it in disgust only to have your stomach growl again
&gt;Well fuck, might as well
&gt;You pick up the lettuce apple and bite into it
&gt;It actually doesn&#039;t taste to bad, if anything its bland
&gt;As you eat, Celeste coils herself up at the table and has several large Slabs of the spam like meat
&gt;You watch her as you crunch through your veggie
&gt;Just like a snake, you watch as her jaw unhinges and swallows one of the chunks of meat whole
&gt;It&#039;s both terrifying and impressive
&gt;You finish your lettuce ball thing and pick up the meat, no utensils and Celeste didn&#039;t seem to care for manners anyway
&gt;As you take a bite out of it the taste is actually similar to spam as well, not your favorite but manageable
&gt;While you both eat in silence you wonder why she seemed so interested in you in the first place
&gt;Well you as in humans
&gt;And you wonder why your scent drove her mad
&gt;Doesn&#039;t matter though because she finishes her meal and coils her long body around you
&gt;&quot;HEY WAIT! I&#039;m not done!&quot;
&gt;Your plea falls on deaf ears as she yawns loudly dragging you to her nest before completely immobilizing you with her rope like body
&gt;You attempt to struggle only to have her tighten
&gt;&quot;Sssssstop, sssssleep now&quot; she hisses sleepily
&gt;You give up any attempt to escape, you were sure if you dislocated your shoulder you could get out of this scaly flashy prison
&gt;But you don&#039;t know how to do that though, and you&#039;re on a spaceship, what were you gonna do next?
&gt;Accepting your fate temporarily as a living space heater you rest your head against her firm yet soft scaly body
&gt;Better to think about it in the morning

Chapter 2: Spaceman
&gt;you awake with a start as you&#039;re dragged out of the temporary bed you were in
&gt;the temporary bed being Celeste 
&gt;she seems to have decided to wake up and start preparing for whatever journey she had planned
&gt;However she didn&#039;t seem to want to let you go
&gt;as such you were still wrapped in her long body
&gt;She seems to be at the helm of her ship tip tapping away at buttons
&gt;&quot;h-hey Celeste can you let me go for a second, I need water and to uh, relieve myself&quot;
&gt;your words seem to startle her slightly because she jumps a bit
&gt;&quot;what? No! You are my heater during this trip&quot;
&gt;you wiggle slightly trying to escape
&gt;&quot;yea I get that but I still need water, food, and to piss&quot;
&gt;her whole body isn’t around you so you have movement of your arms but her strong rope like body is coiled around your midsection
&gt;&quot;What does pisssss mean Beast?&quot;
&gt;you think for a moment, the translator implants she talked about yesterday must not be able to fully translate it
&gt;&quot;uh, biological waste disposal?&quot;
&gt;she stares at you with large unblinking eyes for a moment
&gt;&quot;yesssss waste disposal! I will release you for that&quot;
&gt;She doesn&#039;t release you immediately though
&gt;Instead she slithers to out of the room and through one of the various hallways 
&gt;Before long she&#039;s carried you through a door into a very sterile white room
&gt;&quot;Deposit your waste into that hole&quot; she says uncoiling from around you
&gt;for all the advances in space travel they haven&#039;t really done much in terms of bathrooms
&gt;it&#039;s literally a hole in the floor with some padding around it
&gt;but then again, looking at her body it occurs to you that her ...private places must be somewhere down her scaled body
&gt;she only wears a shirt and from what you&#039;ve seen of her there is no opening 
&gt;if she’s like earth snakes scales cover it and need to be pushed aside
&gt;whatever the case was you stand and lower the front of your pants allowing the beast to spring free 
&gt;you can feel her eyes boring into your back as you relieve yourself
&gt;&quot;How is it you do that? You stand and let it pour from you freely? Does gravity affect it?&quot;
&gt;You pull up your shorts and turn to her to answer her questions
&gt;&quot;I uh&quot;
&gt;Before you can get out anymore words she&#039;s coiled around you once more and dragging you back to the helm
&gt;Fuck whatever you’re a space heater now
&gt;&quot;Uh, there&#039;s a muscle that applied pressure to our bladder, it&#039;s not gravity driven at all&quot; you say as you try to avoid having your feet scraped against the smooth floor
&gt;Right she slithers, makes sense to have smooth floors for comfort
&gt;&quot;Interesting, your unevolved species piques my interest more and more&quot;
&gt;Even though she was coiled around you, you had full use of your arms
&gt;&quot;Hey Celeste can you let me go? I wanna grab some food&quot;
&gt;She pauses what she was doing and looks at you
&gt;&quot;You do not need to eat yet&quot;
&gt;Right Snakes only need to eat every once and a while
&gt;&quot;I need to eat at least 2 meals a day though&quot;
&gt;almost on cue your stomach Growls loudly
&gt;&quot;your sssspecies is quite odd, very well I will create more food for you&quot;
&gt;She slither drags you into the room where you were ate yesterday and pushes a few buttons on the machine 
&gt;It spits out more of the spam meat and lettuce thing
&gt;&quot;Eat beast, I have preparations must do before our journey home&quot;
&gt;She uncoils from around you, leaving you laying on the floor
&gt;&quot;Can I have some water too? I&#039;m thirsty&quot;
&gt;She lets out a hissing sigh
&gt;&quot;Helplesssss little thing&quot; she hisses 
&gt;She slithers her way over to a panel and pulls it open revealing jugs of  water
&gt;You stand and walk over to them 
&gt;&quot;Thanks Celeste&quot; you say as you grab one
&gt;You go back to the table and start eating with her watching you intently
&gt;Lettuce thing and spam, not too tasty but not bad
&gt;But it was gonna get old really quick
&gt;&quot;Does your food machine make anything besides this weird stuff?&quot; you say as you eat
&gt;She just stares at you
&gt;&quot;You eat sssso oddly, May I sssee your fangs?&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re a bit confused at this question
&gt;&quot;Fangs? I don&#039;t have fangs&quot;
&gt;You bare your teeth at her showing them off
&gt;She slither close and leans down inspecting them 
&gt;A scaled hand grabs your chin and she turns your head so she can see them at different angles
&gt;&quot;Truly unevolved, crushing teeth like the prey animals&quot;
&gt;She releases your face and lets you eat in peace
&gt;She stays close though, watching you eat with what you assume is a perplexed look on her face
&gt;&quot;Curious species&quot;

&gt;You Drink deep and drain the jug you had completely
&gt;Guess you were more thirsty than you thought
&gt;You eat your food then stand
&gt;&quot;Uh can I make more?&quot;
&gt;Celeste looks awestruck
&gt;Well you guess awestruck anyway, you can&#039;t really ready her facial expressions
&gt;She simply stares at you as you mimic her button presses on the machine
&gt;&quot;You already learned that? I did not show you how to use the Sssssynthsizer&quot;
&gt;The machine spits out another ball of lettuce stuff and more spam
&gt;You collect the food and set it on the table then grab 2 more jugs of water
&gt;&quot;I watched you do it twice, I just did what you did&quot;
&gt;She watches as you eat your second helping
&gt;You were hungry and thirsty, she abducted you right after your workout
&gt;Because of that you were starving and dehydrated
&gt;&quot;How do you eat sssso much? And drink so much?&quot;
&gt;You shrug and talk with your mouth full
&gt;She&#039;s a space snake what do you care about manners?
&gt;&quot;I have a fast metabolism so I need to eat a lot, and my body is 70% water or something like that&quot;
&gt;You feel her long tail starting to coil around you
&gt;&quot;high metabolic processessss that create heat, decent learning capabilities, and your species creates delicious nutrientsssss&quot;
&gt;You scarf down the rest of your food before she can finish coiling around you
&gt;&quot;My Ssssisters will find your species very ussseful anon&quot;
&gt;You aren&#039;t sure what that means and aren&#039;t even sure you want to know what it means
&gt;Soon enough her body is wrapped around you and you&#039;re lifted from the floor
&gt;&quot;You have held up my preparations beast, I have to refuel before I can initiate the Hyperspace jump&quot;
&gt;you wiggle a bit and get your arms free
&gt;&quot;You know I can help? If you show me what to do I can do stuff&quot;
&gt;She lets out a laugh that sounds more like a series of short hisses
&gt;&quot;Primitive little thing, you will do no such thing, you will keep me warm and give me more of your nutrientsss&quot;
&gt;The fact you&#039;re willing to help leave your world surprises you a bit at first
&gt;The more you think about it the more you&#039;re strangely ok with it
&gt;Why stay on earth? Work a dead end Job, try to find a girl to marry and have kids you&#039;ll probably hate?
&gt;Or go into space with a giant talking snake with tits that wants to suck your dick?
&gt;not a hard choice by any means
&gt;Skip the daily grind, skip the whole bullshit of lamenting about never seeing another planet
&gt;as you&#039;re carried through the small ship you make notes of where things are
&gt;&gt;honestly it&#039;s laid out similar to an apartment
&gt;a Kitchen, a bedroom, the shower room, a bathroom, etc.
&gt;&quot;so is this ship like multiple floors? Am I going to be allowed to explore and get used to my new home?&quot;
&gt;She carries you to what you assume is the flight deck
&gt;&quot;I will sssshow you more of the ship once we make the jump, it will take roughly two of your monthsss to get home&quot;
&gt;2 months? 
&gt;&quot;I thought you said you were going to do a hyperspace jump or something&quot;
&gt;She flicks your Nose casually before pushing some buttons 
&gt;&quot;Sssssspace is vassst, even going fassster than light it takes time&quot;
&gt;She had a point, you know the nearest Star to earth is Alpha Centauri, and that&#039;s 4 light years away
&gt;you stay quiet as you watch her pilot the ship towards the sun
&gt;within minutes you&#039;re closer to the sun than any human had ever been
&gt;&quot;you refuel with Stars? How does that work?&quot;
&gt;she huffs and squeezes you with her coiled body
&gt;&quot;I will not even attempt to explain it to you&quot;
&gt;you sigh and resign yourself to watching 
&gt;the ship orbit around the sun slowly
&gt;&quot;is that Mercury?&quot; you ask pointing 
&gt;&quot;what is Mercury Beast?&quot; she says looking at the planet your pointing to
&gt;&quot;uh the planet closest to our star, No human has been there or seen it like this&quot;
&gt;She makes her hissing laugh again
&gt;&quot;Backwards little species, still haven&#039;t explored your own backyard&quot;
&gt;You frown and place your hands on her scaled body
&gt;Smooth, and faintly warm
&gt;As she goes back to refueling you find yourself running your hands on her scaled flesh
&gt;Like a snake&#039;s scales but softer
&gt;The ones on top of her body smoother and softer than the rougher harder scales that contact the floor
&gt;what do the ones on her hood feel like?
&gt;you reach upwards and touch the back of her hood softly
&gt;she swats your hand away
&gt;&quot;Sssssstop it beast! Keep your appendages to yourssself!&quot;
&gt;you frown
&gt;&quot;I could say keep your mouth to yourself! No more nutrients for you&quot;
&gt;She stops and locks onto you with her amber eyes
&gt;a scaled hand grabs your arm and pulls it to her hood
&gt;&quot;fine Beasssst, although I do not know what you hope to accompplisssh with your needlessss touching&quot;
&gt;you rub her scales gently
&gt;&quot;If we are going to be stuck on this ship together I want get to know you&quot;
&gt;As you rub the edges of her hood she breathes sharply
&gt;oh? A reaction maybe?
&gt;you rub up and down her hood gently
&gt;her breathing gets deeper 
&gt;&quot;E-enough of that! Let me work&quot;
&gt;She pushes away your hands and gets back to pressing buttons on a console
&gt;Well now, looks like you had a secret weapon for later

&gt;You watch in silence and she types away and occasionally looks at the screen
&gt;Space travel! It was truly fascinating
&gt;Your whole life you had been told you were born too late to explore the world but too early to explore the universe
&gt;Guess the memes were wrong, you were getting to explore
&gt;The ship begins taking in something from the sun, particles you don&#039;t understand and Celeste wasn&#039;t about to explain to you
&gt;Here you were wrapped in the lengthy body of a space alien, getting ready to depart your world for who knows what
&gt;But it doesn&#039;t matter to you in the slightest
&gt;You were about to see the galaxy 
&gt;And for lack of better words; boldly go where no man has gone before
&gt;Cue fucking Star Trek Music
&gt;Although you&#039;re feeling more like Kirk than Picard
&gt;Honestly Kirk was a horndog of the utmost degree
&gt;You just happened to find, or rather be found, by an alien who thinks you provide &quot;nourishment&quot;
&gt;Could be worse, she could have frozen you in carbonite or something
&gt;&quot;So what do you do for fun around here Celeste?&quot; you ask, still rubbing at different parts of her long body
&gt;She ignores you and continues pressing buttons
&gt;You&#039;re about to ask again when you notice the ship is moving, turning in space
&gt;With a final press of a button the sun disappears
&gt;&quot;Are we going to do that thing you said? Hyperspace?&quot;
&gt;&quot;We have Beast, the ship is already taking us home&quot;
&gt;It&#039;s a lot less cool than you imagined, or rather what media showed
&gt;Instead of stars zipping by as streaks, they barely move at all
&gt;What a let down
&gt;You feel an additional coil around your waist and you’re dragged out of the room by Celeste
&gt;&quot;I cultivate plantsss and try to make amends for my crimesssss&quot; she says dragging you up a ramp
&gt;Again she has said something about crimes or punishment
&gt;How she is able to move so gracefully while carrying you is beyond you
&gt;But then again Snakes have muscles on top of muscles on earth and here you were dealing with a giant one
&gt;You&#039;re pulled into a large room filled with ...things
&gt;You guess plants but they are of all different shapes, sized and colors
&gt;And it looks like some even have teeth
&gt;&quot;What is all this Celeste?&quot;
&gt;She hisses angrily at you
&gt;&quot;You will call me by my full name Beassst, and thissss is my work&quot;
&gt;She plucks a fruit from a thing nearby
&gt;&gt;&quot;Ingesssst thissss&quot; She says shoving the large yellow fruit into your mouth
&gt;Without much of a choice in the matter you bite into it and swallow a bit of the fruit
&gt;Immediately your entire body goes limp
&gt;Did she poison you? You aren&#039;t in pain or anything just unable to move
&gt;&quot;Hmm Intersssssting. I did not expect that reaction&quot; she says as she sets you on the ground
&gt;You fight to move and eventually after about 5 minutes you&#039;re able to move, albeit sluggishly
&gt;&quot;And you are able to recover quickly from it, you speciesssss is quite odd&quot; 
&gt;You see her tapping at a tablet like device
&gt;&quot;What was that!?&quot;
&gt;You can’t tell but it looks like she is smirking behind her pad
&gt;&quot;The tree of those fruits is carnivoussss&quot; she says pointing to the plant
&gt;All over its base are little nubs squirming in your direction
&gt;&quot;The fruit hasssss a muscle relaxant like nothing I have sssseen before, prey animals eat the fruit and are bound by the plant and digesssssted&quot;
&gt;You stare at her in disbelief
&gt;&quot;You were going to feed me to a PLANT?!&quot;
&gt;She gives a hissing laugh
&gt;&quot;You are ussssseful and I have rendered the plant harmlesssss, but you recovered much quicker than its typical prey&quot;
&gt;For the time being you guess that&#039;s a compliment
&gt;&quot;Warn me next time&quot; 
&gt;She&#039;s slithered over to you and begun coiling herself around you once more
&gt;&quot;That would ruin the fun&quot; She hisses in an almost singsong tone
&gt;Great, you&#039;re a lab rat
&gt;But surprisingly your body feels great, you suppose that had to do with the muscle relaxant 
&gt;You feel a clawed hand feeling your hair
&gt;&quot;You will help me with my research, you are more than enough to compensate and end my exile, but I will get back my prestige as well&quot;
&gt;Twisting around to look at her, you try to move her hand away from your hair
&gt;As oddly nice as it felt you weren&#039;t in a mood to be pet
&gt;&quot;What do you mean exile? What were you exiled for?&quot;
&gt;She continues scratching your hair
&gt;&quot;I tried to introduce a new heating ssssystem, however I did not know the head of the counsel would try to use it while using a, what did you call it? Sssssshower?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yea, and let me guess she got electrocuted and died?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes, they blamed me for not giving &quot;fair warning&quot;. Who would be dumb enough to use an electric heater in a shower?&quot;
&gt;Apparently the &quot;head of the counsel&quot;
&gt;Whatever
&gt;&quot;So you were exiled and forced to find stuff to help your kind?&quot; you ask as she drags you around
&gt;She carefully attends to each plant she passes
&gt;&quot;Yessss, and you are an exceptional find, no other species produces heat like you and can use our transsslator implantsss&quot;
&gt;She looks at you with what you assume is sadness in her eyes
&gt;&quot;Will you help me Anon? I want to go home&quot;
&gt;She actually used your name, and ASKED 
&gt;&quot;Yes Celeste, Just show me around and please stop calling me beast ok?&quot;
&gt;You feel more coils around you, steel like muscle wrapping around your body
&gt;And finally her arms wrap around you in the most constricting hug ever
&gt;&quot;Thank you, come, I will shower you the rest of the ship&quot;
&gt;And with that she drags you around showing you the rest of the ship
&gt;A workout area to fight bone density loss
&gt;Another food making area with more advanced looking parts hooked to a computer
&gt;&quot;Sssssome of your earth food is amazing, you will make it here for me&quot;
&gt;Nice
&gt;You were a chef, body heater, lab rat for a giant space snake
&gt;Could be worse



Chapter 3: SPACEEEEE
&gt;It&#039;s been about 3 weeks since you had been abducted by Celeste on from earth
&gt;You helped her test her various plants and their effects on you
&gt;Most did nothing, which confused Celeste; some were just spicy
&gt;Apparently capsaicin is a rare thing in the rest of the Galaxy and the fact you were able to just eat it without any real negative effects blew her mind
&gt;In fact you had been using some of them plants to flavor up some of the meals you created using her more advanced food system
&gt;Her ships database had downloaded the internet
&gt;Literally ALL of the internet
&gt;So you were able to pull up foods from the internet and create food for yourself and her
&gt;Turns out she likes some weird things, like fermented seafood
&gt;She encouraged you to make warm foods usually, and she almost always was wrapped around you in some sense
&gt;Her ship had a &quot;workout area&quot; which was basically a slow treadmill
&gt;When you sped it up to a decent jog speed, about 5 MPH it blew her mind
&gt;When you were able to keep that speed for 40 minutes she thought it was a fluke
&gt;She said no creature should be able to go that fast for that long
&gt;After your run, you pulled up the fact that humans were Pursuit predators on the internet the ship downloaded 
&gt;She poured over the pages, astounded at humanities resilience and stamina
&gt;But you never figured out why your sweat and scent drove her crazy
&gt;Maybe the pheromones? You recall reading something about that and snakes
&gt;It doesn&#039;t matter though because every chance she got she would wrap you up and suck you off
&gt;You couldn&#039;t complain though, not like your sex life on earth was great
&gt;At the moment however you&#039;re in her botany lab picking various fruits and veggies
&gt;A few of the ones with teeth and tentacles you actively avoided
&gt;Why does a plant need tentacles?! You had seen enough hentai to know what happens with those
&gt;Either way a few of these fruits would be great for making food better
&gt;While the food printer (that&#039;s what you called it anyway) made food very well, it usually tasted a bit off, not quite how you remember it
&gt;So you added a bit of extra spices and veggies
&gt;Maybe later you could try to adjust the gravity in the workout room
&gt;You didn&#039;t want your strength to fade in this lower gravity
&gt;That was another thing you learned
&gt;Earth was larger than Celeste&#039;s home world and her world’s gravity was about 5/6 of earths
&gt;Not noticeable at first but when you tried running the first time you pushed off to hard and flung yourself into a wall
&gt;Not quite like John Carter but still enough to elicit a hissing laugh from Celeste
&gt;You grab an odd looking fruit 
&gt;And by odd it looked like an orange football covered in short cubic growths, for lack of a better word
&gt;Those was one Celeste said she wanted to test on you
&gt;It didn&#039;t look very appetizing though, and the plant it grew on reeked like moldy oranges
&gt;But she wanted you to try it and promised it wouldn’t poison you this time
&gt;A few had made you vomit violently
&gt;Ugh that wasn&#039;t fun at all
&gt;She didn&#039;t tell you what this one would do, but then again some she didn&#039;t actually know what they would do to you
&gt;She wouldn&#039;t admit that but you could tell based on her reactions
&gt;You carry the fruit and veggies into the &quot;testing lab&quot;
&gt;It was the room she originally had you in when she abducted you and installed translator implants into your neck
&gt;You hadn&#039;t thought about that at first, you had just assumed she spoke English very well for an alien
&gt;They did in the Movies so it somehow made sense
&gt;She explained that it interfaced with some part of your brain and how you could understand every language
&gt;But that&#039;s neither here nor there
&gt;You feel a long thick body wrapping around you 
&gt;&quot;Beassst, you have to make me more of that fisssssh after tessting&quot;
&gt;&quot;Beast&quot; was her apparent nickname for you, she assured it wasn&#039;t an insult and more a pet name
&gt;&quot;I will so let&#039;s get this over with&quot; you say picking up the football fruit
&gt;You sigh and sniff it
&gt;Ugh it had to smell like old spoiled candy
&gt;Whatever just get it over with and get your dick sucked
&gt;You bite into it and shudder from the awful taste
&gt;A Mix spoiled cabbage and twizzles
&gt;After 2 more bites you set the fruit down and frown
&gt;&quot;Ingessst it all&quot; Celeste says picking up the frown and shoving it in your face
&gt;&quot;Nope! That thing tastes gross if I eat more I&#039;m gonna vo-&quot;
&gt;You feel it
&gt;It being a feeling, like your preworkout, like electricity running through your veins
&gt;But stronger, SO much stronger
&gt;You grip the table hard and feel it denting under your fingers
&gt;&quot;Beast? Anon?! Are you o-?&quot;
&gt;You look at Celeste
&gt;Urge
&gt;She had hidden those tits of hers for so long
&gt;You want them, you want to see them and feel then
&gt;Fire in your veins
&gt;You Jump on her, ignoring the coils wrapped around you

&gt;Grabbing that white coat she always wore, you yank it hard revealing her whole body to you
&gt;And her rockin tits
&gt;Why she had them was beyond you and she wouldn&#039;t explain but you know you want to see and feel them
&gt;You pin her to the floor as the fire dies down but your painful erection tells you to keep going
&gt;Celeste looks panicked, trying to keep you restrained with her body
&gt;You&#039;re able to just shove it off you as you feel and squeeze her breasts together savoring the smooth scales
&gt;&quot;What isssss this strength? Why is your smell ssstronger?&quot; Celeste half asks and half moans
&gt;As you grope and squeeze, you feel her body spasming
&gt;You found another weak spot on her it seems
&gt;But where was her pussy? Could you call it that?
&gt;You keep kneading her scaled breasts with one hand and begin feeling down her body
&gt;She isn&#039;t resisting at all
&gt;Just panting hard looking at you expectantly
&gt;You feel a clawed hand grasp your wrist and guide your hand
&gt;&quot;Pussssh between those sssssscalesss&quot; she moans to you
&gt;A slight push and they slip apart revealing her wetness to you
&gt;&quot;I have needed thissss since I smelled that mussssk&quot;
&gt;You push 2 fingers into her and feel her clamp around your fingers
&gt;You expected her to be tight but this is something else 
&gt;The smooth scales of her body feel amazing
&gt;As you knead her breast you feel something under your fingers
&gt;A nipple? Poking out from between the scales
&gt;Nice
&gt;You pinch and tease it gently earning hissing moans
&gt;&quot;You Handssss, feel so good” Celeste moans as she begins playing with her other breast with her free hand
&gt;You release her breasts and put a hand behind her hood and pull you mouth to yours
&gt;You press your tongue into her mouth and free her long one wrapping around it
&gt;When she finally breaks the kiss, she&#039;s panting harder
&gt;&quot;The tassste of your musk and your heat isss amazing&quot;
&gt;A long clawed hand wraps around your throbbing erection
&gt;&quot;Remove your garments Anon, I wish to feel you in my most sensitive place&quot;
&gt;You stand up and look over her nude body 
&gt;Her breasts were at least HH Cups, which was unsurprising considering her size
&gt;It’s surprising how sexy she is, considering she was a snake alien
&gt;But that doesn&#039;t matter as she begins to finger herself as she looks up at you
&gt;A long coil of her tail wraps around your leg and you undress quickly
&gt;Within a second you&#039;re back on her, rubbing your hands on her smooth scales
&gt;She moans and rubs your back 
&gt;&quot;Mmmm Beasssst this heat you make is amazing&quot;
&gt;You smile as you attempt to position yourself to push into her
&gt;She grasps your member and guides you to her opening
&gt;&quot;Be careful Anon, I have not mated before&quot;
&gt;You slowly press into her
&gt;The tightness you felt on your fingers was nothing compared to now
&gt;All of her muscles tighten around your member
&gt;If she didn&#039;t have that hood, you would swear she was a constrictor
&gt;Inch by inch, you press into her wetness, eliciting quiet hissing moans from Celeste
&gt;you feel her claws pressing into your back and breaking the skin as you begin slowly pumping into her
&gt;her long tail spasms between your legs and you kiss her neck and chest while you speed up
&gt;The scales of her body are smooth and faintly warm
&gt;the tightness of her pussy is amazing and incomparable
&gt;You had been with woman on earth
&gt;Each had something the other didn&#039;t
&gt;Tightness, wetness, breast size looks, willingness
&gt;Celeste was all that and more
&gt;Her body was amazing and toned, her breasts firm and perky, her willingness to do anything with you was beyond compare
&gt;How could a human woman even compare to her?
&gt;You wrap your arms around her and thrust into her hard, feeling her muscles clench each time
&gt;Her long tong laps at you, licking up your sweat as you kiss her neck and nipples
&gt;Her hissing moans fill your ears as you work hard, drilling your diamond hard cock into her
&gt;Why did you wait so long to do this?
&gt;Respect? Hardly, she sucked you off every day
&gt;It definitely wasn&#039;t disinterest
&gt;Perhaps it was just the unknown
&gt;But you didn&#039;t care now as you pushed further into her
&gt;You feel her clawed hands drawing blood as you pistoned into her
&gt;Each thrust making her body coil and her pussy tighten
&gt;You feel her and kiss her 
&gt;&quot;C-celeste I&quot;
&gt;She cuts you off 
&gt;&quot;Give me you nutrients Anon, fill me with your warmth; your lava&quot;
&gt;You paint her hidden insides white and you release and collapse upon her
&gt;Holy fuck where did that come from?
&gt;You absentmindedly look at the half eaten fruit on the table
&gt;Well now, looks like you found your new favorite food



Chapter 4: Part of that world

&gt;How many weeks had it been since you were abducted? 
&gt;When there are no natural day and night cycles it really messes with your perception of days and time
&gt;But according to Celeste&#039;s ship logs you were nearing her home world
&gt;From what she told you she was going to have to show you off like a prize
&gt;As such you had been working out hard
&gt;What else can you do in the meantime?
&gt;Between helping Celeste with her research and getting freaky with her there was so much free time
&gt;And with her food printer you were able to make all the healthy foods that were too expensive on earth
&gt;As a result you bulked up
&gt;It amazed Celeste
&gt;She sat in a corner of the fitness room on her ship watching you
&gt;&quot;Your body hasssss gotten More muscular in such a short time, how isss this possible?&quot; she asked while watching you deadlift some weights
&gt;Originally there hadn&#039;t been weights on the ship but you asked Celeste to make some 
&gt;Turns out the ships thing that made your clothes also can make other things
&gt;&quot;By straining our muscles with heavier weight, Humans can cause muscle mass to form faster&quot; you answer calmly between reps
&gt;You complete a set and wipe your brow
&gt;Out of the corner of your eye you see Celeste shiver slightly
&gt;She never did get used to your scent or whatever pheromones your body made
&gt;Not that you would complain about it
&gt;Getting your dick sucked by a space snake after each workout was a great motivator
&gt;&quot;Your Body is unlike anything I have seen, Humanity will be a valuable ally to my people&quot;
&gt;You shrug and prepare for you next set
&gt;&quot;Whatever, tell me more about the show and tell I&#039;m being a part of&quot;
&gt;As you grip the bar and begin lifting again she explains in more detail
&gt;&quot;First I will have to show all the plants I have documented and cultivated; explain their uses and how they will benefit my people&quot;
&gt;you nod as you keep working, straining your muscles
&gt;&quot;Then I will bring you out and show you them, you will have to show off your endurance and your strength; then I will explain how your species is useful to my sisters and then hopefully they will welcome my back home&quot;
&gt;She always said sisters why?
&gt;&quot;Hey Celeste, I&#039;ve always wondered, Why do you only say sisters? Are females the ruling class in you society or something?&quot;
&gt;You feel her tail starting to coil around your leg
&gt;&quot;We are all females, the males of our population were wiped out by diseases as such we are all made from a singular genome, so we are all sisters&quot;
&gt;You nearly drop the weights
&gt;&quot;Huh? Wiped out? Why haven&#039;t you like, remade males or something?&quot;
&gt;Gently you set the weights down and walk to Celeste
&gt;Something tells you this is a touchy subject
&gt;&quot;Genetics isn&#039;t that easy Beast! But maybe...&quot;
&gt;She looks you up and down then down at her own body
&gt;&quot;Maybe?&quot; ask
&gt;&quot;Maybe I will discuss it another time, for now I desire your nutrients&quot;

&gt;Without warning a long strong body wraps around your own
&gt;As much as you worked out and gotten stronger in the workout room of Celeste’s ship, she was always a stronger, her tail and body was pure muscle and could lock your body down no matter how you struggled
&gt;&quot;Mmmm no matter how many timesssss I engorge myself on the nutrients you sssssupply, I can never get enough&quot; She Mumbled half to you, half to herself
&gt;&quot;Hey! Wait, in Not don- AH&quot; is all you can say before her clawed fingers have pulled down your pants and her generous maw has clamped down on your shaft
&gt;A soft &quot;happy hiss&quot; is heard from celeste as she coiled her long tongue around your member
&gt;You had learned a while ago what her various hisses and other noises meant
&gt;Now was one of bliss as her nostrils flared and her tongue slowly writhe around your member
&gt;Her strong body clamped down on you as you attempted to pry her off to finish your workout
&gt;While yes you loved having her suck you off every chance she got, you wanted to finish this while you were still in the workout mentality
&gt;But it looked like she got too intoxicated by your scent again, and wouldn’t let you go
&gt;Wet loud slurping noises echo through the workout room as she licks and sucks on your engorged member and her hands runs any spot on your body that isn’t covered by her smooth scales
&gt;Her mouth is hot and wet compared to her cool, smooth scales
&gt;The contrast is amazing
&gt;But you wanted to be a part of this too
&gt;&quot;Let my Arms Go Celeste, I’ll show you how it’s done&quot; you say smugly earning an annoyed hiss from her
&gt;She relents however, shifting her clamp like coils to let your arms through
&gt;You reach downwards and grope her large breasts, squeezing them and eliciting more hisses, however this time of pleasure
&gt;Where were they? Those openings? a little more kneading and you feel her nipples, usually hidden by scales
&gt;Her species had something like inverted nipples, except they were covered by strong plate like scales
&gt;Why her species even had nipples, you don’t know, but you don’t care as you pinch them and pull them out of their protection
&gt;You feel a sharp gasp as her long tongue constricts sharply around your member and she pulls you deeper into her throat
&gt;Squeezing harder her nipples harder, you feel her body shudder as she licks and suck your member, desiring both your seed and your contact
&gt;Her body squeezes you and her mouth clamps down, her long tongue wriggling against you member
&gt;Through the weeks together she learned all your weak points, every little place her tongue could touch and tease to get you to cum faster
&gt;After all this wasn&#039;t for your pleasure, it was for her own desire for your &quot;Nutrients&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ce-celeste I’m going to-&quot; you sputter, earning more frenzied sucking and licks,
&gt;You pinch her nipples hard as you spray your seed into her ravenous mouth
&gt;Her tongue unravels from around your member and snakes its way up and down, attempting to get any last little bit of your seed as it can
&gt;When at last she lets you go, she sighs happily
&gt;&quot;Mmmm you are asssss delicious as always Beast...now go clean yourself! We will be arriving shorty and I do not want your musk disturbing my sistersssss&quot; she said as she pushed her nipples back into their protective scales
&gt;Dang you wanted to play with them more....
&gt;No after sex cuddling with Celeste unless she was tired from the day
&gt;Otherwise it was research and more attempts to end her solitary voyage
&gt;As she slithers off, you notice her hips swaying side to side as she slithers
&gt;Why she had hips was another mystery to you, but it against wasn’t something you were going to question
&gt;Either way, as she slithered off, you headed to the washroom to get cleaned up
&gt;While you thought the idea of the smell of your sweat turning on one snek alien was cool, you doubt you could handle more than one of them 
&gt;And here you were to be presented to an entire population of Females as a living body warmer and nutrient dispenser
&gt;Also the thought of a thousand horny space snake crushing you in an uncontrollable pile of desire to get your dick was enough to make sure you scrubbed your body thoroughly of sweat and anything else that might turn on this odd population of lizards
&gt;You washed quickly, and then got dressed just as quick, not wanting to miss anything that happened with the stars and space
&gt;After all you were the first human that you knew of to go to another star system, meet an alien race and then fuck that alien race
&gt;As you walked through Celeste&#039;s Spaceship you can’t help but marvel at it, it was like a full size mansion to you
&gt;Lots of room, a lab, a workout room, an eating area, a &quot;bedroom&quot; a flight deck, and so many other rooms, it was bigger than the average house that’s for sure
&gt;When Celeste called it &quot;small&quot; it made you want to take her to your one bedroom apartment stick her in it and say “This is small&quot;
&gt;Sure she was much bigger than you in terms on length, but otherwise everything else was the same
&gt;You had seen her slither through a small opening in the engine room with ease, just like a snake on earth
&gt;Your bare feet hit the warm floor as you walked through the ship, heading to the flight deck where you found Celeste speaking to a screen with a nearly identical Snake alien on it
&gt;&quot;-Have returned, I have brought many thingsssss for the empire that will help us greatly&quot; she said to the slightly annoyed looking snake on the screen
&gt;At first, reading emotions on these snake aliens had been difficult, however during your time with celeste you could now read them like a book
&gt;&quot;Thissssss again? Sclaria you have tried to win back the gracesssss more than any other exile, accept that you will never come back&quot; The snake said absentmindedly, looking off screen at something
&gt;&quot;I will NOT, I have found sssssssomething extremely useful to the empire and will plead my casssse once again&quot; Celeste retorted angrily, her hood puffing out in annoyance at being dismissed so nonchalantly 
&gt;You keep your distance, making sure as not to be seen by the snake on the screen
&gt;With a short sight the screen snake replies
&gt;&quot;Alright fine, we will set up a Council meeting again, try not to waste their time thisssss time&quot;
&gt;The screen goes black and you walk forwards to a very anxious looking Celeste
&gt;How do you comfort a big Snek alien?
&gt;Hugs maybe?
&gt;You wrap your arms around her waist, and hug her close, earning a surprised wiggle and hiss
&gt;&quot;B-Beast! Stop that! We must prepare you for the Council meeting&quot;
&gt;&quot;Shush, that can wait&quot; you say holding her tight as she struggles to get free of your grip
&gt;Eventually her struggling subsides and she lowers herself, sliding down through your arms until she is able to hug you back, while her long body wraps around you
&gt;&quot;I jussssst want to come home&quot; she whispers sadly into your shoulder
&gt;Her arms wrap around you and her face buries itself into your neck
&gt;&quot;I know, I’ll do my best&quot; you say calmly
&gt;The council or sorority or whatever it was called didn’t matter to you really
&gt;Would you leave it all behind for a snake alien who was rejected from her home?
&gt;Even if you weren&#039;t enough to make sure she was accepted, you would stay with her, helping her find various things to progress her species
&gt;But you think just being you would be enough or rather you hope you will be
&gt;Warm blooded, a scent that drove them wild and could satisfy them in multiple ways
&gt;All you wanted was to help her and stay with her
&gt;Nothing back on each could top this after all
&gt;See the galaxy, see things humans might not see for thousands of years, walk on new worlds, and at this point, maybe be the one brokering a symbiotic lifestyle between 2 species
&gt;Far more interesting than your dead end job on earth
&gt;&quot;Come Beassst, let’s get ready for our presentation to the council&quot; Celeste finally said, letting you go and unraveling her body from around you
&gt;&quot;How can I help?&quot; you ask earnestly as she slithered to the lab 
&gt;&quot;For now begin carrying the varioussss plants I have found to the airlock while I dock the ship&quot; she said over her scaled shoulder
&gt;When you entered the lab, she began pointing out various plants to be carried to the airlock, then she left you to move them, heading to the flight deck 
&gt;You&#039;re left alone to your thoughts as she piloted the ship to yours and her destiny
&gt;These plants were all wondrous to you, each doing so much and being well, different
&gt;One that made you instantly relax, one that made her instantly sleepy, etc.
&gt;It was all amazing with how plants on different planets worked
&gt;Even the carnivorous one would be useful on earth for pest control
&gt;You dutifully carry each plant to the airlock, preparing for the inevitable
&gt;Even as you feel the slight thud of the ship docking, you feel nervous
&gt;How would these aliens react to you?
&gt;Would they welcome you or treat you like a monster?
&gt;It took a few days for Celeste to accept you were a genuine help
&gt;But that was because she was stuck with you
&gt;Would the &quot;Council&quot; think you were just an animal like she did at first?
&gt;Celeste slithers next to you as you carry another plant forwards
&gt;&quot;Beassst, do not interact with anyone when the airlock openssss&quot; she hissed gently, placing a clawed hand on your shoulder, &quot;Do not even act as though you understand, please&quot; 
&gt;You set the plant down and place a hand on hers silently, nodding up at her as you looked into her amber eyes
&gt;&quot;I will ssssseem harsh towards you at first, it is not personal, but the council is watching and you are a wildcard to them, and your...capabilities must be kept secret&quot; she says apologetically
&gt;The sounds of airlock pressurizing beyond is heard and you take a few steps back behind Celeste
&gt;Better to let her take the reins on this
&gt;But first one last thing
&gt;&quot;Celeste, one last thing&quot; you say calmly
&gt;As she turns around you cup a hand behind her hood and pull her into a deep kiss, pushing your tongue into her mouth
&gt;For a moment she seems surprised, but gives into it as her scaly fingers rub up and down your body
&gt;After a moment you pull away, leaving her panting
&gt;&quot;Beasssst? What? Why?&quot; she moans looking at you
&gt;&quot;For good luck, let’s do this&quot; you say with a smile
&gt;She looks at you for a moment with surprise, then her facial expression goes neutral
&gt;&quot;Yes, Let&#039;s&quot; she says, turning away from you and &quot;Standing&quot; upright
&gt;You ready yourself as the airlock opens
&gt;Time to get this show on the road.

Chapter 5: More For Show

&gt;Even after you got led through the airlock into a waiting area, Celeste ignores you; directing the various other snek aliens carrying her discoveries so she could present them.
&gt;Totally ignored, you set the ceramic pot down near the others and head back to the ship to grab another.
&gt;Although she warned you, it was still a bit difficult to be treated so coldly by Celeste.
&gt;How could it not be?
&gt;You had spent nearly every hour of every day with the odd space snake for so long.
&gt;Seeing her direct the grunts while ignoring you completely took the wind out of your sails.
&gt;She was relying on you to get her home, yet you were being treated like a beast of burden.
&gt;After your 4th trip, you feel a long tail wrap around your leg gently.
&gt;Her strong, scaled tail is pulling you to her softly.
&gt;You let it pull you, and end up face to face with a concerned looking snek.
&gt;&quot;Beasssst.....Anon; I am sorry for how I must treat you, forgive me later&quot; she murmurs to you.
&gt;It was hard to accept that apology, but still it was nice to know she was concerned for your feelings
&gt;&quot;What are you doing to that animal Sssscalara?&quot; Comes an annoyed hissing voice, causing her to snap upright and push you away from her.
&gt;&quot;Thissss species works well when given physical support from time to time&quot; She hisses casually, motioning to you coolly with a clawed hand.
&gt;No time to fight it, you continue working to support her like a drone. 
&gt;You pick up a particularly heavy plant and carry it past the inquiring viper, who stares in disbelief.
&gt;&quot;You tamed this thing? How? Its strength is absurd” the alien says, watching you carry the large tree.
&gt;&quot;It requiresssss positive motivation on a physical level, if you give it what it wantssss, it will do anything for you&quot; Celeste hisses calmly 
&gt;Sounds much colder than it really is, but you understand.
&gt;It takes a little while for you to move everything, even with Celeste and the other snakes it takes a close to an hour.
&gt;As you worked diligently you see a few snakes staring at you.
&gt;How long have the snakes been watching you?
&gt;Not your place to care.
&gt;What concerned you is how long Celeste had been trapped in solitude, traveling from planet to planet.
&gt;It doesn’t take long to get everything assembled and ready, various plants all on display.
&gt;You&#039;re left alone with the plants as the extra hands slither past Celeste, wishing her good luck on being re-accepted into this odd viper society. 
&gt;She stares at you with an odd face
&gt;A mixture of sadness, and of excitement.
&gt;You knew why.
&gt;How she was treating you must be a burden, but there was also the excitement of how she might finally reverse her banishment.
&gt;It all hinged on you; even you could see that, after all those attempts to get back in with whatever else she found, you were the one difference.
&gt;You give her a pained smile, hoping it doesn’t show through that you were as concerned as she was.
&gt;You promised to help her, you gave your word to get her back into this all female society
&gt;And you weren’t going back on that promise.
&gt;The floor shifts with a creaking groan and starts to raise quickly, so you stand up straight in your best power pose.
&gt;Guess you are on an elevator.
&gt;The ceiling above you opens, revealing a large see through dome that shows the openness of space and the surface of a small green and blue planet.
&gt;The floor comes to a stop as you observe your surroundings.
&gt;A chamber, like the ones you saw on TV of the UN council.
&gt;Raised seating overlooking the floor you were standing on amongst the plants, snake aliens look down at you with varied looks on their faces.
&gt;Some were bored, some confused, and some interested.
&gt;You could only tell because of all the time you spent with Celeste, learning her facial expressions and quirks.
&gt;Scanning upwards, your eyes fall on a single snake on the top of the seating, in what you would assume is the equivalent of a throne.
&gt;Her coloring is different from the others, neon blue and bright orange.
&gt;She leans against a cushioned armrest, her head supported by her clawed hand with a face of bored annoyance.
&gt;That must be the empress or whatever title they use here.
&gt;But you’re snapped away from her as you see Celeste slither out of a doorway to a podium
&gt;&quot;Esssssteemed Vipers, I, Celeste Knes Sclaria, have returned to appeal my Exile. I have traveled to many systems and found many, many things that will be useful to the empire&quot; She says, her voice magnified by some sort of microphone
&gt;She motions outwards towards you and her various discoveries
&gt;&quot;I have picked out the very best things to show you, and you will not be disappointed&quot; she says cheerfully looking back to the crowd.
&gt;Some of the snakes have been looking with interest at the plants, but you feel one set of eyes fall on you.
&gt;Then another, and another as they look past time plants.
&gt;So many slitted eyes focused on you. 
&gt;Celeste begins her presentation, going through each plant, where she found it, and what it can do.
&gt;Each is accompanied with a video, or her testing them on herself, and then testing them on you.
&gt;The snakes focus on the parts where you are featured, some whispering to each other.
&gt;It’s about 30-40 minutes of you being eyeballed while Celeste goes through her various discoveries
&gt;&quot;And Lasssst but not leassst&quot; She starts, flipping to a picture of you and Earth.
&gt;&quot;Isssss this lifeform, from Sol system, Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. He is a curiosity and of great use to us&quot; She says motioning to you
&gt;The video changes to you lifting and working out, as well as an elapsed time video of you running
&gt;&quot;Highly intelligent, strong, and with near boundless stamina, they are perfect for integration into our empire&quot; She says with a fanged smile
&gt;You see the head snake stop looking at her claws to look at you with barely any interest
&gt;Frowning slightly, you motion for Celeste; who gives you a terrified look.
&gt;You do a lifting weight motion at her and smile.
&gt;&quot;Oh uhm....He isssss also a creature of habit with great time awareness! The motion he just did is to say it’s time for his fitness regime&quot; She says, tapping a few buttons on the podium.
&gt;She has seen you work out, and knows what to make with her little nanites.
&gt;A weight bench appears along with various weights and a bar.
&gt;Ignoring her now, you focus on this.
&gt;A show of strength might just help.
&gt;You set weights on your bar, more than usual.
&gt;No time to limit yourself now, as you carry the weights to the bar and set them on it with ease.
&gt;But you had learned what some of the symbols of Celeste’s alien language meant as you carried the weights to the bench press bar.
&gt;You could hear astonished gasps, as you place the weights on the bar and begin doing reps slowly.
&gt;Celeste continues with a bit of unease in her voice.
&gt;&quot;A-asssss you all can see this species is very strong and hardy. They are smart and willing to work with the right motivation&quot; she says with false calmness.
&gt;You&#039;re pretty sure you’re the only one that can recognize the insincerity in her voice as you lift more than you ever had before; determined to get her home.
&gt;&quot;And of course I have left out a few surprises from this species!&quot; Celeste says happily, swapping to a thermal view of you &quot;This species, is smart, strong, obedient and best of all &quot;Warm blooded&quot;&quot; she says as the thermal imaging settles on you.
&gt;You sweat angrily, trying to work out the annoyance of how Celeste treated you so coldly, yet with understanding of her position.
&gt;You can see your body heat on the screens.
&gt;As you work out for the snakes, your body temperature rises; earning gasps that you were sure you weren’t supposed to hear.
&gt;&quot;And for a few final points&quot; Celeste says over the audiences gasps.
&gt;&quot;This species might be able to breed with us, with a little modification&quot; she says calmly, looking at the crowd.
&gt;Wait what? You nearly drop the bar and look to her in confusion.
&gt;Breed? What the fuck?
&gt;No time to linger on it.
&gt;&quot;You wissssssh us to mate with these undignified thingsss?&quot; Comes a shout from the crowd
&gt;You can hear the smugness in Celeste’s voice as she answers
&gt;&quot;No...Because they are not undignified, he can understand everything we are saying, and can speak to us clearly&quot; She says; you assume she has made some over the top flourish, so you toss aside the weight bar, which cracks the floor with a loud crunching noise.
&gt;Slowly, you stand up and look at the crowd of snake aliens a small smile across your face
&gt;&quot;Hi&quot; you say calmly
&gt;Satisfaction courses through you as your audience recoils back and together, all looking at you with awe.
&gt;&quot;I’m Anon, how’s it going?&quot; 
&gt;The entire council or whatever it’s called recoils collectively, a group so surprised they nearly act as one.
&gt;&quot;It speaks!” ”It’s Sapient!”, &quot;What?!&quot; 
&gt;All phrases and words tossed out.
&gt;Not your fault they couldn’t figure out that you were smarter than the average bear.
&gt;You give a small side eye look to Celeste with a small frown. 
&gt;She would pay for this surprise later, with her throat or with her slit.
&gt;But for now you focus on the crowd, and revel in the fact that this is the most attention you&#039;ve ever gotten.
&gt;Earth had its advantages to be sure, you being important wasn’t one of them though.
&gt;On Earth, you were nothing and no one.
&gt;Here you were an ambassador of your species.
&gt;A voice calls out to you
&gt;&quot;You underssssstand us?&quot;
&gt;You nod and somehow your voice if magnified.
&gt;&quot;I understand&quot;.
&gt;More gasps from the aliens, who seem totally shocked that you stand before them.
&gt;You look up at the queen, or whatever her title was, and smile coldly.
&gt;She no longer has a bored look on her face, instead she has one of concern and interest; staring at you coldly.
&gt;You stare right back with unwavering loyalty to Celeste.
&gt;Didn&#039;t matter if she got back in or not; you were going to stay with her regardless.
&gt;&quot;Thissss species might be the solution! Warm blooded, strong and most of all; willing&quot; Celeste’s voice calls out above the din of murmuring voices.
&gt;You look outwards to the various snakes and see a mix of contempt and joy.
&gt;And you feel the same.
&gt;It was a joyous that you and the rest of humanity might be able to save this species.
&gt;It was contempt that before Celeste&#039;s words, they thought of you as nothing more than a beast of burden.
&gt;But not every eye was upon you, with a cold eagerness.
&gt;&quot;It can replace our malesssss?&quot; 
&gt;You wish you could identify the voice in the crowd of stares, but reality says otherwise as you look to the wall of flabbergasted faces.
&gt;&quot;Thisssss species is strong, masculine, and they have more than enough abilities to replace our males&quot; comes Celeste&#039;s answering voice.
&gt;&quot;However. It comes at a sssslight cost&quot; She says with a small grimace you doubt anyone else would see.
&gt;&quot;Humanity emits a pheromone that is irresistible to us Viperssss&quot; she hisses coolly “I cannot resist it, and I doubt any of you can either&quot;
&gt;Hushed voices, words you can&#039;t make out.
&gt;She had tried so many times to get back into this crooked empire. 
&gt;You weren’t going to screw this up now.
&gt;&quot;Thank you for your presentation Ssssclaria, the council will deliberate your fate&quot;.
&gt;Celeste bows low and slithers onto the floor you were on, away from her podium.
&gt;As the floor sinks down slowly, you wave happily to each snake that you notice looking at you.
&gt;Fuck it, even if it wasn&#039;t the same across species, you could try a bit of friendliness.
&gt;As the ceiling closes above you, you look to Celeste, who stares at her notecards.
&gt;&quot;Celeste?&quot; you call to her.
&gt;She jumps slightly and drops her cards, then slithers over to you.
&gt;&quot;B-beasss - err- Anon I think that went well...&quot; She says worriedly, trying to feign confidence
&gt;You walk to her slowly then hug her waist calmly.
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s get you home&quot; you say softly.
&gt;You feel the bindings of Celeste’s tail slowly wrap around your and her arms hugs you close.
&gt;&quot;Yessssss, you did great anon&quot; she says with the same soft tone you had.
&gt;Truth is you just wanted her happy, regardless of what humanity could do for her kind.
&gt;You were content with a life of exploring the galaxy with her.
&gt;The two of you remain in each others embrace, hoping for something positive from this.
&gt;Even after the elevators floor settles, you say holding each other; her loving your warmth and maybe a bit more than that.
&gt;And you loving her, plus the feeling you might actually do something good in your life beyond working a dead end job until you died.
&gt;You rub your face slowly against her soft, smooth scales that lined her mid-drift as you comfort her further.
&gt;&quot;We did all we could, and even if you don&#039;t get back in, I promised to help you get accepted again&quot; you say calmly, rubbing your hands along her scales.
&gt;&quot;We did... And, I thi-&quot; her words are cut off as a door opens; causing her to push you away swiftly.
&gt;You regain a bit of composure from the push and look to see who disturbed your hug.
&gt;A snake alien, wearing a shirt with some insignia you don’t recognize; but it makes Celeste &quot;stand&quot; straight upright.
&gt;&quot;The Empressss, would like to ssssee you&quot; the messenger hisses calmly, not even looking at you.
&gt;Celeste slowly slithers towards the other snake, only for it to hold up a clawed hand.
&gt;&quot;No...No alone&quot; she hisses with disdain, looking at you.
&gt;&quot;Bring the beast&quot;.


Chapter 6: Beware The Beast 


&gt;As you follow this random viper with Celeste, the only sound you hear is your own hard footsteps and your nervous breathing.
&gt;It makes you oddly self-conscious to the point you try to quiet each footfall, but it&#039;s to no avail; the floor is made of hard polished stone, and your shoes aren&#039;t made to be sneaky.
&gt;trying hard to make your foot falls silent next to Celeste&#039;s slithering is just about as possible as you sprouting wings and hovering above the ground.
&gt;Your guide totally ignores you as you walk behind Celeste, but you can see your presence affecting her.
&gt;Her nostrils flare wide and her long tongue flicks out, catching your scent, and each time her eyes flick to you involuntarily.
&gt;This one MUST have some discipline in her, as she ignores your smell.
&gt;Luckily nothing happens as you walk behind Celeste, no coils, no nothing.
&gt;Celeste has grown a tolerance to you, and you can also see her intentionally breathing through her mouth as to not smell your pheromones or sweat from your workout. 
&gt;You walk for what seems like miles, up through the bowels of the station, but all the while you notice something.
&gt;Everything is becoming more and more ornate. 
&gt;It was hard to notice at first, but slowly the sterile walls become marbled white, with columns of sculpted gold.
&gt;The floors shift from hard white stone to a soft, thin carpet like material.
&gt;You&#039;ve taken quite a few elevators are well, and they are the only real reason you know you&#039;re travelling upwards.
&gt;Each one is faced out towards the stars and you can see bits of the station drift down as you travel up.
&gt;The whole time you travel, you feel Celeste against your side.
&gt;To an outsider it would be just a slight touch, but to you, it was as if she was crying for comfort.
&gt;Celeste&#039;s want for physical contact when it comes to comfort is rare.
&gt;You were used to her want for &quot;Nutrients&quot;, but now it was different.
&gt;The tip of her tail wrapped around your leg.
&gt;Her clawed hands holding your arm as if to guide you is a show, she is latching onto you.
&gt;Her nervousness was evident when she accidentally dug her claws into your arm, drawing blood and making you wince.
&gt;When Celeste saw what she did she started to fuss about it, but when she saw your guide eyeing her in distain, she parted from you.
&gt;It hurt a bit seeing Celeste pull away from you after she hurt you.
&gt;But this isn&#039;t about you.
&gt;So, instead of whining like you would have in your past life; your life before being abducted, you just nod at her in understanding. 
&gt;Celeste in turn gives the equivalent of a sorry smile.
&gt;Your guide notices your bleeding arm and gives Celeste an inquiring look.
&gt;&quot;Your pet did ssssomething to displease you? Why have you punisssshed it?&quot; She asks flatly, looking between the red lifeblood seeping from your arm to Celeste.
&gt;&quot;It wassss an accident, I pressed my claws too hard into his skin; guard....?&quot; Celeste answers, probing for the guards name.
&gt;&quot;Guard Mytha, we will need to wasssh and close that before you meet the empress&quot; the Viper guard say as she leads you into yet another elevator.
&gt;&quot;The Empresss?!&quot; Celeste gasps, recoiling back and nearly pinning you against the side of the elevator.
&gt;&quot;Ssshe wishes to... invessstigate your pet&quot; Mytha says simply.
&gt;Your memory flashes to the bored looking viper on her throne.
&gt;So she was interested in you... well, that’s a start you suppose.
&gt;&quot;This thing doesn&#039;t seem to be very interes-&quot; Mytha states as she grabs your upper arm to turn you around.
&gt;As soon as her hand touches your skin, she pulls it back in surprise, then looks at Celeste in amazement.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s...warm? And why do I feel...Odd around it?&quot; She asks Celeste as she places her hand back on your upper arm.
&gt;She gives a small shiver of pleasure.
&gt;&quot;He&quot; Celeste states.
&gt;&quot;What, He? What do you mean?&quot; the guard asks as you feel her tail beginning to wrap around you.
&gt;Luckily, Celeste pulls you away from Mytha, who hisses in annoyance.
&gt;&quot;Anon issss a male, &quot;it&quot; is a he, and be careful around him, his pheromones do...Odd things to us&quot; Celeste states as she pulls you away and literally puts her body between yours and the guard.
&gt;Guard Mytha hisses and tries to sneak her tail around Celeste, who hisses back and bares her fangs.
&gt;&quot;Jussssst let me feel him and smellll him&quot; the guard nearly pleads, her tongue flicking in and out.
&gt;This is now a very difficult situation.
&gt;You are trapped in a metal and glass box, with 2 very large vipers; who are hissing at each other with fangs bared.
&gt;They begin circling each other, hissing loudly with fangs and claws bared; Celeste using her strong coils to keep herself between you and the guard.
&gt;&quot;Hey calm down you two! Uh, we need to go to see the empress or something right?&quot; you call out, trying in vain to defuse the situation.
&gt;The hissing only grows in response to your plea, not that you thought it would really do anything.
&gt;Luckily, you&#039;re saved by the bell.
&gt;Well not really the bell, but you&#039;re aren&#039;t going to argue as the door to the elevator opens.
&gt;Immediately Celeste&#039;s coils foils around you and you&#039;re dragged bodily out of the elevator.
&gt;The guard follows, shaking herself and trying to regain control. Maybe being enclosed in a tight space with a viper who isn&#039;t used to your presence was a bad idea after all.
&gt;&quot;wha...What hassss that thing done to me?&quot; Mytha hisses in confusion.
&gt;Celeste carries you backwards, away from Guard Mytha so the viper can clear her head.
&gt;&quot;Hisss species is unique, it ignites a fire within us, Plus his kind produces heat from within, making them ideal heaters&quot; Celeste explains, still coiling around you.
&gt;You can tell your smell is starting to get to her too as her long body coils around you.
&gt;&quot;Celeste, I need to clean myself and these cuts&quot; you say calmly, rubbing your fingers along the side of her hood.
&gt;Celeste shivers for a moment then drops you, allowing you to catch yourself with ease in this lower gravity.
&gt;&quot;Uh, yes Anon. Mytha please lead us to the nearest med-bay&quot; Celeste demands calmly &quot;Maybe from a distance for your sake&quot;
&gt;Guard Mytha nods, and hisses to herself, eyes still locked on you as she begins to lead the way to a med-bay.
&gt;Celeste ushers you forwards, although you&#039;re once again walking of your own accord, her long body bumps you forwards occasionally.
&gt;As well, every now and then her tail begins to wrap around your wrist, which means only one thing.
&gt;she&#039;s fighting HARD to keep in control; your scent, plus nervousness; compromising her mental state, AND the news she&#039;s going to meet the empress are all wearing her down.
&gt;It&#039;s all getting to her, and she&#039;s fighting to not release that frustration on you.
&gt;If you could, you would hang back from her, but right now that’s not really an option.
&gt;She might be compromised emotionally and mentally, but she was the only viper used to your scent and because of that, she takes you away from Mytha; who writhes and hisses angrily at the fact you&#039;re being kept away from her.
&gt;Celeste casually wraps around you, picking you up and carrying you as what you assume is a sign of dominance to other vipers.
&gt;Celeste carries you easily, just like always; to a sterile room similar to the one you woke up in when you first met her.
&gt;&quot;let&#039;sss fix that arm before we continue up the spire of starsssss&quot; Celeste hisses, noting the blood smearing against her scales.
&gt;&quot;I can walk you know! lemme go Celeste!&quot; you say as you squirm against her coils, attempting to free yourself.
&gt;You see her shake her head as she slithers, carrying you behind her
&gt;&quot;I cannot let you free, otherwisssse your scent might enssssnare other viperss&quot; she hisses, motioning to the various doors.
&gt;It&#039;s at that point you notice doors have been opening and vipers are peeking out, tongues flicking in interest.
&gt;&quot;Oh... go faster than please&quot; you say, attempting to keep your cool.
&gt;&quot;They will not do anything so long as I am here beasssst~&quot; she says in a teasing tone
&gt;You frown and attempt to kick her rear.
&gt;&quot;YOU don&#039;t always think straight when you smell me, imagine what THEY will do!&quot; you hiss quietly.
&gt;Celeste looks back at you quickly, wide eyed in shocked realization at what you are implying.
&gt;A space station full of vipers, driven mad by your scent.
&gt;She instantly speeds up and you hear her hissing curses to herself.
&gt;A group of vipers are now trailing behind you and her at a distance, tongues flicking and nostrils flaring as they smell your scent.
&gt;&quot;Must go faster!&quot; you murmur in alarm as you watch some of the vipers surge forwards, trying to catch your scent better.
&gt;&quot;SSSSHUT UP!&quot; Celeste hisses as she comes to a stop.
&gt;You hear the clicking of buttons and a fizz of electricity, then a door slide open.
&gt;Celeste slithers through it quickly and then it slams shut behind you both
&gt;Both of you give a collective sigh, then she lowers you onto the ground as you begin hear slow thumps on the other side of the door.
&gt;The room you&#039;re in can only be described as a nurse&#039;s office; a cot, a station on the wall for medication, and a machine you think is called a bio scanner.
&gt;The exact name is lost to you at you walk to it; after all the name doesn’t matter right now.
&gt;You hit a green button and feel the thing scan you, then the pain on your arm fades as it seals the scratches from Celeste closed.
&gt;Looking at your arm, you nod to yourself at the closing wound; but are troubled by another issue.
&gt;&quot;How do we get out of here now? I’m not fighting my way through a hundred vipers&quot; you ask as the machine beeps, signaling the healing is done.
&gt;You watch your arm and see the faded slash marks on your arm, looking like old faded scars rather than fresh scratches.
&gt;Celeste doesn’t answer you, instead, she digs her claws into a vent door and yanks it loose.
&gt;You&#039;re about to ask a serious &quot;what the fuck&quot; as she slithers into the vent, her tail wrapping around your arm like a vice and dragging you in.
&gt;You can hear Celeste voice as she drags you like a ragdoll though the vents.
&gt;&quot;Thisss will help us avoid other viperssss&quot; 
&gt;You&#039;re seriously questioning your life choices as she drags you out of another vent onto what you presume is the floor above where you were.
&gt;After being dumped on the floor in heap, you gather yourself and look at Celeste in annoyance.
&gt;&quot;A little warning maybe next time&quot; you say as you rub your arm, feeling like it’s almost been yanked out of its socket.
&gt;She merely gives you a snake like smirk, then beckons you onwards, towards another elevator.
&gt;&quot;This isn&#039;t what I imagined when that guard told us we would be meeting the empress&quot; you say and you massage your arm.
&gt;Celeste looks back at you in mild amusement as she slithers.
&gt;&quot;Oh? What did you expect Beast? Us to simply walk into her chambers? Especially with your scent?&quot; she asks in mocking amusement as she boards another elevator.
&gt;You frown as you get on it with her.
&gt;Of course you had expected some kind of space oddities when dealing with these snake aliens....But not getting dragged through vents like John McClain in Die Hard.
&gt;But as you think about it, you feel Celeste body wrapping around you in a tight hug.
&gt;&quot;We are so close; never before has this happened where I have been summoned by the empress&quot; Celeste whispers, setting her large head on your shoulder.
&gt;Tugging an arm free, you rub the side of her face, gently caressing her scales.
&gt;&quot;we&#039;ll get you home Celeste, I Promise&quot; you say as the elevator dings and the doors open.
&gt;You&#039;re pulled out by Celeste, who has wrapped around you once more.
&gt;It turns out when you don&#039;t need to focus on walking you can really take in your surroundings.
&gt;You&#039;re in a huge glass dome, looking out into the void of space, with the nearby planet and star in view.
&gt;A solid white floor inlaid with gold reflects light from the star, making lamps unnecessary.
&gt;Plants of various types grow along the edges of pathways leading to stage for lack of a better word.
&gt;You note that a few of the ones you&#039;ve brought are already planted, freshly stirred soil surrounding the stems of each one.
&gt;A throne sits atop the stage, with the Empress lounging and looking down at you and Celeste in amused disdain.
&gt;&quot;Again trying so, so hard to rejoin us little sister? Still crawling through the vents like an animal?&quot; the empress hisses calmly, not even bothering to look at you or Celeste, instead more interested in her claws.
&gt;&quot;I just wish to return home&quot; Celeste responds in a pleading tone.
&gt;You see the empress smirk as she eyes her claws, then her gaze moves to you and Celeste with mild boredom on her scaled face.
&gt;&quot;And you think this...thing will bring you back into the fold? It’s no more than an animal&quot; the empress says with a fanged sneer
&gt;Your teeth sink into your tongue as Celeste answers.
&gt;&quot;His kind will help our kind&quot; she almost whimpers in submission.
&gt;The empress sneers and slowly slithers out of her throne towards you and Celeste.
&gt;&quot;A thing? Help us? Don’t make me laugh&quot; the empress hisses in amusement as she slithers her way towards you.
&gt;Your mirth can no longer be contained.
&gt;&quot;Who the fuck are you to judge? Living in luxury like it’s the standard? Do you even understand it’s either my kind or extinction?&quot; you shout angrily, staring down the empress
&gt;She merely laughs at you, her low pitched hissing giggles.
&gt;&quot;That&#039;sss right, your pet talksss... How quaint&quot; the Empress hisses as she coiled herself up in front of you and Celeste
&gt;You feel Celeste’s body wrapping around you as she speaks, a rising anger in her voice as she addresses her sovereign.
&gt;The coils are different this time though, different from when she constricts and drags you places and totally different from when she wants to &quot;mate&quot; with you.
&gt;This is gentle, caressing and careful; ensuring it’s not so tight you can’t move, more like a full body hug.
&gt;&quot;Se issss not my pet, he issss my partner&quot; Celeste hisses, keeping the main bulk of her body in between you and the empress.
&gt;Partner? That’s a new term from her that’s for sure, new but welcome.
&gt;The empress eyes you with annoyance, but when her eyes meet your, it’s a different story.
&gt;You can’t help but feel anger as you think of the injustice against Celeste.
&gt;Exiled because of someone else&#039;s stupidity?!
&gt;&quot;Partner? A beast like this? It is nothing but a pack animal&quot; she empress states matter of factly, with the viper equivalent of a smug smirk.
&gt;You&#039;ve had enough.
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t see you trying to help your kind survive, you want extinction because pride?&quot; you shout, trying in vain to shake some sense into the empress.
&gt;How can someone be so out of touch with the common populace?
&gt;Not your place to wonder as the empress now slithers around you and Celeste, eyeing you both.
&gt;&quot;SILENCE, you know nothing of our kind!&quot; the empress hisses as she looks you over, her tongue flicking in and out. &quot;Your scent is...Pleasurable though&quot;
&gt;You look up at Celeste and she looks down at you.
&gt;&quot;Ssssshall we let her feel your warmth?&quot; Celeste asks you, but directing the question to the empress.
&gt;This gives the empress pause.
&gt;&quot;Warmth?&quot; she hisses curiously.
&gt;Celeste doubles down on wrapping you up, shaking her hips and shoulders against you as she snuggles up to you.
&gt;&quot;Ohh yess he is warm&quot; she answers smugly.
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t know Celeste, I’m just a pack animal&quot; you say with a smirk, staring directly into the empresses eyes.
&gt;This causes the Empress to rear up and glare down on you haughtily.
&gt;&quot;I EMPRESS RIISHA SALLIS DEMAND THIS WARMTH&quot; She shouts angrily, pointing a clawed finger at you.
&gt;You smirk up at her as Celeste slowly unravels herself from around you
&gt;&quot;Feel why he isss my partner...my...mate&quot; Celeste says as she does so.
&gt;Mate? This is the first time she&#039;s called you that; you look up at her and see her giving the equivalent of a smile.
&gt;You nod at her as she pushed you forward with her tail, while still keeping the tip pf it wrapped around your ankle.
&gt;The Empress, Riisha, reached a clawed hand to you and stops just before making contact.
&gt;&quot;Is...Is he safe?&quot; Riisha asks Celeste.
&gt;In response Celeste pushes you her hand, which now rests squarely on your chest.
&gt;Her eyes widen in surprise and she draws her hand back immediately, only to stop and press it to you once more.
&gt;&quot;Waaaaarrrrrmth&quot; she moans as her long body begins to coil around you almost instinctively.
&gt;You try to push the coiling mass away when you feel Celeste’s hands on you and her coils around you as well.
&gt;&quot;Let her feel it, thisssss is our chance&quot; she whispers to you as her and the empress&#039;s bodies coil around you
&gt;Long, strong bodies wrap around you, immobilizing you.
&gt;You can see the empress&#039;s nostril flaring as they intertwine around your body.
&gt;&quot;Sisster... What sorcery have you unleashed? This beast.... His scent is making my body react very... Enthusiastically towards it&quot; Riisha softly moans as her body wraps around you.
&gt;Celeste encircles your body along with the empress, occasionally kissing your body.
&gt;&quot;You get used to it&quot; Celeste says as she snuggles against you.
&gt;&quot;Used to it? I do not want to get used to it!&quot; Riisha hisses and her tongue runs along your chest.
&gt;You see in her eyes that she&#039;s already lost to you.
&gt;Celeste only cements it in place.
&gt;&quot;I have spent week using him for heat AND nutrients, there is no doubt his kind has a place with us&quot; she says before kissing you, forcing her forked tongue into your mouth. 
&gt;You can feel the unhinged jaw widen as you kiss her and one of the bodies wrapped around you tightens sharply.
&gt;&quot;NO! No affection! This is just an...An animal&quot; Riisha hisses, pushing celeste mouth away from you away quickly
&gt;Celeste in turn kisses you again and you feel her hands running down your body.
&gt;Her hands right, not Riisha&#039;s?
&gt;It’s impossible to tell anymore as the two vipers writhe and slither around your body.
&gt;At this point you&#039;re just along for the ride, you couldn&#039;t stop Celeste&#039;s steel like coils so there was no way you would be able to stop both her and Riisha.
&gt;&quot;You mentioned...Nutrients? What madness is this?&quot; Riisha asks as she almost involuntarily pressed against you once more.
&gt;You feel the two vipers tongues flicking against your face and then the bodies loosen around your groin.
&gt;HereWeGO.Jpg
&gt;&quot;His kind providessss delicious nutrients from here Empresssss&quot; Celeste explains as the pair move out of your field of view.
&gt;At this point, all you see is the stars, the throne and a writhing mass of two large viper bodies entangled around you.
&gt;Everything else is feeling
&gt;A hole opening in the coils, hands pulling your pants off and delicately stroking your engorged member.
&gt;&quot;Taste him Riisha, its delicious~&quot; Celeste moans as you feel a hand slowly rub your member.
&gt;One of the bodies tightens a bit around you as you feel a wetness envelope your shaft.
&gt;&quot;Mhmmm just like that~&quot; 
&gt;A long tongue coils around your shaft as you feel the head of your cock, being pushed deep into the empress&#039;s throat.
&gt;For just a moment, Celeste comes into your field of view and winks at you, then disappears again
&gt;The wet feel disappears for a moment.
&gt;&quot;W-what have you exposed me too Sister? i-i c-can&#039;t get enough of his scent&quot; comes the empress&#039;s voice, full of confusion and lust
&gt;Pressure and warmth envelop your shaft once more as the empress in all her dignified glory sucks you off, driven mad by your smell.
&gt;Her moments are odd and erratic, not real rhythm to her head bobbing, instead you get an odd discord of feelings of nearing completion to being annoyed at the slow pace
&gt;You wish you could guide the empress&#039;s head with your hands, but you&#039;re locked down tight.
&gt;&quot;C-celeste! Show her how to do it right! And for god’s sake watch the fangs!&quot; you groan, trying in vain to escape your fleshy prison.
&gt;Almost immediately, the jerky erratic motion of the empress ceases and becomes gentle and methodical.
&gt;A quick yet tight moment begins as what you assume is Celeste hand guiding Riisha&#039;s head.
&gt;A long wet tongue is wrapped around your shaft and warm wet pressure encapsulates your member as celeste guides the inexperienced Empress with words.
&gt;All the while you hear moaning from Celeste; who you guess is aroused from watching; and Riisha, who currently has your shaft deep in her throat.
&gt;&quot;Ssssslowly Empress, go at an even pace&quot; Celeste moans, but it totally ignored by Riisha
&gt;You groan as you feel you limit approach, struggling against your fleshy bonds.
&gt;What Riisha lacks in experience she makes up for in enthusiasm, of rather raw desire.
&gt;She moves with deliberate force, unsure of what to do.
&gt;Because of this you get uneven forces and pressure, awkward pauses in pacing and a hand occasionally clamping down on your member.
&gt;It almost hurts with how the edge nears then fades away simply because of her inexperience 
&gt;Even Celeste, having never met a male before kept a steady pace when you first &quot;met&quot;
&gt;&quot;L-let my arms free&quot; you groan out, wiggling against your fleshy prison.
&gt;You feel one set of binding ropes slowly give slack, then the next as Celeste descends to stop the empress.
&gt;After a moment, you&#039;re there is enough slack to move your arms out of the folds of scales
&gt;Almost immediately they tighten around once more
&gt;Guided by feel alone, you guide your hands to the empress&#039;s head and hood; gripping them gently to guide her.
&gt;Riisha lets go of your member, hissing in agitation.
&gt;What issss your beast doing? Trying to prevent me from absorbing his nourishment?&quot; comes her agitated voice.
&gt;&quot;He is trying to guide you to get nourishment faster sister, he is willing to give them to you, let him guide your movements&quot; Celeste hisses softly.
&gt;The empress relents control to you, allowing you to move her head at the perfect pace for you. &gt;Her tongue slithers up and down your shaft as you guide her movements.
&gt;You can feel her body shivering around you, unused to the heat and your scent.
&gt;Your body shakes as your limit approaches.
&gt;Guided by your hands, you drive Riisha&#039;s face down onto yourself; forcing your shaft deep into her willing and eager throat.
&gt;Everything you had unloads into her mouth; all you worry, frustration and anger. 
&gt;All of it milked from you down a will and happily accepting throat.
&gt;&quot;Mmmmmmmfff&quot; comes a quiet happy moan From Empress Riisha as you pump it all into her.
&gt;Her long tongue laps at your length and you can feel her body shivering and seizing against yours.
&gt;When at last she lets go of your member, she sighs contently.
&gt;&quot;This beast of yours is....tasty....but I have one final test&quot; she says condescendingly, licking her &quot;lips&quot; for lack of a better word.
&gt;At those words you feel Celeste tighten against you.
&gt;&quot;What other test?&quot; she asks with obvious anxiety
&gt;&quot;You say these things can mate with us? Possibly reproduce? I wissssh to test that&quot; the empress states calmly, slowly slithering to her throne and beckoning Celeste to follow.
&gt;Still carrying you in her coils, Celeste follows eagerly behind her empress while you simply pant and catch your breath.
&gt;Empress Riisha comes to a halt in front of her throne and opens a compartment in the arm rest, which she reaches into and pulls out a vial of some liquid.
&gt;&quot;Hold your beast upon my throne, he must not be allowed to move or take control&quot; Riisha commands Celeste, who &quot;sits&quot; on the throne, with you entwined in her coils.
&gt;&quot;My empress? What do you want him to do?&quot; Celeste asks calmly, although you hear the anxiety in her voice.
&gt;You watch as Riisha pours some of the liquid into her hands and then advances on you and Celeste
&gt;&quot;He must not move; this test is....delicate... for me&quot; is her response.
&gt;Huh? Delicate?
&gt;Before you can ask anything, Riisha gently rubs the liquid onto your still stiff member.
&gt;Slippery? She put lube on you?
&gt;&quot;This beast may not use my golden vassal, however he may satisfy me other ways&quot; the empress says haughtily.
&gt;Celeste tightens around you sharply
&gt;&quot;You don&#039;t mean-?!&quot; she quietly hisses.
&gt;What is going on?
&gt;You decided to keep your mouth shut though because you don’t need to pissed off the empress when you are SO close to getting Celeste back home.
&gt;The empress turns, wiggling her hips in an odd shiver.
&gt;Why these snakes have hips you don’t know, but when Riisha pushes hers against your groin, realization hits you like a ton of bricks.
&gt;You watch as she reaches back, spreading her reptilian cheeks to rub against your member.
&gt;A warm puckering asshole rubs up against your shaft as Riisha looks back smugly at you.
&gt;&quot;You think a beasssst would have the honor of deflowering an empresssss? He gets the dishonored trail&quot;&quot; she hisses as she rubs your shaft up and down calmly.
&gt;What kind of odd world is this?
&gt;Anal is somehow a punishment? A dishonor somehow?
&gt;You are at a loss as Riisha slow presses herself against you, slowly letting you penetrate her warm ass.
&gt;&quot;Eempress, Are you sure of this?&quot; Celeste asks apprehensively,
&gt;The empress doesn&#039;t bother responding, instead pushes back against you, rubbing her asshole against your member gingerly.
&gt;Slowly, she pushes the tip of your member into her.
&gt;This isn&#039;t what you were expecting at all. 
&gt;You expected to maybe work out a bit harder than usual and maybe let a viper suck your dick.
&gt;Instead you&#039;re being held like a prisoner while the empress uses you as a dildo to fuck herself in the ass
&gt;Celeste holds you tight as Riisha moves herself back and forth, moaning with and almost eager acceptance.
&gt;&quot;Thissss is pleasssureable&quot; Riisha hisses and she back her hips to yours, making a soft &quot;Plap&quot; sound each your hips meet hers.
&gt;The Empress&#039;s insides are hot and tight as she continues pounding her hips to yours.
&gt;&quot;Celeste, Let my arms Free&quot; you whisper loudly to Celeste, trying to be quiet enough for Riisha to not hear you over the own hissing moans and the clapping sounds.
&gt;Wordlessly, Celeste lets your arms free.
&gt;You immediately grab Riisha&#039;s hips and pull her to you with the force of a high gravity dweller.
&gt;She hisses in surprise as you take control of her movements.
&gt;&quot;B-BEASSSSST! R-releaaasee meeee&quot; she moans loudly as you pull her to you
&gt;Celeste strokes your chest fondly with her writhing body as the empress slowly gives in and her protests turn to gently moaning hisses.
&gt;&quot;D-do not s-stop Beast! I-I It f-feeels good&quot; Riisha quietly moans as she leans her body back against yours and celeste, allowing you to penetrate further into her.
&gt;You redouble your efforts, pulling her harder and harder until the Empress erupts into a cacophony of pleasured hisses.
&gt;She tries to pull away, but you wrap one arm around her chest and the other around her waist, pulling her back to you as you do your best to thrust forwards.
&gt;&quot;R-Release me! I am s-sssenstive!
&gt;&quot;You will misssss the besssst part&quot; Celeste answers, her tongue stroking your ear as she speaks &quot;give it to her my mate, show her why you are such an important discovery&quot;
&gt;You nod as you feel your limit approach.
&gt;Riisha&#039;s weak struggles against you cause her insides to tighten and spasm as she wriggles from the pleasure.
&gt;&quot;H-Here it comes&quot; You groan as you spurt your load into her.
&gt;The empress hisses loudly in pleasured surprise as you feel her with your seed.
&quot;S-Sssssuch warmth&quot; She moans as she collapses back onto you and Celeste.
&gt;You pant softly as you feel Riisha&#039;s hole tightening gently, trying to milk every last drop out of you.
&gt;&quot;S-Sclaria?&quot; the empress pants softly.
&gt;&quot;y-yes my empress?&quot;
&gt;&quot;welcome back to the sisterhood&quot;


Epilogue
&gt;It has been 4 months the Vipers got their space station into near earth orbit.
&gt;At first there was mass hysteria from humans.
&gt;A giant space station appearing in orbit without warning can do that.
&gt;However when all the television screens showed you Celeste and the Empress offering peace between the Humans and the vipers, peace fell once again.
&gt;The vipers integrated into human society, and humans integrated into the viper society.
&gt;Presently, you sit in a room aboard the viper space station, Celeste lazily coiled around you as you play video games.
&gt;&quot;Sssso you make the little man jump on the....armored frogs?&quot; she asks, bewildered at the television screen.
&gt;Turtles, and it’s just a game Celeste&quot; you answer her as Mario throws a turtle shell as a piranha plant.
&gt;Out of a window nearby the earth spins lazily below you, ship and plants leaving ion trails as humanity begins interstellar travel.
&gt;You feel a sense of pride, being the one to help create this alliance that has benefited humanity and the viper so much.
&gt;You don&#039;t even notice Mario dying until you hear the death music.
&gt;Celeste laughs softly and grips her controller now.
&gt;&quot;You have failed to complete the level beassst, allow me to compensate for you inadequacies&quot; she muses, rubbing her chin against the top of your head.
&gt;You smile and watch her try to play the game.
&gt;Who would have though such a space oddity would have changed your life, and the history of two species forever?
&gt;But none of that matter now as you snuggles against Celeste, who is wearing a pink sweater.
&gt;&quot;Hey Celeste?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yesses beast?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Love ya, thanks for kidnapping me&quot;
&gt;She hisses and bonks the top of your head with her chin.
&gt;&quot;I did not kidnap you!&quot; she hisses
&gt;&quot;But I love you too&quot;</textarea>
