Oh, no! Sorry! I have to take this, it&#039;s my work phone!&quot; she says in a panic, passing Lucatiel to Clara.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You watch as Clara calms down the crying cub and Jasmine picks up her phone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s always weird to hear one side of an important conversation.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Huh?

DON&quot;T LET HIM GO!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jasmine hurriedly hangs up and stands up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m so, SO sorry, but we have to go, the BHA found an Anonymous member who&#039;s been homeless for years and is terrified of Anthros, I have to go!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Chick stands up quickly, setting down his half-drunken beer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;OK, let&#039;s go, Jasmine.&quot; He says, suddenly serious.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stand with them and help them out to their car.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As important as this call was, you hate to see them leave.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Clara gives Jasmine a big hug, you shake Chick&#039;s hand, and everyone says their goodbyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jasmine drives, and Chick is in the passenger seat as they pull away...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stand and watch them go.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s a shame they had to go, but finding a homeless guy from the other world is huge.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jasmine had told you the stories of some of the people who appeared in this world.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some appears thousands of feet up, some were babies, some where just children who didn&#039;t understand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You frown, thinking about it as you walk back into the house.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Emi sits with Lucatiel, teasing and playing with the giggling cub.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well, it&#039;s just us now, glad we got that all knocked out,&quot; you say calmly as you sit down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Clara sits next to you and Emi scoots closer to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well now, this doesn&#039;t seems weird at all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One guy with 2 big cats and a cub.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Seems like a weird sit-com...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But it&#039;s your life, and you can&#039;t complain.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Although you can&#039;t see Emi&#039;s dating situation getting ANY better with her living with you...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You know that Clara doesn&#039;t mind that though, and Emi probably doesn&#039;t either.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For the rest of the evening, you all relax and enjoy each other&#039;s company, talking about Clara and Emi&#039;s job as nurses.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The things they see at work is sometimes funny.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sometimes Clara comes home with her fur matted with blood and you have to help wash her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At about 19:00 (7:00 pm), you put Lucatiel down to bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Emi and Clara are sitting and talking to each other quietly about something when you return to the living room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What are you two whispering about over there?&quot; you say as you sit down next to them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They look at you then back at each other.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh god, they&#039;re scheming up something...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well, we were thinking that since you did such a good job moving stuff...&quot; Clara starts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;And because you were so nice to let me move in...&quot; Emi says after her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...you deserve a treat,&quot; they finish together.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If that means what you think it means, then you&#039;re in for a fun night.</div></li></ol>        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Today was a weird day, that’s for sure.
&gt;You hated moving, yet here you were, cleaning out your garage because Clara asked you to.
&gt;And who were you to say no to your lovely snow leopard wife?
&gt;Happy wife, happy life.
&gt;Happy husband doesn’t have a rhyme because no one cares.
&gt;But she promised that she would make it worth your while.
&gt;And she would, that was for sure, she always did.
&gt;And so, you&#039;re sweeping the garage, waiting for Clara and Emi to arrive with the moving truck you and Emi loaded.
&gt;Emi had struck out too much, her last roommate had flaked and refused to sign up for a new lease.
&gt;As well as every guy she dated wasn&#039;t good enough, apparently.
&gt;After you and Clara had a date night with her, she had stuck to dating humans.
&gt;Guess you spoiled her too much.
&gt;Clara had made the decision that Emi needed to move in then.
&gt;While you don&#039;t mind, you wish she would have consulted you first.
&gt;Your spare room got emptied, and the extra furniture was going to be stored in the garage
&gt;Your buddy, the Chickenman &quot;Chick&quot; was coming over to help you move the heavy furniture.
&gt;You offered him his favorite beer &quot;Alamo&quot; and a favor.
&gt;While you weren&#039;t really &quot;anonymous&quot; like he was, you were a third generation Anon
&gt;As such, you were still able to use the infamous Anonymous Network.
&gt;Anonymous members were people, men and women who were transported from their world to this one.
&gt;And they stuck together once they got here, helping each other out.
&gt;Favors for favors, because some people came to this world with much, some with nothing.
&gt;Mechanic had apparently come with an entire vineyard and promptly sold it.
&gt;You hear the telltale vroom of a large truck engine coming down your street, and you walk out the open garage door...
&gt;Here they come with the truck, Clara driving and Emi driving her own car.
&gt;You can see Clara nervously holding her tail in her mouth as she drives.
&gt;Why she didn&#039;t let you drive the truck, you&#039;ll never know. 
&gt;She had never driven a truck like that before, but she wanted the experience.
&gt;Whatever, as long as she didn&#039;t hit anyone or anything.
&gt;You use your arms to direct her to the driveway as she backs up.
&gt;Emi parks on the street behind your El Camino.
&gt;Normally that would be in the garage, but you and Clara’s hobbies were getting in the way.
&gt;Gun smithing equipment took up some space.
&gt;Chick was interested with that hobby, but then again he always had an arsenal on him.
&gt;As well when the mechanic learned that Lilith was barren, he borrowed one of the guns you made and spent all day shooting at targets.
&gt;His silent rage was apparent, he didn&#039;t talk to anyone or do anything beyond shoot those paper targets.
&gt;You couldn’t blame him at all.
&gt;How could you?
&gt;He and Lilith had been trying for a long time, only to learn that something had messed her up.
&gt;How would you have reacted if you and Clara hadn&#039;t been able to have Lucatiel?
&gt;Probably the same.
&gt;Clara stops the truck at your motion, then parks it.
&gt;&quot;Hi, love! I told you I could drive the truck!&quot;
&gt;You smile and nod.
&gt;&quot;You did, good job!&quot;
&gt;She bounds over to you happily and gives you a big hug and a kiss.
&gt;You hear Emi walking up the driveway, sticks cracking under her boots.
&gt;&quot;Hey Anon, thanks for giving me a place to stay for a while.&quot;
&gt;She gives you a hug and kisses your cheek.
&gt;You can&#039;t help but think her doing this greeting for you might be a factor in why her various human boyfriends didn&#039;t stay with her.
&gt;You recall once she actually kissed you in a greeting in front of one of her boyfriends...
&gt;THAT went over well.
&gt;&quot;It’s no problem Emi, you’re like family.&quot;
&gt;As you go to let her out of your arms so you can start moving the small stuff, she grips you harder and gives you a kiss.
&gt;&quot;No, really Anon, Clara said this was your idea, and I really appreciate it.&quot;
&gt;You peek over at Clara with a raised eyebrow...
&gt;She gives you a sneaky smile and a wink.
&gt;&quot;Told you Anon is the best husband!&quot;
&gt;Emi nods while looking into your eyes...
&gt;&quot;Yes, he is,&quot; she says with a happy smile.
&gt;You suddenly feel VERY uncomfortable.
&gt;&quot;Uh, let’s see about unloading this truck...&quot;
&gt;You peel away from the big cats and unlatch the truck&#039;s lock, then slide the door open.
&gt;Nothing too big, a couch and lazy boy chair, her mattress, and a few things you can carry alone, like a table and such.
&gt;The &quot;spare&quot; furniture would be stored in the garage.
&gt;&quot;Babe, where&#039;s Lucatiel? It’s almost her feeding time.&quot;
&gt;You point to a baby monitor on your workbench...
&gt;&quot;She&#039;s napping, I put her to sleep about half an hour ago.&quot;
&gt;Clara goes inside, leaving you and Emi to start unloading the truck.
&gt;You knew that the small stuff was in the front, easy to get and move.
&gt;As you move the small things, you think about how convenient having Emi around will be...
&gt;She could easily babysit Lucatiel now when you had class and Clara had work.
&gt;Granted, she would before, but you had to drop her off at Emi&#039;s place, or Emi had to come to you.
&gt;You hear Emi tapping away at her phone, then hear music start, her phone connected to a small Bluetooth speaker.
&gt;Huh, the latest Gorillaz album? Not a bad choice, but you preferred Demon Days and Plastic Beach.
&gt;As you groove to Damon Albarn’s voice, you hear the revving Of Chick&#039;s Pontiac.
&gt;You watch as he drives it around the cul-de-sac and parks behind Emi&#039;s car.
&gt;Chick and Jasmine get out of the car, a small baby bump on Jasmine as she looks positively radiant.
&gt;The big cats always have a certain glow of happiness when they&#039;re pregnant.
&gt;&quot;Jasmine! What an unexpected surprise! I thought it was just Chick coming?&quot;
&gt;She walks over and gives you a hug.
&gt;&quot;I got off work to help! Couldn&#039;t let Chicky have all the fun!&quot;
&gt;You frown.
&gt;&quot;Nope! You aren&#039;t helping! No heavy lifting while preggo.&quot;
&gt;Chick walks up behind her, his eye patch still on.
&gt;&quot;Told you he wouldn&#039;t let you help.&quot;
&gt;You shake Chick&#039;s hand calmly.
&gt;&quot;Hey man, your beer is in the fridge, let me know when you’re ready to tackle the heavy stuff.&quot;
&gt;He nods and heads inside with Jasmine...
&gt;You follow and motion to Emi to do the same.
&gt;Clara should be done feeding Lucatiel, and you&#039;re sure the mom-to-be wants to play with the cub.
&gt;Plus, you know Emi loves Lucatiel like she was Lucatiel’s mother.
&gt;Jasmine is already fawning over the giggling cub when you get into the house.
&gt;Chick is fishing through the fridge for his beer.
&gt;&quot;Yo, you want pizza? I&#039;ll order some New York style pizza from this local joint,&quot; you call to him.
&gt;&quot;Oh, get me the anchovy pizza! Emi and I love that one!&quot; Clara says as she passes a giggling Lucatiel over to Jasmine...
&gt;Jasmine tickles your cub&#039;s foot paws gently.
&gt;&quot;Yeah man, just get whatever you get, I’m not picky,&quot; Chick says as he sits next to Jasmine on the couch.
&gt;You nod and leave the room, then order the pizzas.
&gt;As much as you want to get this moving stuff done, you still want to relax and hang out with your friends.
&gt;Between Chick and Jasmine&#039;s BHA stuff, you couldn&#039;t get everyone together all the time.
&gt;Even this was a stretch, Jasmine being able to show up was surprising...
&gt;Not that you were complaining.
&gt;Although as your family cat, Scooter, crawled her way into Chick&#039;s lap, you think Jasmine might.
&gt;Scooter and Jasmine had a weird rivalry you thought was hilarious.
&gt;Scooter would smell Jasmine on Chick and because &quot;fuck you, I’m a cat,&quot; would begin rubbing her scent all over Chick.
&gt;You and Clara thought it was hilarious because Jasmine would then &quot;subtly&quot; rub her scent all over Chick again.
&gt;And the cycle would go on.
&gt;Although right now Jasmine was too busy to notice Scooter rubbing all over Chick&#039;s legs...
&gt;You get up and head to the garage again, letting them all catch up with each other.
&gt;Small stuff first, then the medium.
&gt;Before long, the pizza guy arrives and he heads right into the garage, where you pay.
&gt;No need to let your guests see the payment.
&gt;You head back into the house, carrying the pizzas.
&gt;Chick looks like he&#039;s on beer number 2, and the girls are all still talking happily about cubs and such.
&gt;Emi holds Lucatiel, who is attempting to get to Emi&#039;s breasts in her mouth, and Scooter sits in Chick&#039;s lap with Jasmine eyeing her angrily.
&gt;Scooter returns the glare.
&gt;&quot;Hey all, pizza&#039;s here!&quot;
&gt;You watch Clara bounce happily as you set the pizzas in the kitchen.
&gt;The group slowly gets up and meanders over getting pizza and enjoying company.
&gt;After a little while, Chick places a hand on your shoulder...
&gt;&quot;Let’s knock this heavy stuff out.&quot;
&gt;You nod, &quot;Cool, let’s go.&quot;
&gt;Even though chick is shorter than you, you know you can depend on him with this stuff.
&gt;Out of the bedroom comes the old mattress and the old bedframe...
&gt;Into the room goes Emi&#039;s bed frame, box spring, mattress, and dresser.
&gt;Everything else is pulled and stored into the garage.
&gt;Emi helped with most of the smaller stuff, Clara helped organize the room, and Jasmine kept an eye on Lucatiel.
&gt;She was getting the hang of this mom thing.
&gt;You’re finished with the heavy stuff in about 45 minutes, and the not so heavy stuff within a few hours.
&gt;With everyone working together, it went quick.
&gt;You were grateful for Chick being able to help you out.
&gt;You&#039;re sure you and Emi could have done it, after all she was fit and even ran with you when she stayed over.
&gt;But you wanted an excuse to have your friends come over.
&gt;Not that you needed an excuse, but having them over was always a pleasure.
&gt;When you and Chick finish, you go back into your living room to Scooter and Jasmine glaring at each other.
&gt;Honestly, it&#039;s hilarious to see a big tiger gal staring down a housecat, and the housecat not backing down at all.
&gt;But still, you should break the tension.
&gt;You walk over to Scooter, pick her up, and put her outside.
&gt;Sorry kitty, you&#039;ll get some tuna later.
&gt;Clara is already next to Jasmine.
&gt;You sit next to her and Emi sits next to you.
&gt;Chick grabs another beer and sits next to Jasmine.
&gt;It&#039;s a shame Lilith and the mechanic couldn&#039;t come hang out, but Lilith had classes and the mechanic had to work.
&gt;Clara and Jasmine coo at Lucatiel when Jasmine&#039;s phone rings, causing the cub to cry.
&gt;&quot;Oh! Oh, no! Sorry! I have to take this, it&#039;s my work phone!&quot; she says in a panic, passing Lucatiel to Clara.
&gt;You watch as Clara calms down the crying cub and Jasmine picks up her phone.
&gt;It&#039;s always weird to hear one side of an important conversation.
&gt;&quot;Huh? Yeah? NO! No, no, no! I&#039;ll be there shortly! DON&quot;T LET HIM GO!&quot;
&gt;Jasmine hurriedly hangs up and stands up.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m so, SO sorry, but we have to go, the BHA found an Anonymous member who&#039;s been homeless for years and is terrified of Anthros, I have to go!&quot;
&gt;Chick stands up quickly, setting down his half-drunken beer.
&gt;&quot;OK, let&#039;s go, Jasmine.&quot; He says, suddenly serious.
&gt;You stand with them and help them out to their car.
&gt;As important as this call was, you hate to see them leave.
&gt;Clara gives Jasmine a big hug, you shake Chick&#039;s hand, and everyone says their goodbyes.
&gt;Jasmine drives, and Chick is in the passenger seat as they pull away...
&gt;You stand and watch them go.
&gt;It&#039;s a shame they had to go, but finding a homeless guy from the other world is huge.
&gt;Jasmine had told you the stories of some of the people who appeared in this world.
&gt;Some appears thousands of feet up, some were babies, some where just children who didn&#039;t understand.
&gt;You frown, thinking about it as you walk back into the house.
&gt;Emi sits with Lucatiel, teasing and playing with the giggling cub.
&gt;&quot;Well, it&#039;s just us now, glad we got that all knocked out,&quot; you say calmly as you sit down.
&gt;Clara sits next to you and Emi scoots closer to you.
&gt;Well now, this doesn&#039;t seems weird at all.
&gt;One guy with 2 big cats and a cub.
&gt;Seems like a weird sit-com...
&gt;But it&#039;s your life, and you can&#039;t complain.
&gt;Although you can&#039;t see Emi&#039;s dating situation getting ANY better with her living with you...
&gt;You know that Clara doesn&#039;t mind that though, and Emi probably doesn&#039;t either.
&gt;For the rest of the evening, you all relax and enjoy each other&#039;s company, talking about Clara and Emi&#039;s job as nurses.
&gt;The things they see at work is sometimes funny.
&gt;Sometimes Clara comes home with her fur matted with blood and you have to help wash her.
&gt;At about 19:00 (7:00 pm), you put Lucatiel down to bed.
&gt;Emi and Clara are sitting and talking to each other quietly about something when you return to the living room.
&gt;&quot;What are you two whispering about over there?&quot; you say as you sit down next to them.
&gt;They look at you then back at each other.
&gt;Oh god, they&#039;re scheming up something...
&gt;&quot;Well, we were thinking that since you did such a good job moving stuff...&quot; Clara starts.
&gt;&quot;And because you were so nice to let me move in...&quot; Emi says after her.
&gt;&quot;...you deserve a treat,&quot; they finish together.
&gt;If that means what you think it means, then you&#039;re in for a fun night.</textarea>
