            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">[Tags: Human(M) x Anthro(F, Doberman), Oral (Fellatio, Sixty Nine), Vaginal, Cream Pie]</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Too glitzy. Too spacious. Way, way too goddamn expensive. Paige had a multitude of complaints as they carried their luggage into their hotel suite. Even after she had been assured that this was definitely on the lower end of the spectrum for what qualified as a luxury resort, for the doberman this was above and beyond what was required. She would have been satisfied with a three star motel in the nice part of town, yet Shane insisted that she wouldn’t mind once she got used to it. Speaking of, where did that man go? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The short black tuft of hair bounced as she turned to make sure he was still following her. Butch was almost the perfect word to define her, from the way she carried herself, and the toned shape of her black and caramel colored body. Yet it was her body shape that allowed her to just barely defy the word. Ample breasts and eye catching curves chipped away at the raw domineering form, leaving it sculpted to something far more streamlined. It left the impression of might contained within elegance, akin to a jet fighter prepped for launch. Just as dangerous as well, hazel eyes long trained to spot weakness in anything she saw. Paige had a tendency to make rooms full of people antsy just by being around, nervous what she would do with that unimpressed frown that usually decorated her face. A perfect example of a breed designed to be intimidating, this was a woman who could intimidate with a chuckle and a grin. After all, if she was having a good time, that generally meant that someone else wasn’t.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yet behind her trailed a man with a half amused grin permanently attached to his face. It was never unusual to see him with his hand to his chin as he contemplated whatever was on his mind. Compared to the doberman, the calm human was a complete foil. Short, light brown, almost golden hair covered his scalp, slightly wild but definitely maintained. Convincing him to keep it short was one of the few things she had managed to bully him into doing. It was something she preferred compared to the long, metal head style locks he had when they first met. Wide bodied with a touch of softness to it, but she knew that it was just a layer over experienced muscle. It was enough to be disarming to most but still cause surprise when he really started moving. He was few inches taller than her, too; it took a long time for her to get over how it bothered her to look up juuust slightly to keep eye contact with him. Again in contrast to her threatening demeanor, he had a paternal aura to him. The kind who’s sigh of disappointment could pierce complete strangers with spears of guilt.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Compared to their surroundings, she had a feeling they were both under dressed. There were men in the first floor lobby in suits, women on the pool patio in swirling, colorful dresses. And here they were, dressed to go shopping at the local strip mall. It was almost cute how they matched. Both of them were wearing blue jeans, the rugged denim long worn soft from years of ownership. The doberman had stepped into the resort’s tall automatic doors wearing a concert t-shirt for a band he had introduced her too. Countless visits to the laundry had caused it to shrink, but that’s exactly the reason she wore it. It dared and taunted people with how taut it was wrapped around her chest. He, on the other hand, was slightly sharper dressed in his white button up. Her favorite button up of his she noticed, since it was the one that she could undo with a single hand. Seemingly tired eyes caught hers as he noticed her looking him over, and he raised an eyebrow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“What?” He laughed as he tugged a cooler towards the suite’s half-kitchen, mainly towards the fridge, “Too late to back out now.” He teased at whatever complaint she was going to fire at him next. Indeed, for the past three months every thing he had planned for them had been labeled as ‘plain goddamn unnecessary’ by the canine. Yet he would grin, she would sigh, and then things would move along again. Her friends had insisted that he was using his criminal connections to bully her into their relationship, and for her, it was better that they thought that. There was no way to explain that the Paige, Queen Bitch, honestly had feelings for some soft spoken human. After all, she had managed to hide it from them pretty well until just a few weeks ago.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“God, you and you’re damn planning. It’s amazing that shit get done at all.” Paige huffed as her hands clasped onto her waist, hips at a tilt as she once again was throwing sass about. He simply shook his head as he began loading up the fridge with the drinks they had brought along. No way in hell were they about to pay this hotel’s convenience cost for shitty champagne. They both could drink like fish once the ball got rolling, and this whole experience as already a touch pricey for both of their tastes. But she deserved it, and he was paying for it, so that was that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“It’s only because of my plans things get done in the first place.” He chuckled as the last six pack was slide into the back of the fridge. If she had her way, their relationship could have been summarized by a unrelenting challenge of awkwardly dancing schedules as she tried to keep things under wraps. It was stressful in the first place, but now even he could tell she was a lot more relaxed. There was less of a burden weighing on her after the last few days’ events, like she didn’t have to hide something she had long buried.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Closing the cooler then sending it sliding with a kick, he took a deep breath as he looked over to their two suitcases laying in the entrance. The suite definitely had dressers for them to stuff their clothes into, but... Shane looked over to the waiting doberman. He had been horrible to her the past few days. So much waiting, so much restraint. It had definitely been taxing on her patience and will power to put up with all he had asked of her. He wouldn’t blame her if she was more than slightly resenting him at the moment. There was certainly a look of irritation on her face as she waited for him to do whatever it was he thought was more important than her. It softened as he made eye contact with her and smiled, before completely melting away as he started walking towards her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She met him halfway, striding up to him before her arms reached up to wrap around his neck with practiced ease. Their chests pressed together, and his own arms reached down to wrap around her waist. Both human and canine sighed audibly as their lips met. This was why she would have been satisfied anywhere they went; once she was in his embrace, she could be sitting in some dingy dive bar and still be on cloud nine. He was soft, yet by no means fragile. Warm and endearing, but he didn’t busy himself with trying to impress her. Shane was simply himself, and that was all she needed. He wasn’t intimidated by or upset with who she was or how she acted, and was much more understanding than the mountain of people that came before him trying to tame her. The man was her source of warmth, not guidance. She was whole before, but with him, she could relax. There was no need to kowtow to his mental image of her. She, in her entirety, was just fine enough for him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">---</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">When they had first met, she had acted like a stuck up bitch. She was causing a fuss at some bar, that she had been dragged to by a friend. Instead of anything interesting happening, it was just another dive. Sure, everyone there looked like they could handle themselves, and some east coast hipster wouldn’t have the courage to even push the door open to let themselves in, but that could be found in any part of the county. She knew better to openly voice her complaints, but that didn’t mean she was turning down her level of bitchiness. She was bored, none of the guys here looked like any fun, and she was stuck here until her friend decided she wanted to leave. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Even when she tries her hardest to remember, she doesn’t remember how he approached. As far as she could tell, he simply appeared. This long haired human straight out of a cheap 80s cover band had came over to her table. Very calmly, he had asked her to settle down, a bored expression on his face as if he would rather be doing anything else than policing a bar. The doberman didn’t even catch what exactly he said, and reflexively she fired back, “Oh please, go get fucked cock sucker. I’m enjoying myself here.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">To this day, she still shudders at remembering how silent the bar had become within seconds. In an instant, she had known she fucked up. Eyes were on him, and then to her, and then back to him. It was almost out of a movie how still everything had become. She didn’t know who he was, but he was someone of importance. Enough importance to get a variety of thugs and bikers to become deathly quiet just to watch what would happen to her. Within a fraction of a moment, she had gone from some dusty dive bar to the executioner’s block, and there was already an audience waiting for her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The look on his face was hardly any different, completely unshaken by the fact that some random anthro insulted him. In fact, he almost looked disappointed. “Look, I know you’re enjoying yourself, but it’s bothering some folks.” It had been years since someone last had the balls to lecture her, yet there she was, standing at attention, “And when people around here get bothered, they do some stupid shit. So how about you just calm it down a bit? They already do enough dumb shit in the first place.” He had smirked at her, laughing at his own joke. In that chaotic den of vice and violence, there was a single man who brought calm to a storm. And for the first time in years, in the whirlwind of chaos and debauchery that had been her life, she had been given a moment to breath. Everyone stopped to watch on him to deliver judgment, but he was standing there, waiting for her instead. It felt like the world was waiting on him, and he was giving her all the time she needed. It was a surreal feeling, like a mid-game timeout. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Shane Lantry. The local chapter head of the Burning Jackals. Paige had always been a trouble maker, but compared to her the human was a professional, and he had the scars to prove it. A variety of nicks and cuts on his cheek, chin, and neck were testament to many close calls. Still, she couldn’t find it within herself to simply bow out. “Fuckin’…yeah, whatever man, fine. I’ll tone it down. Got any other shit you want to bring up? Or am I free to go?” There were murmurs in the crowd, and she heard ‘this bitch’ more than a few times around the room. The human merely shook his head before grinning wide, “Not at all. That’s all I needed to hear.” As he walked away, she didn’t feel relieved nor worried. That breathing room he had given her, that sensation of a calm, was gone and the bar came alive once more with its usual cacophony of noise. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She was back in her usual element again, yet she was shaken. That man had stripped her of her usual airs of danger and respect, but not to belittle her. In that short conversation, the way he had looked at her was something akin to mutual respect. Despite an environment that screamed to the contrary, in that moment they were equals. She could have bitched and argued, and he would have held court like a king listening to an old friend vent as his subjects looked on. He wasn’t upset or disinterested, and she wasn’t a threat or his lesser. Welcome. He had made her feel welcome, despite having every reason to do otherwise.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It all just left her feeling not only confused, but it was alien enough to make her anxious. For whatever it was worth, it made her uncomfortable whenever she found herself thinking about that first meeting. Time didn’t stop; rather, it stopped mattering. That was definitely not normal. However, every time they did meet, she definitely could feel herself relax around him. She had even caught him glancing her way at a number of parties and gatherings, and he had noticed her returning the favor several times. They were keeping an eye out for each other at the very least. If her at-the-time room mate’s stupid movies were enough to go on, this meant they were all primed and ready to get to the fun part. Of course, it would take another year or so before things would go beyond drinking together in the same room. She was far too cautious and guarded to just let herself trip into a relationship after all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">---</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Back in the current moment, their kiss had become far hungrier. Shane’s hands slipped downward, grabbing a handful of dobie ass and causing her short tail to flick about excitedly. At the same time, she turned her muzzle, opening her lips slightly to allow the kiss to deepen. Her hands grasped at the back of his head, turning and guiding him to properly take advantage of the new angle. The moment she could taste his tongue, there was a muffled groan as they began to wrestle and dance with each other.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Since the moment they had met, Paige always had trouble if not outright refusing letting her show her more feminine side. She always had something to prove, and wouldn’t let herself just be someone’s arm candy. In fact, she had long kept the situation reversed, playing the more dominant role in whatever qualified as her relationships for a time. It was only when they had started spending some private time practicing how to kiss someone of a different species did Shane find the little switch that allowed the doberman to let her guard down and be taken care of. A little tongue action, a small game of grab ass, and that moan would let him know that she was ready to melt into his arms.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The pair stood there for a few more moments, enjoying the simple show of affection. Whenever he teased her about it, Paige would always deny that she enjoyed the act of kissing, insisting it was just part of foreplay. Yet, whenever he would steal a quick smooch from her on his way out, he would catch her grinning like she had just gotten away with something. A surprise peck on the cheek could get her to smirk, but when things are this heated, it was a quick way to get her riled up. Her leg wrapped around his, and she used her free arm to pull herself up slightly against him. The kiss broke as she huffed for breath, her wet nose pressed against his, “How long are you going to make me fucking wait? Lets do this already.” Impatience caused her to finally growl out as she looked up at him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Almost immediately in response, he began to walk forward toward the bedroom, the canine forced to step backwards in time. What made this even more difficult was their mutual insistence to assault wherever they could reach with a flurry of kisses. Paige even was tackling the inevitable task of peeling his shirt off at the same time, bringing a hand down to deal with each button with deft fingers. She goddamn loved this shirt of his, as it almost looked like she was cutting it open with how fast it was peeling off of his chest. Once the last button was undone, her hand immediately slipped past the clothing and pressed against his skin, dragging her nails against his chest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Their march was interrupted by the wall that acted as the separating barrier between the rest of the suite and the master bedroom. Though the couple didn’t seemed bothered much as he pinned the canine against it. She grinned, tugging his shirt off his arms as he gave them to her before resting her head against his chest and taking in his scent. This was her man, after all; being able to indulge every one of her senses with him was part of the deal. She remembered reading in one of the many human-on-anthro relationship books she forced herself to skim through that humans didn’t have the same fine tuned senses as many anthros had, so they usually didn’t have the same responses as anthros when it came to recognizing those close to them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The doberman had a hard time imagining a life where the mere scent of Shane didn’t excite her, and sometimes found herself wondering if she made him feel the same way somehow. Even she worried about it, she knew that the man had a smile he only had for her. It was subtle in a way that she would never be able to explain it, but she was be able to recognize it from across the afar, the look on his face that showed his love and adoration the moment he realized that it was her he was looking at. She would catch it most often when he was busy with something, only to look up and see her. Just a smile almost like any other kind the constantly amused man would make, but the warmth behind it made her heart flutter. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She was distracted from her thoughts when she realized the lights in the suite were going dim. From the golden glitz of an expensive resort to the dull brightness of a bar at closing time. A bit hard to see, but lit well enough to give a sense of warmth and comfort. Turning her head, she could see him messing with some sort of control pad on the wall behind them, screwing around with the lights. “Romantic.” Paige snickered, pushing him back slightly to get some room away from the wall. “I try to be.” He answered, attempting to follow her as she turned around the corner to the bedroom. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Immediately he was stopped by a single finger on his nose and a devious look on her face. “I waited days for this, through all those dumb plans. You can wait a few minutes.” The one finger turned into a full hand as she pushed him back around the corner. “Got it.” He laughed before leaning against the wall, “Call me when you’re ready.” There was a clink of a button being undone, followed by the shuffle of clothing being pulled off, and finally a deep breath of anticipation from the other side of the wall. “Oh, I will, don’t worry hot stuff.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">---</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">After their first meeting, Shane had definitely been left with a lasting impression. His various underlings and confidants were certain he was thinking of some way to get back at that anthro bitch for her lack of respect. Instead, he had found himself kind of obsessed with her. Usually whenever he tried to flex his will, there were whispered chains of apologies and promises that such things would never happen again. That doberman had looked him dead in the eye and talked to him like an equal. She either didn’t know who he was at the time, or she just didn’t give a damn. Unimpressed by him or the atmosphere of the room at that moment. He had to respect that. She didn’t have a thing to prove to anyone there. It had been so long since he had come across someone not scared of him, who didn’t tense up or fold under the oppressing aura that surrounded him. It was a cool drink of water, so refreshing that he wasn’t surprised he had become addicted from a single taste. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">At first, he simply started asking around anyone who knew her if she would be keen to showing up at more events. “Yeah, that one doberman from that one time. Just get her to show up.” He had people convinced he was simply setting her up for something. Even she thought that was the case, but when her friends insisted that turning him down was not a safe option, she reluctantly played along. When she did show up to the first time she had been ‘invited’ to a private party, she was tense. Eyes were on her, like an audience in front of the gallows. Shane began making his rounds, making sure every one of his guests was having a good time. The ruckus of the event slowed as he made his way over to her, everyone trying their best to be subtle as they looked in their direction.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">To their surprise, the moment Paige realized Shane was coming to talk to her, her body language…relaxed? She had been anxious all evening, but when what everyone was expecting to the hour of her proper judgment came nigh, she calmed down. There was a smirk on her face as the man tapped his glass to hers, “Is everything alright? Beer cold enough?” That casual manner of speaking was signature to Shane, yet it felt out of place in that moment. Shouldn’t she be on the receiving end of some form of wrath the way she had disrespected him? He wasn’t surprised that people thought this, but it didn’t feel right. Sure, she didn’t beg for forgiveness back at the bar, but with the way she had handled herself it didn’t feel right to punish her. She obviously didn’t think she had stepped out of line, he thought, so why give her trouble for it?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I’m just fuckin’ fine. You always kill the party whenever you talk to chicks or what?” To anyone else, that response sounded cocky, even mocking, as the canine leaned onto the wall. To Shane, it sounded like an appropriate thing to say with the way all the other conversations died down. Yet she wasn’t even looking their way. Those eyes of hers were on him, and he wasn’t giving much thought to anything else.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1"> “Well, in their defense, it is a bit of an oddity. I usually don’t go out of my way to make sure someone gets invited. Speaking of which, I never caught your name that time back at the bar. Shane Lantry.” He extended his free hand for a shake, that permanently attached smirk on his face. Her eyes darted down to the offered hand, before back up to him as she reached forward to accept it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Paige Taylor. Though, I’ve been called ‘that bitch’ enough times that I’m pretty sure I could use it on court papers.” His immediate snort of amusement was genuine, and from there the small talk began proper. On that cheaply lit back patio, surrounded by dozens of people, they somehow managed to talk with ease. Laughs and calls for more beer were common as they got to know each other proper, and everyone’s guard came down as they realized what had truly happened on that day in the bar. She had impressed him, somehow, and won his respect.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That’s where he learned that she generally bounced between jobs, but at the moment her current job as warehouse security might actually stick, assuming she didn’t, in her words, “really fuck things up, somehow.” And that was how she got to hear it from his own admittance that despite his day job of being the owner of a tattoo parlor, most of the time he was just corralling the local knuckle heads, making light of the gang’s intimidating reputation. She seemed to take it in stride.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1"> Then he started asking for her by name, and she had simply became part of the crowd. “That one bitch the boss finds funny,” she told him she had heard someone call her. “Well, they’re not really wrong,” he freely admitted. They would meet every now and again, sometimes even coincidentally when they would run into each other at the seedy places they tended to lurk in. And every time, they would end up chatting it up, her abrasive attitude hardly affecting his calm and casual attitude.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Eventually, at a party at his own place, he managed to catch her alone in the hallway, between the party and the bathroom. No audience. Well, if there was ever a time… “Hey Paige.” Shane called out, causing her to turn around. He watched her usual scowl peel off at the sound of his voice, and she was smirking by the time she was facing him. “I was thinking that instead going through your friends any time I wanted to hang out, it would probably be smarter to just get your number. You know, so I can let you know whenever something is going to go down.” Even looking back, that was probably the most poorly delivered lie that ever came out of his mouth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The doberman had looked him right in the face, snorted, and pulled out her phone. “Whatever you say, jack. Saves me the trouble of asking for yours. For getting into these parties you throw, of course. No other reasons.” They shared a knowing look, a nervous chuckle, and after a moment a glib, their numbers. Paige managed to pull her eyes away from him, looking through the crack of the door next to them. His bedroom, of course she had found herself looking into his bedroom. Then her facial expression changed from one of embarrassed amusement to something that looked like a combination of surprise and doubt, and she pushed past him and past the door. “Don’t fucking tell me that’s the goddamn book.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Shane was immediately confused as to why she was suddenly dashing into his room, much less talking about some book. Well, he couldn’t just leave her alone, and he followed behind her. “What are you going on about-” He was stopped dead in his tracks as she sat there flipping through his evening reading material for the past few weeks. A moderately size paperback, with a purposely nondescript cover that only had black title text on a blue backdrop. ‘Fur &amp; Skin: An Encyclopedic Guide to Cross-Species Romance.’ Currently the best selling guide on human/anthro relations, and otherwise known as the ‘little blue book of banging,’ among other equally low brow nicknames. He had gone out of his way to make sure no one knew he had a copy, heading to a bookstore three hours away after calling ahead to make sure they had it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And now there was a doberman skipping through all the pages, hopping from each bookmark tag to the next. And she had a growing grin on her face with every stop she made. “This fucking book. I had to buy this shit online, couldn’t find a single copy anywhere. Let’s see here…” the pages flicked against her thumb as she skimmed to the next colored tag that was sticking out from the pages. “Oh, this is where I left off last night. ‘French kissing a canine.’ From the looks of it, you’ve studied up.” She put the book back into its semi-hidden spot on the shelf of his night stand. “Up for some practice?” Paige strutted over, doing something he had never seen her do before; swing her hips.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He didn’t know what to do, or how to defend himself, so he went with the first joke that came to mind as he watched her walk up to him. “…You can read?” “Jesus fucking Christ, fuck you.” In that moment, he saw it in her eyes; she was considering cold clocking him and leaving him on the floor. He had seen her do it to other people, and knew she had put down larger men than him. Instead, she wrapped her arms around him, “This is good an excuse as any to get this ball finally rolling, so I’m going to goddamn use it. So go hang a sock on that door, study buddy.” She growled into his ear, her thumb nail scratching against the side of his neck before pushing him back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It was in that moment Shane wished he knew the exact location of every sock he owned, since he was coming up distinctly sock-less. Looking around, he improvised with the first serviceable option he saw; grabbing a bright red baseball cap, he almost jumped over to the door, reaching around and blindly feeling until he felt the loop of the cap catch on the door knob on the other side. In the rush to pull the door close, there was a definite slam that surely somebody heard. He was too busy locking the bedroom to care about that, though. With the metallic click of a lock settling, he turned around to see what the doberman was up to in the ten seconds he had been occupied.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">---</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">There was a moment of tense stillness, Shane listening to her breathing from around the corner. She had done this before, so he wasn’t that worried. This was just he sound of her gathering confidence. He had heard it a few times in their relationship, and he opted to lean against the wall, smiling to himself as he waited for her to collect herself. After one more sigh, he turned to look at where she stood on the other side. Sounds like she was just about ready with whatever she had in store.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“God, still can’t believe I bought these. Get over here before I rip this shit off.” Her flustered tone had set some idea of what waited for him, but even then he couldn’t have fully prepared himself for the sight that awaited him. He was beginning adjusted to the dimness of their suite, but he didn’t need to much light to see how well white lace contrasted against her dark fur. It almost glowed in the low light of the room, and the doberman in front of him biting in her lips in embarrassed frustration was hard to pull his sights off of.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Dancing lines of silks wrapped around her body, the curling vines becoming less dense and revealing more of the rising patch of caramel fur that covered the underside of her bountiful breasts. She hardly would need to try to rip the straining bra off, the material straining to keep both her chest and all her muscle toned body in. It was too dark to see, but he was familiar enough with her body to know that the black nipples of her soft mounds were teasing just over the brim of her lingerie.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">His eyes traced downwards, and her lace panties were having just as much trouble as her bra. They weren’t undersized, but damn if they weren’t meant to look that way. The almost silver looking material hugged against her waist before dipping down with direction of his gaze. White mesh squeezed her fur, giving her a layer of color that was likely more effective for someone without a fur coat. Still, it’s main feature worked just as well; a single, stretched diamond of solid material slipped up from between her legs. An exaggerated promise of what laid beneath.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It must have killed her to buy lingerie. This was the woman who either wore a sports bra or no bra, and he had seen her spend more than one whole weekend completely topless. He had trouble imagining the scene, her walking into some lingerie store, stomping up to the desk, and demanding ‘something good and fucking sexy.’ She always had a way with describing what exactly she wanted. Judging from the look on her face, she was having second thoughts about whether or not she got what she had asked for.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Shane closed the distance in a single stride, wrapping his arms around her waist once more. Fingers dug into her toned cheeks while his thumbs hooked under the brim of the sheer panties. “White, babe?” He teased as he leaned in to nip at her lip, “You said you’d never wear white.” As he poked fun at her choice in lingerie color, she brought her hands up to the neck of his open shirt.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“The chick at the store insisted on it.” She explained as she pulled, tugging his shirt off of his shoulders before gravity began helping her undress him. “Said ‘the contrast’ was important. Better than some of the crazy shit I saw in there, trust me.” As his button up hung halfway on his back, held up by his arms, she nuzzled into his neck, “You’re wearing too much, stud. Get rid of it.” Her jaws clicked as she teasingly snapped at him. As his hands left her ass, she took the opportunity to drop to her knees, hooking her fingers into his pants while working on freeing him from them. There was a pleased grin on her face as she spotted the bulge printing against the denim, “Someone needs room to breath.” The doberman snickered as the shirt hit the floor behind Shane.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She didn’t need to see what she was doing, popping the button off with just a thumb as she looked up at his body. More cuts and scars, far more severe than the ones on his face. As he had put it, more than a few people had ‘got him good, but it never stuck.’ The multiple jagged, slash shaped scars that decorated his torso were hard to look past, but when she did, that’s when she was able to spot the more subtle little circles that dotted his body. She vividly remembered her friend commenting on how dangerous he seemed even when he was laughing, but Paige couldn’t be convinced he was anything more than a stubborn tree; weathered by the seasons, but still standing strong. Then again, she also found him calming when most people couldn’t bring themselves to relax around him. Part of her had to admit she might not be the best judge of character.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The doberman’s ears twitched at his sigh of relief as she pulled the zipper down. “Swear, there was plenty of room down there when we got here.” He said as he scratched the back of his head, the stupid smirk on his face causing her to roll her eyes. Readjusting her grip, she dipped her fingers into his pants a little deeper to catch the boxers that were peeking out at her from his open zipper. She planted a kiss on his stomach, eyes closing shut as his hand reached down and patted her head, one of her ears sticking out between his thumb and forefinger. For a moment, she paused to enjoy moment of tenderness as he caressed her, rubbing her head back into his palm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Shane.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yeah?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Do I look good? In this stuff, I mean.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	He chuckled. She recognized the kind of laugh it was; it was the kind of laugh he did whenever someone asked him something with an obvious answer. Her eyes opened to look up at him, and he was looking down with that soft smile of his. “Baby, I don’t even deserve this.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The doberman huffed, “Just shut up. It’s too late to say that now, and you goddamn know it.” She grinned before pinching a bit of his skin in between her knuckles, causing him to jump a bit before shaking his head. Pleased with herself, she went back to the task at hand. Pulling downward, the pants came falling down before catching at his knees. That was good enough for her, because it was all the room his cock needed to spring up against the side of muzzle. Nuzzling up to it, her nose followed along his length until she was kissing at the base of it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1"> Part of her wished they would bother to break out a tape measure one of these days, that way she would have a definite size to brag about. Instead, all she could do to describe it was say it was ‘heavy.’ Definitely thick, and long enough that even when considering her pointed muzzle she could slip a handle between her lips and his stomach with the head of his cock pushing into her throat. Delightfully drool-worthy, and it was all hers now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">His hand was still resting on her head, but she hardly needed instruction before her lips found his sack and began planting chaste kisses. Both of her hands slid up from his knees, one resting on his thigh while the other gently wrapped around his shaft. Not truly stroking it, but rather tracing her furred fingers along the length of it. The coo of pleasure she heard from overhead told her to continue, and she grinned as she nosed at his heavy orbs. “Alright boys, it’s the big night.” She pushed her lips against them for a wet kiss, opening her maw slightly to suckle on each one before sighing happily, “Mama won’t forgive any slacking.” A snort sounded off above her before Shane’s hand pressed her forward and she obliged. Once again her mouth opened, wider this time as she softly sucked and licked at his sack with her wide tongue.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">While she tended to him below with her mouth, her grip around his dick tightened as she began to properly stroke him. Her hand made the long journey from tip to base every few seconds, slowly working him as she once again found herself appreciating it. A lovely detail few brought up when it came to being human; it was mostly uniform from start to finish. No thin pointed tip to make it easy for either of them when it came to getting it in, but she also didn’t have to worry about some troublesome knot leaving her in need of an ice pack after each round. And as she aimed her muzzle upwards to lap at the base of his cock, she knew there would be plenty of rounds in their future tonight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What she didn’t expect was him using his grip on her to pull her away from his crotch, causing her to let out an upset growl as he played with her hair. “I - ah, we, paid too much to do this standing up. Come on, get that stubby tailed ass of yours on the bed.” Huffing, Paige reluctantly got herself up from the floor, giving him a slap on his ass as she did so. For however upset she was though, her tail was going crazy, betraying her mood as she turned around and climbed onto the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I was getting into it, you know. I was - what the fuck.” She was cutoff midway into her boiling up rant when she felt herself sink into the mattress. “Damn, do they make their beds out of free range clouds?” Neither of them were very accustomed to high class luxury, and this was enough of a discovery to distract them from the moment. Shane had a look of doubt on his face as he followed, watching her bounce on her hands and knees as he climbed onto the bed. Immediately he understood as he sank down, blinking in surprise</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I can’t even afford to be sitting on this.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Right? Holy shit.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He couldn’t help but laugh as he got comfortable in the middle of the bed, laying on his back and using a pillow to hold his head up as he watched her. That prick standing up tall brought her back into the moment and she began crawling over to him. Holding a hand up, he did a spinning motion with his finger. “Pull those panties off and turn that ass around. It’s no fair if only you get something to do.” Paige nodded, reaching down to pull the slinky bottom off before stopping herself as she remembered something.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Oh yeah, that’s the thing she told me about these. You’ll love it, stud, just watch.” Rather than pull off the lingerie, she simply crawled into position, swinging her legs over his head before wiggling her butt in front of his face. Now he was given a proper look at her panties; again purposely not much besides covering her ass in thin white mesh that stuck out in the low light, but there was that solid diamond covering her mound. There was a glistening wetness underneath, just barely visible because of how close he was, but he was distracted by her grabbing at his hands. “Okay so…grab at the sides near the diamond thing. And tug it apart. I swear, this is the craziest shit.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He raised an eyebrow at her excitement, slipping a couple fingers underneath her panties and pinching with this thumbs. “I swear, if this does what I think it does…” All the while, her tail was going ballistic to the point where she was effectively wiggling on top of him. She wasn’t going to answer any of his concerns, her toothy smile urging him to keep going. Sighing, he braced himself before pulling his hands apart. Except with almost minimal amounts of effort, there was a quiet rip and the diamond that had been concealing her sex pulled cleanly apart, going from something that had been covering her up to providing a white diamond shaped outline for him to stare at. There was a moment of silence as he took it in before he started laughing. “Are you fucking kidding me? This is ridiculous. Who makes this shit?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The moment he started laughing, so did she, looking over her shoulder as she watched his reaction. “Right? That’s what I fucking thought. When I asked why this set came with so many panties but only one top, she just pulled one out and showed me. Got’em because I thought you would get a kick out of it.” He just sat there, shaking his head and laughing as he pulled his hands free and onto her thighs, squeezing them as he mumbled something about ‘goddamn Cracker Jack prizes.’ She shook her ass one more time before pushing it back onto him, “Alright, show’s over. Get to work.” She barked as she turned back to the real task at hand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Fur brushed against skin as her body sank down against his, and her arms draped over his thighs as she leaned forward. She had gotten a taste of it earlier, but now she could really enjoy his cock as she ran her tongue along it. The wide muscle dragged along the top, lovingly slathering it in her spittle before she brought a hand up to hold the base of the heavy pole. The man underneath her shuddered in reaction, before returning the favor as she leaned in for a second go. Fingers dug onto the fur on her cheeks as she was pulled back and felt his face slip in between her thighs. She felt his breath on her leaking slit for a moment before he ran his tongue between her folds, from bottom to top. She must have been more worked up than she imagined, since with just that she gripped onto his thigh with her free hand and heard herself groan.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Just another benefit of taking a human lover was how close they could bring their face in when between a pair of legs. No long muzzle and cold nose, just lips and a surprisingly dexterous tongue. A tongue that Shane was putting to used as he buried himself into his prize. He could feel her forcing herself to hold still as he worked over her entrance, getting her primed and ready for what was to follow when they were done tasting each other. His hand raised to give her ass a light pat, reminding her that she was doing something before he started eating her out. There was a snicker from the bottom of the bed, “Sorry, hard to be dinner and the show at the same time.” That earned her a pinch, causing Paige to yipe. She got the message though, since moments later he could feel her rolling her tongue along the side of his length. She kissed the head of his cock before shifting to the other side, and doing the same thing, pressing her tongue in against each vein she came across.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The bedroom of the suite filled with the sound of slurps, gasps, and groans as they found a rhythm with each other. The doberman would have to stop every now and then to simply hold onto his legs as he traced his tongue around her clit, finishing his assault as he dragged his way back up and pulled a shaky moan from her. Of course, she would return the favor as she put both of her hands to work; the palm of one hand was simply rolling his sack slowly, never letting up as she stroked the lower part of his cock. The rest of that breeding tool was being tended to by her maw, tongue refusing to stop as she lathered it with adoring attention. She couldn’t help grinning to herself as she felt him squirm underneath her, and her ears flicked each time she caught a muttered swear slip from between her legs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Eventually she brought her lips to the head of his cock, pressing her lips against it until they were forced to open by it as she leaned forward. Exhaling through her nose, she slowly slipped more of his girth into her mouth. Her tongue refused to rest, rolling in a slow circle around the throbbing flesh. Pressing on, she began to lower herself down his cock, lips pressing down on each sensitive spot of his she had ever found. Inch after inch slipped past her lips, before finding her limit as he threatened to slip into her throat. Not unfamiliar territory for either of them, but that’s not what fit the mood. Not at this moment; she could test herself another time, but right now called for something more sensual and passionate.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Passionate she could do. It’s not like either of them were unfamiliar with how loud she could howl when riled up. Sensual would be new territory for Paige, though. Tonight though, she would have to learn as she went. Breathing out, she pulled her hands from the ‘usual’ positions, leaving fingers trailing against his skin. They rested against the bottom half of his cock, forming a weak brace to hold it steady as she began to bob along what she could fit into her maw Her fingertips traced up and down in time with her muzzled, teasing with a uncharacteristically soft touch. She knew she was getting to him from how often he stopped to mutter or groan, but he made up for it by more thoroughly tending to her heated slit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It became an odd rhythm of each of them having to stop for a few seconds and indulging in the haze inducing attention of their lover, only to pick up the slack and force the other take their ‘break.’ She had him swearing and groaning, and then he would dive back into her and have her eyes threatening to roll back into her head. He could turn her into a melted puddle with just his mouth, and he was putting all of that experience to use as he traced his tongue along every sensitive spot he had ever found while they had been together. Her toes curled with each tease at her entrance, pushing up against it until his tongue sank in and dragged against the inner walls just long enough to make her shudder before pulling back. Genuine moans escaped her each time, but she could taste that salty warmth trickling against her tongue as whenever it was her turn again and she could see his legs pull up before stretching out again just before he took over once more.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It took so much effort out of her just to hold this deliberate pace, and with each pass at her he threatened to shatter her concentration. She ached to just throw herself at this and fall into their usual rutting frenzy, but they would only get this night once. Surprisingly, it wasn’t her that finally broke the spell, but Shane, squeezing at her ass and slapping it to get her attention. “Alright, that’s enough of this.” Pulling off of his cock and taking her first real breath since they started this, she looked over her shoulder to see what he meant. As she did so, he pulled her leg over his head to let himself free. It would make sense that they would move onto the main course eventually, but she wasn’t expecting him to complete the motion by actually tossing her onto her back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The doberman yelped in surprise as she was flipped over, but he busied himself by grabbing a small pillow as she adjusted to her new position. One hand on her waist to lift her ass up before he stuffed the pillow underneath her, angling her lower half upwards. “God, finally.” She huffed out, less out of irritation and more of relief as she looked up at the man looming over her. Her eyes trailed down to the cock in his hands as he slipped between her legs. He could tell by the way she was breathing that he could ram it in right there without warning and she would only scream in thanks. Tonight called for a more intimate approach though, and he reached for her hand, squeezing it gently before guiding it down between her legs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He never needed any help getting it in, and in fact could probably walk through a room in pitch black darkness, and still find his mark. Regardless, she wrapped her fingers around his length and aimed it downwards to the diamond outline in her panties. They hadn’t been this measured and hesitant even on their first time together, and they had both long lost count of how many times they’ve fucked. Yet both of them realized they were holding their breath as his cock head was brought against her soaked cunt. Just resting against her slit she felt hot, and he could see her ears pinned back and her other hand preemptively clutching at the covers of the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Whatever reservations and worries he had were thrown far away when she snorted and laughed, “Is this the part where I ask you to be gentle?” He couldn’t help but laugh with her, hand shifting from hers to her thigh, “You’d scare me if you did. ” Even with her dark fur, or maybe just because how well he knew her, he could tell she was smiling as she looked up to him. “No take backs?” She teased, rubbing a finger back and forth against his shaft. “Not without a lawyer present.” There was another snort from her before she stretched out her free leg, wrapping around the back of his. He heard her take a deep breath before she let herself fall back onto the bed, “I’m all yours, stud.” She cooed as she pulled at him, urging him forward.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">With nothing more to be said, and a needy doberman to please Shane began to lean forward, and after a brief moment of straining, began to sink his cock into her. Immediately she gasped and her body tensed, before she forced herself to relax. She hissed through clenched teeth as she took him, savoring the slow, half-pleasure-half-pain process of being spread apart by his hefty dick. There was a love-hate relationship with how he started them off like this every time; one on hand, he was far too gifted to just slam that thing in one thrust. On the other, due to his size and how slow he hilted himself into her sex, it tended to fuck with her sense of time. What had taken only a handful of seconds felt like entire minutes in her mind. So big, yet it felt like he never ran out of cock to stuff her with with how long it took. Even as her fingers traced along his length, inviting each inch in before welcoming it into her cunt, she couldn’t tell when he was almost there until her hand was pressing up against his stomach as he finally touched home. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He wasn’t entirely to blame for this, even if he did take a bit of pride in how she writhed and squirmed while being fed his cock. Part of him was sure she wasn’t even aware of how hard she was clenching down on his shaft, slowing him down even further before her body would let up. The deeper he got, the tighter she squeezed. It was expected; her body was built for a canine shaped cock that tapered off into a thin point, so his human cock, thick from base to tip, was pressed up against sensitive bundles of nerves that would otherwise go ignored. What resulted was Paige being put into a hazed state as he lodged himself into her, the throbbing of his girth making it impossible to ignore as she clawed at the blanket. Not like she was making it any easier on him; if her entrance was hot, her inner walls were almost burning up, slick and seemingly trying their best to milk his cock even as the two of them laid still.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her now free hand pulled from his stomach and rested on hers, a finger tracing a circle in her fur where she felt the fullness inside of her end. She sighed happily as she adjusted to its presence before reaching back up to him and scratching lightly at his chest, “I got a surprise for you~” She murmured. As he lowered his chest down to hers, her hands slipped over his shoulders. Her legs followed suit, her toes buried into the pit of his knees as he announced his arrival with a kiss to her neck. “Is this really the time?” He said as he slipped his arms underneath her head. “You said there would be no take backs,” she teased while nipping at his ear before squeezing him close, “I took a few pills before we got here. Got’em from a friend when I told her I met ‘the one.’ ” Even in the dark she could see his confusion, so she brought her legs up and wrapped them around his waist, “Just two or three breeding pills, nothing to worry about. You don’t mind raising a pup, do you?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">There was a beat as Shane put two and two together, before he started to chuckle. Pulling himself up to line his lips up to her muzzle, he pressed in for a kiss. She happily accepted it, turning her head and opening her mouth wide enough for a passionate bout of tongue wrestling. A few seconds in, she whined into the kiss. Of course she would; he was pulling his hips back and she could feel the fullness of his cock leaving her. The whine was almost immediately replaced by a thankful moan as he brought his body back down with a hearty clap. Her nails dug into his shoulder blades as she held the kiss despite this, but when he did it again and their hips collided a second time, she wasn’t able to both make out with him and be fucked at the same time. Pulling her head back, she cried out right into his ear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Just one?” He huffed as he began to pick up speed, his cock never fully leaving her cunt before being driven back in, “I’m thinking three or - ha- four.” His boast definitely wasn’t unwarranted, not with the weight of his sack as it slapped against her ass. She was keenly aware of how much of a mess he could make of her cunt, but before now it was just because she found it hot. Now her body was screaming for him to lay claim to her. Something he was reminded off with how hard she was clamping down on his cock each time he pulled back. He sat up, pulling her hands off his shoulders and onto the bed as he pinned them there, pushing his fingers in between hers. The gold of the bands on each of their left hands gleamed even in the dark. “How about it? A big ol’ family - nnff - sound good?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yes!” The doberman almost howled as another thrust came down, both in agreement and raw pleasure. Five years ago, she would have spit on the idea of raising a family. That was for Daisy-Do-Nothing’s and timid women. Now, she was looking up at the man that two days ago she was standing at an altar with. Her fingers went straight out before curling and grabbing onto his hand, intertwining with his so she could hold on as each buck of his hips rocked her body. “You gotta - oooh fuck - give me’em first!” As if taunted by this, he shifted gears again. The long, slow pulls gave way to a frenzied rush to get just enough of his thick cock out of her before he could really slam it home.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1"> Either because it was meant to, or that was just how hard he was giving it to her, the lacy bra began to loose its hold on her chest. Each time the clap of their hips filled the suite, it slipped a little lower until finally her breasts came free. Finally unrestrained, they bounced with each thrust she took. A good show in and of itself, Shane wasn’t just watching her chest. He took in every detail he could in the dark. How she arched her back, how she bit her lip before each pleasured swear force its way out of her, the way it sounded as her fur brushed against the blanket every time she moved. For a few seconds at a time, she even managed to lock eyes with him, sharing a tender moment before the next surge of pleasure forced them shut. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What she saw was the grizzled man she adored, with the most strained face he ever put on. The one that only she got to see in their most private moments. His usually relaxed demeanor gone, replaced by a furrow brow, panting and grunting as he did everything he could to hear her lustful howling. The muscled hips rolling in between her legs insured he would, and if he hadn’t pinned her hands to the bed, she would be digging her nails right into that wide back of his. The fact that his upper back sported an series of cuts and fresh scars around his collar bone and shoulder blades was testament to how far over the edge he could send her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her muzzled swapped between clenched tight in a poor attempt to not scream, and wide opened as she called out for him with staggered moans, interrupted mid-howl by his thrusts. “Nnnffuc-king yes-ss-ss!” She wanted everything he had to give her, and not a drop less. Even the steady flow of pre-cum against her walls was setting her off, her body begging to be rewarded for taking him so well. She should have listened to her friend’s warning about those pills, the way it was causing her to lose focus. This wasn’t simply a passionate lay; she was finding herself aching at the very thought of him getting off, to feel him shudder as he usually did as he came. They had done this so many times before, but never had she wanted him this badly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Suddenly his body was pressed against hers, slumping down as he once again changed his rhythm. She could hear he was short of breath with how he was gasping, but she was doing no better. He had settled into a rut against her body, constantly pounding her with short thrusts that had him shoved deep in her and staying deep. The heavy bucks that had knocked her top off hadn’t dizzied her like this, replacing her loud outbursts with whines of need that she filled his ears with. They were like whispers compared to those, and she struggled to even speak as the raucous noise of their act was replaced by the subdued sounds of his grunts and hammering movement.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She was losing track of reality, losing awareness of their surroundings as the creeping sensation of pressure began to grow. Anything could set her off at this point, and she couldn’t keep her eyes open as her head fell back. “Shaaane,” she whimpered, and she could feel his grip on her hand tightened. They had held full conversations before that were less meaningful than that one squeeze. With just that, she let herself submit to the pleasure that was threatening to bowl her over and leave her drooling. Any second now, and she was going to fly off the deep end hard enough to make him worry.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Shane beat her to it. In a rare show of complete submission, likely due to the pills, she had given him total control of the pace of things. Instead of pushing him over and switching positions a few times where they had to find their rhythm again, she opted to simply take it. Once they had started going at it, she wanted nothing but more. Or, at the very least, her body did. He couldn’t remember the last time she felt this hot, or the last time her cunt had so desperately squeezed at his cock. From the moment he had hilted into her, he had known that pulling out wasn’t on the table. The premise of giving her children was just an extra touch of motivation.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hearing her wail for him as he pinned her to the bed, he squeezed her hand to let her know he was right there with her. Damn sure he wasn’t in condition to say it, the way he was sweating. He could hear her whines becoming higher pitch and go on for longer with each one that came out of her, and it only spurred him on. She was gripping tighter onto his hands, her nails starting to break skin. Part of him wanted to try for something special at the end, but that building spot of pressure told him he didn’t have time. Really, it was a wonder he even noticed it before his hips slammed in and he groaned, “Oh fuck…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The low volume of his swear belied the intensity of his orgasm. He managed a ragged gasp that made Paige’s ear twitch, before he shuddered and came. The first rope of cum that landed in her immediately set her off as her back arched, a weakened whine escaping her as her walls suddenly clamped down on his cock. Her legs locked him down as deep as she could get him, not letting him even risk pulling back in his mid-orgasm thrusts as he tried to empty everything he had. He had finally given her what she was burning up for, and took over that process as her cunt spasmed and squeezed around it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">They had purposely stopped having sex a few weeks before the ceremony just to make sure this night was special, and now she was reaping the rewards as he painted her insides white with his seed. Each shot shook her, toes curling and uncurling as his cock jumped and twitched with every delivery. This was a high she hadn’t expected as her climax dragged on, any chance of it lulling to a stop being kickstarted with a spike of pleasure with each volley of thick human cum. Unlike watery, thin canine seed, this was sticking where it landed, dragging against her walls as he filled her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And filled her he did, her snatch running out of room to keep it all in before he ran out of spunk to give. It was flowing out in what little space there was between his cock and her entrance, trickling down her cheeks and his sack before dripping onto the pillow he had hoisted her on. A mess that would have to be dealt with, but they had wordlessly and simultaneously decided that could wait until they could remember what day it was again. For now, they were preoccupied riding out their orgasms and catching their breath.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Even as things finally died down, she still was shaking underneath him, panting heavily as they shared a quiet moment in an attempt to catch their breath. When he moved to sit up, she squeezed him with her legs and he was met with a growl. Knowing better than to ruin the moment, he instead brought himself up on his elbows. Finding himself perched at her lips, he began pecking at her chin and neck softly. That pacified her for the moment, squeezing his hand in approval. He leaned down to rub his nose with hers, finding it almost amusingly cold compared to how hot the rest of her body was, “Paige Evette Lantry, you are the most beautiful woman a man could marry.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She snorted, as she usually did, before kissing him right on the lips. When it broke, she let out a happy sigh. “Shane Jeremy Lantry, you’re a terrible with words. Most beautiful woman? Really? That’s what you go with on our honeymoon?” Immediately he was laughing, and he gave a dramatic sigh of defeat. “Fine, not most beautiful. How about…baddest bitch a man can handle.” There was pause. “Barely.” The doberman giggled, nodding, “I knew you were a poet, stud. Gotta be able to do something right, right?” He simply shook his head as she grinned up at him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her hands tugged in his grip, and he let go, holding himself up so she do whatever she was trying to accomplish underneath him. Immediately, she grabbed his left hand, bring it up to her face and petting herself with it. Or rather, rubbing the wedding band against her cheek. A simple gold band, nothing fancy. She was completely unsurprised when she had seen it, since it suited him perfectly. In fact, the one who was surprised was him when she insisted on getting the same thing. No diamond, no engravings. Just a ring of shiny yellow metal that said she was taken. There was nothing to prove. Except maybe to her family that someone would marry her in the first place, really.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Shane?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yeah, baby?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I love you. Scars and all.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“God, I’d fucking hope so.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He hardly had time to react before she had reached up and punched him in the shoulder. “Ow,” he chuckled as he rubbed it, “Did you want me to recite my wedding vows again?” Huffing, she snorted, “I’d expect you to at least try to be romantic, you fucker.” He made a face, “I just tried - ah, whatever.” She started snickering, and he sighed. “I love you from your pointed ears to your stubby tail, you crazy thing.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“And everything in between?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“And everything in between.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Satisfied, she let go of his hand to reach up and wrap her arms around his neck. As they kissed again, she finally relented from her death grip on his waist with her legs. Slowly they slid down, before she wrapped and rested them on the back of his. He wasn’t going anywhere, and she knew that. But she wanted to him to keep close, so that’s where he stayed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">- Post Script Thoughts: https://pastebin.com/qzXdbkuS -</div></li></ol>        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">[Tags: Human(M) x Anthro(F, Doberman), Oral (Fellatio, Sixty Nine), Vaginal, Cream Pie]

Too glitzy. Too spacious. Way, way too goddamn expensive. Paige had a multitude of complaints as they carried their luggage into their hotel suite. Even after she had been assured that this was definitely on the lower end of the spectrum for what qualified as a luxury resort, for the doberman this was above and beyond what was required. She would have been satisfied with a three star motel in the nice part of town, yet Shane insisted that she wouldn’t mind once she got used to it. Speaking of, where did that man go? 

The short black tuft of hair bounced as she turned to make sure he was still following her. Butch was almost the perfect word to define her, from the way she carried herself, and the toned shape of her black and caramel colored body. Yet it was her body shape that allowed her to just barely defy the word. Ample breasts and eye catching curves chipped away at the raw domineering form, leaving it sculpted to something far more streamlined. It left the impression of might contained within elegance, akin to a jet fighter prepped for launch. Just as dangerous as well, hazel eyes long trained to spot weakness in anything she saw. Paige had a tendency to make rooms full of people antsy just by being around, nervous what she would do with that unimpressed frown that usually decorated her face. A perfect example of a breed designed to be intimidating, this was a woman who could intimidate with a chuckle and a grin. After all, if she was having a good time, that generally meant that someone else wasn’t.

Yet behind her trailed a man with a half amused grin permanently attached to his face. It was never unusual to see him with his hand to his chin as he contemplated whatever was on his mind. Compared to the doberman, the calm human was a complete foil. Short, light brown, almost golden hair covered his scalp, slightly wild but definitely maintained. Convincing him to keep it short was one of the few things she had managed to bully him into doing. It was something she preferred compared to the long, metal head style locks he had when they first met. Wide bodied with a touch of softness to it, but she knew that it was just a layer over experienced muscle. It was enough to be disarming to most but still cause surprise when he really started moving. He was few inches taller than her, too; it took a long time for her to get over how it bothered her to look up juuust slightly to keep eye contact with him. Again in contrast to her threatening demeanor, he had a paternal aura to him. The kind who’s sigh of disappointment could pierce complete strangers with spears of guilt.

Compared to their surroundings, she had a feeling they were both under dressed. There were men in the first floor lobby in suits, women on the pool patio in swirling, colorful dresses. And here they were, dressed to go shopping at the local strip mall. It was almost cute how they matched. Both of them were wearing blue jeans, the rugged denim long worn soft from years of ownership. The doberman had stepped into the resort’s tall automatic doors wearing a concert t-shirt for a band he had introduced her too. Countless visits to the laundry had caused it to shrink, but that’s exactly the reason she wore it. It dared and taunted people with how taut it was wrapped around her chest. He, on the other hand, was slightly sharper dressed in his white button up. Her favorite button up of his she noticed, since it was the one that she could undo with a single hand. Seemingly tired eyes caught hers as he noticed her looking him over, and he raised an eyebrow.

“What?” He laughed as he tugged a cooler towards the suite’s half-kitchen, mainly towards the fridge, “Too late to back out now.” He teased at whatever complaint she was going to fire at him next. Indeed, for the past three months every thing he had planned for them had been labeled as ‘plain goddamn unnecessary’ by the canine. Yet he would grin, she would sigh, and then things would move along again. Her friends had insisted that he was using his criminal connections to bully her into their relationship, and for her, it was better that they thought that. There was no way to explain that the Paige, Queen Bitch, honestly had feelings for some soft spoken human. After all, she had managed to hide it from them pretty well until just a few weeks ago.

“God, you and you’re damn planning. It’s amazing that shit get done at all.” Paige huffed as her hands clasped onto her waist, hips at a tilt as she once again was throwing sass about. He simply shook his head as he began loading up the fridge with the drinks they had brought along. No way in hell were they about to pay this hotel’s convenience cost for shitty champagne. They both could drink like fish once the ball got rolling, and this whole experience as already a touch pricey for both of their tastes. But she deserved it, and he was paying for it, so that was that.

“It’s only because of my plans things get done in the first place.” He chuckled as the last six pack was slide into the back of the fridge. If she had her way, their relationship could have been summarized by a unrelenting challenge of awkwardly dancing schedules as she tried to keep things under wraps. It was stressful in the first place, but now even he could tell she was a lot more relaxed. There was less of a burden weighing on her after the last few days’ events, like she didn’t have to hide something she had long buried.

Closing the cooler then sending it sliding with a kick, he took a deep breath as he looked over to their two suitcases laying in the entrance. The suite definitely had dressers for them to stuff their clothes into, but... Shane looked over to the waiting doberman. He had been horrible to her the past few days. So much waiting, so much restraint. It had definitely been taxing on her patience and will power to put up with all he had asked of her. He wouldn’t blame her if she was more than slightly resenting him at the moment. There was certainly a look of irritation on her face as she waited for him to do whatever it was he thought was more important than her. It softened as he made eye contact with her and smiled, before completely melting away as he started walking towards her.

She met him halfway, striding up to him before her arms reached up to wrap around his neck with practiced ease. Their chests pressed together, and his own arms reached down to wrap around her waist. Both human and canine sighed audibly as their lips met. This was why she would have been satisfied anywhere they went; once she was in his embrace, she could be sitting in some dingy dive bar and still be on cloud nine. He was soft, yet by no means fragile. Warm and endearing, but he didn’t busy himself with trying to impress her. Shane was simply himself, and that was all she needed. He wasn’t intimidated by or upset with who she was or how she acted, and was much more understanding than the mountain of people that came before him trying to tame her. The man was her source of warmth, not guidance. She was whole before, but with him, she could relax. There was no need to kowtow to his mental image of her. She, in her entirety, was just fine enough for him.

---

When they had first met, she had acted like a stuck up bitch. She was causing a fuss at some bar, that she had been dragged to by a friend. Instead of anything interesting happening, it was just another dive. Sure, everyone there looked like they could handle themselves, and some east coast hipster wouldn’t have the courage to even push the door open to let themselves in, but that could be found in any part of the county. She knew better to openly voice her complaints, but that didn’t mean she was turning down her level of bitchiness. She was bored, none of the guys here looked like any fun, and she was stuck here until her friend decided she wanted to leave. 

Even when she tries her hardest to remember, she doesn’t remember how he approached. As far as she could tell, he simply appeared. This long haired human straight out of a cheap 80s cover band had came over to her table. Very calmly, he had asked her to settle down, a bored expression on his face as if he would rather be doing anything else than policing a bar. The doberman didn’t even catch what exactly he said, and reflexively she fired back, “Oh please, go get fucked cock sucker. I’m enjoying myself here.”

To this day, she still shudders at remembering how silent the bar had become within seconds. In an instant, she had known she fucked up. Eyes were on him, and then to her, and then back to him. It was almost out of a movie how still everything had become. She didn’t know who he was, but he was someone of importance. Enough importance to get a variety of thugs and bikers to become deathly quiet just to watch what would happen to her. Within a fraction of a moment, she had gone from some dusty dive bar to the executioner’s block, and there was already an audience waiting for her.

The look on his face was hardly any different, completely unshaken by the fact that some random anthro insulted him. In fact, he almost looked disappointed. “Look, I know you’re enjoying yourself, but it’s bothering some folks.” It had been years since someone last had the balls to lecture her, yet there she was, standing at attention, “And when people around here get bothered, they do some stupid shit. So how about you just calm it down a bit? They already do enough dumb shit in the first place.” He had smirked at her, laughing at his own joke. In that chaotic den of vice and violence, there was a single man who brought calm to a storm. And for the first time in years, in the whirlwind of chaos and debauchery that had been her life, she had been given a moment to breath. Everyone stopped to watch on him to deliver judgment, but he was standing there, waiting for her instead. It felt like the world was waiting on him, and he was giving her all the time she needed. It was a surreal feeling, like a mid-game timeout. 

Shane Lantry. The local chapter head of the Burning Jackals. Paige had always been a trouble maker, but compared to her the human was a professional, and he had the scars to prove it. A variety of nicks and cuts on his cheek, chin, and neck were testament to many close calls. Still, she couldn’t find it within herself to simply bow out. “Fuckin’…yeah, whatever man, fine. I’ll tone it down. Got any other shit you want to bring up? Or am I free to go?” There were murmurs in the crowd, and she heard ‘this bitch’ more than a few times around the room. The human merely shook his head before grinning wide, “Not at all. That’s all I needed to hear.” As he walked away, she didn’t feel relieved nor worried. That breathing room he had given her, that sensation of a calm, was gone and the bar came alive once more with its usual cacophony of noise. 

She was back in her usual element again, yet she was shaken. That man had stripped her of her usual airs of danger and respect, but not to belittle her. In that short conversation, the way he had looked at her was something akin to mutual respect. Despite an environment that screamed to the contrary, in that moment they were equals. She could have bitched and argued, and he would have held court like a king listening to an old friend vent as his subjects looked on. He wasn’t upset or disinterested, and she wasn’t a threat or his lesser. Welcome. He had made her feel welcome, despite having every reason to do otherwise.

It all just left her feeling not only confused, but it was alien enough to make her anxious. For whatever it was worth, it made her uncomfortable whenever she found herself thinking about that first meeting. Time didn’t stop; rather, it stopped mattering. That was definitely not normal. However, every time they did meet, she definitely could feel herself relax around him. She had even caught him glancing her way at a number of parties and gatherings, and he had noticed her returning the favor several times. They were keeping an eye out for each other at the very least. If her at-the-time room mate’s stupid movies were enough to go on, this meant they were all primed and ready to get to the fun part. Of course, it would take another year or so before things would go beyond drinking together in the same room. She was far too cautious and guarded to just let herself trip into a relationship after all.

---

Back in the current moment, their kiss had become far hungrier. Shane’s hands slipped downward, grabbing a handful of dobie ass and causing her short tail to flick about excitedly. At the same time, she turned her muzzle, opening her lips slightly to allow the kiss to deepen. Her hands grasped at the back of his head, turning and guiding him to properly take advantage of the new angle. The moment she could taste his tongue, there was a muffled groan as they began to wrestle and dance with each other.

Since the moment they had met, Paige always had trouble if not outright refusing letting her show her more feminine side. She always had something to prove, and wouldn’t let herself just be someone’s arm candy. In fact, she had long kept the situation reversed, playing the more dominant role in whatever qualified as her relationships for a time. It was only when they had started spending some private time practicing how to kiss someone of a different species did Shane find the little switch that allowed the doberman to let her guard down and be taken care of. A little tongue action, a small game of grab ass, and that moan would let him know that she was ready to melt into his arms.

The pair stood there for a few more moments, enjoying the simple show of affection. Whenever he teased her about it, Paige would always deny that she enjoyed the act of kissing, insisting it was just part of foreplay. Yet, whenever he would steal a quick smooch from her on his way out, he would catch her grinning like she had just gotten away with something. A surprise peck on the cheek could get her to smirk, but when things are this heated, it was a quick way to get her riled up. Her leg wrapped around his, and she used her free arm to pull herself up slightly against him. The kiss broke as she huffed for breath, her wet nose pressed against his, “How long are you going to make me fucking wait? Lets do this already.” Impatience caused her to finally growl out as she looked up at him.

Almost immediately in response, he began to walk forward toward the bedroom, the canine forced to step backwards in time. What made this even more difficult was their mutual insistence to assault wherever they could reach with a flurry of kisses. Paige even was tackling the inevitable task of peeling his shirt off at the same time, bringing a hand down to deal with each button with deft fingers. She goddamn loved this shirt of his, as it almost looked like she was cutting it open with how fast it was peeling off of his chest. Once the last button was undone, her hand immediately slipped past the clothing and pressed against his skin, dragging her nails against his chest.

Their march was interrupted by the wall that acted as the separating barrier between the rest of the suite and the master bedroom. Though the couple didn’t seemed bothered much as he pinned the canine against it. She grinned, tugging his shirt off his arms as he gave them to her before resting her head against his chest and taking in his scent. This was her man, after all; being able to indulge every one of her senses with him was part of the deal. She remembered reading in one of the many human-on-anthro relationship books she forced herself to skim through that humans didn’t have the same fine tuned senses as many anthros had, so they usually didn’t have the same responses as anthros when it came to recognizing those close to them.

The doberman had a hard time imagining a life where the mere scent of Shane didn’t excite her, and sometimes found herself wondering if she made him feel the same way somehow. Even she worried about it, she knew that the man had a smile he only had for her. It was subtle in a way that she would never be able to explain it, but she was be able to recognize it from across the afar, the look on his face that showed his love and adoration the moment he realized that it was her he was looking at. She would catch it most often when he was busy with something, only to look up and see her. Just a smile almost like any other kind the constantly amused man would make, but the warmth behind it made her heart flutter. 

She was distracted from her thoughts when she realized the lights in the suite were going dim. From the golden glitz of an expensive resort to the dull brightness of a bar at closing time. A bit hard to see, but lit well enough to give a sense of warmth and comfort. Turning her head, she could see him messing with some sort of control pad on the wall behind them, screwing around with the lights. “Romantic.” Paige snickered, pushing him back slightly to get some room away from the wall. “I try to be.” He answered, attempting to follow her as she turned around the corner to the bedroom. 

Immediately he was stopped by a single finger on his nose and a devious look on her face. “I waited days for this, through all those dumb plans. You can wait a few minutes.” The one finger turned into a full hand as she pushed him back around the corner. “Got it.” He laughed before leaning against the wall, “Call me when you’re ready.” There was a clink of a button being undone, followed by the shuffle of clothing being pulled off, and finally a deep breath of anticipation from the other side of the wall. “Oh, I will, don’t worry hot stuff.”

After their first meeting, Shane had definitely been left with a lasting impression. His various underlings and confidants were certain he was thinking of some way to get back at that anthro bitch for her lack of respect. Instead, he had found himself kind of obsessed with her. Usually whenever he tried to flex his will, there were whispered chains of apologies and promises that such things would never happen again. That doberman had looked him dead in the eye and talked to him like an equal. She either didn’t know who he was at the time, or she just didn’t give a damn. Unimpressed by him or the atmosphere of the room at that moment. He had to respect that. She didn’t have a thing to prove to anyone there. It had been so long since he had come across someone not scared of him, who didn’t tense up or fold under the oppressing aura that surrounded him. It was a cool drink of water, so refreshing that he wasn’t surprised he had become addicted from a single taste. 

At first, he simply started asking around anyone who knew her if she would be keen to showing up at more events. “Yeah, that one doberman from that one time. Just get her to show up.” He had people convinced he was simply setting her up for something. Even she thought that was the case, but when her friends insisted that turning him down was not a safe option, she reluctantly played along. When she did show up to the first time she had been ‘invited’ to a private party, she was tense. Eyes were on her, like an audience in front of the gallows. Shane began making his rounds, making sure every one of his guests was having a good time. The ruckus of the event slowed as he made his way over to her, everyone trying their best to be subtle as they looked in their direction.

To their surprise, the moment Paige realized Shane was coming to talk to her, her body language…relaxed? She had been anxious all evening, but when what everyone was expecting to the hour of her proper judgment came nigh, she calmed down. There was a smirk on her face as the man tapped his glass to hers, “Is everything alright? Beer cold enough?” That casual manner of speaking was signature to Shane, yet it felt out of place in that moment. Shouldn’t she be on the receiving end of some form of wrath the way she had disrespected him? He wasn’t surprised that people thought this, but it didn’t feel right. Sure, she didn’t beg for forgiveness back at the bar, but with the way she had handled herself it didn’t feel right to punish her. She obviously didn’t think she had stepped out of line, he thought, so why give her trouble for it?

“I’m just fuckin’ fine. You always kill the party whenever you talk to chicks or what?” To anyone else, that response sounded cocky, even mocking, as the canine leaned onto the wall. To Shane, it sounded like an appropriate thing to say with the way all the other conversations died down. Yet she wasn’t even looking their way. Those eyes of hers were on him, and he wasn’t giving much thought to anything else.

 “Well, in their defense, it is a bit of an oddity. I usually don’t go out of my way to make sure someone gets invited. Speaking of which, I never caught your name that time back at the bar. Shane Lantry.” He extended his free hand for a shake, that permanently attached smirk on his face. Her eyes darted down to the offered hand, before back up to him as she reached forward to accept it.

“Paige Taylor. Though, I’ve been called ‘that bitch’ enough times that I’m pretty sure I could use it on court papers.” His immediate snort of amusement was genuine, and from there the small talk began proper. On that cheaply lit back patio, surrounded by dozens of people, they somehow managed to talk with ease. Laughs and calls for more beer were common as they got to know each other proper, and everyone’s guard came down as they realized what had truly happened on that day in the bar. She had impressed him, somehow, and won his respect.

That’s where he learned that she generally bounced between jobs, but at the moment her current job as warehouse security might actually stick, assuming she didn’t, in her words, “really fuck things up, somehow.” And that was how she got to hear it from his own admittance that despite his day job of being the owner of a tattoo parlor, most of the time he was just corralling the local knuckle heads, making light of the gang’s intimidating reputation. She seemed to take it in stride.

 Then he started asking for her by name, and she had simply became part of the crowd. “That one bitch the boss finds funny,” she told him she had heard someone call her. “Well, they’re not really wrong,” he freely admitted. They would meet every now and again, sometimes even coincidentally when they would run into each other at the seedy places they tended to lurk in. And every time, they would end up chatting it up, her abrasive attitude hardly affecting his calm and casual attitude.

Eventually, at a party at his own place, he managed to catch her alone in the hallway, between the party and the bathroom. No audience. Well, if there was ever a time… “Hey Paige.” Shane called out, causing her to turn around. He watched her usual scowl peel off at the sound of his voice, and she was smirking by the time she was facing him. “I was thinking that instead going through your friends any time I wanted to hang out, it would probably be smarter to just get your number. You know, so I can let you know whenever something is going to go down.” Even looking back, that was probably the most poorly delivered lie that ever came out of his mouth.

The doberman had looked him right in the face, snorted, and pulled out her phone. “Whatever you say, jack. Saves me the trouble of asking for yours. For getting into these parties you throw, of course. No other reasons.” They shared a knowing look, a nervous chuckle, and after a moment a glib, their numbers. Paige managed to pull her eyes away from him, looking through the crack of the door next to them. His bedroom, of course she had found herself looking into his bedroom. Then her facial expression changed from one of embarrassed amusement to something that looked like a combination of surprise and doubt, and she pushed past him and past the door. “Don’t fucking tell me that’s the goddamn book.”

Shane was immediately confused as to why she was suddenly dashing into his room, much less talking about some book. Well, he couldn’t just leave her alone, and he followed behind her. “What are you going on about-” He was stopped dead in his tracks as she sat there flipping through his evening reading material for the past few weeks. A moderately size paperback, with a purposely nondescript cover that only had black title text on a blue backdrop. ‘Fur &amp; Skin: An Encyclopedic Guide to Cross-Species Romance.’ Currently the best selling guide on human/anthro relations, and otherwise known as the ‘little blue book of banging,’ among other equally low brow nicknames. He had gone out of his way to make sure no one knew he had a copy, heading to a bookstore three hours away after calling ahead to make sure they had it. 

And now there was a doberman skipping through all the pages, hopping from each bookmark tag to the next. And she had a growing grin on her face with every stop she made. “This fucking book. I had to buy this shit online, couldn’t find a single copy anywhere. Let’s see here…” the pages flicked against her thumb as she skimmed to the next colored tag that was sticking out from the pages. “Oh, this is where I left off last night. ‘French kissing a canine.’ From the looks of it, you’ve studied up.” She put the book back into its semi-hidden spot on the shelf of his night stand. “Up for some practice?” Paige strutted over, doing something he had never seen her do before; swing her hips.

He didn’t know what to do, or how to defend himself, so he went with the first joke that came to mind as he watched her walk up to him. “…You can read?” “Jesus fucking Christ, fuck you.” In that moment, he saw it in her eyes; she was considering cold clocking him and leaving him on the floor. He had seen her do it to other people, and knew she had put down larger men than him. Instead, she wrapped her arms around him, “This is good an excuse as any to get this ball finally rolling, so I’m going to goddamn use it. So go hang a sock on that door, study buddy.” She growled into his ear, her thumb nail scratching against the side of his neck before pushing him back.

It was in that moment Shane wished he knew the exact location of every sock he owned, since he was coming up distinctly sock-less. Looking around, he improvised with the first serviceable option he saw; grabbing a bright red baseball cap, he almost jumped over to the door, reaching around and blindly feeling until he felt the loop of the cap catch on the door knob on the other side. In the rush to pull the door close, there was a definite slam that surely somebody heard. He was too busy locking the bedroom to care about that, though. With the metallic click of a lock settling, he turned around to see what the doberman was up to in the ten seconds he had been occupied.

---

There was a moment of tense stillness, Shane listening to her breathing from around the corner. She had done this before, so he wasn’t that worried. This was just he sound of her gathering confidence. He had heard it a few times in their relationship, and he opted to lean against the wall, smiling to himself as he waited for her to collect herself. After one more sigh, he turned to look at where she stood on the other side. Sounds like she was just about ready with whatever she had in store.

“God, still can’t believe I bought these. Get over here before I rip this shit off.” Her flustered tone had set some idea of what waited for him, but even then he couldn’t have fully prepared himself for the sight that awaited him. He was beginning adjusted to the dimness of their suite, but he didn’t need to much light to see how well white lace contrasted against her dark fur. It almost glowed in the low light of the room, and the doberman in front of him biting in her lips in embarrassed frustration was hard to pull his sights off of.

Dancing lines of silks wrapped around her body, the curling vines becoming less dense and revealing more of the rising patch of caramel fur that covered the underside of her bountiful breasts. She hardly would need to try to rip the straining bra off, the material straining to keep both her chest and all her muscle toned body in. It was too dark to see, but he was familiar enough with her body to know that the black nipples of her soft mounds were teasing just over the brim of her lingerie.

His eyes traced downwards, and her lace panties were having just as much trouble as her bra. They weren’t undersized, but damn if they weren’t meant to look that way. The almost silver looking material hugged against her waist before dipping down with direction of his gaze. White mesh squeezed her fur, giving her a layer of color that was likely more effective for someone without a fur coat. Still, it’s main feature worked just as well; a single, stretched diamond of solid material slipped up from between her legs. An exaggerated promise of what laid beneath.

It must have killed her to buy lingerie. This was the woman who either wore a sports bra or no bra, and he had seen her spend more than one whole weekend completely topless. He had trouble imagining the scene, her walking into some lingerie store, stomping up to the desk, and demanding ‘something good and fucking sexy.’ She always had a way with describing what exactly she wanted. Judging from the look on her face, she was having second thoughts about whether or not she got what she had asked for.

Shane closed the distance in a single stride, wrapping his arms around her waist once more. Fingers dug into her toned cheeks while his thumbs hooked under the brim of the sheer panties. “White, babe?” He teased as he leaned in to nip at her lip, “You said you’d never wear white.” As he poked fun at her choice in lingerie color, she brought her hands up to the neck of his open shirt.

“The chick at the store insisted on it.” She explained as she pulled, tugging his shirt off of his shoulders before gravity began helping her undress him. “Said ‘the contrast’ was important. Better than some of the crazy shit I saw in there, trust me.” As his button up hung halfway on his back, held up by his arms, she nuzzled into his neck, “You’re wearing too much, stud. Get rid of it.” Her jaws clicked as she teasingly snapped at him. As his hands left her ass, she took the opportunity to drop to her knees, hooking her fingers into his pants while working on freeing him from them. There was a pleased grin on her face as she spotted the bulge printing against the denim, “Someone needs room to breath.” The doberman snickered as the shirt hit the floor behind Shane.

She didn’t need to see what she was doing, popping the button off with just a thumb as she looked up at his body. More cuts and scars, far more severe than the ones on his face. As he had put it, more than a few people had ‘got him good, but it never stuck.’ The multiple jagged, slash shaped scars that decorated his torso were hard to look past, but when she did, that’s when she was able to spot the more subtle little circles that dotted his body. She vividly remembered her friend commenting on how dangerous he seemed even when he was laughing, but Paige couldn’t be convinced he was anything more than a stubborn tree; weathered by the seasons, but still standing strong. Then again, she also found him calming when most people couldn’t bring themselves to relax around him. Part of her had to admit she might not be the best judge of character.

The doberman’s ears twitched at his sigh of relief as she pulled the zipper down. “Swear, there was plenty of room down there when we got here.” He said as he scratched the back of his head, the stupid smirk on his face causing her to roll her eyes. Readjusting her grip, she dipped her fingers into his pants a little deeper to catch the boxers that were peeking out at her from his open zipper. She planted a kiss on his stomach, eyes closing shut as his hand reached down and patted her head, one of her ears sticking out between his thumb and forefinger. For a moment, she paused to enjoy moment of tenderness as he caressed her, rubbing her head back into his palm.

“Shane.”
“Yeah?”
“Do I look good? In this stuff, I mean.”

	He chuckled. She recognized the kind of laugh it was; it was the kind of laugh he did whenever someone asked him something with an obvious answer. Her eyes opened to look up at him, and he was looking down with that soft smile of his. “Baby, I don’t even deserve this.”

The doberman huffed, “Just shut up. It’s too late to say that now, and you goddamn know it.” She grinned before pinching a bit of his skin in between her knuckles, causing him to jump a bit before shaking his head. Pleased with herself, she went back to the task at hand. Pulling downward, the pants came falling down before catching at his knees. That was good enough for her, because it was all the room his cock needed to spring up against the side of muzzle. Nuzzling up to it, her nose followed along his length until she was kissing at the base of it.

 Part of her wished they would bother to break out a tape measure one of these days, that way she would have a definite size to brag about. Instead, all she could do to describe it was say it was ‘heavy.’ Definitely thick, and long enough that even when considering her pointed muzzle she could slip a handle between her lips and his stomach with the head of his cock pushing into her throat. Delightfully drool-worthy, and it was all hers now.

His hand was still resting on her head, but she hardly needed instruction before her lips found his sack and began planting chaste kisses. Both of her hands slid up from his knees, one resting on his thigh while the other gently wrapped around his shaft. Not truly stroking it, but rather tracing her furred fingers along the length of it. The coo of pleasure she heard from overhead told her to continue, and she grinned as she nosed at his heavy orbs. “Alright boys, it’s the big night.” She pushed her lips against them for a wet kiss, opening her maw slightly to suckle on each one before sighing happily, “Mama won’t forgive any slacking.” A snort sounded off above her before Shane’s hand pressed her forward and she obliged. Once again her mouth opened, wider this time as she softly sucked and licked at his sack with her wide tongue.

While she tended to him below with her mouth, her grip around his dick tightened as she began to properly stroke him. Her hand made the long journey from tip to base every few seconds, slowly working him as she once again found herself appreciating it. A lovely detail few brought up when it came to being human; it was mostly uniform from start to finish. No thin pointed tip to make it easy for either of them when it came to getting it in, but she also didn’t have to worry about some troublesome knot leaving her in need of an ice pack after each round. And as she aimed her muzzle upwards to lap at the base of his cock, she knew there would be plenty of rounds in their future tonight.

What she didn’t expect was him using his grip on her to pull her away from his crotch, causing her to let out an upset growl as he played with her hair. “I - ah, we, paid too much to do this standing up. Come on, get that stubby tailed ass of yours on the bed.” Huffing, Paige reluctantly got herself up from the floor, giving him a slap on his ass as she did so. For however upset she was though, her tail was going crazy, betraying her mood as she turned around and climbed onto the bed.

“I was getting into it, you know. I was - what the fuck.” She was cutoff midway into her boiling up rant when she felt herself sink into the mattress. “Damn, do they make their beds out of free range clouds?” Neither of them were very accustomed to high class luxury, and this was enough of a discovery to distract them from the moment. Shane had a look of doubt on his face as he followed, watching her bounce on her hands and knees as he climbed onto the bed. Immediately he understood as he sank down, blinking in surprise

“I can’t even afford to be sitting on this.”
“Right? Holy shit.”

He couldn’t help but laugh as he got comfortable in the middle of the bed, laying on his back and using a pillow to hold his head up as he watched her. That prick standing up tall brought her back into the moment and she began crawling over to him. Holding a hand up, he did a spinning motion with his finger. “Pull those panties off and turn that ass around. It’s no fair if only you get something to do.” Paige nodded, reaching down to pull the slinky bottom off before stopping herself as she remembered something.

“Oh yeah, that’s the thing she told me about these. You’ll love it, stud, just watch.” Rather than pull off the lingerie, she simply crawled into position, swinging her legs over his head before wiggling her butt in front of his face. Now he was given a proper look at her panties; again purposely not much besides covering her ass in thin white mesh that stuck out in the low light, but there was that solid diamond covering her mound. There was a glistening wetness underneath, just barely visible because of how close he was, but he was distracted by her grabbing at his hands. “Okay so…grab at the sides near the diamond thing. And tug it apart. I swear, this is the craziest shit.”

He raised an eyebrow at her excitement, slipping a couple fingers underneath her panties and pinching with this thumbs. “I swear, if this does what I think it does…” All the while, her tail was going ballistic to the point where she was effectively wiggling on top of him. She wasn’t going to answer any of his concerns, her toothy smile urging him to keep going. Sighing, he braced himself before pulling his hands apart. Except with almost minimal amounts of effort, there was a quiet rip and the diamond that had been concealing her sex pulled cleanly apart, going from something that had been covering her up to providing a white diamond shaped outline for him to stare at. There was a moment of silence as he took it in before he started laughing. “Are you fucking kidding me? This is ridiculous. Who makes this shit?”

The moment he started laughing, so did she, looking over her shoulder as she watched his reaction. “Right? That’s what I fucking thought. When I asked why this set came with so many panties but only one top, she just pulled one out and showed me. Got’em because I thought you would get a kick out of it.” He just sat there, shaking his head and laughing as he pulled his hands free and onto her thighs, squeezing them as he mumbled something about ‘goddamn Cracker Jack prizes.’ She shook her ass one more time before pushing it back onto him, “Alright, show’s over. Get to work.” She barked as she turned back to the real task at hand.

Fur brushed against skin as her body sank down against his, and her arms draped over his thighs as she leaned forward. She had gotten a taste of it earlier, but now she could really enjoy his cock as she ran her tongue along it. The wide muscle dragged along the top, lovingly slathering it in her spittle before she brought a hand up to hold the base of the heavy pole. The man underneath her shuddered in reaction, before returning the favor as she leaned in for a second go. Fingers dug onto the fur on her cheeks as she was pulled back and felt his face slip in between her thighs. She felt his breath on her leaking slit for a moment before he ran his tongue between her folds, from bottom to top. She must have been more worked up than she imagined, since with just that she gripped onto his thigh with her free hand and heard herself groan.

Just another benefit of taking a human lover was how close they could bring their face in when between a pair of legs. No long muzzle and cold nose, just lips and a surprisingly dexterous tongue. A tongue that Shane was putting to used as he buried himself into his prize. He could feel her forcing herself to hold still as he worked over her entrance, getting her primed and ready for what was to follow when they were done tasting each other. His hand raised to give her ass a light pat, reminding her that she was doing something before he started eating her out. There was a snicker from the bottom of the bed, “Sorry, hard to be dinner and the show at the same time.” That earned her a pinch, causing Paige to yipe. She got the message though, since moments later he could feel her rolling her tongue along the side of his length. She kissed the head of his cock before shifting to the other side, and doing the same thing, pressing her tongue in against each vein she came across.

The bedroom of the suite filled with the sound of slurps, gasps, and groans as they found a rhythm with each other. The doberman would have to stop every now and then to simply hold onto his legs as he traced his tongue around her clit, finishing his assault as he dragged his way back up and pulled a shaky moan from her. Of course, she would return the favor as she put both of her hands to work; the palm of one hand was simply rolling his sack slowly, never letting up as she stroked the lower part of his cock. The rest of that breeding tool was being tended to by her maw, tongue refusing to stop as she lathered it with adoring attention. She couldn’t help grinning to herself as she felt him squirm underneath her, and her ears flicked each time she caught a muttered swear slip from between her legs.

Eventually she brought her lips to the head of his cock, pressing her lips against it until they were forced to open by it as she leaned forward. Exhaling through her nose, she slowly slipped more of his girth into her mouth. Her tongue refused to rest, rolling in a slow circle around the throbbing flesh. Pressing on, she began to lower herself down his cock, lips pressing down on each sensitive spot of his she had ever found. Inch after inch slipped past her lips, before finding her limit as he threatened to slip into her throat. Not unfamiliar territory for either of them, but that’s not what fit the mood. Not at this moment; she could test herself another time, but right now called for something more sensual and passionate.

Passionate she could do. It’s not like either of them were unfamiliar with how loud she could howl when riled up. Sensual would be new territory for Paige, though. Tonight though, she would have to learn as she went. Breathing out, she pulled her hands from the ‘usual’ positions, leaving fingers trailing against his skin. They rested against the bottom half of his cock, forming a weak brace to hold it steady as she began to bob along what she could fit into her maw Her fingertips traced up and down in time with her muzzled, teasing with a uncharacteristically soft touch. She knew she was getting to him from how often he stopped to mutter or groan, but he made up for it by more thoroughly tending to her heated slit.

It became an odd rhythm of each of them having to stop for a few seconds and indulging in the haze inducing attention of their lover, only to pick up the slack and force the other take their ‘break.’ She had him swearing and groaning, and then he would dive back into her and have her eyes threatening to roll back into her head. He could turn her into a melted puddle with just his mouth, and he was putting all of that experience to use as he traced his tongue along every sensitive spot he had ever found while they had been together. Her toes curled with each tease at her entrance, pushing up against it until his tongue sank in and dragged against the inner walls just long enough to make her shudder before pulling back. Genuine moans escaped her each time, but she could taste that salty warmth trickling against her tongue as whenever it was her turn again and she could see his legs pull up before stretching out again just before he took over once more.

It took so much effort out of her just to hold this deliberate pace, and with each pass at her he threatened to shatter her concentration. She ached to just throw herself at this and fall into their usual rutting frenzy, but they would only get this night once. Surprisingly, it wasn’t her that finally broke the spell, but Shane, squeezing at her ass and slapping it to get her attention. “Alright, that’s enough of this.” Pulling off of his cock and taking her first real breath since they started this, she looked over her shoulder to see what he meant. As she did so, he pulled her leg over his head to let himself free. It would make sense that they would move onto the main course eventually, but she wasn’t expecting him to complete the motion by actually tossing her onto her back.

The doberman yelped in surprise as she was flipped over, but he busied himself by grabbing a small pillow as she adjusted to her new position. One hand on her waist to lift her ass up before he stuffed the pillow underneath her, angling her lower half upwards. “God, finally.” She huffed out, less out of irritation and more of relief as she looked up at the man looming over her. Her eyes trailed down to the cock in his hands as he slipped between her legs. He could tell by the way she was breathing that he could ram it in right there without warning and she would only scream in thanks. Tonight called for a more intimate approach though, and he reached for her hand, squeezing it gently before guiding it down between her legs.

He never needed any help getting it in, and in fact could probably walk through a room in pitch black darkness, and still find his mark. Regardless, she wrapped her fingers around his length and aimed it downwards to the diamond outline in her panties. They hadn’t been this measured and hesitant even on their first time together, and they had both long lost count of how many times they’ve fucked. Yet both of them realized they were holding their breath as his cock head was brought against her soaked cunt. Just resting against her slit she felt hot, and he could see her ears pinned back and her other hand preemptively clutching at the covers of the bed.

Whatever reservations and worries he had were thrown far away when she snorted and laughed, “Is this the part where I ask you to be gentle?” He couldn’t help but laugh with her, hand shifting from hers to her thigh, “You’d scare me if you did. ” Even with her dark fur, or maybe just because how well he knew her, he could tell she was smiling as she looked up to him. “No take backs?” She teased, rubbing a finger back and forth against his shaft. “Not without a lawyer present.” There was another snort from her before she stretched out her free leg, wrapping around the back of his. He heard her take a deep breath before she let herself fall back onto the bed, “I’m all yours, stud.” She cooed as she pulled at him, urging him forward.

With nothing more to be said, and a needy doberman to please Shane began to lean forward, and after a brief moment of straining, began to sink his cock into her. Immediately she gasped and her body tensed, before she forced herself to relax. She hissed through clenched teeth as she took him, savoring the slow, half-pleasure-half-pain process of being spread apart by his hefty dick. There was a love-hate relationship with how he started them off like this every time; one on hand, he was far too gifted to just slam that thing in one thrust. On the other, due to his size and how slow he hilted himself into her sex, it tended to fuck with her sense of time. What had taken only a handful of seconds felt like entire minutes in her mind. So big, yet it felt like he never ran out of cock to stuff her with with how long it took. Even as her fingers traced along his length, inviting each inch in before welcoming it into her cunt, she couldn’t tell when he was almost there until her hand was pressing up against his stomach as he finally touched home. 

He wasn’t entirely to blame for this, even if he did take a bit of pride in how she writhed and squirmed while being fed his cock. Part of him was sure she wasn’t even aware of how hard she was clenching down on his shaft, slowing him down even further before her body would let up. The deeper he got, the tighter she squeezed. It was expected; her body was built for a canine shaped cock that tapered off into a thin point, so his human cock, thick from base to tip, was pressed up against sensitive bundles of nerves that would otherwise go ignored. What resulted was Paige being put into a hazed state as he lodged himself into her, the throbbing of his girth making it impossible to ignore as she clawed at the blanket. Not like she was making it any easier on him; if her entrance was hot, her inner walls were almost burning up, slick and seemingly trying their best to milk his cock even as the two of them laid still.

Her now free hand pulled from his stomach and rested on hers, a finger tracing a circle in her fur where she felt the fullness inside of her end. She sighed happily as she adjusted to its presence before reaching back up to him and scratching lightly at his chest, “I got a surprise for you~” She murmured. As he lowered his chest down to hers, her hands slipped over his shoulders. Her legs followed suit, her toes buried into the pit of his knees as he announced his arrival with a kiss to her neck. “Is this really the time?” He said as he slipped his arms underneath her head. “You said there would be no take backs,” she teased while nipping at his ear before squeezing him close, “I took a few pills before we got here. Got’em from a friend when I told her I met ‘the one.’ ” Even in the dark she could see his confusion, so she brought her legs up and wrapped them around his waist, “Just two or three breeding pills, nothing to worry about. You don’t mind raising a pup, do you?”

There was a beat as Shane put two and two together, before he started to chuckle. Pulling himself up to line his lips up to her muzzle, he pressed in for a kiss. She happily accepted it, turning her head and opening her mouth wide enough for a passionate bout of tongue wrestling. A few seconds in, she whined into the kiss. Of course she would; he was pulling his hips back and she could feel the fullness of his cock leaving her. The whine was almost immediately replaced by a thankful moan as he brought his body back down with a hearty clap. Her nails dug into his shoulder blades as she held the kiss despite this, but when he did it again and their hips collided a second time, she wasn’t able to both make out with him and be fucked at the same time. Pulling her head back, she cried out right into his ear.

“Just one?” He huffed as he began to pick up speed, his cock never fully leaving her cunt before being driven back in, “I’m thinking three or - ha- four.” His boast definitely wasn’t unwarranted, not with the weight of his sack as it slapped against her ass. She was keenly aware of how much of a mess he could make of her cunt, but before now it was just because she found it hot. Now her body was screaming for him to lay claim to her. Something he was reminded off with how hard she was clamping down on his cock each time he pulled back. He sat up, pulling her hands off his shoulders and onto the bed as he pinned them there, pushing his fingers in between hers. The gold of the bands on each of their left hands gleamed even in the dark. “How about it? A big ol’ family - nnff - sound good?”

“Yes!” The doberman almost howled as another thrust came down, both in agreement and raw pleasure. Five years ago, she would have spit on the idea of raising a family. That was for Daisy-Do-Nothing’s and timid women. Now, she was looking up at the man that two days ago she was standing at an altar with. Her fingers went straight out before curling and grabbing onto his hand, intertwining with his so she could hold on as each buck of his hips rocked her body. “You gotta - oooh fuck - give me’em first!” As if taunted by this, he shifted gears again. The long, slow pulls gave way to a frenzied rush to get just enough of his thick cock out of her before he could really slam it home.

 Either because it was meant to, or that was just how hard he was giving it to her, the lacy bra began to loose its hold on her chest. Each time the clap of their hips filled the suite, it slipped a little lower until finally her breasts came free. Finally unrestrained, they bounced with each thrust she took. A good show in and of itself, Shane wasn’t just watching her chest. He took in every detail he could in the dark. How she arched her back, how she bit her lip before each pleasured swear force its way out of her, the way it sounded as her fur brushed against the blanket every time she moved. For a few seconds at a time, she even managed to lock eyes with him, sharing a tender moment before the next surge of pleasure forced them shut. 

What she saw was the grizzled man she adored, with the most strained face he ever put on. The one that only she got to see in their most private moments. His usually relaxed demeanor gone, replaced by a furrow brow, panting and grunting as he did everything he could to hear her lustful howling. The muscled hips rolling in between her legs insured he would, and if he hadn’t pinned her hands to the bed, she would be digging her nails right into that wide back of his. The fact that his upper back sported an series of cuts and fresh scars around his collar bone and shoulder blades was testament to how far over the edge he could send her. 

Her muzzled swapped between clenched tight in a poor attempt to not scream, and wide opened as she called out for him with staggered moans, interrupted mid-howl by his thrusts. “Nnnffuc-king yes-ss-ss!” She wanted everything he had to give her, and not a drop less. Even the steady flow of pre-cum against her walls was setting her off, her body begging to be rewarded for taking him so well. She should have listened to her friend’s warning about those pills, the way it was causing her to lose focus. This wasn’t simply a passionate lay; she was finding herself aching at the very thought of him getting off, to feel him shudder as he usually did as he came. They had done this so many times before, but never had she wanted him this badly.

Suddenly his body was pressed against hers, slumping down as he once again changed his rhythm. She could hear he was short of breath with how he was gasping, but she was doing no better. He had settled into a rut against her body, constantly pounding her with short thrusts that had him shoved deep in her and staying deep. The heavy bucks that had knocked her top off hadn’t dizzied her like this, replacing her loud outbursts with whines of need that she filled his ears with. They were like whispers compared to those, and she struggled to even speak as the raucous noise of their act was replaced by the subdued sounds of his grunts and hammering movement.

She was losing track of reality, losing awareness of their surroundings as the creeping sensation of pressure began to grow. Anything could set her off at this point, and she couldn’t keep her eyes open as her head fell back. “Shaaane,” she whimpered, and she could feel his grip on her hand tightened. They had held full conversations before that were less meaningful than that one squeeze. With just that, she let herself submit to the pleasure that was threatening to bowl her over and leave her drooling. Any second now, and she was going to fly off the deep end hard enough to make him worry.

Shane beat her to it. In a rare show of complete submission, likely due to the pills, she had given him total control of the pace of things. Instead of pushing him over and switching positions a few times where they had to find their rhythm again, she opted to simply take it. Once they had started going at it, she wanted nothing but more. Or, at the very least, her body did. He couldn’t remember the last time she felt this hot, or the last time her cunt had so desperately squeezed at his cock. From the moment he had hilted into her, he had known that pulling out wasn’t on the table. The premise of giving her children was just an extra touch of motivation.

Hearing her wail for him as he pinned her to the bed, he squeezed her hand to let her know he was right there with her. Damn sure he wasn’t in condition to say it, the way he was sweating. He could hear her whines becoming higher pitch and go on for longer with each one that came out of her, and it only spurred him on. She was gripping tighter onto his hands, her nails starting to break skin. Part of him wanted to try for something special at the end, but that building spot of pressure told him he didn’t have time. Really, it was a wonder he even noticed it before his hips slammed in and he groaned, “Oh fuck…”

The low volume of his swear belied the intensity of his orgasm. He managed a ragged gasp that made Paige’s ear twitch, before he shuddered and came. The first rope of cum that landed in her immediately set her off as her back arched, a weakened whine escaping her as her walls suddenly clamped down on his cock. Her legs locked him down as deep as she could get him, not letting him even risk pulling back in his mid-orgasm thrusts as he tried to empty everything he had. He had finally given her what she was burning up for, and took over that process as her cunt spasmed and squeezed around it.

They had purposely stopped having sex a few weeks before the ceremony just to make sure this night was special, and now she was reaping the rewards as he painted her insides white with his seed. Each shot shook her, toes curling and uncurling as his cock jumped and twitched with every delivery. This was a high she hadn’t expected as her climax dragged on, any chance of it lulling to a stop being kickstarted with a spike of pleasure with each volley of thick human cum. Unlike watery, thin canine seed, this was sticking where it landed, dragging against her walls as he filled her.

And filled her he did, her snatch running out of room to keep it all in before he ran out of spunk to give. It was flowing out in what little space there was between his cock and her entrance, trickling down her cheeks and his sack before dripping onto the pillow he had hoisted her on. A mess that would have to be dealt with, but they had wordlessly and simultaneously decided that could wait until they could remember what day it was again. For now, they were preoccupied riding out their orgasms and catching their breath.

Even as things finally died down, she still was shaking underneath him, panting heavily as they shared a quiet moment in an attempt to catch their breath. When he moved to sit up, she squeezed him with her legs and he was met with a growl. Knowing better than to ruin the moment, he instead brought himself up on his elbows. Finding himself perched at her lips, he began pecking at her chin and neck softly. That pacified her for the moment, squeezing his hand in approval. He leaned down to rub his nose with hers, finding it almost amusingly cold compared to how hot the rest of her body was, “Paige Evette Lantry, you are the most beautiful woman a man could marry.”

She snorted, as she usually did, before kissing him right on the lips. When it broke, she let out a happy sigh. “Shane Jeremy Lantry, you’re a terrible with words. Most beautiful woman? Really? That’s what you go with on our honeymoon?” Immediately he was laughing, and he gave a dramatic sigh of defeat. “Fine, not most beautiful. How about…baddest bitch a man can handle.” There was pause. “Barely.” The doberman giggled, nodding, “I knew you were a poet, stud. Gotta be able to do something right, right?” He simply shook his head as she grinned up at him.

Her hands tugged in his grip, and he let go, holding himself up so she do whatever she was trying to accomplish underneath him. Immediately, she grabbed his left hand, bring it up to her face and petting herself with it. Or rather, rubbing the wedding band against her cheek. A simple gold band, nothing fancy. She was completely unsurprised when she had seen it, since it suited him perfectly. In fact, the one who was surprised was him when she insisted on getting the same thing. No diamond, no engravings. Just a ring of shiny yellow metal that said she was taken. There was nothing to prove. Except maybe to her family that someone would marry her in the first place, really.

“Shane?”
“Yeah, baby?”
“I love you. Scars and all.”
“God, I’d fucking hope so.”

He hardly had time to react before she had reached up and punched him in the shoulder. “Ow,” he chuckled as he rubbed it, “Did you want me to recite my wedding vows again?” Huffing, she snorted, “I’d expect you to at least try to be romantic, you fucker.” He made a face, “I just tried - ah, whatever.” She started snickering, and he sighed. “I love you from your pointed ears to your stubby tail, you crazy thing.”

“And everything in between?”
“And everything in between.”

Satisfied, she let go of his hand to reach up and wrap her arms around his neck. As they kissed again, she finally relented from her death grip on his waist with her legs. Slowly they slid down, before she wrapped and rested them on the back of his. He wasn’t going anywhere, and she knew that. But she wanted to him to keep close, so that’s where he stayed.
