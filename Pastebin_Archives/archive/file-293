At the start of the latest season, he was drowning in debts, worked a dead-end job, still hadn&#039;t had a date ever since season 15, and had little to no connections with his family. The latest episode he was very downbeat; his only excitement in the day coming from his computer. Of course he&#039;d have no good reason to ever go back to that.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&#039;... Wait. Wait wait wait wait...

I insist, I don&#039;t want you freezing or feeling bad.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a few seconds, he nods, sets your tiny beating heart aflame once more with his grin, and thanks you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lead the way up to your bedroom, eagerly grinning in anticipation for something among a list of things you&#039;ve been wanting for a very long time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You enter your bedroom with Anon following close behind you, motioning towards your grey blanketed bed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As he approaches the bed he was unceremoniously dumped onto just an hour ago, you have another slight idea</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Turning to &quot;look through&quot; the top drawer of your dresser, you rummage around your various pairs of socks and undergarments before turning to sheepishly look at Anon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uh... Hey, I just realized that I... Don&#039;t have any sets of pajamas.&quot; you inform him. &quot;I don&#039;t want to, uh, weird you out, but is it OK with you if I sleep in just a... shirt and undies?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Though only slight, you can see his ears begin to turn red</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yeah, that&#039;s no problem.&quot; he answers, his voice much less obvious of his true opinion than his body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&#039;Oh hell yes.&#039; you inwardly cheer, remembering his usual sleeping attire of just briefs from quite a few raunchy episodes set late at night</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After handing him a spare toothbrush, prepping yourself for bed and quickly excusing yourself to dress down to just a shirt and panties, you reenter your bedroom to see Anon slowly crawling under the bed </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Unfortunately, fully clothed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&#039;No, wait, fuck.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You OK with sleeping like that?&quot; you ask</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well, I didn&#039;t want to be rude by taking anything off.&quot; he answers, his eye contact ever so briefly disconnecting with yours to look downward at your near bare legs and crotch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not wanting to push any further and show yourself to be the perverted little rodent that you are, you say &quot;Just didn&#039;t want you to overheat or anything.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Turning off the lights, you crawl into your bed, secretly giddy with excitement for not only having someone to sleep with, but THE Anon to cuddle!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or, you would be cuddling if he didn&#039;t pin himself against the wall, leaving ample room between you and him</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once again, you want to distance yourself from any negative implications, as painful as it is to force yourself to not indulge in your fantasies straight away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well...

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;You&#039;re not sure what to make of this
&gt;Anon is in your bedroom
&gt;No, not a bodypillow or cosplayer, THE Anon
&gt;Furless skin, plain T-Shirt, near 6 foot height (or so he claims), no tail and all, lying unconscious on your bed
&gt;Sure, you could chalk it up to a really well-done cosplay, but his method of arrival is what solidifies your proof of him being the real deal
&gt;You wished for him from a dinky looking CYOA
&gt;It wasn&#039;t anything you paid much mind to, just something to pass the time while browsing the internet during the winter standstill between heavy snowfall and holiday celebrations
&gt;Post your wish, see if the last two numbers in your post number hits that lucky spot, then brag about you winning
&gt;Others having already made their own wishes and shitposts, you add on to the pile with your own post stating &quot;I want an Anon from An Anonymous Proxy Near You to love&quot;
&gt;Sure enough, you not only won, but you got quads
&gt;Before you could brag about your small winnings, you were quickly blinded by a bright flash quickly filling your room
&gt;As you blink away the white haze from your eyes, you look around the room and nearly jump out of your chair as you spot a figure standing near your bed looking your way
&gt;Scrambling for some item of improvised use as a weapon on your desk, you see the blurry figure stumble from side to side before collapsing backwards onto your bed
&gt;You watch his still form for a minute, then put your plastic, vidya figurine back to the side of the desk
&gt;Rubbing the last of the blur from your eyes, you slowly approach your bed to examine the sudden intruder
&gt;Your eyes widen as you quickly recognize who it is
&gt;It was Anon
&gt;The next several minutes were spent with you feeling his smooth skin, making sure he was alive, checking to see if this really WAS him, and then quickly entering a mixture of incomparable ecstasy, shock, and confusion
&gt;The thread still up with your post in the center, every so often automatically updating with a post most likely congratulating your get, you quickly realized his method of arrival
&gt;Wonder and bewilderment once again washing over you as you begin to comprehend the true existence of the existence of wishes, your trip on this train of thought came to a swift end as a light groan emanated from Anon
&gt;His body began to stir, his hands slowly reaching up to his own face
&gt;You&#039;re not sure at all what to do, but a sudden thought came across to you as you spotted your form in the mirror
&gt;Brown haired with a bushy tail, round fuzzy ears, four feet tall with a tan color of fur on your chubby belly, fluffy cheeks, and perky breasts, and a set of thick framed glasses perched on your button nose; all normal details for a chipmunk such as you
&gt;But most importantly at the moment: you&#039;re dressed in only a bra and loose panties, having discarded your pants and shirt the side for comfort
&gt;As various awkward and disastrous scenarios regarding his first impression of you begin to fill your mind, you scramble for your clothes and hurriedly try to put on your shirt
&gt;Just before you can shove your last arm through the sleeve, you freeze as you see a groggy Anon viewing you with confusion
&gt;A thick tension is held in the short span of time you two silently stare at one another
&gt;You still frozen in place with your shirt halfway on your body and pants next to your feet, and him quietly observing you with a disoriented expression as he sits up on your bed
&gt;You don&#039;t know what to say
&gt;The silence must be broken
&gt;&quot;...Hi?&quot; you quietly peep
&gt;&quot;What the hell...&quot; Anon mutters, slowly pushing himself back against the wall
&gt;You finish putting on your shirt and blindly reach down for your pants as you state, &quot;It&#039;s not what it looks like! I&#039;m just-&quot;
&gt;&quot;What is this?!&quot; he shouts, stumbling off of the bed and onto the floor
&gt;You jump backwards with a meep as the confused Anon scrambles past you and out of the room
&gt;Quickly putting your pants on, you follow after him as you hear his footsteps echo through the house from down the stairs
&gt;Once you reach the bottom of the stairs, you hear the front door get thrown open and feel a blast of cold air rush through the house
&gt;You turn the corner and see Anon standing before a pile of snow as tall as you blocking the way out, with only more snow equally as mountainous outside in the overpowering snowstorm
&gt;You can see his head look from left to right as he tries to figure some way of escape, but considering his modest clothing, you assume he is reluctant due to his poor chances of survival in the desert of snow
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s OK, I wont hurt you.&quot; you try to explain in an attempt to calm him, mentally berating yourself for having said something more appropriate for a toddler or injured animal
&gt;Anon turns around, his body already beginning to shiver from exposure to the low temperatures and expression still frightened and confused
&gt;&quot;I got some... uh...&quot;, you say, trailing off as you try to recall anything you have that he might like
&gt;&#039;Don&#039;t say eggs, don&#039;t say eggs.&#039;
&gt;As you quietly ponder, a memory resurfaced
&gt;You recall a particular product placement that was pushed heavily around season 16, then became a small staple throughout the series
&gt;It was his, or at least it was for the Anon in the show&#039;s, favorite drink, and he even had his own short series of bottles with his depiction on the label
&gt;&quot;I got some Dr. Pepper?&quot;
&gt;Things have calmed down for the moment
&gt;Though reluctantly, he accepted your offer of Dr. Pepper and is attempting to relax in the living room while sitting across from you on the sofa
&gt;His body still shivers, though you&#039;re not sure if it&#039;s because of the lack of proper heating in order to save money or because he still isn&#039;t used to suddenly arriving here
&gt;&quot;So... Do you know what happened when you, uh... Arrived here?&quot; you ask, knowing fully well of how and why he suddenly appeared in your bedroom
&gt;&quot;I was just playing video games at home and I blacked out, then I woke up to you undressing...&quot; Anon says, holding onto the Dr. Pepper tightly
&gt;You brush at your cheek fluff in an attempt to look casual, dismissing his claim with &quot;No, no, you just appeared when I was... about to go to bed.&quot;
&gt;Not wanting to paint yourself as a lazy slob, you feel a slight sense of relief as he nods to your answer
&gt;Aside from the wind blowing outside, the room is silent as you try to think of something to further the conversation
&gt;You decide to ask about him; where he&#039;s from, what his name is, other questions of the sort
&gt;Of course, you already knew everything down to his birthday, favorite color, and even his opinion regarding Skub
&gt;But not only was it an attempt to soothe his nerves by allowing him to speak, but you wanted to disguise your knowledge of his personal life being contained within a foreign cartoon
&gt;Perhaps later you could tell him of this, but a part of your brain tells you that informing him of being the star of a fictional TV show for filthy geeks such as you at this current moment would probably send him on a fit
&gt;But then he asks about you
&gt;While you don&#039;t want to out yourself as a stay-at-home loser who spends all of her free time at the computer, you skip your hobbies
&gt;&quot;My name is Tammy. I work at the grocery store several minutes out of the neighborhood, but I&#039;m out till the snow clears.&quot;
&gt;&#039;A lame explanation, but it works.&#039;
&gt;&quot;Are there others... like you?&quot; he asks, sipping his drink
&gt;You nod and answer &quot;Well, yeah, others like me, but there are others like wolves, bears, mice, water bears... The neighbor next door is a raccoon, and uh... That sort of deal.&quot;
&gt;Another pregnant pause, another questioning of your choice of answer as Anon quietly ponders about his situation
&gt;&#039;For a magical wish, this really isn&#039;t that fantastical. I feel a bit bad about this...&#039;
&gt;Anon takes a drink from his soda and shivers at the cold temperature in the room
&gt;&quot;How long will the snow last?&quot; he finally asks
&gt;&quot;From what the weather tells me, not for six days. Why?&quot; you ask
&gt;&#039;He wants to leave. I don&#039;t blame him, but he&#039;s got nowhere to go. Hell, if anything, he&#039;ll just be picked up by the nearest group of suits to be dissected if fics about the only real life human on the planet is anything to go by.&#039;
&gt;Anon looks back down at his soda, his previously calmed expression returning to a look of worry
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t know.&quot; he finally answers
&gt;&quot;You want to go back to your home?&quot; you ask, guilt beginning to settle in
&gt;A quick smile flashes on his face as he gives a short laugh, confusing you somewhat at his response
&gt;&quot;Except for my computer, no. Don&#039;t really have much reason to go back home.&quot; he answers
&gt;&#039;That&#039;s right, I forgot. At the start of the latest season, he was drowning in debts, worked a dead-end job, still hadn&#039;t had a date ever since season 15, and had little to no connections with his family. The latest episode he was very downbeat; his only excitement in the day coming from his computer. Of course he&#039;d have no good reason to ever go back to that.&#039;
&gt;&#039;... Wait. Wait wait wait wait... Shit, this might just work.&#039;
&gt;&quot;You can stay here, if you want. I-I mean, it isn&#039;t right to just toss you out in the snow, and all.&quot;
&gt;Then you see it
&gt;That simple thing that sets your heart aflutter and leaves your head light, something you&#039;ve seen many times before on his show but never in person
&gt;He smiles, just barely showing his teeth past his cute, human lips and says &quot;Thank you.&quot;
&gt;You try to hide your obvious swooning, thankful you&#039;re not as visually obvious as humans are when blushing
&gt;&quot;Sorry, but where can I sleep?&quot;
&gt;&#039;Huh?&#039;
&gt;&quot;Huh?&quot; you ask, returning your attention back to Anon
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m getting tired. Is the couch OK?&quot; he asks
&gt;&quot;I mean, I guess, but you&#039;ll be freezing cold down here even with a cover. The room has poor heating.&quot; you lie, fully knowing that the living room&#039;s heat is turned down just because you solely spend 90% of your time at home in your bedroom
&gt;&quot;Oh. Is there a spare bedroom?&quot;
&gt;You DO have an extra room, but it&#039;s more suited for storage
&gt;You only bought one bed for yourself, only entertaining the idea of guests staying over to sleep on your couch
&gt;&quot;Sorry, the only room with a bed is mine. But... I&#039;m fine with you sleeping with me. In bed! I&#039;m- I&#039;m fine with you sleeping in bed with me!&quot; you stumble
&gt;&quot;Are you sure? I can sleep on the floor if it&#039;s a problem.&quot; he says
&gt;You wave your hand dismissively and say &quot;No, no, please. I insist, I don&#039;t want you freezing or feeling bad.&quot;
&gt;After a few seconds, he nods, sets your tiny beating heart aflame once more with his grin, and thanks you
&gt;You lead the way up to your bedroom, eagerly grinning in anticipation for something among a list of things you&#039;ve been wanting for a very long time
&gt;You enter your bedroom with Anon following close behind you, motioning towards your grey blanketed bed
&gt;As he approaches the bed he was unceremoniously dumped onto just an hour ago, you have another slight idea
&gt;Turning to &quot;look through&quot; the top drawer of your dresser, you rummage around your various pairs of socks and undergarments before turning to sheepishly look at Anon
&gt;&quot;Uh... Hey, I just realized that I... Don&#039;t have any sets of pajamas.&quot; you inform him. &quot;I don&#039;t want to, uh, weird you out, but is it OK with you if I sleep in just a... shirt and undies?&quot;
&gt;Though only slight, you can see his ears begin to turn red
&gt;&quot;Yeah, that&#039;s no problem.&quot; he answers, his voice much less obvious of his true opinion than his body
&gt;&#039;Oh hell yes.&#039; you inwardly cheer, remembering his usual sleeping attire of just briefs from quite a few raunchy episodes set late at night
&gt;After handing him a spare toothbrush, prepping yourself for bed and quickly excusing yourself to dress down to just a shirt and panties, you reenter your bedroom to see Anon slowly crawling under the bed 
&gt;Unfortunately, fully clothed
&gt;&#039;No, wait, fuck.&#039;
&gt;&quot;You OK with sleeping like that?&quot; you ask
&gt;&quot;Well, I didn&#039;t want to be rude by taking anything off.&quot; he answers, his eye contact ever so briefly disconnecting with yours to look downward at your near bare legs and crotch
&gt;Not wanting to push any further and show yourself to be the perverted little rodent that you are, you say &quot;Just didn&#039;t want you to overheat or anything.&quot;
&gt;Turning off the lights, you crawl into your bed, secretly giddy with excitement for not only having someone to sleep with, but THE Anon to cuddle!
&gt;Or, you would be cuddling if he didn&#039;t pin himself against the wall, leaving ample room between you and him
&gt;Once again, you want to distance yourself from any negative implications, as painful as it is to force yourself to not indulge in your fantasies straight away
&gt;&quot;Well... Goodnight.&quot; you say, shifting to where your back is to him
&gt;&quot;Goodnight.&quot; Anon says
&gt;Excitement still overwhelming your nerves, you quietly lay on your side and wait
&gt;You listen in on the sound of cloth shifting, Anon breathing and idle scratching of his furless skin until you hear what you what you were waiting for
&gt;The slow, rhythmic pattern of his deep breaths in and out through his nose
&gt;He&#039;s completely asleep
&gt;As he gently breathes in and out, you quietly and slowly begin to shift yourself onto your back then your side to face him
&gt;Though the darkness gives no sign of his movement, he continues to breathe
&gt;Your side now facing him, you then begin to scooch closer towards him, keeping an ear out for any sudden changes in sound
&gt;Through what seemed an eternity of shifting, you finally manage to position yourself directly next to him
&gt;His breath a ever continuous wave of gentle peace and slumber, now louder as you head is right beside his, you snake your arm through the cover and lay it across his warm, shirt-covered chest
&gt;Still dissatisfied with his clothed form, you gladly take what you can get regardless
&gt;Your operation near complete, you begin your final step and carefully lay your head just below his shoulder
&gt;His breathing stops for the briefest second, your heart nearly stopping out of fear of awakening him, but resumes its soft pattern
&gt;You&#039;ve done it
&gt;You&#039;re cuddling with someone
&gt;And good fucking god is it fantastic
&gt;The warmth shared from his body as it bleeds through the clothes
&gt;The slight rise your head feels as he breathes in and out
&gt;The near intoxicating smell of his person
&gt;And the quiet atmosphere he provides beside you in his rest
&gt;It&#039;s amazing
&gt;As your eyelids slowly droop to a close, the last thought in your mind before you fall into a wonderful sleep was thankfulness for whatever force at hand granted you your wish</textarea>
