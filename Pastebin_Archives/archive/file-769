I&#039;m on edge now and really hope this is just my friends pulling a prank because they found me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I see... I see something through the window, a hand, a human one, waving slowly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;that hand, it has the pink armband that Todd&#039;s girlfriend wears, I question why</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I find out when the hand raises and I see it&#039;s dismembered and being held by a large claw</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;ohfuck.jpg</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;before I can react, I see the white glowing eyes ofwhatever the hell that creature was as it dropped the hand and began to claw and bang at the cabin&#039;s door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;thankfully, I locked the door before trying to sleep, and the windows looked way too small for even a teenager to fit through</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;this thing was obviously intelligent though, it was twisting the door handle and even trying to pick the lock with it&#039;s claws</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I drew my gun then and shot at the door thrice, all bullets punching a hole all the way through</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I thought I had hit and wounded, maybe even killed the thing as the door stopped shaking violently and sound stopped abruptly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;curious, I peeped through one of the holes, only to see a white eye staring back at me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it&#039;s hand pierced through the door then and grabbed the barrel of my beloved weapon, snapping it in half effortlessly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;panicking, I reached for nearby furniture and barricaded the door before locking myself behind the bedroom&#039;s door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I was now without a weapon and the kitchen had no knives</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I didn&#039;t know what to do at this point and simply hid under the bed, hoping it wouldn&#039;t find me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;trying to breath as quiet as possible, I hear the door to the cabin swing open from the bedroom, the sound of furniture crashing was loud, and then I heard the door close</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the door to the bedroom was torn off the hinges and thrown to the side and from under the bed I could see a pair of hooved feet step in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;thoughts and confusion plauged my mind</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;that same bloody clawed hand shot under the bed then and grabbed hold of my arm as I tried to hold onto the bed for dear life</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;my struggle was useless as the thing pulled me up and threw me down onto the matress hard</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as I prepared for my end, I looked up to see the thing itself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I saw a great pair of antlers on the cervine skull head of the thing, and I realized this was the fabled Wendigo</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I took notice of how it was hesitating to kill and devour me and saw it was panting with it&#039;s tongue hanging out slightly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;my eyes traveled down then and I was met with something more surprising and glorious than terrifying</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;two rather huge breasts with the shiniest black nipples filled out the chest of the creature nicely as it leaned down over me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;my fear had disappeared and I had figured that if I were to die, I may as well enjoy this body before me or at least try and have a fondle or two</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the Wendigo crawled up onto the bed and I got to see it&#039;s divine hips as it tore at my clothes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;snaking my hands back as it pulled at my underpants I grabbed a handful and more of it&#039;s soft, plump ass, earning a moan from the Wendigo as it had fully unclothed me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the Wendigo herself did not hesitate to take charge as she immediately went down and began to lick and kiss my throbbing cock to harden it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she coiled her tongue around my member and went sround it in a whirlwind like motion until it was standing as tall as it could</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the Wendigo moved to position herself, she turned and raised her ass above my head, giving me a great view of her dripping cunt, tight anus and jiggly ass cheeks right before she plopped her vagina onto my face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;knowing what she wanted, I simply started licking and tonguing it to satisfy her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she began to satisfy me as well as she wrapped her huge tits around my member and began to give the most wonderful tittyfuck, massaging and twisting the shaft while sucking the head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the cunnilingus I gave became more rigorous, my tongue reaching far into her depths at an increased pace</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she was now paralyzed in pleasure, unable to move as she was eaten out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;unable to help myself either, I thrusted between her tits, pumping in and out until we both reached a point and let out our pressure, I tasted her climax as I shot strings with the head of my dick poking out from her cleavage</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she was quite rigorous herself as well, shifting again and shoving her tits into my face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I had only now recovered when she had already slammed her ass down onto my pelvis, engulfing my length in her tight anus completely</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I was shaking as she pinned me and plopped up and down, taking me into her ass repeatedly while I tasted milk from sucking her delicious nipples</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it was irresistible as she dominated me, intending to get me to cum as quickly as possible, I couldn&#039;t help it as I released my pool of semen into her ass</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she let out a loud anf prolonged moan as I choked up while vibrating</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but now it was revenge time, and I would spend the last bit of semen I had filling this slag&#039;s pussy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;acting quickly, I shoved her onto her back much to her surprise, my dick making an audible *POP* as I exited her ass and lined up with her vagina</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she stared in anticipation while breathing heavy, I smiled as I slid it in and out a few times, causing her eyes to roll to the back of her skull</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with the force of one thousand earthquakes, I began to ravage her cunt, thrusting in and out, slowly building up speed</div></li><li class="li1"><div

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;be me, anon
&gt;decided to go walking through some good mountain trails in Appalachia with friends
&gt;catch is, we went at night
&gt;I get lost because of my poor sense of navigation and end up aimlessly walking through the woods waving around a flashlight and calling out for friends
&gt;luckily, I feel safe with my grandfather&#039;s old 1911 in my shorts pocket, and the moon shines bright enough to illuminate the woods ahead
&gt;things are getting creepy as I walk through the woods, I hear the faint hoots of an owls, the buzzing of insects, and the air around me flowing through the trees
&gt;swear I could even hear some snapping branches as I went through a bush
&gt;notice an old log cabin as I tread through bushes and hope to find help, or flares at the least
&gt;waddling up the creaking steps I open the door which wasn&#039;t locked and enter the dark cabin
&gt;I looked around and saw only mundane things like a couch, a small kitchen, some books and a bedroom with one bed
&gt;but at least it&#039;s warmer in here, so I decide to stay put until day when I can make a smoke signal that somebody will hopefully see
&gt;check the time and see it&#039;s 3:02 AM
&gt;never really believed in the whole &#039;witching hour&#039; thing, but I couldn&#039;t help but wonder often since I was nervous around cemeteries and graveyards
&gt;I bunk out for the night on the bed matress using my bedroll for warmth
&gt;as I get closer to sleeping, I swear I hear a scratching coming from elsewhere in the cabin
&gt;get out of bed with my hand rested on the handle of my pistol in my pocket, just in case and only in case
&gt;scratching is coming from a window.... I&#039;m on edge now and really hope this is just my friends pulling a prank because they found me
&gt;I see... I see something through the window, a hand, a human one, waving slowly
&gt;that hand, it has the pink armband that Todd&#039;s girlfriend wears, I question why
&gt;I find out when the hand raises and I see it&#039;s dismembered and being held by a large claw
&gt;ohfuck.jpg
&gt;before I can react, I see the white glowing eyes ofwhatever the hell that creature was as it dropped the hand and began to claw and bang at the cabin&#039;s door
&gt;thankfully, I locked the door before trying to sleep, and the windows looked way too small for even a teenager to fit through
&gt;this thing was obviously intelligent though, it was twisting the door handle and even trying to pick the lock with it&#039;s claws
&gt;I drew my gun then and shot at the door thrice, all bullets punching a hole all the way through
&gt;I thought I had hit and wounded, maybe even killed the thing as the door stopped shaking violently and sound stopped abruptly
&gt;curious, I peeped through one of the holes, only to see a white eye staring back at me
&gt;it&#039;s hand pierced through the door then and grabbed the barrel of my beloved weapon, snapping it in half effortlessly
&gt;panicking, I reached for nearby furniture and barricaded the door before locking myself behind the bedroom&#039;s door
&gt;I was now without a weapon and the kitchen had no knives
&gt;I didn&#039;t know what to do at this point and simply hid under the bed, hoping it wouldn&#039;t find me
&gt;trying to breath as quiet as possible, I hear the door to the cabin swing open from the bedroom, the sound of furniture crashing was loud, and then I heard the door close
&gt;the door to the bedroom was torn off the hinges and thrown to the side and from under the bed I could see a pair of hooved feet step in
&gt;thoughts and confusion plauged my mind
&gt;that same bloody clawed hand shot under the bed then and grabbed hold of my arm as I tried to hold onto the bed for dear life
&gt;my struggle was useless as the thing pulled me up and threw me down onto the matress hard
&gt;as I prepared for my end, I looked up to see the thing itself
&gt;I saw a great pair of antlers on the cervine skull head of the thing, and I realized this was the fabled Wendigo
&gt;I took notice of how it was hesitating to kill and devour me and saw it was panting with it&#039;s tongue hanging out slightly
&gt;my eyes traveled down then and I was met with something more surprising and glorious than terrifying
&gt;two rather huge breasts with the shiniest black nipples filled out the chest of the creature nicely as it leaned down over me
&gt;my fear had disappeared and I had figured that if I were to die, I may as well enjoy this body before me or at least try and have a fondle or two
&gt;the Wendigo crawled up onto the bed and I got to see it&#039;s divine hips as it tore at my clothes
&gt;snaking my hands back as it pulled at my underpants I grabbed a handful and more of it&#039;s soft, plump ass, earning a moan from the Wendigo as it had fully unclothed me
&gt;the Wendigo herself did not hesitate to take charge as she immediately went down and began to lick and kiss my throbbing cock to harden it
&gt;she coiled her tongue around my member and went sround it in a whirlwind like motion until it was standing as tall as it could
&gt;the Wendigo moved to position herself, she turned and raised her ass above my head, giving me a great view of her dripping cunt, tight anus and jiggly ass cheeks right before she plopped her vagina onto my face
&gt;knowing what she wanted, I simply started licking and tonguing it to satisfy her
&gt;she began to satisfy me as well as she wrapped her huge tits around my member and began to give the most wonderful tittyfuck, massaging and twisting the shaft while sucking the head
&gt;the cunnilingus I gave became more rigorous, my tongue reaching far into her depths at an increased pace
&gt;she was now paralyzed in pleasure, unable to move as she was eaten out
&gt;unable to help myself either, I thrusted between her tits, pumping in and out until we both reached a point and let out our pressure, I tasted her climax as I shot strings with the head of my dick poking out from her cleavage
&gt;she was quite rigorous herself as well, shifting again and shoving her tits into my face
&gt;I had only now recovered when she had already slammed her ass down onto my pelvis, engulfing my length in her tight anus completely
&gt;I was shaking as she pinned me and plopped up and down, taking me into her ass repeatedly while I tasted milk from sucking her delicious nipples
&gt;it was irresistible as she dominated me, intending to get me to cum as quickly as possible, I couldn&#039;t help it as I released my pool of semen into her ass
&gt;she let out a loud anf prolonged moan as I choked up while vibrating
&gt;but now it was revenge time, and I would spend the last bit of semen I had filling this slag&#039;s pussy
&gt;acting quickly, I shoved her onto her back much to her surprise, my dick making an audible *POP* as I exited her ass and lined up with her vagina
&gt;she stared in anticipation while breathing heavy, I smiled as I slid it in and out a few times, causing her eyes to roll to the back of her skull
&gt;with the force of one thousand earthquakes, I began to ravage her cunt, thrusting in and out, slowly building up speed
&gt;the Wendigo had again been paralyzed, and all she could do was give out a myriad of moans as her vagina pulsated and my cock throbbed inside of it
&gt;I did not stop, I went on like a machine, pushing in and pulling out
&gt;we were both close now as her knockers rang around from her being ploughed
&gt;her hands shot over my shoulders as she brought her face closer and stared me in the eyes, I stared back
&gt;her tongue snaked out and I met it with mine as we shared a kiss then, her mouth was as clean as mine shockingly, though I tasted some traces of blood as our tongues danced
&gt;finally, I had reached my limit and pumped in and out of her as fast as I could, her head hung back as we both had an orgasm simultaneously and collapsed into the bed, I remained insider of her as a puddle of our love seeped onto the matress
&gt;I fell alseep then
&gt;....
&gt;....
&gt;....
&gt;I woke up to see rays of sunlight blind me for the moment
&gt;the Wendigo was gone, but I could smell the cum that stained the bed, so it definitely wasn&#039;t a dream...
&gt;I felt groggy and got up to put on what remnants of clothes I had
&gt;then it hit me
&gt;I boned the same cryptid that probably killed one of my friends last night
&gt;...
&gt;oh well</textarea>
