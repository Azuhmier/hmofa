end of a long day is coming home to her Anon for a little bit of pampering, enough to bring the little kitten out of the big cat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s late in the afternoon when you get the text</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;[on my way home soon :3]</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s Turrula</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her 24-hour shift at the fire station is finally over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So now she has the weekend with you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s heartbreaking to be away from her for whole days at a time, but it’s for a good cause</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Plus, she’s never far from your side whenever she gets off work</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At least one of these two days will be spent pampering her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She doesn’t demand or even ask it of you, but you’re willing to treat her well regardless</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;None of the other men at the fire station ever interested her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s mostly dogs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mostly bigger ones</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not only is she one of the few women on the team (not even enough to fill a full calendar, unlike the boys), but she’s the only feline as well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;However, the jaguar grew up where it’s hot and humid, so the roaring fires and the torrents of water barely faze her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not to mention she’s no slouch in the strength department</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The job came naturally to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even the Dalmatians can’t take away her title as “the best spotted firefighter on the team”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Turrula takes pride in what she does, though you can tell it wears on her sometimes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But her duties are tolerable thanks to the love you provide whenever she’s off the clock</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So when you receive the text you have precious minutes to prepare everything</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lay out her favorite robe</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Set the fireplace</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Grab a glass for her warm milk</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You might have time to get a meal started when you know she’s close to being done with her shift</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Though more often than not she just brings take-out home with her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Turrula walks through the door with a powerful sigh</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Usually she comes home exhausted from just sitting around waiting for a call</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If it’s something particularly hazardous, you can be sure the news crew is tracking it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;More than once you’ve seen your girl in action live</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Occasionally she’ll be covered in dirt or doused in water, depending on what kind of emergency occurs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One time she came back looking like a black panther with all the soot on her fur</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Today she’s a little cleaner, but that’s because she’s sopping wet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Rookies”, is all she can say with a shake of her head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every step she takes peels another bit of clothing from her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’ll grab them eventually, but picking up for her is one more way to score some brownie points</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She drags herself into the bathroom and kicks on the shower</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now’s your chance to heat the milk and finish what you didn’t get to yet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Kick on the music</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Take some blankets out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Turrula is a fan of her showers, but you can tell this one is going to be short-lived</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The singing is cut short, followed by the water</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Anon!” she calls out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You head over to the bathroom door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I forgot my towel…” she whines</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Technically, you forgot it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But she’ll never blame you for missing a step of her routine</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After all, you’re not obligated to do any of it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And yet it’s that sort of commitment that has made the relationship grow tighter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hand her a towel and the jaguar dries herself off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re about to leave the bathroom when you hear her whine again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s sitting on the edge of the tub half wrapped up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With her body partially exposed and her expectant look, someone else might have thought she’s asking for something a little more sensual</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But after being with her for so long, you know that isn’t quite the case</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No, THAT kind of intimacy will come another time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For now, she just wants you to help her dry off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grab a second towel and the two of you work the fur in unison</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Turrula does her legs while you take care of her back and head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She needs to leave her favorite spots for YOU</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you run the towel over her, she begins her process of unwinding</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re not just wicking up moisture, you’re also breaking down her tension</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her muscles relax as you work your hands into them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Mmmm…” she hums</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You continue for a bit even after her fur is dry enough</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You let her enjoy the moment, then move on when she wants to</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her royal blue robe is all ready for her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The jaguar ties it comfortably around her athletic body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take her by the paw and lead her to the living room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Everything’s waiting patiently for her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The couch will be your nest for probably the next few hours</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get settled in, and Turrula lies down next to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She places her head on your lap, and the night begins</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You start with some simple head scratches</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Almost immediately she falls into a hypnotic sort of trance</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her round ears flatten as you rub behind them</div></li><li

        <textarea class="textarea">Connect the Sweet Spots [Jaguar; Comfy, Scratches and Massages, Intimacy]: The greatest reward a firefighting jaguar can receive at the end of a long day is coming home to her Anon for a little bit of pampering, enough to bring the little kitten out of the big cat.

&gt;It’s late in the afternoon when you get the text
&gt;[on my way home soon :3]
&gt;It’s Turrula
&gt;Her 24-hour shift at the fire station is finally over
&gt;So now she has the weekend with you
&gt;It’s heartbreaking to be away from her for whole days at a time, but it’s for a good cause
&gt;Plus, she’s never far from your side whenever she gets off work
&gt;At least one of these two days will be spent pampering her
&gt;She doesn’t demand or even ask it of you, but you’re willing to treat her well regardless
&gt;None of the other men at the fire station ever interested her
&gt;It’s mostly dogs
&gt;Mostly bigger ones
&gt;Not only is she one of the few women on the team (not even enough to fill a full calendar, unlike the boys), but she’s the only feline as well
&gt;However, the jaguar grew up where it’s hot and humid, so the roaring fires and the torrents of water barely faze her
&gt;Not to mention she’s no slouch in the strength department
&gt;The job came naturally to her
&gt;Even the Dalmatians can’t take away her title as “the best spotted firefighter on the team”
&gt;Turrula takes pride in what she does, though you can tell it wears on her sometimes
&gt;But her duties are tolerable thanks to the love you provide whenever she’s off the clock
&gt;So when you receive the text you have precious minutes to prepare everything
&gt;Lay out her favorite robe
&gt;Set the fireplace
&gt;Grab a glass for her warm milk
&gt;You might have time to get a meal started when you know she’s close to being done with her shift
&gt;Though more often than not she just brings take-out home with her
&gt;Turrula walks through the door with a powerful sigh
&gt;Usually she comes home exhausted from just sitting around waiting for a call
&gt;If it’s something particularly hazardous, you can be sure the news crew is tracking it
&gt;More than once you’ve seen your girl in action live
&gt;Occasionally she’ll be covered in dirt or doused in water, depending on what kind of emergency occurs
&gt;One time she came back looking like a black panther with all the soot on her fur
&gt;Today she’s a little cleaner, but that’s because she’s sopping wet
&gt;”Rookies”, is all she can say with a shake of her head
&gt;Every step she takes peels another bit of clothing from her
&gt;She’ll grab them eventually, but picking up for her is one more way to score some brownie points
&gt;She drags herself into the bathroom and kicks on the shower
&gt;Now’s your chance to heat the milk and finish what you didn’t get to yet
&gt;Kick on the music
&gt;Take some blankets out
&gt;Turrula is a fan of her showers, but you can tell this one is going to be short-lived
&gt;The singing is cut short, followed by the water
&gt;”Anon!” she calls out
&gt;You head over to the bathroom door
&gt;”I forgot my towel…” she whines
&gt;Technically, you forgot it
&gt;But she’ll never blame you for missing a step of her routine
&gt;After all, you’re not obligated to do any of it
&gt;And yet it’s that sort of commitment that has made the relationship grow tighter
&gt;You hand her a towel and the jaguar dries herself off
&gt;You’re about to leave the bathroom when you hear her whine again
&gt;She’s sitting on the edge of the tub half wrapped up
&gt;With her body partially exposed and her expectant look, someone else might have thought she’s asking for something a little more sensual
&gt;But after being with her for so long, you know that isn’t quite the case
&gt;No, THAT kind of intimacy will come another time
&gt;For now, she just wants you to help her dry off
&gt;You grab a second towel and the two of you work the fur in unison
&gt;Turrula does her legs while you take care of her back and head
&gt;She needs to leave her favorite spots for YOU
&gt;As you run the towel over her, she begins her process of unwinding
&gt;You’re not just wicking up moisture, you’re also breaking down her tension
&gt;Her muscles relax as you work your hands into them
&gt;”Mmmm…” she hums
&gt;You continue for a bit even after her fur is dry enough
&gt;You let her enjoy the moment, then move on when she wants to
&gt;Her royal blue robe is all ready for her
&gt;The jaguar ties it comfortably around her athletic body
&gt;You take her by the paw and lead her to the living room
&gt;Everything’s waiting patiently for her

&gt;The couch will be your nest for probably the next few hours
&gt;You get settled in, and Turrula lies down next to you
&gt;She places her head on your lap, and the night begins
&gt;You start with some simple head scratches
&gt;Almost immediately she falls into a hypnotic sort of trance
&gt;Her round ears flatten as you rub behind them
&gt;The jaguar doesn’t exactly “purr” like you’ve heard from smaller cats
&gt;But the sound that reverberates deep in her chest at your touch is as close to purring as one could get
&gt;Turrula bunches her body up, pulling her legs in closer
&gt;There’s no way she’d fit on your lap entirely
&gt;She always makes an earnest effort to, though
&gt;After showing ample attention to her ears, you move to her face
&gt;Her mossy eyes close as your fingers stroke the bridge of her nose
&gt;From her wide, rosy snout all the way up to her forehead
&gt;Her nostrils flare with the motion
&gt;This is where she really seems to start enjoying herself
&gt;There’s no wrong way to rub her here
&gt;The tip of her pink tongue sticks out from her black lips
&gt;It slides in and out in slow gestures, though only a bit at most
&gt;You press firmly with your thumb as you continue to stroke her nose
&gt;Sometimes her eyelids are pulled open just slightly along with your strokes
&gt;When they are, you can see her green eyes roll back in bliss
&gt;You move down the sides of her head
&gt;A smile forms on her face as you draw circles on her cheeks
&gt;Then you gently navigate through the spaces between her whiskers
&gt;Your hands reunite under her jaw, where the massaging resumes
&gt;You scratch under her chin with your knuckles
&gt;Then your hands flatten to rub her neck
&gt;She loves the scruff in the back the most
&gt;You can steal a quick tug at it from time to time
&gt;She’s told you it reminds her of her childhood when you do that
&gt;Turrula brings her arms up to her chest
&gt;Her large paws flex and knead the air
&gt;She’s the biggest kitten you’ve ever seen
&gt;Her eyes open lazily
&gt;You already know what she’s looking for before she can say it
&gt;”Milk?” she mouths silently
&gt;It’s still plenty warm
&gt;You bring the glass to her lips and let her sip at her own pace
&gt;Yeah, just like a kitten
&gt;The jaguar continues to paw at the air while she downs the milk
&gt;She has an adorable white mustache when she finishes it
&gt;You wipe the milk off, but her rough tongue is too fast
&gt;She licks your fingers clean, then nuzzles her head into your hand
&gt;The girl just doesn’t want those fingers to go a moment without attending to her needs
&gt;The scratches go on for some time
&gt;You grab one of the floating paws and work the spots between the digits
&gt;No part of her will go unloved
&gt;The shoulders are next, though you never dwell on them for too long
&gt;She gets frequent back and shoulder rubs throughout the normal day
&gt;The “kitten treatment”, on the other hand, is its own special process
&gt;There are much more infrequent, but you can tell she appreciates them more when they do occur
&gt;It’s at this point that Turrula slowly rotates herself over
&gt;Her head leans over your lap, now on her belly
&gt;She continues her attempt to fit her whole body on top of your legs

&gt;Turrula is very much like the fire herself
