She was using a canvas fold-up chair, while you were simply sitting on a fallen log.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were focused on some corned beef hash browning in a small skillet over the fire, while your GF was staring at you with a scowl on her face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon, you can&#039;t -honestly- expect me to eat that. It&#039;s so greasy!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her that it was fine, and that you couldn&#039;t really just stop cooking it at this point.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ugh, it smells fucking disgusting! You know how I feel about red meat!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why the hell do you even keep her around?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;God, this place sucks. Next time you wanna go on vacation, you&#039;re taking me to a resort or something.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you can form a response, she stands up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She ducks inside your shared tent, and comes out holding a couple packets of travel toilet paper.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m gonna go pee. And NO, I don&#039;t need any help.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her not to go too far, and to be careful.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh, be quiet. I know how to piss, Anon. And I can&#039;t go if you can hear me!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You just watch her with a neutral expression as she marches off through the bushes, leaving the circle of light around your campfire.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sometimes it was difficult to keep your anger in check around her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You just sigh, poking at the sizzling meat with a small spatula.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just another day and a half, and you could be out of here and back to your monotonous life as a wagie back in the city.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s been nearly 20 minutes since your GF left to go pee. She still hasn&#039;t come back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fuck, did she get hurt or something? That would just be the cherry on top of the shit sundae that this trip was turning out to be.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At first you had thought she had decided to maybe take a shit or something, but it was getting unnerving.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just as you&#039;re about to get up and start looking for her, you can hear the sound of something moving in the treeline.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now that you notice it, there&#039;s also this weird smell in the air... Almost like burnt copper or stale blood.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whatever it was, it wasn&#039;t particularly pleasant.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Suddenly, something walks out of the brush and into your camp.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh, it&#039;s just your Girlfriend. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s her alright, but there&#039;s something... Off about her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her clothes and hair are a bit dirty looking, and she&#039;s standing kind of funny. It almost looks like she&#039;s laughing, but without the noise.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask her if she&#039;s okay, but she just continues to stare at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You motion for her to sit down, and she rushes over to you, plopping herself down on the log next to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sits closely next to you, her arm and thigh gently pressing against you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This was weird... You didn&#039;t like how she was being so quiet. Or how she suddenly wanted to be close to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was pretty out of character for her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;An unsure look on your face, you turn back to the skillet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It had finished cooking a while ago, and was sitting on a rock next to the fire.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can hear your GF sharply inhale through her nose.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait, no.

You weren&#039;t accomplishing anything by standing here with your thumb up your ass.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Picking a direction, you start to walk at a brisk pace.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re not sure how long you&#039;ve been walking, but you&#039;re getting increasingly terrified at the thoughts running though your mind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Where&#039;s your Girlfriend?

Flashlights?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Holy shit, you&#039;re fucking saved!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You call out to the lights and rush towards them, yelling that you needed help.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you get closer though, the color drains from your face and your cry tapers out into a rattling moan.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The lights did not belong to a pair of flashlights.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was simply the reflection off of an animals&#039; eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To be more specific, the eyes&#039; of the Creature.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;welp.gif</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It looked different now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It still looked vaguely like your Girlfriend, except it was now 7 feet tall, propped up by animalistic legs similar to a deer or goats.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s arms were unusually long, with long, yet blunt, claws poking out from it&#039;s four-fingered hands.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Thing&#039;s torso and head still had the appearance of your GF&#039;s, except for the weird sagging effect the skin had.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One thing was for sure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was NOT your day.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You book it in the opposite direction, running as fast as your bare legs can take you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You glance back, and see it following you at the same pace.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Running becomes the only thing in your mind. That and the need to vomit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You keep on running, but every time you look back, the creature is the same distance behind you, a grin on It&#039;s face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s toying with you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You keep on running until you trip over a root, falling flat on your face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you get up, you feel a large hand gently pressing against your back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re slowly turned over, the creature&#039;s eyes seeming to appraise you as they run over your body.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It smiles warmly at you, It&#039;s brutish hands lovingly stroking your head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It leans in close, the smell of bear mace choking you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It tenderly whispers something in your ear, but you can&#039;t really make them out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The situation proves to be too much to you, and you start to feel faint.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You let out a shaky cry, then black out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wake up with a start, your leg kicking at the air.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your eyes blink rapidly, but you still can&#039;t see anything.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Either your surroundings were really dark, or you were blind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a minute, your eyes adjust to the darkness, showing you where you were.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were sitting near the mouth of some cave, lit up by the light from the moon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re covered by a large animal hide, which you roll off of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quickly realize that you aren&#039;t wearing any clothes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking around the immediate area for your clothes, you can see nothing except for pebbles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And a large pile of bones.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some of which are recognizable as belonging to Humans.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh, FUCK.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Uneasily, you stand up, moving to the cave entrance.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you get to the edge of the cave, you&#039;re met by a ledge.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking down, it&#039;s almost 30 foot drop straight to some sharp-looking rocks.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yeah, this seems about right for the lair of a monster.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t even try to maneuver your way down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You weren&#039;t good at rock climbing on your best days, so you didn&#039;t really like your chances when you were naked and tired in the darkness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;From behind you, you can hear a sharp noise suddenly cut through the quiet air.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then you feel a large, warm hand rest on your shoulder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t bother trying to scream. You know nobody can hear you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Turning you around, you stare into the face of the creature, now fully changed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s chest is covered by a thick layer of fur, with two large breasts poking out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s head is situated on the end of a long neck, also covered in a thick covering of scraggly fur.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s face resembles no animal you&#039;ve ever seen before.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It almost looks like some weird mixture of a cow&#039;s facial structure, a dog&#039;s muzzle, and a deer&#039;s horns.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whatever the Thing is, it still has that disturbing grin on It&#039;s face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It pulls you in for a hug, your face pressing into the fur between Her breasts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To your surprise, it doesn&#039;t smell how you thought it would.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Instead of an unbearable stench, it instead has some vaguely familiar animal smell. Almost like that of a dog.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can hear and feel a deep rumble coming from the Creature&#039;s chest as it rubs along your back with it&#039;s large hands.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It slowly eases you back over to the hide blanket.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re slowly let down onto your back as the Thing begins to straddle you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can feel a thick, warm drop of it&#039;s natural lubricant drip onto your shaft.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One of her hands gently cups your groin, rubbing the slick moisture all over your length.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She coos at you as she coaxes your dick to rise like some sort of sick snake-charmer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She begins to stroke your length slowly, her other hand positioned on your chest to keep you from running.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Many conflicting thoughts are rushing through your head at this point, most of them relating to whether you should run or not.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, it&#039;s not like you could get out the front of the cave. And you&#039;re pretty certain that the other end of the cave wouldn&#039;t really give you many options...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh, what the hell. You might as well try to enjoy this before the Creature decides to rip your neck open.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You let out a sigh, and rest your head onto the pelt under you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Creature let&#039;s out a satisfied squeal as it sees you finally giving in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look it in the eyes as it shimmys up your pelvis a bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see it holding your dick with one hand, trying her best to align it with her own slick opening.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When she has it just where she wants it, she slowly eases herself down, your cock sinking into her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She eases onto your shaft at a tortuously slow rate, taking atleast 2 minutes until your hips finally meet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shivers happily, feeling you hilted inside of her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Panting, she begins to lift up again, just as slowly as before.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re not sure how long the cycle continues, but she has your dick throbbing inside of her, begging for more.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks at you with a knowing smirk, her hand leaving your chest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Big mistake, faggot!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You immediately thrust up into her, forcing a loud cry out of her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her hips drop down onto you, smacking against your pelvis with a loud slap.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It stings a bit, you&#039;re too busy trying to stuff her full of your cock to even register the pain.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If you were going out, you were going out with a bang! Literally!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hammer into the Furred woman&#039;s cunt without mercy, drawing all sorts of embarrassing noises out of her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At one point she even flops onto her side, your dick popping out of her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Without skipping a beat, you push her onto her back, climbing on top of her before slamming back into her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her skinny legs and arms loosely wraps around you as you pound into her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She lets out several loud, feral cries as you slam deep inside of her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Suddenly, her arms and legs tighten around you, and she lets out an ungodly scream as her climax hits her like a bullet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s enough to set you over the edge as well.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You groan as you spray her insides white with your love, her internal muscles drawing your cum directly into her womb.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her hand lovingly strokes your head as she huffs and pants, her long tongue hanging out of her mouth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your head rests in her fur, your head swimming.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel a deep and satisfied rumble coming from deep within her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her fur feels so warm, and you can&#039;t help but close your eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Everything feels right in this moment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Balls deep inside a monster who probably killed your Girlfriend?

&gt;You were 26 years old, standing at an even six feet.
&gt;You were an avid outdoorsman, and were currently out camping in the Appalachians.
&gt;On this particular outing, you had managed to convince your GF to come along.
&gt;It was a bit of a rough relationship, but you thought that maybe a peaceful weekend away from everything would be just what you two needed to really connect.
&gt;Oh, how wrong you had been.
&gt;From the second she had step foot into the woods, almost everything that came out of her mouth was a complaint.
&gt;Whether she was complaining about the humidity, or pleading for you to cut the trip short, she just won&#039;t shut up.
&gt;It&#039;s the second day of your trip, near the evening.
&gt;You had tried to teach her how to fish in a lake nearby, only for her to drop the rod into the water and then blame you for it.
&gt;fuckmylife.jpg
&gt;Currently, it was in the evening, and the two of you were sitting on opposite sides of a campfire. She was using a canvas fold-up chair, while you were simply sitting on a fallen log.
&gt;You were focused on some corned beef hash browning in a small skillet over the fire, while your GF was staring at you with a scowl on her face.
&gt;&quot;Anon, you can&#039;t -honestly- expect me to eat that. It&#039;s so greasy!&quot;
&gt;You tell her that it was fine, and that you couldn&#039;t really just stop cooking it at this point.
&gt;&quot;Ugh, it smells fucking disgusting! You know how I feel about red meat!&quot;
&gt;Why the hell do you even keep her around?
&gt;&quot;God, this place sucks. Next time you wanna go on vacation, you&#039;re taking me to a resort or something.&quot;
&gt;Before you can form a response, she stands up.
&gt;She ducks inside your shared tent, and comes out holding a couple packets of travel toilet paper.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m gonna go pee. And NO, I don&#039;t need any help.&quot;
&gt;You tell her not to go too far, and to be careful.
&gt;&quot;Oh, be quiet. I know how to piss, Anon. And I can&#039;t go if you can hear me!&quot;
&gt;You just watch her with a neutral expression as she marches off through the bushes, leaving the circle of light around your campfire.
&gt;Sometimes it was difficult to keep your anger in check around her.
&gt;You just sigh, poking at the sizzling meat with a small spatula.
&gt;Just another day and a half, and you could be out of here and back to your monotonous life as a wagie back in the city.

&gt;It&#039;s been nearly 20 minutes since your GF left to go pee. She still hasn&#039;t come back.
&gt;Fuck, did she get hurt or something? That would just be the cherry on top of the shit sundae that this trip was turning out to be.
&gt;At first you had thought she had decided to maybe take a shit or something, but it was getting unnerving.
&gt;Just as you&#039;re about to get up and start looking for her, you can hear the sound of something moving in the treeline.
&gt;Now that you notice it, there&#039;s also this weird smell in the air... Almost like burnt copper or stale blood.
&gt;Whatever it was, it wasn&#039;t particularly pleasant.
&gt;Suddenly, something walks out of the brush and into your camp.
&gt;Oh, it&#039;s just your Girlfriend. 
&gt;It&#039;s her alright, but there&#039;s something... Off about her.
&gt;Her clothes and hair are a bit dirty looking, and she&#039;s standing kind of funny. It almost looks like she&#039;s laughing, but without the noise.
&gt;You ask her if she&#039;s okay, but she just continues to stare at you.
&gt;You motion for her to sit down, and she rushes over to you, plopping herself down on the log next to you.
&gt;She sits closely next to you, her arm and thigh gently pressing against you.
&gt;This was weird... You didn&#039;t like how she was being so quiet. Or how she suddenly wanted to be close to you.
&gt;It was pretty out of character for her.
&gt;An unsure look on your face, you turn back to the skillet.
&gt;It had finished cooking a while ago, and was sitting on a rock next to the fire.
&gt;You can hear your GF sharply inhale through her nose.
&gt;Wait, no. She&#039;s... Sniffing you?
&gt;thatjustaintright.mp3
&gt;You scooch away from her a bit, making her cock her head at you.
&gt;You ask her if she wanted some of the corned beef hash, or if she wanted to get some rest.
&gt;She smells the air, and then violently nods.
&gt;Well, that&#039;s certainly a change of mood from earlier.
&gt;As you try to plate some of the hash onto a tray for her, she keeps trying to grab it.
&gt;You manage to hold her off just long enough so that you can give her a decent amount.
&gt;You hand her the tray and a fork.
&gt;She drops the fork and scoops the steaming food into her mouth with her hand, finishing it within a minute.
&gt;You have to practically wrestle the tray out of her hands to stop her from licking the remaining grease off of the plate.
&gt;You ask her what was with her today, making her cock her head at you once more.
&gt;What the fuck?
&gt;She croaks out a phrase.
&gt;&quot;Yes, I&#039;m FINE.&quot;
&gt;Well, she certainly still had her bitchy mood.
&gt;But something was weird about how she said it. It&#039;s almost like the pitch in her voice was off?
&gt;Weird.

&gt;Maybe things would be better when you woke up in the morning.
&gt;You stand up, telling her that you were going to sleep.
&gt;She stands up as well, a toothy grin on her face.
&gt;You ask her what happened to her out in the woods, and she just shakes her head at you.
&gt;She probably just fell down or something...
&gt;Her hand tugs on your arm, pulling you closer to her.
&gt;She wraps you in a hug, smelling your hair.
&gt;Still hugging you, she moves her head to face you.
&gt;She still has that wide grin, staring at your face.
&gt;Ew, what the fuck!? That metallic smell is coming from her breath!
&gt;Wait. Oh fuck.
&gt;The woman in front of you has dark brown eyes.
&gt;Your girlfriend&#039;s eyes were blue.
&gt;holypoptartsinapencilsharpener.webm
&gt;This isn&#039;t your girlfriend!
&gt;You pull away from her, alarm on her face.
&gt;She must notice your alarm, as she takes a couple steps back, her head tilting at you once more.
&gt;To your horror, her head doesn&#039;t stop tilting until it&#039;s horizontal, the vertebrae in her neck audibly popping.
&gt;You scream at her, asking what she did to your GF.
&gt;The grin slips from her face as she walks closer to you.
&gt;You want to run, but your legs are frozen.
&gt;She grabs your arm with an iron grip, pulling you to your tent.
&gt;You try to resist, but she&#039;s way stronger than she looks.
&gt;She doesn&#039;t even bat an eye when you start throwing punches at her.
&gt;The creature that looks like your girlfriend roughly throws you onto your sleeping bag, the air being forced from your lungs.
&gt;She begins to tear at her dirty clothes, ripping the fabric off of her skin. She doesn&#039;t stop until she&#039;s mostly naked, her sopping wet loins bared to you.
&gt;She grins at you, causing you to scream out once more. Holy shit, whatever this thing was, it was going to fucking rape you!
&gt;In place of normal Human teeth, are a bestial set that look more at home in a werewolf movie.
&gt;It drops down onto it&#039;s knees, hands grasping at your jeans. Her fingers are almost inhumanly long, with the nails rough and ragged at the ends.
&gt;The Creature tries to tear at them, but the denim seems to be just a bit too sturdy for her.
&gt;You kick and yell, but it&#039;s no use.
&gt;Wait a minute!
&gt;Your pack is just a couple feet away from you. Maybe if...
&gt;You keep kicking at her, your arms gripping the pack in a panic.
&gt;You do your best to unzip it with one hand, using the other hand to try and get her off of you.
&gt;Your hand enters the pack, feeling around until it closes around a cylindrical metal object...
&gt;Bear mace, Motherfucker!
&gt;You whip out the aerosol can, pointing it right at the creatures&#039; wide, excited eyes.
&gt;It&#039;s too focused on getting your pants off to notice what you&#039;re holding.
&gt;You shut your eyes tight, and pull back on the tab, sending a fine red mist of liquid tear gas directly into the creatures face.

&gt;The Creature&#039;s hands tighten around your jeans, ripping them as it screams.
&gt;It flops onto one side, clawing at the air.
&gt;You take the opportunity to clamber out of the tent.
&gt;You unsteadily get to your feet, and book it in a random direction.
&gt;Fuck, fuck, fuck!
&gt;You don&#039;t stop running until you&#039;re choking and tears run from your eyes.
&gt;Leaning against a tree, you try to get your breath back...
&gt;What the FUCK was that!?
&gt;Jesus Tap-Dancing CHRIST, a fucking MONSTER just tried to jump your bones!
&gt;It was like some shitty greentext on /x/!
&gt;You take a quick inventory of yourself as you try to calm down.
&gt;You&#039;re out in the middle of nowhere, with no clue where you are.
&gt;Your jeans have been torn to ribbons, leaving your boxers exposed.
&gt;You have no supplies, and nothing to contact the outside world.
&gt;To summarize, you&#039;re good and truly fucked.
&gt;You groan, rubbing your sweat-covered brow.
&gt;You look around, seeing if there was anything in the immediate area that could help you.
&gt;It&#039;s all just rotting sticks and mushrooms.
&gt;Damn.
&gt;You try and look at the sky for a point of reference. You knew that there was an established campground intended for more novice campers a ways east of here. If you could get there, you would be able to get help.
&gt;Too bad the night sky is blocked by a thick covering of leaves.
&gt;Damn trees! Maybe deforestation wasn&#039;t too bad of an idea after all.
&gt;You uneasily look around once more, hoping that the creature wouldn&#039;t find you.
&gt;In any case, it would be better to get a move on. You weren&#039;t accomplishing anything by standing here with your thumb up your ass.
&gt;Picking a direction, you start to walk at a brisk pace.

&gt;You&#039;re not sure how long you&#039;ve been walking, but you&#039;re getting increasingly terrified at the thoughts running though your mind.
&gt;Where&#039;s your Girlfriend? Is she dead?
&gt;Why did that Thing look like her? Why did it try to have sex with you?
&gt;Was It trying to find you?
&gt;You come to a dead stop after that last thought leaves your mind.
&gt;In the distance, you can see two pin-pricks of light through the vegetation. Flashlights?
&gt;Holy shit, you&#039;re fucking saved!
&gt;You call out to the lights and rush towards them, yelling that you needed help.
&gt;As you get closer though, the color drains from your face and your cry tapers out into a rattling moan.
&gt;The lights did not belong to a pair of flashlights.
&gt;It was simply the reflection off of an animals&#039; eyes.
&gt;To be more specific, the eyes&#039; of the Creature.
&gt;welp.gif
&gt;It looked different now.
&gt;It still looked vaguely like your Girlfriend, except it was now 7 feet tall, propped up by animalistic legs similar to a deer or goats.
&gt;It&#039;s arms were unusually long, with long, yet blunt, claws poking out from it&#039;s four-fingered hands.
&gt;The Thing&#039;s torso and head still had the appearance of your GF&#039;s, except for the weird sagging effect the skin had.
&gt;One thing was for sure.
&gt;It was NOT your day.
&gt;You book it in the opposite direction, running as fast as your bare legs can take you.
&gt;You glance back, and see it following you at the same pace.
&gt;Running becomes the only thing in your mind. That and the need to vomit.
&gt;You keep on running, but every time you look back, the creature is the same distance behind you, a grin on It&#039;s face.
&gt;It&#039;s toying with you.
&gt;You keep on running until you trip over a root, falling flat on your face.
&gt;Before you get up, you feel a large hand gently pressing against your back.
&gt;You&#039;re slowly turned over, the creature&#039;s eyes seeming to appraise you as they run over your body.
&gt;It smiles warmly at you, It&#039;s brutish hands lovingly stroking your head.
&gt;It leans in close, the smell of bear mace choking you.
&gt;It tenderly whispers something in your ear, but you can&#039;t really make them out.
&gt;The situation proves to be too much to you, and you start to feel faint.
&gt;You let out a shaky cry, then black out.

&gt;You wake up with a start, your leg kicking at the air.
&gt;Your eyes blink rapidly, but you still can&#039;t see anything.
&gt;Either your surroundings were really dark, or you were blind.
&gt;After a minute, your eyes adjust to the darkness, showing you where you were.
&gt;You were sitting near the mouth of some cave, lit up by the light from the moon.
&gt;You&#039;re covered by a large animal hide, which you roll off of you.
&gt;You quickly realize that you aren&#039;t wearing any clothes.
&gt;Looking around the immediate area for your clothes, you can see nothing except for pebbles.
&gt;And a large pile of bones.
&gt;Some of which are recognizable as belonging to Humans.
&gt;Oh, FUCK.
&gt;Uneasily, you stand up, moving to the cave entrance.
&gt;When you get to the edge of the cave, you&#039;re met by a ledge.
&gt;Looking down, it&#039;s almost 30 foot drop straight to some sharp-looking rocks.
&gt;Yeah, this seems about right for the lair of a monster.
&gt;You don&#039;t even try to maneuver your way down.
&gt;You weren&#039;t good at rock climbing on your best days, so you didn&#039;t really like your chances when you were naked and tired in the darkness.
&gt;From behind you, you can hear a sharp noise suddenly cut through the quiet air.
&gt;Then you feel a large, warm hand rest on your shoulder.
&gt;You don&#039;t bother trying to scream. You know nobody can hear you.
&gt;Turning you around, you stare into the face of the creature, now fully changed.
&gt;It&#039;s chest is covered by a thick layer of fur, with two large breasts poking out.
&gt;It&#039;s head is situated on the end of a long neck, also covered in a thick covering of scraggly fur.
&gt;It&#039;s face resembles no animal you&#039;ve ever seen before.
&gt;It almost looks like some weird mixture of a cow&#039;s facial structure, a dog&#039;s muzzle, and a deer&#039;s horns.
&gt;Whatever the Thing is, it still has that disturbing grin on It&#039;s face.

&gt;It pulls you in for a hug, your face pressing into the fur between Her breasts.
&gt;To your surprise, it doesn&#039;t smell how you thought it would.
&gt;Instead of an unbearable stench, it instead has some vaguely familiar animal smell. Almost like that of a dog.
&gt;You can hear and feel a deep rumble coming from the Creature&#039;s chest as it rubs along your back with it&#039;s large hands.
&gt;It slowly eases you back over to the hide blanket.
&gt;You&#039;re slowly let down onto your back as the Thing begins to straddle you.
&gt;You can feel a thick, warm drop of it&#039;s natural lubricant drip onto your shaft.
&gt;One of her hands gently cups your groin, rubbing the slick moisture all over your length.
&gt;She coos at you as she coaxes your dick to rise like some sort of sick snake-charmer.
&gt;She begins to stroke your length slowly, her other hand positioned on your chest to keep you from running.
&gt;Many conflicting thoughts are rushing through your head at this point, most of them relating to whether you should run or not.
&gt;Well, it&#039;s not like you could get out the front of the cave. And you&#039;re pretty certain that the other end of the cave wouldn&#039;t really give you many options...
&gt;Oh, what the hell. You might as well try to enjoy this before the Creature decides to rip your neck open.
&gt;You let out a sigh, and rest your head onto the pelt under you.
&gt;The Creature let&#039;s out a satisfied squeal as it sees you finally giving in.
&gt;You look it in the eyes as it shimmys up your pelvis a bit.
&gt;You can see it holding your dick with one hand, trying her best to align it with her own slick opening.
&gt;When she has it just where she wants it, she slowly eases herself down, your cock sinking into her.
&gt;She eases onto your shaft at a tortuously slow rate, taking atleast 2 minutes until your hips finally meet.
&gt;She shivers happily, feeling you hilted inside of her.
&gt;Panting, she begins to lift up again, just as slowly as before.
&gt;You&#039;re not sure how long the cycle continues, but she has your dick throbbing inside of her, begging for more.
&gt;She looks at you with a knowing smirk, her hand leaving your chest.
&gt;Big mistake, faggot!
&gt;You immediately thrust up into her, forcing a loud cry out of her.
&gt;Her hips drop down onto you, smacking against your pelvis with a loud slap.
&gt;It stings a bit, you&#039;re too busy trying to stuff her full of your cock to even register the pain.
&gt;If you were going out, you were going out with a bang! Literally!
&gt;You hammer into the Furred woman&#039;s cunt without mercy, drawing all sorts of embarrassing noises out of her.
&gt;At one point she even flops onto her side, your dick popping out of her.
&gt;Without skipping a beat, you push her onto her back, climbing on top of her before slamming back into her.
&gt;Her skinny legs and arms loosely wraps around you as you pound into her.
&gt;She lets out several loud, feral cries as you slam deep inside of her.
&gt;Suddenly, her arms and legs tighten around you, and she lets out an ungodly scream as her climax hits her like a bullet.
&gt;It&#039;s enough to set you over the edge as well.
&gt;You groan as you spray her insides white with your love, her internal muscles drawing your cum directly into her womb.
&gt;Her hand lovingly strokes your head as she huffs and pants, her long tongue hanging out of her mouth.
&gt;Your head rests in her fur, your head swimming.
&gt;You feel a deep and satisfied rumble coming from deep within her.
&gt;Her fur feels so warm, and you can&#039;t help but close your eyes.
&gt;Everything feels right in this moment.
&gt;Balls deep inside a monster who probably killed your Girlfriend? Whatever.
&gt;Trapped in a cave 30 feet off of the ground? Eh, so what?
&gt;Hopelessly lost in the Appalachians? Well, it could be worse.
&gt;With a smile, you left yourself drift off to sleep.

&gt;To your shock, you wake up the following morning.
&gt;You sit up on the pelt, your skin sticky with the remainders of last night.
&gt;Next to you, you can see the Creature looking at you with a peaceful smile.
&gt;She&#039;s happily rubbing her stomach, staring at you.
&gt;To your shock, she suddenly speaks in a raspy voice.
&gt;&quot;Our children... We will raise them... Together...&quot;
&gt;idshabbening.png
&gt;Well, you could cross &quot;fathering demon children&quot; off of your bucket list.
&gt;You sigh, laying back down.
&gt;She reaches over, patting you on the thigh.

&gt;From that day on, you were never again seen by the outside world.
&gt;Your Girlfriend had actually survived, being picked up by the side of the road crying about some &quot;huge fucking monster&quot;.
&gt;Her cries were interpreted as those of someone in a state of  shock and hysteria, and were thus ignored.
&gt;Your disappearance had been investigated for about a month and a half before being dropped.
&gt;The official word that closed the investigation was that your camp had been attacked by a Black Bear, and you had been killed.
&gt;Never-mind the fact that no traces of Bear fur were found at your camp, and Bears hadn&#039;t even been sighted in the region for the past 6 years.
&gt;You lived on, somewhat happily, in the company of your monstrous baby-mama and your many children.
&gt;And there you would remain.
&gt;It could be worse, though.
&gt;Hey, at least she didn&#039;t eat you.
