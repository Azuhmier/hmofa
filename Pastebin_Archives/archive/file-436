She had a height of a kid but a body of a fertility goddess, thighs so thick and soft you could use them as a pillow, boobs so big and round they had to be at least E cups, and a set of hips that looked like it could support the world.  Although others say that she has a lil pudge going on her stomach, you know that she has a lot of strength stored in that tiny body of hers, that only serves as fuel for your raging dick.
Her being a wolverine blessed her with an oily dark grey coat of fur making it smooth and resistant to the cold. Like other wolverine girls, she sports a mask of cream color fur on her face making her look like a stereotypical bandit in the night.
&quot;w-whatever, who needs to go on a stupid date. I already own your ass,&quot; she muttered while she stuck in your embrace. 
&quot;I guess you don&#039;t want to go to that new restaurant that opened up,&quot; you say. 
&quot;The one with the deer burgers!? I heard that the meat they use is fresh and they grind the meat to order!&quot; she excitedly responded.
&quot;Yup. That&#039;s the one. Shame I wanted to enjoy a nice walk with my gf while on my way to a new restaurant to spoil her.&quot; you say.
&quot;Well what are we waiting for come on!&quot; she said frantically as she started to run off.
&quot;Nope I want to enjoy a nice walk with you. Here.&quot; as you extended your hand to call hers.
&quot;R-really with all of this mushy stuff? P-people might think ive gone soft,&quot; she mumbled. 
&quot;Is it that bad to hold my hand?&quot; You say. 
&quot; N-N-NO! Its not like that! It just hard to keep m-my cool doing stuff...like...handholding.&quot; She stammered.
&quot;It&#039;s not gonna kill you.&quot; You say while you entwine your fingers with hers.
&quot;And besides I like seeing you cute and flustered like this.&quot; You said with a smug grin on your face.
&quot;S-shut up idiot&quot; Sirena says as a blush crawls on her cheeks.
&quot;You know you love it. I can see your tail wagging.&quot; You said.
&quot;E-enough. Lets go eat. I want to tear into something right now.&quot; she said as you two begin to walk down the street.</textarea>
