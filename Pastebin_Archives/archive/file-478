</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Doing gig at bowling alley, you and 8 other bands because it&#039;s the damn bowling alley </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Go on, do your 5 songs, show the metalcore kids how it’s done </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After packing your shit up, get told that some panda girl is doing a report on the local music scene for her journalism class and wants to interview you </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your drummer had done left, and your guitarist bailed at “panda.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Seemed odd she wasn&#039;t at a more anthro-friendly event, but what the hell, you&#039;ll do it, all you were doing was getting drunk anyway </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Which you’ll keep doing, as you take a pitcher of beer with you to go meet her </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bands are still playing, so they’ve put her off in some back room </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stagger back there, clumsily checking each room because you forgot to ask which room she was in </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually find her in a room that’s just her, a small table and a couple chairs </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s chubby, not surprising for a panda, has long black hair and is wearing a Venom shirt </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;#NWOBHM </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You plop down, pour some beer in a plastic cup and offer her some, would be rude not to </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She declines, has to drive </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;More for you then </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She introduces herself as Jade and tells you what class and college she&#039;s doing the report for </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s actually the same college you go to </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Asks pretty standard questions, howling you been playing, what your influences are, etc </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s really piqued when you start going on about how much folk music influences your songwriting </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not many humans would admit to liking “furry music,” but you never really cared who the writer of something was if the music spoke to you </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once she finishes her interview questions, the two of you keep talking about music because no one else has shown up to be interviewed </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you know it, the two of you are being kicked out because it&#039;s closing time </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No one else came to talk to her, speciesist bastards </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Call your guitarist since he was your ride </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He had actually left without you and gone home </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tell him how far you&#039;re gonna put your boot up his ass and hang up on him </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fuckin’ great, now you&#039;ve gotta take a cab, and they borderline price gouge late Saturday night </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jade says she lives in the same town as the college and can give you a ride </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You serpentine your way to her car, as it&#039;s the straightest you can walk </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Get in the car and buckle up </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Safety first </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The drive is uneventful, just talking about college things </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When she arrives at your apartment, she writes her number on a piece of paper and gives it to you, telling you to call or text if you ever wanna hang out </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Soundsh great, and here’sh mine.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take the same piece of paper, flip it over, write your number on it and give it back </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You thank her for the ride, and faceplant into the dirt getting out of the car </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quickly get up, give her a salute and close her door </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She watches to make sure you get into your apartment, which you get unlocked with the fifth key you try </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Collapsing on the couch, you pass out for the night </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">End Chapter 1 </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Chapter 2 </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Windows “Tada” sound awakens you from your drunken slumber </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn&#039;t silence your phone before passing out last night</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fishing it out of your pocket, you see a text from a number you don&#039;t recognize </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;’Hey it’s Jade, you gave me back my number with yours lol, how are you?’ </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t remember giving her your number, but you were pretty drunk, so probably did</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was texting you, so must have left a good impression, or at least not a bad one </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;’Hungover’ you respond back </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;’That sucks :(’ </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;’My fault for drinking like it was water’ </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;’lol, so when are your classes tomorrow?’ </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;’9-12 1-2 and 3-4’ </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I&#039;ve got a break at noon too, would you like to get lunch?’ </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;’Sure, where at?’ </div></li><li class="li1"><div

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were looking forward to lunch tomorrow, would be nice to not be eating alone </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s Sunday so you get started on your homework for class </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Get that finished after a few hours, fairly light weekend load </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Need to go shopping too, stock your fridge</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Out of beer from pre-gaming for the gig last night</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your wallet looks rather light in the cash department though</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Damnit, you forgot to get the gig money...again </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get in your car, having to go back down to the bowling alley before going shopping </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You arrive at the bowling alley, and luckily the guy at the desk was the same guy working last night </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Have to show your ID to prove who you are, but you get your share of the gig money </div></li><li class="li1"><div

Hey, some people said they saw you leaving with that furry last night.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“So?  My cunt of a guitarist left me here, she was just giving me a ride home.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Ah, well next time may want to consider what people will say about you if they see something like you getting in a car with one of them.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn&#039;t verbally respond to that, just rolled your eyes, took your money and left </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;One of them&quot;?  You know this is the south, and you&#039;d seen a fair bit of implicit bias against anthros, last night being a good example, but hearing someone talk like that always left a bad taste in your mouth

music </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Get out your bass and jam up some riffs, but just not feeling metal right now </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hmm, maybe some folk music will do the trick </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You fish out your acoustic guitar, find a pick and begin strumming </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sing a song you wrote about All Quiet on the Western Front (Im Westen Nichts Neues) </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It feels good to sing clean, you can&#039;t remember the last time you did </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You never could get a gig as a human folk singer though </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Human run places would always turn you down, say that wouldn&#039;t be something their clientele would care to listen to, or sometimes just straight up say “ain&#039;t havin no furry music here” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anthro places seemed to think you were pranking them when you&#039;d try to set something up </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Because God forbid a human wanna sing folk music </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Folk music used to be something everyone, human or anthro, would sing and perform </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then around the turn of the 20th century, a psuedo-intellectual movement swept the country, and suddenly folk music was something that was “below” human standards</div></li><li class="li1"><div

hadn&#039;t dismissed you liking it as a human </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She seemed nice, liked both folk and metal, and was rather fun to talk to last night </div></li><li

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your first three classes breeze by and you go down to the cafeteria </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you get there Jade’s nowhere to be seen, so you shoot her a text </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;’Ok here, where you at?’ </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;’omw’ </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Indeed she shows up after a couple minutes, this time just wearing a plain black shirt, which goes well with her colors </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re wearing a Cannibal Corpse shirt </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Alex Webster and George Fisher are big influences on you after all </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She approves of your choice in apparel, damn right, they&#039;re metal as fuck </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You both get lunch and find a table </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her lunch looks fairly similar to yours, mixture of veggies, fruits and meat </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not surprising, as anthros are normally omnivorous </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Convergent evolution and whatnot </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you talk about your classes, how they&#039;re going </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even though you were the only one to talk to her, she was able to get enough to do her report</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;d like to be an investigative journalist</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re majoring in chemistry, gonna try to go into that field when you graduate </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or maybe just cook meth, depending on the economy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Would be nice if you could get a break in music though</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lunch with her is a welcome change to your weekly routine, even if it seems like every so often you catch someone giving a hateful look at you for socializing with an anthro </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fuck em </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask if she&#039;d like to get lunch again Wednesday, and she agrees </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After lunch you both head to your respective classes, and you&#039;re already looking forward to the next time you see her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She is one interesting lady</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You start to feel that longing in your heart, and just kind of sigh</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Great, you&#039;ve got a crush, on an anthro</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe you should try asking her on a date</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Who knows what she&#039;d say though, human/anthro romance is considered extremely taboo</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But the heart wants what it wants, and you&#039;ve never really been one to ignore that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You arrive at your class and head in, hopefully two days will give you enough time to think about the best course of action</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">End of Chapter 2</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Chapter 3</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s now

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you have been texting back and forth, which was nice</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you kept reminding yourself that talking with a human and agreeing to date are two completely different things</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Most anthros seemed to have as low an opinion of interspecies relationships as humans</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But she wasn’t like most anthros</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still need to think of what to ask her to do as a date</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You start doing homework in the hopes you&#039;ll get an idea</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Finish it and still nothing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tuesday is band practice, so head out to meet your bandmates</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your guitarist apologizes for

when he heard she was a panda</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You just stare at him for a few seconds before bursting out in laughter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Scared, he got scared, of a panda</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Why were you scared of her?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”It’s not something I wanna talk about.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He actually seemed to be getting a bit upset, so you dropped it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The three of you have a songwriting session</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your guitarist had written some lyrics about stabbing babies in a maternity ward</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Brutal</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Y&#039;all are able to come up with some riffs that go well with the lyrics, and have the beginning of a pretty metal song</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After practice your guitarist leaves fairly quickly, leaving just you and your drummer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You ok?” he asks you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yeah, why?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”It&#039;s just you didn’t seem to quite have the drive you usually do, like…you met a girl didn&#039;t you?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Damn that bastard is observant</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t say anything, just kind of purse your lips</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I knew it, what&#039;s her name?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“No, I haven&#039;t met anyone.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Bullshit, I know that face you made when I said something,” He pauses for a second, “It&#039;s that panda you two were talking about isn&#039;t it.  That’s why you won&#039;t admit it.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;How the hell does he do it?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yes, ok, you&#039;re right, happy?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;“You tell her how you feel?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Not yet”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”So you plan on doing it, good, hope that works out for you.  An actual girlfriend beats the floozies we get any day of the week.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You just kind of cock your head a bit, he sounds surprisingly ok with telling you that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You heard of Paws and Claws?  It&#039;s a restaurant downtown,  most Saturday nights they have live music.  They also have quite a diverse menu, great place for both a human and anthro to go to.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“How do you know that?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He just smiles, “That&#039;s right, my girlfriend moved across the country before you joined the band.  She was a fox,  in both senses of the word.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn’t know he&#039;d had an anthro girlfriend, guess he never had a reason to mention it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“People ever say anything to you when you were dating her?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Honestly, not really.  Most people don&#039;t approve but it&#039;s not like they&#039;re actually gonna&#039; do anything about it.

I could pick you up around 7 or so.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Sounds good&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Great, so it&#039;s a date then.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She said yes, you&#039;re so happy, but you restrain your smile somewhat, try to play it cool</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After lunch and the rest of your classes, you head off to Wal-Mart</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Gotta get something nice to wear for Saturday</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Be Jade</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anon asked you out earlier today</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re excited</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ve never been to Paws and Claws, but know you&#039;re gonna&#039; have a great time with Anon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you get home you try to find your black dress, but it doesn&#039;t seem to be in your closet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe dad knows where it is</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You go to the living room and find him in his recliner, watching the news</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hey dad, I can&#039;t find my black dress.

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They&#039;re...all right, they play about half southern rock covers and half their own material </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re also pretty sure they&#039;re on something, not sure what, the rhythm guitarist looks high enough he&#039;s in danger of breaking orbit though </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Does let you and Jade make fun of them some at least </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After the lackluster show they set up for the patrons to do karaoke </div></li><li class="li1"><div

</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;That was awesome, you can sing clean pretty good.&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;ve got nothing on you

with her </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s the one to eventually break off, &quot;I should get heading inside, see you Monday.&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Be in a death metal band 
&gt;Play bass and sing, because it&#039;s the best combination 
&gt;Doing gig at bowling alley, you and 8 other bands because it&#039;s the damn bowling alley 
&gt;Go on, do your 5 songs, show the metalcore kids how it’s done 
&gt;After packing your shit up, get told that some panda girl is doing a report on the local music scene for her journalism class and wants to interview you 
&gt;Your drummer had done left, and your guitarist bailed at “panda.” 
&gt;Seemed odd she wasn&#039;t at a more anthro-friendly event, but what the hell, you&#039;ll do it, all you were doing was getting drunk anyway 
&gt;Which you’ll keep doing, as you take a pitcher of beer with you to go meet her 
&gt;Bands are still playing, so they’ve put her off in some back room 
&gt;You stagger back there, clumsily checking each room because you forgot to ask which room she was in 
&gt;Eventually find her in a room that’s just her, a small table and a couple chairs 
&gt;She&#039;s chubby, not surprising for a panda, has long black hair and is wearing a Venom shirt 
&gt;#NWOBHM 
&gt;You plop down, pour some beer in a plastic cup and offer her some, would be rude not to 
&gt;She declines, has to drive 
&gt;More for you then 
&gt;She introduces herself as Jade and tells you what class and college she&#039;s doing the report for 
&gt;It&#039;s actually the same college you go to 
&gt;Asks pretty standard questions, howling you been playing, what your influences are, etc 
&gt;She&#039;s really piqued when you start going on about how much folk music influences your songwriting 
&gt;Not many humans would admit to liking “furry music,” but you never really cared who the writer of something was if the music spoke to you 
&gt;Once she finishes her interview questions, the two of you keep talking about music because no one else has shown up to be interviewed 
&gt;Before you know it, the two of you are being kicked out because it&#039;s closing time 
&gt;No one else came to talk to her, speciesist bastards 
&gt;Call your guitarist since he was your ride 
&gt;He had actually left without you and gone home 
&gt;Tell him how far you&#039;re gonna put your boot up his ass and hang up on him 
&gt;Fuckin’ great, now you&#039;ve gotta take a cab, and they borderline price gouge late Saturday night 
&gt;Jade says she lives in the same town as the college and can give you a ride 
&gt;You serpentine your way to her car, as it&#039;s the straightest you can walk 
&gt;Get in the car and buckle up 
&gt;Safety first 
&gt;The drive is uneventful, just talking about college things 
&gt;When she arrives at your apartment, she writes her number on a piece of paper and gives it to you, telling you to call or text if you ever wanna hang out 
“Soundsh great, and here’sh mine.” 
&gt;You take the same piece of paper, flip it over, write your number on it and give it back 
&gt;You thank her for the ride, and faceplant into the dirt getting out of the car 
&gt;You quickly get up, give her a salute and close her door 
&gt;She watches to make sure you get into your apartment, which you get unlocked with the fifth key you try 
&gt;Collapsing on the couch, you pass out for the night 
End Chapter 1 
Chapter 2 
&gt;The Windows “Tada” sound awakens you from your drunken slumber 
&gt;You didn&#039;t silence your phone before passing out last night
&gt;Fishing it out of your pocket, you see a text from a number you don&#039;t recognize 
&gt;’Hey it’s Jade, you gave me back my number with yours lol, how are you?’ 
&gt;You don&#039;t remember giving her your number, but you were pretty drunk, so probably did
&gt;She was texting you, so must have left a good impression, or at least not a bad one 
&gt;’Hungover’ you respond back 
&gt;’That sucks :(’ 
&gt;’My fault for drinking like it was water’ 
&gt;’lol, so when are your classes tomorrow?’ 
&gt;’9-12 1-2 and 3-4’ 
&gt;I&#039;ve got a break at noon too, would you like to get lunch?’ 
&gt;’Sure, where at?’ 
&gt;’Main cafeteria work?’ 
&gt;’Sure’ 
&gt;’Great I&#039;ll see you then’ 
&gt;You were looking forward to lunch tomorrow, would be nice to not be eating alone 
&gt;It&#039;s Sunday so you get started on your homework for class 
&gt;Get that finished after a few hours, fairly light weekend load 
&gt;Need to go shopping too, stock your fridge
&gt;Out of beer from pre-gaming for the gig last night
&gt;Your wallet looks rather light in the cash department though
&gt;Damnit, you forgot to get the gig money...again 
&gt;You get in your car, having to go back down to the bowling alley before going shopping 
&gt;You arrive at the bowling alley, and luckily the guy at the desk was the same guy working last night 
&gt;Have to show your ID to prove who you are, but you get your share of the gig money 
&gt;”Here you go Anon.  Hey, some people said they saw you leaving with that furry last night.&quot;
“So?  My cunt of a guitarist left me here, she was just giving me a ride home.” 
&gt;”Ah, well next time may want to consider what people will say about you if they see something like you getting in a car with one of them.” 
&gt;You didn&#039;t verbally respond to that, just rolled your eyes, took your money and left 
&gt;&quot;One of them&quot;?  You know this is the south, and you&#039;d seen a fair bit of implicit bias against anthros, last night being a good example, but hearing someone talk like that always left a bad taste in your mouth 
&gt;You never saw a reason to hate them, they sometimes had odd behaviors and mannerisms, but that&#039;s all they were, odd 
&gt;Maybe if they bothered to actually interact with them more than the absolute minimum, they wouldn&#039;t think being in the same car with one was a sign of the apocalypse
&gt;Meh, no point getting riled up by fucktards, fuck them and whatever stupid shit they wanna gossip about 
&gt;You arrive at Wal-Mart, get your shit and get out, not in a social mood 
&gt;After getting home, decide the best way to unwind is write some music 
&gt;Get out your bass and jam up some riffs, but just not feeling metal right now 
&gt;Hmm, maybe some folk music will do the trick 
&gt;You fish out your acoustic guitar, find a pick and begin strumming 
&gt;Sing a song you wrote about All Quiet on the Western Front (Im Westen Nichts Neues) 
&gt;It feels good to sing clean, you can&#039;t remember the last time you did 
&gt;You never could get a gig as a human folk singer though 
&gt;Human run places would always turn you down, say that wouldn&#039;t be something their clientele would care to listen to, or sometimes just straight up say “ain&#039;t havin no furry music here” 
&gt;Anthro places seemed to think you were pranking them when you&#039;d try to set something up 
&gt;Because God forbid a human wanna sing folk music 
&gt;Folk music used to be something everyone, human or anthro, would sing and perform 
&gt;Then around the turn of the 20th century, a psuedo-intellectual movement swept the country, and suddenly folk music was something that was “below” human standards
&gt;And somehow that schism had stuck around into today, still alive and strong 
&gt;Jade was about the only person you could think of that hadn&#039;t dismissed you liking it as a human 
&gt;She seemed nice, liked both folk and metal, and was rather fun to talk to last night 
&gt;You were really looking forward to seeing her again 
&gt;Before you know it, it’s the next day 
&gt;Your first three classes breeze by and you go down to the cafeteria 
&gt;When you get there Jade’s nowhere to be seen, so you shoot her a text 
&gt;’Ok here, where you at?’ 
&gt;’omw’ 
&gt;Indeed she shows up after a couple minutes, this time just wearing a plain black shirt, which goes well with her colors 
&gt;You&#039;re wearing a Cannibal Corpse shirt 
&gt;Alex Webster and George Fisher are big influences on you after all 
&gt;She approves of your choice in apparel, damn right, they&#039;re metal as fuck 
&gt;You both get lunch and find a table 
&gt;Her lunch looks fairly similar to yours, mixture of veggies, fruits and meat 
&gt;Not surprising, as anthros are normally omnivorous 
&gt;Convergent evolution and whatnot 
&gt;The two of you talk about your classes, how they&#039;re going 
&gt;Even though you were the only one to talk to her, she was able to get enough to do her report
&gt;She&#039;d like to be an investigative journalist
&gt;You&#039;re majoring in chemistry, gonna try to go into that field when you graduate 
&gt;Or maybe just cook meth, depending on the economy
&gt;Would be nice if you could get a break in music though
&gt;Lunch with her is a welcome change to your weekly routine, even if it seems like every so often you catch someone giving a hateful look at you for socializing with an anthro 
&gt;Fuck em 
&gt;You ask if she&#039;d like to get lunch again Wednesday, and she agrees 
&gt;After lunch you both head to your respective classes, and you&#039;re already looking forward to the next time you see her
&gt;She is one interesting lady
&gt;You start to feel that longing in your heart, and just kind of sigh
&gt;Great, you&#039;ve got a crush, on an anthro
&gt;Maybe you should try asking her on a date
&gt;Who knows what she&#039;d say though, human/anthro romance is considered extremely taboo
&gt;But the heart wants what it wants, and you&#039;ve never really been one to ignore that
&gt;You arrive at your class and head in, hopefully two days will give you enough time to think about the best course of action
End of Chapter 2
Chapter 3
&gt;It&#039;s now Tuesday, and you still haven&#039;t come up with a plan
&gt;At least you don’t have any classes today, so plenty of time to think
&gt;The two of you have been texting back and forth, which was nice
&gt;But you kept reminding yourself that talking with a human and agreeing to date are two completely different things
&gt;Most anthros seemed to have as low an opinion of interspecies relationships as humans
&gt;But she wasn’t like most anthros
&gt;Still need to think of what to ask her to do as a date
&gt;You start doing homework in the hopes you&#039;ll get an idea
&gt;Finish it and still nothing
&gt;Tuesday is band practice, so head out to meet your bandmates
&gt;Your guitarist apologizes for leaving you Saturday night
&gt;You accept his apology, though are still a bit peeved about it
&gt;He got scared when he heard she was a panda
&gt; You just stare at him for a few seconds before bursting out in laughter
&gt;Scared, he got scared, of a panda
“Why were you scared of her?”
&gt;”It’s not something I wanna talk about.”
&gt;He actually seemed to be getting a bit upset, so you dropped it
&gt;The three of you have a songwriting session
&gt;Your guitarist had written some lyrics about stabbing babies in a maternity ward
&gt;Brutal
&gt;Y&#039;all are able to come up with some riffs that go well with the lyrics, and have the beginning of a pretty metal song
&gt;After practice your guitarist leaves fairly quickly, leaving just you and your drummer
&gt;”You ok?” he asks you
“Yeah, why?”
&gt;”It&#039;s just you didn’t seem to quite have the drive you usually do, like…you met a girl didn&#039;t you?”
&gt;Damn that bastard is observant
&gt;You don’t say anything, just kind of purse your lips
&gt;”I knew it, what&#039;s her name?”
“No, I haven&#039;t met anyone.”
&gt;”Bullshit, I know that face you made when I said something,” He pauses for a second, “It&#039;s that panda you two were talking about isn&#039;t it.  That’s why you won&#039;t admit it.”
&gt;How the hell does he do it?
“Yes, ok, you&#039;re right, happy?”
&gt;“You tell her how you feel?”
“Not yet”
&gt;”So you plan on doing it, good, hope that works out for you.  An actual girlfriend beats the floozies we get any day of the week.”
&gt;You just kind of cock your head a bit, he sounds surprisingly ok with telling you that
&gt;”You heard of Paws and Claws?  It&#039;s a restaurant downtown,  most Saturday nights they have live music.  They also have quite a diverse menu, great place for both a human and anthro to go to.”
“How do you know that?”
&gt;He just smiles, “That&#039;s right, my girlfriend moved across the country before you joined the band.  She was a fox,  in both senses of the word.”
&gt;You didn’t know he&#039;d had an anthro girlfriend, guess he never had a reason to mention it
“People ever say anything to you when you were dating her?”
&gt;”Honestly, not really.  Most people don&#039;t approve but it&#039;s not like they&#039;re actually gonna&#039; do anything about it.  Family&#039;s what you gotta&#039; worry about, they can be a real pain if they&#039;re zealously against it.&quot;
&gt;Your parents live 200 miles away, so wouldn&#039;t need to worry about that.  She lives with her dad still though.  Meh, you&#039;ll jump off that bridge if you come to it.
&gt;You two talk for a bit longer, then you head back to your apartment
&gt;When you get home, you look up that restaurant he mentioned
&gt;It looks like they&#039;ll be having a band play Saturday night, and overall does appear to be a good idea for a first date
&gt;So that just leaves asking her, and hoping she says yes
&gt;You had a pretty good feeling she would, but were still feeling nervous about it
&gt;Tomorrow rolls around, and it&#039;s the moment of truth
&gt;You find a booth in an area of the cafeteria with few people around, means it&#039;s quieter
&gt;As the two of you are eating, you go for it
&quot;Do you have any plans Saturday?&quot;
&gt;She thinks for a few seconds, &quot;I don&#039;t believe so, what&#039;s up?&quot;
&quot;I heard about this place, Paws and Claws, they&#039;re gonna&#039; have a band playing and supposedly have pretty good food.  I was wondering if you&#039;d like to go with me, like a-&quot;
&gt;&quot;As a date?&quot; She interrupts you, her right lip curling up in a half smile
&quot;Yeah.&quot;
&gt;She puts on a face like she&#039;s thinking about it, but she also has this playful look that gives a rather big inkling to her answer, &quot;What time?&quot;
&quot;The band starts at 8.  I could pick you up around 7 or so.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sounds good&quot;
&quot;Great, so it&#039;s a date then.&quot;
&gt;She said yes, you&#039;re so happy, but you restrain your smile somewhat, try to play it cool
&gt;After lunch and the rest of your classes, you head off to Wal-Mart
&gt;Gotta get something nice to wear for Saturday

&gt;Be Jade
&gt;Anon asked you out earlier today
&gt;You&#039;re excited
&gt;You&#039;ve never been to Paws and Claws, but know you&#039;re gonna&#039; have a great time with Anon
&gt;When you get home you try to find your black dress, but it doesn&#039;t seem to be in your closet
&gt;Maybe dad knows where it is
&gt;You go to the living room and find him in his recliner, watching the news
&quot;Hey dad, I can&#039;t find my black dress.  Do you know where it is?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I think it got moved to the guest bedroom closet a while back, let me get up and check.&quot;
&gt;He puts down his recliner and gets up
&gt;At 6&#039;6&quot; he&#039;s almost a foot taller than you, and being over 300 pounds he&#039;s earned the title of &quot;Giant Panda&quot;
&gt;He goes to the guest bedroom and comes back fairly quickly with your dress on a hanger
&gt;&quot;Here you go Pumpkin, what do you need it for?&quot;
&quot;I&#039;ve got a date Saturday.&quot;
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s great, remember if he doesn&#039;t treat you good just tell me and I&#039;ll hammer him into the ground like a tent stake.&quot;
&gt;Jesuschristhowhorrifying
&quot;Dad I can take care of myself, besides he&#039;s a pretty great guy.&quot;
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s good, saves me from a manslaughter charge,&quot; he plops back down into his recliner.
&gt;You take your dress and go back to your room
&gt;Putting it on you&#039;re a bit surprised it still fits fine, but it&#039;s a good surprise
&gt;You can&#039;t wait for Saturday
End of Chapter 3
Chapter 4 
&gt;Today&#039;s the day of your and Jade&#039;s first date 
&gt;You can&#039;t remember when you last went on one 
&gt;Usually you&#039;d just bang the occasional piece of ass from a gig 
&gt;Got your fair share as the singer, they never cared that you played bass though 
&gt;You get dress in a button up shirt, nice pants and shoes 
&gt;They really do have everything at Wal-Mart 
&gt;Put your hair back in a ponytail, you play metal so of course it&#039;s long 
&gt;You get in your car and start driving to pick her up 
&gt;Immaculate blue 1987 Plymouth Reliant 
&gt;You just love the bench seats and overall look of a K-car 
&gt;30 years old, but you’ve been good to her and she still runs like a dream 
&gt;You arrive at her place, and give her a call to let you know you&#039;re there 
&gt;You&#039;d have gone up to her door but she didn’t feel like her dad was ready to see her on a date with a human 
&gt;She comes out wearing a black dress that goes down to her knees, and what look like ornate wooden sandals 
&gt;The dress also shows a fair bit of cleavage 
&gt;Her usual attire kind of hid how big her breasts were, calling them “melons” wouldn&#039;t be inaccurate 
&gt;She gets in and greets you with a kiss on the cheek 
&gt;Her fur makes it tickle a bit, and any concerns you had about the date going bad seem to disappear 
&gt;You look her over, it looks like she put on black lipstick to make her lips look fuller, and may have done something with her eyelashes, though the black fur around her eyes makes it difficult to tell 
&gt;You shift into gear and begin the drive, idly chitchatting along the way 
&gt;The drive is pleasant and uneventful, and after about 15 minutes you arrive at Paws and Claws 
&gt;You find a nearby place to park (yay) and get out of the car 
&gt;When you enter the restaurant the host, a flamboyant grey fox, greets you 
&gt;”Welcome to Paws and Claws, is it just you two cuties today?” 
&quot;Yeah, just us.  Can we get a booth near the stage?&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Absolutely, I&#039;m pretty sure we still have a place,&quot; he takes two menus and leads you and Jade to a booth that gives you a nice view of the stage 
&gt;He hands each of you a menu, and tells you that a waiter will be with you shortly 
&gt;They have some kind of bamboo shoot stew on the menu, which she recommends getting as a side 
&gt;Wheninrome.bmp 
&gt;You decide to order it with your entree, and she gets it too 
&gt;Your food arrives fairly quickly, and to your surprise the bamboo stew is actually rather good 
&gt;After eating you both turn to watch the band, who are about to go on 
&gt;They&#039;re...all right, they play about half southern rock covers and half their own material 
&gt;You&#039;re also pretty sure they&#039;re on something, not sure what, the rhythm guitarist looks high enough he&#039;s in danger of breaking orbit though 
&gt;Does let you and Jade make fun of them some at least 
&gt;After the lackluster show they set up for the patrons to do karaoke 
&gt;Jade wants to sing a song with you 
&gt;You agree, could be fun 
&gt;She picks a rock song that the two of you can sing together 
&gt;While waiting your turn you watch the other people going ahead of you 
&gt;Quality is all over the place, some are so drunk they can barely stand 
&gt;A bat guy goes on and just shrieks the whole time 
&gt;Soon it&#039;s you and Jade&#039;s turn and you both head up to the stage 
&gt;You each take a mic and you look over everyone in the restaurant 
&gt;No dirty looks, no one seemingly disapproving of you being with an anthro 
&gt;Feelsgoodman 
&gt;The two of you start singing, and while you&#039;re all right at singing clean, her voice is majestic 
&gt;You two really get into singing, moving around and having a blast with the song 
&gt;When you finish, it seems like the crowd applauds the loudest you&#039;ve heard them do so far tonight 
&gt;You and Jade decide to go ahead and head back home shortly after you finish 
&gt;&quot;That was awesome, you can sing clean pretty good.&quot; 
&quot;I&#039;ve got nothing on you though.&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Did you really think I was that good?&quot; 
&quot;Absolutely amazing.&quot; 
&gt;You and her keep talking until you get her back to her house 
&gt;You lean over to kiss her, and her lips touch yours 
&gt;You&#039;ve never kissed an anthro before, it feels...right 
&gt;When you break the kiss, you look into her eyes, neither of you quite wanting it to end 
&gt;You go back in, get a little carried away for a first kiss when you wind up tongue wrestling with her 
&gt;She&#039;s the one to eventually break off, &quot;I should get heading inside, see you Monday.&quot; 
&quot;See you Monday, good night.&quot; 
&gt;She gets out of the car and heads into her house 
&gt;You drive home, it&#039;s been a damn good day 
End of Chapter 4
Chapter 5 
&gt;Ever since your first date with Jade, things have been going pretty good 
&gt;Jade didn’t really seem to care what other people thought about you two dating 
&gt;You&#039;d hold her hand when walking around campus, and she&#039;d always give a goodbye kiss when you each had to split to head to your separate classes 
&gt;Honestly most people paid you no bother, and those who disapproved normally just glared or gossiped behind your back 
&gt;During the first week at campus after you started dating her, only had one person say anything to you 
&gt;Some old Opossum, blind in one eye, missing half his teeth and doing some kind of religious protest had seen you kiss her, and chided you for having “unnatural relations.” 
&gt;”If God wanted human and anthro to lie together, he would’ve made it so they could procreate.” 
&gt;You thought about making a retort, but had to get to class so just ignored him 
&gt;You hadn&#039;t had sex with her yet anyways, and not having to worry about knocking her up would be nice 
&gt;Not to mention most STDs didn’t spread between humans and anthros 
&gt;Whatever, it&#039;s not like there was a God anyways 
&gt;You needed to think of another thing to do for a date 
&gt;She had been coming over to your apartment some, you&#039;d smoke weed, listen to and play music, she was actually all right at the guitar, couldn’t solo but could hold a rhythm well, play video games and make out, but you hadn&#039;t gone past second base yet 
&gt;Or whatever both of you being shirtless and playing with her tits was 
&gt;They were nice tits, really big and covered in beautiful black fur 
&gt;Her nipples were black like the fur around them, and quite an erogenous zone for her 
&gt;She lets out these primal yips whenever you find the right spot with them 
&gt;You drag your mind away from dirty thoughts, what can you do with her that would be going out 
&gt;You settle on a walk by the river, there&#039;s a trail that runs along part of it and there usually isn&#039;t that many people walking it this time of year 
&gt;You send her a text asking if she&#039;d like to do that Thursday afternoon after her classes 
&gt;’Sure sounds nice’ 
&gt;Neat, second date is on 
&gt;Be nice to go out without having to dress up, even if you loved how good she looked in that dress Saturday before last 
&gt;After her classes finish Thursday she comes by your apartment, and you both head to the trail in her car 
&gt;The weather is nice today, sunny in the low 60’s, great for a walk 
&gt;You arrive at the start of the trail, it’s not too long, only about a mile and a half, so three miles back and forth 
&gt;You take her hand as you begin to walk, the fur on the back of it feels nice and soft 
&gt;She&#039;s looking around, taking everything in 
&gt;”This is nice, it&#039;s so peaceful out here.” 
“Yeah I like coming here sometimes to relax.” 
&gt;The two of you walk in silence for a little over a half mile when you get to a small path that goes right down to the river 
&gt;You lead her down it to your favorite spot on the trail, a place next to the river with a lot of flat rocks that are great for skipping across the water 
&gt;You and her spend a few minutes taking turns flinging rocks 
&gt;You&#039;re better at it, you do it pretty much every time you&#039;re out here, but she gets the hang of it pretty quickly 
&gt;She got one to skip about 5 times, and it made her giggle in excitement 
&gt;”This is so fun,” the smile suddenly fades from her face, “So umm…I just remembered, my dad wants to meet you.” 
&gt;You just look at her, she sounded like that was bad news 
&gt;”I&#039;ve been talking about you, and where I&#039;ve been spending a lot of time at your place and we&#039;re dating, he wants to judge you for himself.  He&#039;s a bit overprotective.” 
&gt;You figured you&#039;d have to meet him eventually 
“You don&#039;t sound happy about that.” 
&gt;Well, I haven&#039;t told him that you&#039;re…well…” 
“Human?” 
&gt;”He never asked and I was kind of vague about it, I told him we met at the bowling alley but didn’t elaborate.  I’m not sure how to tell him.  How about you come over Sunday, I&#039;m sure I can think of something by then.” 
&gt;Sunday would work for you, give you a few days to prepare, put on your best face for him 
“Yeah, I can do Sunday.” 
&gt;”Great,” with that conversation out of the way, you go back to skipping rocks 
&gt;You and her return back to the trail once you both get bored throwing rocks 
&gt;The rest of the walk is quite nice, it’s springtime so a lot of things are in bloom, with beautiful colors and smells 
&gt;Makes you wonder why so few people seem to come here 
&gt;Maybe if they had a beautiful panda to enjoy it with they would 
&gt;Pretty soon you&#039;ve gone down the trail and back 
&gt;Seemed like no time at all 
&gt;You suggest stopping to get pizza, then going back to your place 
&gt;She stops by Little Sleazer’s and you buy a pizza for the both of you 
&gt;If you were by yourself you&#039;d totally be eating this pizza while driving, but you figure best to wait until y&#039;all are back at your place 
&gt;It&#039;s only like 5 minutes back to your place anyways 
&gt;Once y&#039;all arrive, you both get out and head in, the smell of this pizza is driving you mad 
&gt;Set the pizza on your coffee table, turn on your Xbox and bring up YouTube 
&gt;You look up a GWAR video and sit down on the couch next to her 
&gt;You and her both split the pizza, letting it autoplay from one GWAR video to the next 
&gt;After finishing it off, which doesn&#039;t take long, she snuggles up against you, putting her head on your shoulder as you put your arm around her 
&gt;You keep watching a few more videos, waiting for the food to settle before making a move 
&gt;Once you feel like it&#039;s been long enough, you move your arm that&#039;s around her and start to gently caress her breast 
&gt;She doesn&#039;t seem to respond to it 
&gt;You turn your head to look at her, and she&#039;s fallen asleep 
&gt;Well shoot 
&gt;Oh well, the pizza is giving you the itis anyways, a nap wouldn&#039;t be a bad thing 
&gt;You gently wake her, and she kind of snorts when you do 
&quot;Hey, let&#039;s go to my bedroom, would be more comfy to nap there.&quot; 
&gt;She responds with a half mumbled &quot;ok&quot; before getting up and making her way to the bedroom 
&gt;You follow behind her, and come into the room to her stripping everything off except her panties and crawling into your bed 
&gt;It&#039;s a queen, so plenty big for two people, even if you normally take up the whole thing by yourself 
&gt;You strip down to your underwear too, and get under the covers, snuggling up to her as the big spoon and putting your arm around her 
&gt;She&#039;s back out pretty quickly, and you feel your own eyes getting heavy 
&gt;This was also a pretty good date, even if you didn&#039;t get to fool around 
End of Chapter 5
Chapter 6
&gt;The rest of your Thursday was uneventful
&gt;You and Jade both napped for a while so she had to get going by the time y&#039;all woke up
&gt;You&#039;re gonna be meeting her dad tomorrow and have no idea how that&#039;ll go
&gt;Hopefully he doesn&#039;t go ballistic or anything
&gt;But tonight is Saturday, and that means bar gig
&gt;It&#039;s one band opening for yours, and you headlining
&gt;A fair improvement from the bowling alley
&gt;Jade said she&#039;s gonna come and watch you play
&gt;That means you&#039;re gonna show off more than usual
&gt;Just hope the guitarist doesn&#039;t freak out when he sees her
&gt;You did tell him she&#039;d be there, he just gave a muted “ok”
&gt;The opening band is finishing up, so y&#039;all help them get their stuff off the stage and they help y&#039;all set up
&gt;Maybe some day you&#039;ll be popular enough to afford a roadie or two
&gt;As you get ready to go on, you look over the audience and see Jade sitting at a table
&gt;Looks like she&#039;s about the only anthro here
&gt;She blows you a kiss when she sees you&#039;re looking at her
&gt;Actually manages to put a smile on your face, which you contort into a grin when you get ready to start playing
“We&#039;re here to play metal and fuck shit up.”
&gt;Immediately launch into the first song, hard and fast
&gt;You play with your fingers instead of a pick, and they&#039;re a blur across the strings
&gt;Your singing is guttural and brutal, yet your words stay at least somewhat coherent
&gt;No pit, the bar wouldn’t allow it, but got people giving the horns and headbanging
&gt;Jade&#039;s getting into it too, her long, black hair whipping around
&gt;Play songs for over an hour, wrapping up with a Cannibal Corpse cover
“You know what my favorite way to fuck is? *Gutturally* WITH A KNIFE!”
&gt;Fucked_With_A_Knife.mp3
&gt;Everyone starts hootin, hollarin and throwin up the horns when you finish
&gt;“One more song,” the crowd is chanting
&gt;The three of you quickly converse
&gt; Since you’re headlining there isn’t anyone waiting to play after you
&gt;Y&#039;all decide to give them one more song
&gt;Go with the baby stabbing one, it still needs some fine tuning but it&#039;s pretty much good to go
“Well…I guess we can do one more, this one’s called Fourth Trimester Abortion.”
&gt;Commencing the shredding
&gt;The crowd loves it
&gt;It&#039;s totally going on the next album
&gt;Get to clearing the stage and packing things up after the last song
&gt;Jade comes backstage to meet you while y&#039;all are still packing things
&gt;Your drummer introduces himself to her, whereas your guitarist kind of keeps his distance, just says “hi” and meekly waves
&gt;Seriously why the hell does he find pandas scary?
&gt;The three of you make small talk while you and the drummer keep loading equipment, your guitarist has gotten quiet
&gt;Doesn&#039;t take long to load everything up in the drummer’s van
&gt;He gets in and heads out, y&#039;all will unload everything Tuesday before practice
&gt;Your guitarist ducks out too, leaving just you and Jade
&gt;&quot;Wanna head back to your place?” she leans in close to you so she can whisper in your ear, “I love watching you play, let&#039;s see what else you&#039;re good at with your fingers.”
&gt;You get another stupid smile on your face from hearing that
“I’ll meet you at my place.”
&gt;You give her a quick peck before booking it out to your car and taking off to your place
&gt;You drive at a lawful pace to your apartment, you&#039;re super excited but not like you can do much without her
&gt;Get to your place before her, rush inside to your bedroom
&gt;Go to your dresser, and you pull out about 5 candles, placing them strategically throughout the room
&gt;Now for the scented one, to properly set the mood
&gt;Decide to go with lavender, since it&#039;s supposedly relaxing, and does smell nice
&gt;You just finish getting them lit and positioned when you hear her open the front door
&gt;You peek out of your bedroom, and motion for her to come to you
&gt;Turn around to double check everything, and suddenly find yourself being hugged from behind by a bear
&gt;You forgot you can get from the door to your room in like 3 seconds
&gt;She takes a look around the room while still latched onto you, “You&#039;re such a romantic.  I take it you wanna do things in here?”
“Nah, I just lit the candles to hide the smell of weed and cheap beer.”
&gt;She giggled and nibbled on your ear, “That&#039;s too bad, I like the smell of weed.”
&gt;You look over at your replica Bong of Destiny
&gt;It actually works, you wouldn&#039;t have bought it if it was just a prop
&gt;Getting baked would enhance the mood
“Well we can remedy that”
&gt;You pop her arms off you, grab your bong, and get a bag of the good shit
&gt;Pack that shit, fill it up and hit it
&gt;Draws like a pencil
&gt;You and Jade pass it back and forth, each taking a few hits
&gt;Once nice and baked, you put the bong back on its stand
&gt;Jade&#039;s crawled into your bed, she&#039;s on her back, eyes closed and rubbing her nipples through her clothes
&gt;You crawl into bed to join her, and maneuver yourself on top of her
&gt;You smile at her, and she smiles back
&gt;You kind of start space out, just admiring how gorgeous she is
&gt;A sudden kiss brings you back to Earth
&gt;Oh right, this is what you were doing
&gt;You push your tongue into her mouth, wrestling with hers
&gt;Tastes like sweet wine
&gt;You start to grind your hips against hers, and she wraps her arms around you
&gt;Grabbing at her shirt, you pull it up and she adjusts so you can pull it off
&gt;As soon as you get hers off, she grabs at yours and does the same
&gt;She still has her bra on, which hooks together from the front, so just a quick reach down, work your magic fingers and…
&gt;BAM, let dem puppies out
&gt;Big, black and beautiful
&gt;You toss her shirt to the foot of the bed and finish taking off her bra
&gt;They say more than a handful’s a waste, but what do they know
&gt;You start massaging and playing with her breasts like a kitten desperate for milk
&gt;Her fur makes them very soft
&gt;Everything about her is soft
&gt;Like a big, sexy pillow
&gt;You start to space out a bit again, though don’t stop your kneading
&gt;This time it&#039;s the feeling of your pants being undone that snaps you back
&gt;&quot;Mama bear wants to see what you&#039;re hiding there.&quot;
&gt;Ok calling herself &quot;mama bear&quot; is a bit weird, but it wasn&#039;t anything that was gonna&#039; stop you
&gt;It takes her a bit of finagling to get them off, you really need a proper belt, and whips it out
&gt;It&#039;s a bit bigger than average, nothing to write home about, but never fails to disappoint
&gt;She definitely likes what she&#039;s got ahold of, and begins to slowly stroke you off
&gt;The pads on her hands feel really good, it&#039;s a bit surprising since they seemed a bit rough when you&#039;d hold her hand
&gt;You take one of your hands off her breasts and start sliding down her stomach toward her crotch, enjoying the feeling of her fur through your fingers
&gt;Stop right at her pants
&gt;She had her eyes closed in anticipation, but you stopping causes her to look at you and let a noise that&#039;s halfway between a frustrated moan and a growl
&gt;She totally wants it
&gt;Slip your hand down her pants, and can feel as her fur gives way to her moist sex
&gt;Time to start working your magic
&gt;Your fingers trace and caress all the folds of her, trying to find her weaknesses
&gt;Pretty quickly get quite the reaction as her eyes roll back in her head
&gt;Her mouth is half open and she’s making these guttural moaning sounds
&gt;You may be doing too good, as she&#039;s so lost in it she’s kind of stopped jerking you off
&gt;Meh, you were never one to put your pleasure before your girl’s
&gt;Lean down and suckle on her tit while using your free hand to play with the other
&gt;Her moaning picks up in speed and pitch
&gt;”C-Coming” is all she says as she shudders violently
&gt;You keep going, not letting up until her orgasm finishes
&gt;Pull your hand out of her pants, it&#039;s covered in her juices
&gt;You lick them, tastes like sweet honey
&gt;She&#039;s looking up at you, still basking in the afterglow
&gt;”Mmm that was something, a girl could get addicted to that.”
“I aim to please.”
&gt;”That you do, now it&#039;s my turn to show you how good I am.”
&gt;She sits up and pushes you down onto your back
&gt;She takes your cock in her paw, leans down and gives a long lick along the length of the shaft
&gt;”Mama Bear’s gonna take good care of you.”
&gt;Maybe you should say something about the Mama Bear thing
&gt;Reminds you of girls who call you daddy
&gt;On the other hand, as she takes you to the hilt in her mouth and starts working her own skills, she can call herself whatever the hell she wants
&gt;She definitely knows what she’s doing
&gt;Knows just how to work the foreskin, a skill that so few girls seem to have
&gt;And the balls, plays with them just right
&gt; They say fat chicks give good head because they’re hungry
&gt;Not that she’s fat, she&#039;s…voluptuous
&gt;If she was hungry she&#039;d just bite it off
&gt;With her many sharp, pointy teeth
&gt; There’s an idea for a song, a girl who bites off and eats peoples dicks
&gt;You gotta write that down
&gt;Oh right, you’re getting a blowjob right now
&gt;A damn good one at that
&gt;Gotta buy more of that weed
&gt;You&#039;re getting close now
&gt; Whatever she’s doing with her tongue you don’t think a human girl could
&gt;Usually when you come you make a manly grunt
&gt;But because you&#039;re high as fuck you make the sound of a dying whale 
&gt;Blow your massive load all in her mouth, which she greedily licks up and swallows
&gt;She giggles a bit, “Enjoyed that?”
“Incredible.”
&gt;She crawls up to lay down next to you, her soft breasts pressing up against you
&gt;She nuzzles and licks your face, and you take and hold her hand, giving her a few love pecks in return
&gt;The two of you lay together for a little while
&gt;”I should get going, dad’s expecting me home, and I need to get things ready for tomorrow.  Try to be by around 5 ok?”
“Ok.”
&gt;She gets up and gets herself dressed
&gt;You re-secure your pants and get up to see her to the door
“I&#039;ll see you tomorrow.”
&gt;Give her a kiss goodbye
&gt;Watch as she gets in her car and drives off
&gt; You&#039;re worried about tomorrow, hopefully everything goes well
&gt; Just have to wait and see, and be on your best behaviour
&gt;Go ahead and head to bed, trying not to worry about it
End chapter 6
Chapter 7 
&gt;Driving down the road to Jade&#039;s 
&gt;ETA 2 minutes 
&gt;You’re dressed in the one set of nice clothes you have 
&gt;Showered and groomed, hair pulled back 
&gt;No tie, you always had a fear it would get stuck in something and you&#039;d suffocate 
&gt;Or be decapitated 
&gt;Or someone would use it as a garrote 
&gt;Pull into the driveway and get out of your car 
&gt;Two-story house, typical suburban look 
&gt;Straighten your clothes out, and begin the long march to the door 
&gt;It’s only about 30 feet, but feels a lot farther 
&gt;Get to the door, ring the doorbell 
&gt;Moment of truth 
&gt;Hear the thudthudthud of something very big coming to the door 
&gt;The door opens up, and before you stands a very large, ornery looking panda 
&gt;He&#039;s a full head taller than you and built like a brick shithouse 
&gt;He just stares at you for a few agonizing seconds 
&gt;”You anon?” 
“Yes sir, and you must be Jade’s father.” 
&gt;Reach out to give him a hand shake, put on a slight smile 
&gt;He shakes your hand, and squeezes hard, locking eyes with you 
&gt;It hurts, any harder and you think he&#039;d break your hand 
&gt;You manage to keep the same facial expression though 
&gt;After a few seconds he lets go 
&gt;”Come on in.” 
&gt;So far so good, you think 
&gt;Guess Jade let him know that you were a human 
&gt;He didn’t seem to have a negative reaction to you at least 
&gt;The hand-crushing and mean stare might be normal 
&gt;”ANON’S HERE,” he yells 
&gt;You follow him into the foyer 
&gt;Smell whatever&#039;s cooking, but you&#039;re not sure what it is 
&gt;Smells good at least 
&gt;Jade comes out of what appears to be the living room 
&gt;She&#039;s wearing a black dress, different from the one she wore on your date last week 
&gt;This dress is full length and less revealing 
&gt;Makes sense not wanting to show the girls off in front of her father 
&gt;She greets you with a hug and a kiss on the cheek 
&gt;Expect to get throttled, but fortunately nothing 
&gt;”I see daddy didn&#039;t scare you off.” 
&gt;”He hasn&#039;t given me a reason to…yet,” he interjects 
&gt;”And I&#039;m sure he won’t give you one.” 
&gt;”Well why don’t you give him a tour of the house, I&#039;m almost finished cooking.” 
&gt;She takes you by the hand and leads you to the living room 
&gt;It&#039;s a pretty standard living, TV and couch and shit 
&gt;On the wall you see a picture of her family from when she was a baby 
&gt;She hadn&#039;t mentioned her mom before 
&gt;She looks just like her mom going off the picture 
&gt;There&#039;s a few more family pictures, but they’re all just her and her dad 
“That your mom?” 
&gt;”Yeah, I don’t remember her though, she died when I was a baby.  Dad doesn’t talk about it.” 
&gt;That got dark quick 
&gt;Y&#039;all move on from the living room, and she shows you the rest of the first floor 
&gt;Dining room, kitchen, garage, study, just kind of skim those 
&gt;She then takes you upstairs 
&gt;Points out her dad&#039;s room and the guest bedroom, and takes you into her room 
&gt;Band posters all over the room 
&gt;Venom, Cannibal Corpse, Decapitated, Vader, and the big bear himself, Stan Rogers 
&gt;Stan Rogers was a bear, because fuck you that’s why 
&gt;TV, computer, decent looking stereo, guitar, and a cage with two guinea pigs on top of her dresser 
&gt;White with brownish feet, ears and nose, and red eyes 
&gt;Just too cute 
&gt;She also has a bookshelf full of CDs 
&gt;She leads you over to show you what all she has 
“Your dad didn’t have a bad reaction to me.” 
&gt;”Yeah, when I told him you were human he took it pretty well.  I think he just wanted to see if you&#039;re like how I said.” 
&gt;You wrap your arms around her from behind and rub your head against hers 
“And what did you tell him.” 
&gt;She turns herself around and puts her arms around you as well 
&gt;”About how nice you are, what we did on our dates, the music you play and how well you sing.” 
“Tell him how good I am with my fingers?” 
&gt;That elicits a playful smack from her, “no!” 
&gt;She gives you a quick kiss 
&gt;”I didn&#039;t tell him how good you are at kissing either.” 
&gt;You both kiss deeply 
&gt;Her tongue, her teeth, you love the way feel 
&gt;Your little tryst is abruptly interrupted though 
&gt;”GET YOUR ASSES DOWN HERE AND EAT,” her dad yells 
&gt;Break off the kiss 
&gt;”Maybe we can come back up here later.” 
&gt;Damn can she be seductive 
&gt;You both head downstairs and to the dining room 
&gt;The table is about big enough for six people 
&gt;Three sets of dinnerware and plates set up, one at the head is of the table and one along each side 
&gt;Food is set out in the middle of the table 
&gt;Some kind of meat, turkey you think, and various sides, some of which look questionably edible 
&gt;They&#039;re probably supposed to look like that 
&gt;Hopefully they&#039;re supposed to look like that 
&gt;You sit on one side across from Jade, and her father sits at the head of the table 
&gt;They both just start putting food on their plates, so you go ahead and start getting food 
&gt;Some turkey, some of the green stuff with maybe rice in it, and some corn 
&gt;”Eat up, it shouldn&#039;t poison you,” he states plainly 
&gt;Shouldn&#039;t, well that’s reassuring 
&gt;Though giving it a bit of thought, could be a concern, some foods anthros eat are poisonous to humans and vice-versa 
&gt;They’ve both already started eating 
&gt;Go ahead and try the green stuff 
&gt;It’s…surprisingly good 
&gt;Guess you learn to cook as a single father 
&gt;”So Jade says you play some folk music?  Maybe you can play for us some after dinner.” 
&gt;He&#039;s calling you out 
&gt;Well he&#039;s gonna be disappointed that you can 
“Sure.” 
&gt;He just looks at you and grins slightly 
&gt;You don’t think he expected you to say yes to it 
&gt;The rest of dinner goes well 
&gt;Everything he made is delicious 
&gt;He asks you some questions, trying to get to know you better 
&gt;Or waiting for you to slip up so he can call you out on it 
&gt;After dinner you help clean up 
&gt;”Jade why don’t you get your guitar so Anon can play for us.” 
&gt;Jade heads off upstairs to get her guitar, and is back surprisingly quickly 
&gt;Head to the living room to play 
&gt;She had it in Drop D 
&gt;The lazy power chord tuning 
&gt;Tune it up to standard 
&gt;Play a few songs you know 
&gt;One of the songs you play apparently gets to him 
&gt;Notice he&#039;s got a smile on his face and is actually crying 
&gt;Jade’s enamored with watching you so she doesn’t notice 
&gt;Best to pretend you don’t notice 
&gt;Nothing leads to an asswhoopin&#039; faster than callin&#039; out a man on crying 
&gt;Gonna do one more song 
&gt;Set the guitar down 
&gt;Don’t need it for this 
&gt;Stand up to sing 
&gt;Song’s more of a sea shanty, but whatever 
&gt;Barrett’s Privateers 
&gt;Jade joins in singing with you almost immediately 
&gt;She gets up and joins you, putting her arm around your waist behind your back 
&gt;Try to get him to join in too 
&gt;He&#039;s clapping in time, but has gone back on his stern facial expression 
&gt;Won&#039;t sing along either 
&gt;Doesn&#039;t kill the mood you and Jade have going 
&gt;He does smile slightly once the two of you finish the song 
&gt;He looks at you 
&gt;”Anon…I must say, you do know your music.  I see Jade wasn&#039;t making it up when she said you did.  You seem like an all right fella, so I don&#039;t have a problem with you dating my daughter.” 
&gt; Makes you feel like a teenager hearing someone&#039;s dad say that 
&gt;It&#039;s apparently something Jade&#039;s thrilled to hear though, as she gives you a hug 
&gt;A bear hug 
&gt;You see why they call it that 
&gt; Things are popping and cracking that you&#039;re pretty sure should never pop 
&gt;Can&#039;t breathe 
&gt; Once you start to squirm from lack of air she puts you back down 
&gt;”Did I hurt you?” 
“Eh you just cracked a few ribs; I’m sure I&#039;ll bounce right back.” 
&gt;She gives you a look 
“Yes I&#039;m fine.” 
&gt;Her dad lets out an audible laugh at that 
&gt;”I see you&#039;ve got a sense of humor too, good.” 
&gt;He puts up his recliner, grabs the remote and turns on the TV 
&gt;”Now if you&#039;ll excuse me, the Braves game is about to start.  So y&#039;all can either stay and watch or go.” 
&gt;Jade picks up her guitar 
&gt;”Let&#039;s go up to my room.” 
&gt;She&#039;s giving that seductive look again 
&gt;Her dad’s dead to everything that isn’t on the TV 
&gt;This should be fun
