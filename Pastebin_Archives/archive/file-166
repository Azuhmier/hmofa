            RAW Paste Data        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">WinterAnon here. It&#039;s been a long fucking while. Anyway, trying to get back into it with this. Forgive the inaccuracies as I have never actually been to war but I would love to incorporate any suggestions from military personal into this story. Feel free to point out what is wrong so that I can go over it in the final draft on PB.

Also, this features fairly dark themes such as child-soldiers, rape, murder, beheading, PTSD and racism. You have been warned.

Name: Fear.
Description: See the world though the eyes of a soldier during a tour in Afghanistan, circa 2014.



&gt;Fear.
&gt;It’s an interesting sensation.
&gt;A cold chill down the spine.
&gt;Hair standing on end.
&gt;A rock in the pit of your stomach.
&gt;You’ve felt this feeling more than you care to imagine.
&gt;When you got into your first fight.
&gt;When you crashed your car.
&gt;When your girl broke it off.
&gt;When you touched down in Afghanistan.
&gt;The first time you got hit with an IED.
&gt;It’s strange that there’s no fear now.
&gt;Not anymore.
&gt;You came here to do some good.
&gt;You signed up in the Canadian Armed Forces, did quite well in basic and was shipped out to the sandbox as a replacement.
&gt;Things were alright for a while.
&gt;Lines shifted, politics was spoken and rounds were fired but none of it made much difference.
&gt;The fighting seasons came and went.
&gt;Friends and comrades came and went.
&gt;You went out to win the “Hearts and Minds” of the locals.
&gt;Like that was going to work.
&gt;You’re lying on your back, looking up at the sky.
&gt;There are a few clouds in the ritch blue sky, drifting lazily by.
&gt;It’s rather nice, despite the incredibly bright sun.
&gt;Sadly the scene is ruined by a few wisps of inky black smoke rising into the air from the corner of your vision.
&gt;Confusion is your first emotion.
&gt;Who the hell is ruining your beautiful day?
&gt;You roll your head on the sandy ground and take a look.
&gt;Ten feet away, there’s an HMMWV, windows pasted with blood, missing the entire engine compartment.
&gt;It’s on fire.


&gt;You start piecing things together.
&gt;You start to remember.
&gt;You were up-top on the Browning.
&gt;You remember the dirt flying up in front of you.
&gt;You remember the heat and the deafening sound of an explosion.
&gt;You remember flying through the air.
&gt;You don’t want to remember.
&gt;The ringing in your ears, that you didn’t notice before, begins to subside.
&gt;You ears are immediately assaulted by the radio, static squealing punctured by sporadic voices yelling back and forth.
&gt;The roaring fire beside you adds a morbid backdrop, earrily close to hell, to the dusty landscape.
&gt;Gunfire tears through the air all around you, the smaller rounds cracking quickly with the larger weapons shaking your chest with deep booms.
&gt;The cracking of rounds coming in above and around where you’re laying.
&gt;Sensation returns to you all at once.
&gt;You reach down and grab the C7 on your sling, rolling over and aiming your rifle where everyone else was shooting.
&gt;Then you feel it, like an icy hand clutching your heart.
&gt;Fear…

&gt;You’re lying on a road in the middle of nowhere, just having hit a fucking bomb. To your right is the wall of a compound of a village that you went into yesterday.
&gt;Probably tipped the bombers off.
&gt;Across from the wall is a field with a few low walls cutting up the poppy fields.
&gt;A hundred, hundred and fifty, meters further was a treeline with bright flashes winking out of it.
&gt;Just to the left of that is another compound with a broken door and shot up walls.
&gt;Your training takes over.
&gt;You flick the safety off and hunker lower on your dirt mound.
&gt;You pop off a shot, barely feeling the kick of your weapon as you send a round at one of the winking lights, causing it to go silent.
&gt;You fire off another three round at another as a rocket comes out of the treeline, just over you and impacts the compound wall behind you, shattering it to dust and spraying you with debris.
&gt;You continue to fire, emptying your magazine.
&gt;Changing the mag, you finally take a look around.
&gt;You were the lead Vick in a convoy of three trucks and two gun-trucks with an LAV for support.
&gt;It wasn’t even anything worth much.
&gt;Three trucks of water.
&gt;Soldiers died for water.
&gt;How fucked is that?”
&gt;You return the bolt to the forward position and continue to shoot, now suppressing more than anything.

&gt;One more mag and the flashing has died completely, the enemy either running away or rotting in a gully.
&gt;You see someone running from the enemy position toward you holding something solid and green.
&gt;They look almost too small to be a soldier but they are a threat.
&gt;You line up and put three rounds into their chest, dropping them like a stone.
&gt;Your ears still ring.
&gt;Your heart pounds in your chest.
&gt;The thick reek of cordite and metal is dissipating quickly.
&gt;You take some deep breaths and steady your hands.
&gt;They won’t stop.
&gt;You feel faint.
&gt;There’s a pain in your side.
&gt;You can barely breathe now.
&gt;The cap is doing squad checks to see who’s still up.
&gt;You hear your name being called.
&gt;You roll onto your back, feeling the pain almost knock you out as it explodes down your spine.
&gt;You pull your hand up to the transmit button but you can’t seem to get it to work.
&gt;Your mouth is dry as the desert under you.
&gt;You click it on and try and talk.
&gt;All that comes out is a croak and a cough.
&gt;”Vick one? Anyone from Vick one, respond.”
&gt;Another voice joined. “The whole car’s burnt out. Both in the front seat are dead. Wait one.”
&gt;You hear boots hitting the half-paved road toward you.
&gt;The pain is getting worse as the adrenaline fades.
&gt;You see a soldier, dressed in the same uniform as you drop to their knees next to you and hit the call button on their rig.
&gt;It’s a girl.
&gt;”I found the gunner. He’s alive but he needs a medic now.”
&gt;It’s a girl.
&gt;Then she looks at you.
&gt;It’s not a human face.
&gt;It’s a dog’s.
