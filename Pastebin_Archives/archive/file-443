            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;end up with a raccoon owner after she caught me digging through her trash, how ironic, and she offered me some pizza</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;turns out she&#039;s a stoner </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;wears mainly hoodies and baggy sweat pants and the odd few longer skirts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s pretty chubby and she&#039;s got several inches of height on you, but her being a coon makes it look cute at least </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;been a couple months living with her now </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her simple apartment is pretty messy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re no neat freak but even this is too much for you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you at least clean up the place a bit when she&#039;s out or at work, don&#039;t want her to see you cleaning lest you end up has some maid or some shit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the fact she actually had a job shocked the shit out of you, figured she was a NEET</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;of course it was just some shitty/simple convenience store/gas station </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;doesn&#039;t help she wastes most of her money on weed, booze, and delivery food </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;d have her friends over often enough and they pretty much hotbox the apartment </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;they tried to get you high by blowing smoke your way but gave up once they saw you didn&#039;t react much or really got stoned </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;high school helped you learned you&#039;re pretty resistant to weed, or at least the generic/lower tier stuff</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it&#039;s worse when she drinks since she doesn&#039;t just causally drink she always goes full force and gets completely shit faced </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;ve lost count of how often you end up petting her back while she&#039;s hugging the toilet and puking pizza/Chinese/etc out </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;or putting a blanket on her where ever she passed out at</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;fuck, you sleep in her bed more than she does at this point </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she does get fairly affectionate at times </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s got this thing having you sit on the floor against the couch while she sits on the couch and pets/combs through your hair with her claws </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;wonder if this is some raccoon thing, the chirping/chitterings noises she makes are pretty cute anyways </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she tends to vent to you when it&#039;s just the two of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;and my god is it so stereotypical you&#039;d swear you were in some stoner comedy </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;how her life is shit because she&#039;s stuck in a shitty apartment, has a boring shitty job, her life is going nowhere, each weekend is the same of getting stoned/wasted, how she doesn&#039;t have a decent boyfriend, etc etc </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;most of the time you&#039;d spend with her holding you like a security blanket through the whole rants</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you do try your best to comfort her without giving away how much you really knew </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the worst though is when she gets stoned/drunk by herself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she was manageable when stoned by herself since she&#039;d just rather clingy and shower you with compliments that just mainly her shitting on herself </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;like how you were so good to put up with her, how you hadn&#039;t run away and abandoned her to find a better owner, how you were the only guy to actually keep her company, and more depressing shit like that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it&#039;s worse when she got drunk on her own </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you quickly found out she was a sad drunk and her own depression and self-loathing would sky rocket </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;d just bawl her eyes out while nursing whatever cheep booze she manged to buy that week</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you got pretty good at tricking her into drinking more water during those times by refilling empty cans with water and handing them to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;helped make the hangover the next day less harsh</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re surprised she never tried to have sex with you or god forbid see if you&#039;d fall for the peanut butter trick</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her friends trying to egg her own just so she&#039;d be less pent up weren&#039;t helping </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it&#039;s kind of cute how she&#039;d lock herself in her room and masturbate like she was ashamed you seeing her do that </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s a screamer too so you&#039;re pretty sure the whole apartment complex could her her every time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;and she&#039;d always have this guilty/embarrassed afterward while never looking you in the eye for the rest of the day </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;there were the odd times she&#039;d get a date</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;d get so excited and run around the apartment looking for her skirts and a less raggedy looking hoodie</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she actually take a shower more often and you&#039;d be there brushing her fur or what of it she&#039;d let you see</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;d go out on her date and return home late mostly drunk </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her boyfriends never last for long</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a couple days at most before she&#039;d return home one night crying because she got dumped again and you&#039;d have to listen to her crying about the reasons she was dumped</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the worse one was when some asshat opossum </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she came home early on one of her date nights sniffling </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you were getting ready for another long night of her crying episodes only to stop when you see she has a bloody nose and is using her sleeve to soak up the blood </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she looked pretty shaken and then a loud banging started at the door that caused her to jump and shake more </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the opossum was demanding to be let and trying to say he didn&#039;t mean to hit her that hard </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;that struck a nerve with you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the worse part is she actually got up to open door to talk to the asshole </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you were close by making sure nothing more happened </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;he was making it out like it was her fault he hit her and such </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you had the fight the urge to not grab one of the kitchen knives nearby </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;then he did something really stupid</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;he forced his way in and caused her to fall back </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you moved in front of her while glaring at the opossum </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;he had a good foot on you but he was just hungry skeleton has far as builds go</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;he moved to push you out of the way but he dropped has soon as you hit him in the face </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;real fucking glass jaw this pussy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;got a kick out of seeing he had his own bloody nose now </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;since he was just reeling on floor whimpering like a baby you had to drag him out of your apartment and off the to the curb</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;once you back to the apartment and closed the door she jumped you crying and rubbing her face against you desperately</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you both ended up

couple of days she&#039;d make sure you were always within sight of her and has soon as you sat down she&#039;d be holding you again and petting/rubbing against you </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she actually got ice cream for the booth of you </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;of course she made sure you walked with her to the store never letting your hand go the whole time </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;when you got back the two of you ended up sharing the tub of ice cream together</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you wonder when you got this protective of her </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she ended up getting food for you more regularly now too</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;d

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;funny enough they were bright pink and pretty much the only pink things she seemed to own</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;using them and doing simple

either </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you noticed you look like you dropped several pounds and your arms and legs had a little definition to them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;maybe you should try to find something else to do too before this gets out of hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;d come home sometimes when you were in middle of an exercise </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she didn&#039;t seem to give much a reaction so you didn&#039;t have to stop and figured what you were doing was common to see other humans in this world do too</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you always did it without a shirt on since you didn&#039;t want to go around smelling like sweat for a long time due to her not going to the local washers that often</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you did notice she&#039;d watch you more often when she came home to you doing that if a sort of guilty look on her face and sniff at the air occasionally</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;d take a shower afterwards and you also guess this wasn&#039;t too abnormal for the local

figured out she&#039;d go to the washers not long afterwards seeing you do that too</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;funny, it&#039;s like you&#039;re training her like a pet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;speaking of, her hoodies weren&#039;t bad but they too baggy on you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;though you would catch yourself

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she would buy you some new clothes every now and again too, with mixed results </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;sometimes they were little big or a

class="de1">&gt;not sure why she doesn&#039;t just take you with her when getting you clothes, but you are technically a stray she&#039;s letting live in her apartment</div></li><li class="li1"><div

angry/pouty </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;d take you out for walks sometimes, mostly just to convenience stores so you can help carry stuff, but she was ever given much

to be like that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;always made you get a small internal giggle out of that and her having to explain she didn&#039;t do anything </div></li><li

you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;like there was something missing from them that made you and them different</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you could always tell by just looking in their eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;though it was weird when you come across another human like you stuck in this world</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;d both do the same thing, look at each other and then to your &quot;owners&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;and then wonder what their lives are like</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This sucks so much right now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;My damned facial hair has grown in too much and I don&#039;t usually rock the full face of hair look, so I&#039;m in itchy hell.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;My hair has also grown out more too and it&#039;s not like I can just go buy a razor or go to a barber. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;My plight and state hasn&#039;t gone unnoticed either. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;My &quot;owner&quot; and her friend, fuck if I remember her name but you&#039;re sure she&#039;s a coyote, has I scratch my beard from time to time while talking.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You know, if this keeps up he&#039;s going to end up looking like some of your old boyfriends.&quot; Said the coyote.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh fuck you. But yeah, something needs to be done about that.&quot; Dannie said while reaching over to scratch my neck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh thank fuck for raccoon claws because this feels wonderful.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Couldn&#039;t help but lean into her more has she helped itch my face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So are you going to shave him yourself or take him into one of the pet groomers?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Wait, what do mean shave him myself?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well that made me pay a lot more attention to the conversation.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The thought of Dannie running a sharp blade across my neck is not a pleasant one and I can&#039;t do it myself because I&#039;m pretty sure that is too smart for the humans of this world.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You know, those razors you see in stores for pet grooming. Pretty sure you sell &#039;em at the little store you work at too.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Shit! You mean those blades on a stick? I don&#039;t know if I could do that without hurting him.&quot; Dannie said while looking down at me and holding my head closer to her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I heard it&#039;s not that hard has long as the human holds still. It&#039;s also cheaper than bringing him to a groomer especially if their face hair grows in fast.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I don&#039;t care how much extra it costs, pick the fucking groomer!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Unfortunately, that&#039;s rather hard to convey with just a look.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I I don&#039;t think it&#039;d be a good idea to do it myself. Do you know if a grooming shop is close by?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I know there&#039;s one not too far, but it&#039;s far enough you can&#039;t walk and you don&#039;t have a car.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh. Um, do you know how to shave a human then?&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh gee, like that&#039;s any better instead of you cutting my neck open.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Why would I know how to do that. You know I don&#039;t have a human. Look, how about I just drive you out there and you can owe me... a favor.&quot; The coyote bitch said while looking at me for that last bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The fuck does that mean?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And fuck off with that creepy look too!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pretty sure being molested isn&#039;t a good trade off for a fucking shave, you cunt.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not going to let you molest him.&quot; Dannie said quickly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Holy fuck you&#039;re a actually a good owner! </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This requires me to hug her, and hide a bit behind her, while rubbing my face against her side.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh come one! Quit being stingy with him. He&#039;s kind of short, but I&#039;ve seen him in those tight shirts you get him and I know he&#039;s got a decent body on his cute little ass.&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Did she really need to lick her lips after saying that? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I&#039;m going to need to remember to avoid her next time Dannie has a drunken get together with her girlfriends here. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fuck, it&#039;s not like I don&#039;t do that already with the gang of idiots that come over anyways.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t fuck him you perv!&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh wow, she managed to look a perfect mix of angry and embarrassed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Also didn&#039;t know raccoons could poof up like cats can, cute.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Really? You still haven&#039;t used him to have a good time. With you&#039;re luck with boyfriends I figured you&#039;d have fuck the little guy into a coma by now. Fine then! Next time you score some green you have to invite just me so I can smoke most of it with you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yeah, yeah I can do that Rebeca.&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh goody, a stoned and horny coyote will try to rape you later.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Also, that&#039;s what her fucking name was. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Probably going to forget it again later anyways.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Great! How about we go tomorrow? We&#039;re both off and I need to buy some stuff from the other shops around there too.&quot; She said while getting up and grabbing her stuff.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;See ya Dannie. And see you too cutie.&quot; Rebeca said while doing that dumb little finger wiggle thing when she was saying bye to me. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eugh, I&#039;m going to have nightmares now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;God, Beca is such a creepy slut at times. But she can&#039;t have you.&quot; She said while pulling on top of her while she lays down. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then I feel her wrap her arms, legs and tail around in a full body hug.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oooooh fuck, being stuck in this world may just be worth it for feeling this comfy. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Can&#039;t help but melt and relax into this embrace. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now if only she&#039;d... mmn there it is.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her petting/stroking my head and hair while cuddling me like this. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why does this feel so good and make feel guilty at the same time?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She moved her face down to rub her muzzle against the side of my face, but only did it once before pulling back and making a face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;The sooner you get shaved the better. That really doesn&#039;t feel has nice to do has it does when your face is all smooth.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Couldn&#039;t help but give an annoyed sound at that and just lay on her some more.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;We stayed like that for a little longer before she got me to get up so we could go to sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, downside is creepy coyote lady shows up again tomorrow, but on the upside I&#039;m getting a shave.</div></li></ol>        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;end up with a raccoon owner after she caught me digging through her trash, how ironic, and she offered me some pizza
&gt;turns out she&#039;s a stoner 
&gt;wears mainly hoodies and baggy sweat pants and the odd few longer skirts
&gt;she&#039;s pretty chubby and she&#039;s got several inches of height on you, but her being a coon makes it look cute at least 
&gt;been a couple months living with her now 
&gt;her simple apartment is pretty messy
&gt;you&#039;re no neat freak but even this is too much for you
&gt;you at least clean up the place a bit when she&#039;s out or at work, don&#039;t want her to see you cleaning lest you end up has some maid or some shit
&gt;the fact she actually had a job shocked the shit out of you, figured she was a NEET
&gt;of course it was just some shitty/simple convenience store/gas station 
&gt;doesn&#039;t help she wastes most of her money on weed, booze, and delivery food 
&gt;she&#039;d have her friends over often enough and they pretty much hotbox the apartment 
&gt;they tried to get you high by blowing smoke your way but gave up once they saw you didn&#039;t react much or really got stoned 
&gt;high school helped you learned you&#039;re pretty resistant to weed, or at least the generic/lower tier stuff
&gt;it&#039;s worse when she drinks since she doesn&#039;t just causally drink she always goes full force and gets completely shit faced 
&gt;you&#039;ve lost count of how often you end up petting her back while she&#039;s hugging the toilet and puking pizza/Chinese/etc out 
&gt;or putting a blanket on her where ever she passed out at
&gt;fuck, you sleep in her bed more than she does at this point 
&gt;she does get fairly affectionate at times 
&gt;she&#039;s got this thing having you sit on the floor against the couch while she sits on the couch and pets/combs through your hair with her claws 
&gt;wonder if this is some raccoon thing, the chirping/chitterings noises she makes are pretty cute anyways 
&gt;she tends to vent to you when it&#039;s just the two of you
&gt;and my god is it so stereotypical you&#039;d swear you were in some stoner comedy 
&gt;how her life is shit because she&#039;s stuck in a shitty apartment, has a boring shitty job, her life is going nowhere, each weekend is the same of getting stoned/wasted, how she doesn&#039;t have a decent boyfriend, etc etc 
&gt;most of the time you&#039;d spend with her holding you like a security blanket through the whole rants
&gt;you do try your best to comfort her without giving away how much you really knew 
&gt;the worst though is when she gets stoned/drunk by herself
&gt;she was manageable when stoned by herself since she&#039;d just rather clingy and shower you with compliments that just mainly her shitting on herself 
&gt;like how you were so good to put up with her, how you hadn&#039;t run away and abandoned her to find a better owner, how you were the only guy to actually keep her company, and more depressing shit like that
&gt;it&#039;s worse when she got drunk on her own 
&gt;you quickly found out she was a sad drunk and her own depression and self-loathing would sky rocket 
&gt;she&#039;d just bawl her eyes out while nursing whatever cheep booze she manged to buy that week
&gt;you got pretty good at tricking her into drinking more water during those times by refilling empty cans with water and handing them to her
&gt;helped make the hangover the next day less harsh
&gt;you&#039;re surprised she never tried to have sex with you or god forbid see if you&#039;d fall for the peanut butter trick
&gt;her friends trying to egg her own just so she&#039;d be less pent up weren&#039;t helping 
&gt;it&#039;s kind of cute how she&#039;d lock herself in her room and masturbate like she was ashamed you seeing her do that 
&gt;she&#039;s a screamer too so you&#039;re pretty sure the whole apartment complex could her her every time
&gt;and she&#039;d always have this guilty/embarrassed afterward while never looking you in the eye for the rest of the day 
&gt;there were the odd times she&#039;d get a date
&gt;she&#039;d get so excited and run around the apartment looking for her skirts and a less raggedy looking hoodie
&gt;she actually take a shower more often and you&#039;d be there brushing her fur or what of it she&#039;d let you see
&gt;she&#039;d go out on her date and return home late mostly drunk 
&gt;her boyfriends never last for long
&gt;a couple days at most before she&#039;d return home one night crying because she got dumped again and you&#039;d have to listen to her crying about the reasons she was dumped
&gt;the worse one was when some asshat opossum 
&gt;she came home early on one of her date nights sniffling 
&gt;you were getting ready for another long night of her crying episodes only to stop when you see she has a bloody nose and is using her sleeve to soak up the blood 
&gt;she looked pretty shaken and then a loud banging started at the door that caused her to jump and shake more 
&gt;the opossum was demanding to be let and trying to say he didn&#039;t mean to hit her that hard 
&gt;that struck a nerve with you
&gt;the worse part is she actually got up to open door to talk to the asshole 
&gt;you were close by making sure nothing more happened 
&gt;he was making it out like it was her fault he hit her and such 
&gt;you had the fight the urge to not grab one of the kitchen knives nearby 
&gt;then he did something really stupid
&gt;he forced his way in and caused her to fall back 
&gt;you moved in front of her while glaring at the opossum 
&gt;he had a good foot on you but he was just hungry skeleton has far as builds go
&gt;he moved to push you out of the way but he dropped has soon as you hit him in the face 
&gt;real fucking glass jaw this pussy
&gt;got a kick out of seeing he had his own bloody nose now 
&gt;since he was just reeling on floor whimpering like a baby you had to drag him out of your apartment and off the to the curb
&gt;once you back to the apartment and closed the door she jumped you crying and rubbing her face against you desperately
&gt;you both ended up in her bed this time 
&gt;the whole night she clung to you like you&#039;d float away if she let go
&gt;the next couple of days she&#039;d make sure you were always within sight of her and has soon as you sat down she&#039;d be holding you again and petting/rubbing against you 
&gt;she actually got ice cream for the booth of you 
&gt;of course she made sure you walked with her to the store never letting your hand go the whole time 
&gt;when you got back the two of you ended up sharing the tub of ice cream together
&gt;you wonder when you got this protective of her 
&gt;she ended up getting food for you more regularly now too
&gt;she&#039;d just let you eat the leftovers of take out most of the time before
&gt;you tried to do stuff when she was not around to keep yourself busy and not just eat out of boredom
&gt;partially cleaning only got so far, but you did manage to find some small weights under a pile clothes one time
&gt;funny enough they were bright pink and pretty much the only pink things she seemed to own
&gt;using them and doing simple exercises like push-ups, crunches, squats, etc gave you something to do
&gt;you were never a fatass, but at the same time you weren&#039;t really in shape either 
&gt;you noticed you look like you dropped several pounds and your arms and legs had a little definition to them
&gt;maybe you should try to find something else to do too before this gets out of hand
&gt;she&#039;d come home sometimes when you were in middle of an exercise 
&gt;she didn&#039;t seem to give much a reaction so you didn&#039;t have to stop and figured what you were doing was common to see other humans in this world do too
&gt;you always did it without a shirt on since you didn&#039;t want to go around smelling like sweat for a long time due to her not going to the local washers that often

&gt;you walk around the apartment afterwards with no shirt looking for a decently clean hoodie of hers to wear
&gt;picking them up and checking for stains and sniffing them caused her get nervous and you also figured out she&#039;d go to the washers not long afterwards seeing you do that too
&gt;funny, it&#039;s like you&#039;re training her like a pet
&gt;speaking of, her hoodies weren&#039;t bad but they too baggy on you
&gt;though you would catch yourself sniffing the one you were wearing from time to time because it had her scent on it
&gt;god did you feel like a pervert when you did that shit
&gt;she would buy you some new clothes every now and again too, with mixed results 
&gt;sometimes they were little big or a little small on you
&gt;you wonder if she was getting human pet clothes or just buying from a regular store 
&gt;not sure why she doesn&#039;t just take you with her when getting you clothes, but you are technically a stray she&#039;s letting live in her apartment
&gt;she never got you a collar and you briefly wonder if this is one of those no pets allowed apartments too
&gt;probably costs a lot to get registered and all shit you had to do back in your world when buying/owning a pet
&gt;oh well, at least you got some good laughs in when she mistakenly tries to put on one the hoodies she got for you and can&#039;t because of the smaller size
&gt;she&#039;d get so embarrassed and this cute type of angry/pouty

&gt;you&#039;d both do the same thing, look at each other and then to your &quot;owners&quot;
&gt;and then wonder what their lives are like

&gt;This sucks so much right now.
&gt;My damned facial hair has grown in too much and I don&#039;t usually rock the full face of hair look, so I&#039;m in itchy hell.
&gt;My hair has also grown out more too and it&#039;s not like I can just go buy a razor or go to a barber. 
&gt;My plight and state hasn&#039;t gone unnoticed either. 
&gt;My &quot;owner&quot; and her friend, fuck if I remember her name but you&#039;re sure she&#039;s a coyote, has I scratch my beard from time to time while talking.
&gt;&quot;You know, if this keeps up he&#039;s going to end up looking like some of your old boyfriends.&quot; Said the coyote.
&gt;&quot;Oh fuck you. But yeah, something needs to be done about that.&quot; Dannie said while reaching over to scratch my neck.
&gt;Oh thank fuck for raccoon claws because this feels wonderful.
&gt;Couldn&#039;t help but lean into her more has she helped itch my face.
&gt;&quot;So are you going to shave him yourself or take him into one of the pet groomers?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Wait, what do mean shave him myself?&quot;
&gt;Well that made me pay a lot more attention to the conversation.
&gt;The thought of Dannie running a sharp blade across my neck is not a pleasant one and I can&#039;t do it myself because I&#039;m pretty sure that is too smart for the humans of this world.
&gt;&quot;You know, those razors you see in stores for pet grooming. Pretty sure you sell &#039;em at the little store you work at too.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Shit! You mean those blades on a stick? I don&#039;t know if I could do that without hurting him.&quot; Dannie said while looking down at me and holding my head closer to her.
&gt;&quot;I heard it&#039;s not that hard has long as the human holds still. It&#039;s also cheaper than bringing him to a groomer especially if their face hair grows in fast.&quot;
&gt;I don&#039;t care how much extra it costs, pick the fucking groomer!
&gt;Unfortunately, that&#039;s rather hard to convey with just a look.
&gt;&quot;I I don&#039;t think it&#039;d be a good idea to do it myself. Do you know if a grooming shop is close by?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I know there&#039;s one not too far, but it&#039;s far enough you can&#039;t walk and you don&#039;t have a car.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh. Um, do you know how to shave a human then?&quot; 
&gt;Oh gee, like that&#039;s any better instead of you cutting my neck open.
&gt;&quot;Why would I know how to do that. You know I don&#039;t have a human. Look, how about I just drive you out there and you can owe me... a favor.&quot; The coyote bitch said while looking at me for that last bit.
&gt;The fuck does that mean?
&gt;And fuck off with that creepy look too!
&gt;Pretty sure being molested isn&#039;t a good trade off for a fucking shave, you cunt.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not going to let you molest him.&quot; Dannie said quickly.
&gt;Holy fuck you&#039;re a actually a good owner! 
&gt;This requires me to hug her, and hide a bit behind her, while rubbing my face against her side.
&gt;&quot;Oh come one! Quit being stingy with him. He&#039;s kind of short, but I&#039;ve seen him in those tight shirts you get him and I know he&#039;s got a decent body on his cute little ass.&quot; 
&gt;Did she really need to lick her lips after saying that? 
&gt;I&#039;m going to need to remember to avoid her next time Dannie has a drunken get together with her girlfriends here. 
&gt;Fuck, it&#039;s not like I don&#039;t do that already with the gang of idiots that come over anyways.
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t fuck him you perv!&quot; 
&gt;Oh wow, she managed to look a perfect mix of angry and embarrassed.
&gt;Also didn&#039;t know raccoons could poof up like cats can, cute.
&gt;&quot;Really? You still haven&#039;t used him to have a good time. With you&#039;re luck with boyfriends I figured you&#039;d have fuck the little guy into a coma by now. Fine then! Next time you score some green you have to invite just me so I can smoke most of it with you.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah, yeah I can do that Rebeca.&quot; 
&gt;Oh goody, a stoned and horny coyote will try to rape you later.
&gt;Also, that&#039;s what her fucking name was. 
&gt;Probably going to forget it again later anyways.
&gt;&quot;Great! How about we go tomorrow? We&#039;re both off and I need to buy some stuff from the other shops around there too.&quot; She said while getting up and grabbing her stuff.
&gt;&quot;See ya Dannie. And see you too cutie.&quot; Rebeca said while doing that dumb little finger wiggle thing when she was saying bye to me. 
&gt;Eugh, I&#039;m going to have nightmares now. 
&gt;&quot;God, Beca is such a creepy slut at times. But she can&#039;t have you.&quot; She said while pulling on top of her while she lays down. 
&gt;Then I feel her wrap her arms, legs and tail around in a full body hug.
&gt;Oooooh fuck, being stuck in this world may just be worth it for feeling this comfy. 
&gt;Can&#039;t help but melt and relax into this embrace. 
&gt;Now if only she&#039;d... mmn there it is.
&gt;Her petting/stroking my head and hair while cuddling me like this. 
&gt;Why does this feel so good and make feel guilty at the same time?
&gt;She moved her face down to rub her muzzle against the side of my face, but only did it once before pulling back and making a face.
&gt;&quot;The sooner you get shaved the better. That really doesn&#039;t feel has nice to do has it does when your face is all smooth.&quot;
&gt;Couldn&#039;t help but give an annoyed sound at that and just lay on her some more.
&gt;We stayed like that for a little longer before she got me to get up so we could go to sleep.
&gt;Well, downside is creepy coyote lady shows up again tomorrow, but on the upside I&#039;m getting a shave.</textarea>
