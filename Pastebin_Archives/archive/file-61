        <textarea class="textarea">Part I: Clara and MilAnon

&gt;The day has come for your long planned summer BBQ
&gt;You&#039;ve invited a few people over to your house and everything was ready
&gt;Beers, various hard liquors, burgers and steaks, and even oysters to boot to throw on the grill
&gt;A small assortment of soda as well for the kids who didn&#039;t want big boy drinks
&gt;You were expecting Mous and his wife Jasmine at any moment
&gt;Emi might show up a bit late and you weren&#039;t too sure about the &#039;Mechanic&#039; and his lovely wife Lilith
&gt;Clara, your amazing snow leopard wife, was sitting on the couch playing video games while you sat with your cub Lucatiel, relentlessly tickling her little paws and making faces at her
&gt;Eventually you hear a slight knock at the door
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s open!&quot; you call out
&gt;Emi, a tigress of normal stature has her head through the door and upon seeing you, smiles and steps inside
&gt;&quot;Hey Anon! Hi Clara! Am I the first one here?&quot; she asks looking around the room
&gt;You nod as Lucatiel cooes
&gt;She finally spots the ball of fur in your lap, and you&#039;re almost terrified for her safety as the much larger one is immediately by your side
&gt;&quot;Aww can I hold her for a bit? I love this little cub!&quot; she&#039;s a little too excited about it
&gt;Still, you smile and carry Lucatiel over to her, and the moment she&#039;s in her arms a wide motherly grin comes forth
&gt;Your girl could be used as a hospital grade sedative from the way Emi was careful holding her
&gt;These big cats and their motherly instincts helped quite a lot, too
&gt;Sitting back down on the couch you looped an arm around Clara who is staring at a menu in Destiny 2
&gt;&quot;I want to make one of these Hunter capes for Halloween, babe,&quot; she said admiring her character
&gt;&quot;Can&#039;t wait to see it,&quot; you say through a laugh as she&#039;s now fighting off giant 4 armed aliens who rudely interrupted her
&gt;She&#039;s still active as ever when playing games, bouncing around joyfully while she got her revenge
&gt;It wasn&#039;t long before the(and you never really did ask for his name) Mechanic and Lilith arrived
&gt;The man wore casual with the short raccoon matching, and both of them holding a tray of sorts
&gt;They gave a couple of &quot;Hey!&quot;s when they joined in the party
&gt;You had to save Clara from a gigantic spherical robot that she happened to forget as she ran towards Lilith
&gt;The sound of wrenching metal and the sight of sic dance moves drowned out their talk about woman stuff
&gt;The Mechanic is leaning over the couch with a tray in hand
&gt;&quot;Beers are in the fridge,&quot; is all you say to him
&gt;&quot;Cool, I brought ribs,&quot; he replied in his gruff voice
&gt;&quot;You invite Chickenman?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yessir, both Mous and Jasmine,&quot; you gave with a nod
&gt;&quot;Cool, owe him a bottle of whiskey and I brought it just in case&quot;
&gt;You laugh and keep playing while he heads to the kitchen
&gt;Beer in hand and opened with that tray still in his hand, he&#039;s over by your sliding glass door
&gt;&quot;Mind if I start cooking the ribs? Lilith likes them a certain way&quot;
&gt;&quot;You do you man&quot;
&gt;He&#039;s out the door lighting the grill with the trio of women all fawning over Lucatiel
&gt;She seemed to be loving it from the giggling she made
&gt;The sound of a car with terrible gas mileage but a lot of give told you the Chickenman and crew were finally here
&gt;&quot;Hey guys,&quot; you call out to them while you stood from the couch
&gt;Another man and his generously sized tiger wife were stepping through the door
&gt;You paused mid stride at the third coming in
&gt;...Though this being your party and feeling incredibly resilient to Italian disasters, you still made the effort to shake his hand
&gt;&quot;Hey man, beers in the fridge, the Mechanic is out back starting some ribs, and he brought you a whiskey or something&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nice. By the way this is Bingle,&quot; he gestured to the Anthro standing behind him, &quot;his mom asked me to bring him along,&quot; he finished with a potentially strained grin on his face
&gt;You took a look behind him
&gt;Bingle was attempting to straighten his hair while texting on an expensive new phone model
&gt;Noticing you, he gave a wave with a paw that held it, and on the screen was that exact same pose with multiple filters layered on it
&gt;Oh, he&#039;s going to be a fun one then
&gt;Still, you haven&#039;t actually talked to the guy yet
&gt;When everyone else had settled on in, the third wheel stepped in after
&gt;You weren&#039;t really sure if he was a fox or a wolf, and his all jet black fur and unusually brilliant blue eyes further confused your limited knowledge of canines
&gt;When he made his way to the kitchen your attention went back to Mous
&gt;You assumed Jasmine joined in on Lucatiel&#039;s mobbing from the sounds of more giggling behind you
&gt;&quot;I see you still have that rust bucket El Camino, you should get a Pontiac&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nothing beats it man - besides, if I wanted a Firebird ripoff I&#039;d get a Camero&quot;
&gt;So far so good; this was going to be a good night
 
 
&gt;The night had settled, and after everyone had a few drinks the lot of you were currently lazing about and played Cards Against Humanity
&gt;People were starting to get a little tired into the game, and even more so when Lucatiel finally managed to conk out
&gt;The sleeping arrangements were already planned and ready, thankfully
&gt;You had Mous and Jasmine set up in the Guest room
&gt;The Mechanic and Lilith got the just as comfortable spare bed in your game room
&gt;Emi not so surprisingly suggested your&#039;s and Clara&#039;s room
&gt;And Bingle got the couch
&gt;At least attempt to have anyways, you weren&#039;t too sure if your cat would like to give up her bed to a stranger
&gt;Not that you would mind if he couldn&#039;t, as Mr. Peppercorn Starshake here was sitting there spewing verbal diarrhea to you in an ill advised attempt at impressing you
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s what they call me! Seriously! But even then, I get to bed all those Anthros you&#039;ve ever beaten off to&quot;
&gt;You can see the Mechanic slowly getting pissed as Bingle kept talking and wouldn&#039;t pick a goddamn card
&gt;You know he&#039;s always been a bit quick to anger, but talk of his casual adventures through STI land were starting to grate on you too
&gt;He was the one who had the most drinks in the group, with you being a respectable third
&gt;You weren&#039;t entirely sure who got second but frankly that wasn&#039;t important right now; not when his current boasting of personal greatness always lead to an eye or two staying a little bit longer on Clara and Emi
&gt;A bit of relief to the sewage came from you hearing Lucatiel cry in the other room
&gt;Clara began to make a move to get up, but you waved her down and stood up instead
&gt;You needed to get away from that fox (which Mous had corrected you on,) and calm down
&gt;Lucatiel calmed down a bit when she saw you, and cradled in your slowly rocking arms your cooing got her even more so
&gt;You thought you accomplished all those things, anyways as her crying little eyes clenched down even more
&gt;She must of been hungry
&gt;Still cradling and rocking her in your arms, you carried her back to the living room
&gt;You got Clara&#039;s attention when she heard her
&gt;&quot;She must be hungry and wants her mama,&quot; you confirmed
&gt;Soon the gentle rocking of your arms was replaced by the thicker, furrier ones of Clara
&gt;She moved from her seat and sat on the couch
&gt;&quot;None of you mind if I breastfeed her here, right?&quot;
&gt;A choir of no&#039;s, in various levels of drunkenness, answered back
&gt;You were already on your way to grab a blanket to cover them just for the sake of decency
&gt;When you came back however Bingle had moved next to Clara
&gt;A little close, much to your displeasure
&gt;&quot;Lactating huh? I&#039;ve done a few shoots with ladies who did - some of the milk was bitter, but I bet yours is reaaalllly sweet&quot;
&gt;youfuckinserious
&gt;You cleared your throat
&gt;&quot;Watch it little fox,&quot; you growled out
&gt;&quot;Hey I&#039;m allowed to talk to this fine lady about her breast milk!&quot; he protested back looking at you
&gt;Now, you can respect the effects of alcohol
&gt;It didn&#039;t save him from your perfected military scowl, sharpened from years of service that could wilt even the highest generals before it
&gt;You had it set to eleven as you stared the little fox down
&gt;Like the glass flower he is, he shattered under it
&gt;He still had the ability to slink back off to the seats with the silence of everyone else crushing him even more
&gt;You gave Clara the blanket and gave her a quick kiss
&gt;She clutched it a little tighter around her self when you left
&gt;You all sit back down and continued playing the card game while Clara fed your cub
&gt;It was going well until Lucatiel fussed a bit sending the blanket tumbling down
&gt;For a moment Clara&#039;s exposed breast could be seen before she was able to grab the blanket and cover herself again
&gt;This, apparently, meant Bingle had to talk again
&gt;&quot;i woundt mind tryng some of yur milk if you dont mind,&quot; he couldn&#039;t hold his liquor either
&gt;He took another shot from whatever source he had beside him
&gt;&quot;now i would of course,&quot; he hiccuped
&gt;Don&#039;t you fucking say what you think he&#039;s going to say
&gt;&quot;now i- &quot;
&gt;You really wanna pull this bonny boy?
&gt;&quot;i would of course prefer it from the source&quot;
&gt;Yeah, OK.
&gt;Your hands slammed down on the table as you and the Mechanic stood up
&gt;Lilith had his arms in hers, but no one dared to stop yours
&gt;&quot;Time for you to go little fox&quot;
&gt;You had him by his collar and lift him with ease
&gt;&quot;ha! what&#039;re you gonna do beat me up? Chick has my back!&quot;
&gt;You looked at Mous
&gt;You knew you could probably take him in a fight, but neither of you would come out unscathed and you didn&#039;t want to burn that bridge
&gt;He looked back at you, and then towards Bingle
&gt;He picked up a shot of whiskey that the Mechanic had given him, and with pinkey outstretched as he continued to stare
&gt;*Siiiiip*
&gt;The smug grin from Bingle&#039;s face disappeared real quick like
&gt;&quot;Now Anon I was just kidding about the-&quot;
&gt;So that&#039;s what they sound like
&gt;You thought this and more while the kit limply lied there and bleeding on your floor
&gt;All it took was a single punch apparently
&gt;And, oh, you don&#039;t remember muzzles looking like that - especially when the lions felt it too
&gt;You grace his fur with the dirt on your lawn, and the side of his face was spectacularly caked when he looked back at you
&gt;He coughs out a fang or two and raised a paw
&gt;&quot;Call a cab,&quot; you say, and you shut the door

PartII: Mechanic and Lilith
&gt;Chickenman owed you big for this favor
&gt;You made sure he knew it the second he asked you
&gt;He wanted you to help fix that wretched fox&#039;s car
&gt;Not Granny Cass, oh no, she was positively delightful
&gt;No, It was for her shiteating son Bingle
&gt;You couldn&#039;t stand him personally
&gt;Men( Anthro or otherwise ) that constantly talk themselves up annoyed you to no end
&gt;The only reason why you were doing this is that a favor in return was no small thing to sneeze at
&gt;The Chickenman had done pretty well for himself, and you were willing to bite the pavement just this once for a little something good in return
&gt;It&#039;s why you&#039;re on your creeper underneath his POS Lotus Esprit x180
&gt;&#039;A rigid car for a rigid star, if you know what I mean,&#039; he told you
&gt;Damn thing looked like yellow depressed spatula
&gt;&quot;He needs a new Alternator belt, new spark plugs...&quot; you grumbled to himself
&gt;It was obvious that he drove it into the ground
&gt;You didn&#039;t even feel like telling him the engine he&#039;s killing wasn&#039;t even stock
&gt;You doubt he&#039;d even know what you meant
&gt;Its oil was black as tar, the transmission fluid a solid brown instead of bright red, and no coolant was left in the radiator
&gt;You were honestly surprised it even made it here
&gt;With this kind of model, how in the hell did he manage to keep it on
&gt;...
&gt;&quot;Yeah the whole thing keeps overheating and I dunno why,&quot; you heard him call out to you
&gt;He was in your garage
&gt;Again
&gt;&quot;GET OUT OF THE GARAGE AND SIT IN THE OFFICE&quot; you yelled at the scampering black furred legs
&gt;He kept wandering out of your office&#039;s comfortable seats to play around with your tools
&gt;As much as you wished he would accidentally set himself on fire with your welder, you didn&#039;t want to need a new one
&gt;As you continued to work you heard a familiar car pull in
&gt;Lilith must be home from class
&gt;You rolled your creeper out from under the car and stood up
&gt;Lilith, mindful of your stains, gave you as best a hug as she could while you stole a quick kiss from her
&gt;&quot;Hey Lil how was class?&quot;
&gt;&quot;It was ok. A little dull, but I passed my test though!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Good job babe!&quot;
&gt;A high five and a smile later and you excused your self back under the car
&gt;Your smile drooped with the knowledge of who owned this corpse
&gt;&#039;The sooner I get this done, the faster I can get rid of him,&#039; was your personal mantra mid oil change
&gt;&quot;Hey Anon, who&#039;s car is that? Aren&#039;t you usually closed today?&quot; asked a standing Lilith somewhere to your right
&gt;You pointed to the office window from under the car
&gt;You saw her feet raise up on her toes for a few seconds before slowly coming back down
&gt;&quot;Oh... him,&quot; was all she said
&gt;A perfectly understandable response
&gt;The sound of a door opening and closing led to another, black furred pair of legs
&gt;God dammit
&gt;&quot;Well hello there sweet thing~ What are you doing in a dirty place like this?&quot; came a sickening voice
&gt;Your garage is not dirty
&gt;Still you ignored the fox to the best of your ability
&gt;You knew Lilith could handle herself
&gt;Lilith&#039;s legs moved back
&gt;&quot;Uhm, I live here with my Husband you know that!&quot; came her loud reply
&gt;&quot;Also, get out of the garage!&quot;
&gt;His footpaws started to creep forward toward Lilith
&gt;&quot;Well of course!&quot; he began, standing infront of her, &quot;but this is no place for a refined lady like yourself...&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t know what he was doing up there, but a tentative Lilith&#039;s leg stepping back told you enough
&gt;&quot;Why don&#039;t we take your car and get dinner? Let hubby here fix my car&quot;
&gt;&quot;Bingle I swear to god if you touch me I&#039;ll hit you with a goddamn wrench,&quot; her legs stood firm
&gt;You grabbed your own wrench
&gt;Just to be sure
&gt;His footpaws were right next to Lilith&#039;s now
&gt;&quot;Hey hey I was just trying to-&quot;
WONK
&gt;The sound of metal hitting bone echoed through your garage
&gt;You saw Bingle&#039;s footpaws take a few unsteady steps back, and soon enough the rest of him fell onto the cement floor with a soft thud
&gt;You slide out from under the car to the sight of Lilith holding a monkey wrench in her paws
&gt;&quot;I warned him!&quot;
&gt;You chuckle
&gt;&quot;You did&quot;
&gt;You propped his unconscious body onto a stained oily chair, making extra sure you supported his weight with your own just as wet clothes
&gt;You made your way back to a slightly more relaxed Lilith, a pat on her head with an ungloved hand finally gets her to head into the house
&gt;Sliding back under the car you can still see him sitting there
&gt;At least now you can work in peace


PartIII : The Survivor and Zahrah
&gt;You are a survivor
&gt;And possibly, the only human left
&gt;Years ago you stumbled upon some unintended company in the form of a short, bitey Wolverine named Zahrah
&gt;The biting part coming from when you had to untangle her from your trap
&gt;Soon after life had gotten great for you and your then new loving mate
&gt;You are a survivor only in name with how the two of you thrive in your forest home
&gt;It was today however, that put a threat to your peaceful lifestyle
&gt;You are in desperate need of supplies today, and ones that you couldn&#039;t normally find
&gt;Your cabin had power, running water, and a nice water heater to boot
&gt;But Zahrah wanted some cheeses
&gt;Even though you learned plenty during your time in the wastelands you never learned to make cheese
&gt;Not from a lack of trying though, it&#039;s just that it would be extremely uncomfortable to start learning
&gt;So you&#039;re currently doing the next best thing: riding out to the nearest colony with Zahrah giddily bouncing on your lap on your mad quest to find a newer, friendlier, talking source
&gt;Bonus points if they had power to store the cheeses
&gt;Your usual place just so happens to check all the boxes, and soon you pulled into town
&gt;The two of you get a lot of &quot;Hi Anon, hi Zahrah&quot; greetings since you both worked as constant and reliable traders
&gt;It also helped that you stuck out like a sore thumb in a world full of talking animal people
&gt;You ride through the colony for a little while before parking in front of a small shop
&gt;A sign above the door had the words &quot;MILK and CHEESE&quot; highlighted by mismatched glowing letters
&gt;Shutting off the ATV you and Zahrah head in
&gt;A small bell dings somewhere in the back and a large Anthro cow appears from a door behind the counter
&gt;&quot;How can - oh, hi Anon, hi Zahrah! Here for the usual?&quot;
&gt;You smile at her and gesture to Zahrah
&gt;&quot;Her choice, I&#039;ll eat anything cheese related&quot;
&gt;Zahrah stood at the counter and bounced on her paws trying to look over it
&gt;After a couple failed attempts and a small twist with a pout, she threw her arms into the air
&gt;&quot;Anon lift me! I can&#039;t see what Molly has!&quot;
&gt;You obliged, and reached down and set her on your shoulders
&gt;&quot;Oooh she has the cheddar! And Gouda! Anon I want them all!&quot;
&gt;With her thighs around your head, you&#039;re loving her extra bouncy behavior today
&gt;&quot;Get a little of each then babe,&quot; you gave with a little smirk
&gt;You can almost hear Molly&#039;s wistfulness as you bicker with your love
&gt;Thankfully she is also a very patient woman when it comes to Zahrah constantly switching between choices
&gt;In the end Zahrah picked 3 pounds of cheddar and 2 pounds of provolone
&gt;&quot;You sure that&#039;s all you want?&quot; you say as you pay the cow
&gt;&quot;MHM!&quot; she ignores your sarcasm with arms full of cheese
&gt;She&#039;s still happily chatting away with Molly when you took the cheese from her to store it in a cooler
&gt;When she walks out you hear a whistle
&gt;&quot;Whew! Check out that portable blowjob machine!&quot;
&gt;You look up from your quad to see a pitch black fox in mismatching black scrap metal studded leathers
&gt;He&#039;s strolling towards you and Zahrah with his bright blue eyes hungrily looking at her
&gt;Anyone could of mistaken him for a wolf from his size, but you had been around Anthros long enough to tell the difference
&gt;Zahrah is frowning at him, and you&#039;re just confused
&gt;&quot;Excuse me?&quot; you both say
&gt;She had learned a bit of patience since you both became life-mates, but even that had limits
&gt;The fox just kept walking forwards to her, ignoring you completely
&gt;When he&#039;s finally close, he drapes an arm over your shoulder with his eyes locked on Zahrah
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re just the right height for us to have a LOT of fun&quot;
&gt;She frowns harder while looking over her glasses at him
&gt;A flash of light sparking across her lenses got his arm to tense up
&gt;&quot;You realize I&#039;m here with my mate, right?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Eh?&quot;
&gt;You can&#039;t honestly tell if he&#039;s blind or just dumb as shit from his now genuine look of surprise when he turned to look at you
&gt;He got off of you real quick and brushed off the &#039;dirt&#039; when he recovered
&gt;&quot;Another anthro with a human huh?&quot; he says under his breath
&gt;More humans?!
&gt;&quot;Your mate can come too, but he has to watch,&quot; the fox said in earnest
&gt;&quot;Did you seriously not hea-&quot; he wasn&#039;t paying attention to you anymore
&gt;He clapped his paws together and leaned down over Zahrah
&gt;&quot;Can I ask you a question?&quot; he started to pull out a wallet, &quot;do you have to kneel to give him a blowjob, or can you stand normally&quot;
&gt;Zahrah&#039;s fur is puffed in anger
&gt;&quot;Can I axe you a question too?&quot; she started to walk next to the ATV
&gt;&quot;You mean ask?&quot; he says back
&gt;&quot;Nope&quot;
&gt;Zahrah pulls her axe off the bike and sets upon him like the wolverine she is
&gt;His screams and cries paled in comparison to your lovable shorstack&#039;s warcry
&gt;In the end she managed to chop both his legs off below the knees
&gt;And now, he&#039;s eye level with her
&gt;You&#039;re still staring at the stunned gasping stubby fox, and a light pat on your hand snaps you out of it
&gt;You rev up the ATV and she gets into her usual spot
&gt;The both of you turn to look at him, his words still failing to come out
&gt;&quot;Might want to get that flesh wound checked out,&quot; you start
&gt;&quot;Portable blowjob machine!&quot; Zahrah finished over the roar of the ATV as you ride away

Part IV: King Anon and Radka
 
&gt;Your reign thus far has been interesting
&gt;The famine has been reduced by the beastmen&#039;s supposed evil life magic
&gt;Trading with the pack opened new routes for the merchants to follow
&gt;And talks of peace spread like wildfire, and many of your people soon found comforts with the beings they were told were slaves
&gt;It&#039;s going pretty well, surprisingly so
&gt;You just weren&#039;t used to being a ruler
&gt;From a young age you were trained to be a warrior
&gt;And from there, a knight
&gt;You could also throw a pretty nasty fireball and plants like you a bit more now
&gt;Yet here you were, King of the lands you grew up in because the former one couldn&#039;t be bothered to help his people
&gt;But no, you didn&#039;t want to be the seat of power
&gt;He made that choice for you when he murdered one of your loves
&gt;Marie the sheep beast woman
&gt;She taught you life magic, helped teach you love has no boundaries if you let it
&gt;Radka, your still alive reindeer beast woman wife was actually the one who initiated your polygamous lifestyle
&gt;You were there when Marie died, unable to act and only watching
&gt;That moment still haunts your dreams
&gt;You kept two long knives, the handles made from her horns on you at all times
&gt;But today was not a day to dwell upon it
&gt;Supposedly you had a foreign emissary coming from afar
&gt;You assume it&#039;s from the Lady Zig
&gt;You&#039;re still unsure how that night had been possible; assured in the sense that it was an ale induced dream
&gt;Flying metal machines? Four armed beings? A jest at best
&gt;And yet Radka swore it happened , And so had Marie when she was alive
&gt;So you sat there awaiting your guest
&gt;You&#039;re left waiting much longer than you&#039;re used to
&gt;Either being kind has spoiled you or this emissary was just that rude
&gt;A little later some half hearted fanfare announced the person you&#039;re meeting, who is currently accompanied by two very annoyed guards
&gt;He&#039;s casual in his stroll through your throne room
&gt;You are greeted before a disinterested hybrid
&gt;You think so anyways
&gt;A fox perhaps, or maybe a wolf from the size
&gt;His gem studded vestments clashed horribly against his black fur and stunningly blue eyes
&gt;&quot;Grettings se-&quot; you clear your throat of your old habbits
&gt;&quot;I am King Anon,&quot; you start again, &quot;what news have you?&quot;
&gt;He never stopped lazily turning his head looking around
&gt;&quot;My name&#039;s Bingle,&quot; he gave a mock bow, &quot;I&#039;m not sure why I was sent to this dirty place&quot;
&gt;&quot;Dirty? You&#039;ve got a strange sense of humor,&quot; you say through a fake smile
&gt;You clear your thoughts, deciding it was a tactless way to keep a secret
&gt;You stand up from the uncomfortable weight of your throne
&gt;&quot;Walk with me, Sir Bingle,&quot; and with the tap of a guard&#039;s halberd he finally acknowledges you
&gt;The first thing he decides to do was sneeze
&gt;&quot;Right, yeah,&quot; he said through his sleeve
&gt;You sigh, thinking at how terrible it must be to live as a moron
 
&gt;You lead him through your castle with the uninterested fox walking behind you
&gt;&quot;I did not ask to be king,&quot; you begin, and slow down for him to catch up
&gt;A back-stab, no matter how inept the attempt may be would surely ruin your weekend
&gt;&quot;I became it for the good of the people,&quot; you stop in front of a door having finished your words
&gt;&quot;I sense you are lost Sir Bingle, I see the wounds time has left upon you&quot;
&gt;He raised an eyebrow at that while you opened the door
&gt;Portraits of Marie line the walls with a small table in the center of the room
&gt;You quietly walked towards it with Bingle stomping behind you
&gt;A single drawing Marie made sits upon it
&gt;It&#039;s the last self portrait she drew
&gt;Every painting of her since was based on this
&gt;&quot;You need to find the person that is the catalyst to your life&quot;
&gt;The sight of the picture drew a hand over one of your knives
&gt;&quot;Even if they are sometimes taken from you&quot;
&gt;Your grip was a little tighter when you turn to the fox
&gt;His disinterest is only broken with another sneeze
&gt;...
&gt;&quot;Very well Sir Bingle, if you are not here for a reason then I suggest you leave&quot;
&gt;&quot;No, no!&quot; he puts on a &#039;smile&#039; and makes his way to the table
&gt;&quot;I agree completely!&quot;
&gt;He&#039;s looking over the contents on the table, leaning forward a little closer with a paw cupping his chin
&gt;He gave a &quot;hmm&quot; when he looked over the drawing a little more
&gt;And then he picked it up
&gt;&quot;A woman made you thi-&quot;
&gt;&quot;Bingle! Put that down,&quot; you take a step towards him
&gt;His muzzle is scrunched up
&gt;&quot;Thi-i-i-&quot;
&gt;You moved to grab him
&gt;&quot;ACHOO&quot;
&gt;Mucus and wetness cover the drawing
&gt;You&#039;re speechless at that
&gt;&quot;Ooops, sorry about your picture&quot;
&gt;He sneezed again, and with a shrug he tosses it back onto its pedestal
&gt;His delusion stirred a fire you once felt a long time ago
&gt;&quot;How dare you fox!&quot; you grab his shoulders and force him away
&gt;&quot;You enter my house, insult my court, and ruin one of my prized possessions like it&#039;s nothing!&quot; you were roaring, and with every word you pushed a little harder
&gt;His paws are grabbing at your arms
&gt;They fly into the air when you hold him against a wall
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s your prized possession?&quot; that now fear tinged smile was back
&gt;One of his paws points back to the table
&gt;&quot;A shitty drawing? Really?&quot;
&gt;You stared at him
&gt;He started to flinch from the sight of your now red knife and the pain in his neck
&gt;You let go, and he collapses with you no longer supporting his weight
&gt;Blinking out of your haze, you slowly turned the knife around in your hand
&gt;A dot of red paints the horned handle
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m sorry Marie...&quot;
&gt;You take the cloth from your robe and gently rub it across the handle
&gt;&quot;I was just trying to teach him what you did for me&quot;
&gt;You sigh, and call for a servant
&gt;He&#039;s shocked at what he sees, but he loses it from your pained expression
&gt;It quickly hardened
&gt;&quot;Send word to Bongwater. Tell him I have a special meal for him&quot;

Part V : Titan, Jane and Isabelle
 
&gt;Going out together has been increasingly more difficult for the three of you
&gt;The three of you being yourself, Jane, and Isabelle of course
&gt;Jane&#039;s and your schedules were almost the same, but Isabelle had a different one
&gt;You worked nights and she generally worked during the day
&gt;But today was a special occasion
&gt;By some random miracle the three of you could all go out and have a good time together
&gt;Since it was so rare, you and Jane had decided to let Isabelle to pick where to go
&gt;Of course she would choose the UltraLux
&gt;&quot;What? I just want to see where you two work,&quot; was her defense
&gt;And so after a bit of prep work and squeezing into Jane&#039;s FloCar the three of you made it to the UltraLux
&gt;It felt weird going through the main entrance and getting blasted by all of the ritzy glamorous signs advertising fantastic ways to go broke
&gt;A solid door in a concrete wall is more your speed
&gt;You can&#039;t deny the idea was great with how Isabelle keeps looking around in awe at everything
&gt;&quot;You guys work HERE!?&quot; you swear she was bouncing in place
&gt;&quot;Eeee! It&#039;s so exciting!&quot;
&gt;She happily drags you from table to machine to bar to table and back again
&gt;That woman can pull when she wants too
&gt;Jane is spared from losing an arm and casually follows behind you
&gt;Every almost-trip and misstep earned you a poorly hidden giggle behind you
&gt;Soon enough she dragged you out to the center, and for the first time in the night she was finally calm
&gt;&quot;Where do you work usually Anon? I wanna see!&quot;
&gt;You lamely gesture around you
&gt;And got a punch in the shoulder for it
&gt;&quot;Not like that! Where do you hang out?&quot;
&gt;You smile and decide to indulge her
 
&gt;You lead her and Jane to an unassuming side door, and with a quick scan of your hand on a bio-metric scanner it dings and opens with a slight &#039;vwoosh&#039;
&gt;A short walk through a small hidden hallway and soon all three of you stand in a small elivator
&gt;Jane had an arm in yours while the two of you watched Isabelle fog up the glass
&gt;You don&#039;t know why the sight of concrete and wires were so interesting to the her
&gt;But, even that was over too soon
&gt;Another short walk(with the thought about getting a leash) later you all end up in the staging area
&gt;It&#039;s a small but comfortable room with a center table, large TV&#039;s and various red cushions and chairs dotting the line
&gt;Your boss even splurged and got a plant to go with it
&gt;&quot;This is where we are all given our assignments,&quot; you start to explain after giving a short tour
&gt;Isabelle looks around with a slight frown
&gt;&quot;Why is it fancy up there and not down here?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Because guests usually do not come down here,&quot; said a voice cutting through you&#039;re answer
&gt;You turn and see Theo behind you
&gt;&quot;Ah hey Theo, I was just showing Isabelle here where I worked&quot;
&gt;He raises a furred eyebrow up at you
&gt;&quot;Ah, of course. No problem, girlfriends do get curious. I remember my wife wanted to see it too&quot;
&gt;&quot;Just don&#039;t make a mess with her and Ms.Edwards. Or, at at least clean up after,&quot; he said with a wink
&gt;You look at him for a moment before it hits you with what he&#039;s implying
&gt;&quot;Theo, gross! I wouldn&#039;t do that HERE! Who the hell would?!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ronnie and Chika,&quot; he laughs
&gt;You hope Jane&#039;s retches were real
&gt;&quot;Aww gross, comeon man!&quot; you can hardly hold back a grin
&gt;He laughs harder
&gt;&quot;Wait, are you serious?&quot; you lean in close to him
&gt;His laughter fades and and with a napkin he pulled from his pocket he wipes a tear from his eye
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m just fucking with you titan,&quot; after a pat or two, back into the pocket it goes
&gt;&quot;But don&#039;t use that chair anymore&quot;
&gt;With a serious face, he points to a chair in the corner that Eugene usually sits on
&gt;Gross
&gt;&quot;Anyway, continue your tour for Ms. Isabelle, I&#039;ll see you Thursday&quot;
&gt;He gives you a fist bump, and with a nod towards Jane he disappears into the elevator
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s one of my bosses,&quot; you explain as you wait for the elevators to come back down
&gt;&quot;What about you Jane?&quot; Isabelle chirps happily
&gt;Jane shuffles uncomfortably beside you
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t think you&#039;d wanna see that Izzy,&quot; she finally says
&gt;Isabelle looks at her in disbelief
&gt;&quot;Jane, the three of us have had sex multiple times on and off camera. There is literally nothing embarrassing left to show me&quot;
&gt;Your smile is back at that
&gt;The elevator comes back and you usher them both in through the doors
&gt;&quot;Fine! But I&#039;m not pole dancing for you!&quot;
&gt;Isabelle looks a little sad, but she pulls out her patented puppy dog eyes
&gt;&quot;Not even a little bit?&quot;
&gt;She adds a quivering lip on top of her bright pink stare
&gt;&quot;Hmm...&quot;
&gt;Not waiting for an answer she puts on a lewd grin
&gt;&quot;I would love to see what you can do with this body!&quot;
&gt;She spanks Jane, earning a squeak of surprise from a very flustered kitty
&gt;Oooh, someone&#039;s getting bold
&gt;&quot;FINE! But you&#039;re gonna pay for it later, and Anon here is gonna help me!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nothing you can do to me that I won&#039;t like,&quot; said Isabelle with a tongue stuck out
&gt;It&#039;s Jane&#039;s turn to go lewd
&gt;&quot;Oh, is that a challenge? Anon~ it looks like Isabelle&#039;s ass is yours later!&quot;
&gt;That smug look of Isabelle&#039;s didn&#039;t last very long
&gt;Wha? My...? Do I have to?&quot;
&gt;Jane nods, &quot;if you want a pole dance you gotta give it up&quot;
&gt;With a huff and a stomp of her footpaw, she then pulls out a pout
&gt;&quot;FINE! But it better be an awesome pole dance!&quot;
&gt;Looks like you&#039;re about to have a fun night
&gt;The elevator ride ends and Jane leads the two of you to a small room with a stage
&gt;&quot;This is where I usually do private shows!&quot; Jane says with flare
&gt;She follows up her grand opening with a climb to the stage, and pushes a small button with her footpaw
&gt;The room dims and a pole rises out of the floor
&gt;She&#039;s pretty quick to get on it, too
&gt;&quot;I usually change and strip on this stage,&quot; she said mid spin
&gt;&quot;But no touching~&quot; she adds with her arms holding her up and legs spread
&gt;&quot;Aww, no touching? That&#039;s a shame&quot;
&gt;wat
&gt;&quot;Who..?&quot; you turn around and see some sort of large wolf anthro behind you
&gt;A big black with blue eyes and jeans
&gt;The popped collar on his polo shirt was especially impressive
&gt;&quot;Hey, this is a private show buddy, get lost&quot; you grunt
&gt;Instead of listening to you he struts into the room past you
&gt;&quot;Aww come on now mate! You&#039;re just being selfish,&quot; he leans against a chair next to Isabelle
&gt;&quot;You can&#039;t book two lovely ladies all for yourself!&quot;
&gt;A black paw lands on Isabelle&#039;s pink hair covered shoulder
&gt;Her head tilted towards it from how he&#039;s clearly grabbed a handful
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t think you-&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m Bingle,&quot; he cuts you off, &quot;but you probably know me by my stagename: Peppercorn Starshake!&quot; he adjusts his collar after a small mock bow
&gt;You didn&#039;t start this encounter with a lot of patience
&gt;And now, you immediately started agreeing with that little voice in your head
&gt;You clench your fists when Isabelle can&#039;t pry him off
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t give a fuck who you are, fuck off,&quot; you growl and take a step closer
&gt;&quot;Aww, now don&#039;t be like that. How about this: we could tag team them!&quot;
&gt;No fucking way, pal
&gt;&quot;Though I get the tiddywolf here first&quot;
&gt;His paws are on an incredibly distressed Isabelle&#039;s breasts
&gt;&quot;KILL HIM,&quot; the voice roared over your lover&#039;s screaming your name
&gt;You don&#039;t even think twice
&gt;Your fist soon met the soft feeling of fur
&gt;Snapping bone and blood quickly follows it
&gt;And... oh? Oh look!
&gt;His brain jelly joined in on the fun
&gt;Where the left side of his face once stood your fist briefly occupies it
&gt;The entire left side of his skull caved in as his surprisingly lightweight body skidded across the floor
&gt;Oops, that was a fox
&gt;Spindly little fuckers aren&#039;t they?
&gt;You agreed, and turning to Isabelle you&#039;re quickly by her side
&gt;&quot;You ok babe?&quot; you ask
&gt;She doesn&#039;t hesitate leaping onto you with a kiss
&gt;&quot;Ooo yeah Anon, I&#039;m better than ok!&quot; she&#039;s a little hysterical
&gt;&quot;Jane! I&#039;m done seeing where you work!&quot;
&gt;She furiously nods at that
&gt;Jane makes her way off the stage and Isabelle pressed to your side
&gt;Making your way to the door you see Isabelle mistakenly looking back
&gt;A black footpaw twitched back
&gt;&quot;OK, STREAM TIME&quot; and she once again pulls you away
&gt;She looks frazzled, but her heavy panting and tight grip over you tells you otherwise
&gt;Oh yeah, that predatory sense of lovin acts of violence in their defense
&gt;Looks like you&#039;re gonna have a GREAT night

Part VI : Vault Anon and Amana
 
&gt;Scavenging has been easy lately
&gt;Gun parts, screws, weapon mods, food
&gt;Even better with your mudermate Amana with you
&gt;Better in the sense that raiders don&#039;t fuck with a a huge deathclaw
&gt;One who has the hots for you, specifiaclly
&gt;Sure, you could&#039;nt go into colonies at all without people gawking, and a laser or plasma bolt would fly our way
&gt;But people never tried to stiff you on prices now
&gt;Apparently they were under the impression that you were some kind of ultra amazing animal whisperer
&gt;You tell them that, but in reality that isn&#039;t a perk listed in the voodoo guide to your black magic pipboy
&gt;Speaking of, you&#039;re fiddling with it right now as the two of you walk through the wilds of Not Oregon
&gt;Amana stomped off a few minutes ago, following the smell of some Animal
&gt;Like you said - the food part was easy to come by
&gt;Without fail she would be dragging back some poor animal in half an hour or less
&gt;Free of charge, no caps needed
&gt;Only snuggles and hugs
&gt;One time she dragged another deathclaw to you
&gt;Thankfully in a less aggressive and much more eatable state, but you were of course a little reserved about eating what could potentially be her own brother
&gt;She kept bumping you with her muzzle when you tried to shy away, and only your hunger and her rock hard face got you to try it anyways
&gt;It was surprisingly good
 
&gt;After a quick meal of cooked unidentifiable meat chunks you are almost back home
&gt;It was a cellar built into the floor from a long long time ago, that you reinforced with your pipboy&#039;s Cthulhu magic
&gt;It&#039;s a veritable fortress similar to a raider camp, built to last and to weather the storms
&gt;Your locked front gate is wide open
&gt;Ok
&gt;How did they get past your turrets?
&gt;You swore they can run off bullets
&gt;Well, someone, or something was in there
&gt;With your combat rifle drawn you descend down the stairwell into your new intruded homme
&gt;You found it immediately
&gt;Digging through one of your weapon trunks was what appeared to be a, for lack of a better word, humanoid wolf
&gt;A black furred one if the lighting wasn&#039;t lying
&gt;You don&#039;t want to go near it since the poor thing could be a walking atom bomb
&gt;One that has his hands on your favorite modded .50cal rifle, that bastard
&gt;&quot;Man, I&#039;ve gotta show Chick these! This gear is awesome! I mean, just look at it!&quot;
&gt;You charge your rifle to get it&#039;s attention
CHIK CHAK
&gt;The radwolf thing turns around with your precious 50 still in its grubby paws
&gt;&quot;Eh? A human? Not what I expected but this place is neat!&quot;
&gt;He points it haphazardly at you
&gt;&quot;I found it first, so get lost!&quot;
&gt;Great, it&#039;s retarded
&gt;His bright blue eyes focus on you and your rifle, to which you raise it up in response
&gt;&quot;This is my home. Get lost before I shoot you&quot;
&gt;One more load for luck
&gt;&quot;Or worse&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah, right - my gun&#039;s bigger dude! So get lost before I perforate you!&quot;
&gt;You shake your head at him
&gt;&quot;Trust me, you&#039;re gonna want to drop that&quot;
&gt;He raises it even more, and without warning he pulls the trigger
*click*
&gt;&quot;Rule number 1: Never store a loaded weapon&quot;
&gt;He stands there staring at you
&gt;Completely bamboozled
&gt;It was about to get better from the vibrations in the ground that you start to feel
&gt;You smile, take a step three feet to the left, and bow
&gt;Amana tears past you with a roar
&gt;&quot;HOLY SHI-&quot;
&gt;Well, that happened
&gt;The radwolf is nothing more than a pile of fur and bone that Amana is happily tearing into
&gt;You stroll over calmly and lay a hand on her side
&gt;Looking closer you give a whistle
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s some good fur! Hey, Amana, let me have that real quick so I can get the pelt&quot;
&gt;You make a reach for it, and lose both it and the side you were leaning against
&gt;&quot;HEY! Gimme!&quot;
&gt;The pile of muscle and death just starts chewing faster and scoots away
&gt;Dammit, she does this when she eats something she shouldn&#039;t be
&gt;You stop, wiggle your fingers, and pop your neck to get the kinks out
&gt;Time to use the secret weapon
&gt;You leap, and grab onto her scaled back
&gt;As expected she starts to get up, but with your mighty powers you freeze her in place
&gt;Your fingers have found the side of her neck, and they&#039;re gently scratching away
&gt;Her eyes close almost immediately, and you feel and hear a soft purring start
&gt;You continue giving scritches while you cautiously reach over, closer and closer
&gt;Just gotta add the icing on this cake with a long drawn out scratch down the top of her muzzle
&gt;Aaaannnd...
&gt;&quot;HEY!&quot; she parrots at you
&gt;You look over the body you are now holding
&gt;Too many holes in the hide to even make a napkin
&gt;Your mind wanders to the legion and their helmets
&gt;What where they called?
&gt;&#039;Vexillarius helmets!&#039; your demonic wristband says
&gt;Yeah, that&#039;l do
&gt;You make short work of the removing the tattered pelt from the toy you quickly give back to Amana
&gt;No good can come of making your 8 foot murder monster wife angry
&gt;Or how easily bypassed your defenses were
&gt;You got a cool hat out of it though


Part VII: ComfyAnon and Raquel

&gt;It&#039;s a lovely morning as you and Raquel hike slowly up the infamous &#039;stairway to heaven&#039; in Oahu
&gt;Sure, it IS technically illegal to go up them now, but that didn&#039;t stop the droves of people who did it anyway
&gt;You&#039;re pretty sure that the police don&#039;t even bother to stop people anymore, just because so many of them still want to climb it
&gt;Still... better safe than sorry in this case
&gt;You and Raquel had woken up at 4AM and started up the side of the mountain
&gt;While at times the stairs were steep, Raquel took the challenge in stride using her single arm to pull herself along with amazing strength and dexterity
&gt;She happily hummed along knowing you were right there behind her, and ready to catch her should the worst happen
&gt;It&#039;s a few hours into this stressful, peaceful hike, and the sun is just now starting to rise
&gt;The view over the island and sea is breathtaking, second only to the moon you&#039;ve been staring at up the mountain
&gt;&quot;Come on Anon! We&#039;re almost at the top!&quot;
&gt;Your smile was as big as the sunrise, probably, and you hurry up after her
&gt;It&#039;s only about 4,000nd more steps and you are in pretty good shape to do it
&gt;The cool mountain air swirling past you certainly helped
&gt;Yeah, this vacation was just what you and Raquel needed
&gt;&quot;Oh my god look at the view!&quot; your maned wolfess happily calls to you
&gt;No kidding
&gt;You could see it all
&gt;Honolulu, Hanauma Bay, Diamond Head and the jungle all around
&gt;All breathtaking
&gt;But Raquel&#039;s smiling joyous face could definitely kill you on the spot
&gt;Not to be outdone, not with how much effort it took to craft that smile of hers, you beam back
&gt;You didn&#039;t do it for praise or anything like that, you did it because it was the right thing to do
&gt;And in the end, the effort was worth it
&gt;Your thoughts are broken by the sound of struggled panting
&gt;That&#039;s not Raquel is it?
&gt;You look towards Raquel ready to catch her passed out form
&gt;...She must of had the same idea with how her arm is stretched out to you
&gt;Both of you had equally confused looks, but her&#039;s even more so while she looked over your shoulder
&gt;The source of the sound reveals itself when you too turn around

&gt;&quot;Why would anyone do this for fun? This is torture,&quot; gasps a panting black fox, quite literally crawling up the stairs
&gt;Reaching the top he lamely claws at the ground before finally rolling to his side
&gt;You can see why he struggled so much
&gt;He has a full rucksack on and enough supplies to go camping for a few days
&gt;Was he planning on sleeping here?
&gt;Well, now that you think about it, this would make for a lovely camping spot
&gt;You walk over and help the struggling fox to his feet
&gt;&quot;Hey there man, you going camping up here or something?&quot;
&gt;He keeps panting, and only manages to drown it out with a quick drink from a water bottle
&gt;&quot;Huh? Camping? No this is just a hike!&quot; he took a moment to chug it down, &quot;You gotta take a rucksack on a hike anywhere! In case you get lost, or something&quot;
&gt;You look back at Raquel who only gives a half shrug
&gt;Getting lost here is basically impossible, the city below is in full view
&gt;Someone would have to be a special brand of retarded to have something like that happen
&gt;You dismiss that line of thinking and try to strike up a conversation
&gt;With it being a vacation and all you&#039;re probably never gonna see this guy again
&gt;Might as well
&gt;You offer your hand to the fox and he takes it with a firm shake
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m Anon and this is Raquel,&quot; you begin
&gt;He puts on a winded grin and looks at Raquel
&gt;&quot;My name&#039;s Bingle,&quot; he says after catching his breath
&gt;Raquel makes her way to a rock nearby and sits down on it, giving a polite wave at the mention of her name
&gt;The two of you also make your way to rocks, and he takes off his pack while your unburdened self sits next to your fuzzy wife
&gt;He&#039;s looking at you and then back to Raquel with a puzzled look on his muzzle
&gt;&quot;If I&#039;m not mistaken you&#039;re a maned wolf right?&quot; he said with a snap of his fingers
&gt;Raquel and yourself put on your best &#039;mildly surprised&#039; smiles
&gt;It&#039;s not every day that someone didn&#039;t assume her to be a very lanky fox, so when someone gets it right it tends to make her day
&gt;&quot;Why, yes I am! I&#039;m impressed you were able to tell&quot;
&gt;He nods with his hand cupping his chin, deep in thought or deeply proud of his intellect
&gt;&quot;Is it true your piss smells like dank kush?&quot;
&gt;Ah, so it&#039;s neither
&gt;As expected, you both went from mildly surprised to horribly shocked
&gt;You just don&#039;t ask a lovingly taken, not for sale lady that
&gt;&quot;Uh... yeahitdoes,&quot; she squeaks
&gt;He laughs at that
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s a pretty cool fetish you could fill right there! Dank kush watersports&quot;
&gt;...Wel-
&gt;&quot;Whoa whoa whoa whoa WHOA,&quot; you frown, &quot;that&#039;s a little uncalled for!&quot;
&gt;He just looks at you in disbelief, that&#039;s very hard to see behind another drained waterbottle
&gt;Finishing it, he zips to Raquel&#039;s side and places a padded hand on her shoulder
&gt;&quot;No, no it is called for,&quot; you ignore the fact he&#039;s touching your wife for how interesting his story better damn well be
&gt;&quot;See, I&#039;m a pornstar and&quot;
&gt;Alright! No more touching!
&gt;The both of said, with Raquel being extra forceful in pushing him off
&gt;&quot;Wha? No man, I&#039;m always trying to find new fetishes to cater to&quot;
&gt;He&#039;s looking Raquel up and down earnestly
&gt;You stand, and the only thing stopping you from heating up is a warm paw grabbing on to you
&gt;She&#039;s just as bothered as you, but even then she didn&#039;t want to cause a scene
&gt;Atop a mountain with only three people, no less
&gt;&quot;And she&#039;s an amputee!&quot; he whistles, &quot;She&#039;s like a mixed bag of fetishes, all bundled up into one!&quot;
&gt;You open your mouth, and promptly get cutoff by the fox
&gt;&quot;-a few greenscreen socks and we can do the whole &#039;lovepillow&#039; deal too! How &#039;bout we get off this mountain and make a film&quot;
&gt;He walks up to Raquel
&gt;&quot;You and me, what&#039;dya say?&quot;
&gt;He holds his paw out to her with bright blue eyes glinting happily that you simply can&#039;t see through the red haze
&gt;Your scowling goes ignored as well
&gt;It took you hours to get up here and this jerkwad was ruining it
&gt;He loosely grabs behind him to his backpack and pulls out a camera
&gt;Holding it in front of him he then looks back to you
&gt;&quot;Hubby here has to film though,&quot; he must of thought he was smooth
&gt;Not smooth enough to slip out of your tackle
&gt;&quot;Time for you to go Bingle&quot;
&gt;With a loud gasp behind you, you now have an incredibly confused fox pinned to the ground
&gt;&quot;Now listen here you little shit,&quot; you seethe through clenched teeth
&gt;Bingle&#039;s muzzle is making a lot of funny faces back at you
&gt;&quot;My wife and I were having a wonderful vacation before you somehow managed to sour the day with in just a few minutes&quot;
&gt;He must have used some high end softener with how silky his neck fur felt between your hands
&gt;You feel a light tapping on the side of your arm
&gt;You weren&#039;t expecting the thing causing it was his own trying to get you to stop
&gt;...
&gt;That better be his fucking wallet or keys in his front pockets
&gt;You drop his throat, which in turn drops his head right onto the dirt floor
&gt;What kind of weird shit does he do anyways
&gt;He coughs and gags a bit on the floor, and soon gets up as well
&gt;You and Raquel watch him slowly compose himself again
&gt;&quot;Alright!&quot; *wheeze* &quot;ok, fine&quot; *cough* &quot;I get it!&quot; he sputters out
&gt;You think he gets it
&gt;He digs in his pockets and pulls out a card, handing it to you
&gt;On it is the wolf in a much more, &#039;sparkly&#039; outfit with a phone number written on it
&gt;&quot;With a grip like that you could make it even better&quot;
&gt;Are you serious
&gt;&quot;No,&quot; you tear apart the card, but put the pieces away in one of your pockets
&gt;Don&#039;t want to litter, after all
&gt;He puts his hands up to his side, and rolls his eyes walking backwards
&gt;He get&#039;s to his stuff, and starts picking up the things he&#039;s left around
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s like he doesn&#039;t even want to watch me bang his girl,&quot; he quietly says to himself
&gt;He didn&#039;t get it
&gt;You don&#039;t even realize what you&#039;re doing as you seize the fox and hurl him from the cliff
&gt;His screams cut through the air as he ragdolls down the rockface
&gt;Another of Raquel&#039;s gasps brings you back
&gt;She has a paw over her mouth and looking at you, wide eyed
&gt;You kick at the dirt
&gt;&quot;Eh, sorry babe - did I get carried away?&quot; you say, scratching at the back of your head
&gt;She leaps onto you with a half-hug
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ve just never seen you angry like that before&quot;
&gt;Her quick kiss betrays her shaking
&gt;You don&#039;t remember spilling water on your pants
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s just enjoy this view!&quot; she&#039;s off of you in a flash, and reaches into her own backpack
&gt;Pulling out a few boxes she giddily holds them out to you
&gt;&quot;I made sammiches!&quot; she adds a wiggle to each one
&gt;You lost it, laughing at the absurdity of what just happened
&gt;It reminds you of something important however
&gt;You grab the fox&#039;s rucksack, and toss it over the cliff
&gt;You&#039;re somewhat sure it&#039;s the same spot he flew over
&gt;Oh well, you did your best
&gt;Don&#039;t want him getting lost

Part VIII: The Incubus and Devaki

&gt;A cup of coffee sits on a table, unmoving, unchanging, and full of joe
&gt;No matter what goes on in the background, this simple fact doesn&#039;t change
&gt;And no matter how hard the lightning blue veins pulse in your arms, this appears to be it&#039;s purpose in the universe
&gt;The force is definitely against you
&gt;Ever since you pulled Devaki out of her prison, you&#039;ve been trying to see the extent of your new found strength and abilities
&gt;You&#039;ve tried hydrokinesis, pyrokinesis, geokinesis, aerokinesis, a quick stint at mind reading, and regular old kinesis
&gt;The only thing you&#039;ve managed so far was to fart out a few balls of light that would spark out after an hour or so
&gt;The past thirty minutes were spent on getting this cup of coffee to float at you
&gt;&quot;Practice more, we will guide you,&quot; your demoness calls from the couch, comfortable in her favorite pink sweater and not at all struggling at magic
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not even sure what I can do though, or how can I practice&quot;
&gt;She grins, showing off all her wolflike teeth with her head cocked to the side
&gt;&quot;You have all eternity to learn&quot;
&gt;Great, she&#039;s being like fucking yoda
&gt;You sigh, and reach out for the coffee mug with the thought of going to work tomorrow weighing you down
&gt;Work at a place where all of your co-workers are somewhat scared of you now
&gt;You can&#039;t exactly blame them, if you put yourself in their shoes their fear made sense
&gt;Random co-worker shows up with a fiery blue wolf demon and glowing blue eyes would be terrifying
&gt;Despite that, when you grasp at the mug it... shimmers, for lack of a better word
&gt;And it slips through your fingers
&gt;&quot;Dammit!&quot; you make a dive for the cup, only to realize you were still holding it with bean juice now thrown on your table
&gt;&quot;Yeah, ok, sure,&quot; you grit your teeth and pick yourself up
&gt;You also spend an unhealthy amount of time staring at the exact replica of the mug you&#039;re holding
&gt;there is literally an exact copy of the mug on the table
&gt;Wut
&gt;&quot;Wat,&quot; you still stare, mug in hand and a massive stain slowly forming next to you
&gt;&quot;What did you do Anon?&quot; Devaki is standing above you and peering down at the mug
&gt;&quot;We have not seen this type of thing before,&quot; her three blazing blue eyes are shifting from mug to mug
&gt;This time, you reach with both hands and make a grab at them
&gt;They&#039;re both solid
&gt;Huh, that&#039;s pretty neat
&gt;To your surprise there is still a bit of coffee left in your mug, and you take a sip of it
&gt;It&#039;s delicious, because your awesome with a keurig
&gt;You take a sip from the other one
&gt;Huh, that&#039;s pretty aweful
&gt;You retch and spit out the mixture, that was a delicious blend of ash, ass, and some kind of dewy lemon-lime soda
&gt;The smell of sulfur really adds to it, too
&gt;You remedy this with placing both mugs down and rushing to the kitchen to wash the taste out of your mouth
&gt;&quot;Anon it is fading,&quot; you hear Devaki call out
&gt;Your mouth cleansed, and on a mission to raid the fridge, you take a quick peak from the side to see that the second mug is in fact, crumbling away
&gt;Like a structure made of soot it crumbles into nothing until there&#039;s no sign of it left
&gt;&quot;We think if you were concentrating on it, the mug would have lasted longer&quot;
&gt;You walk back over to the table, the mess, and the doggo
&gt;&quot;So I can make temporary clones of things? I wonder if I can do that with living things&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re pulled into a furry hug with her muzzle to your ear
&gt;&quot;That would make our time together at night much more interesting&quot;
&gt;Her long tongue runs down your face, leaving a slight tingling trail wherever it touches
&gt;You would be grossed out buy you&#039;re used to her licking affection
&gt;So instead of reeling back you give her a delicate kiss on her nose
&gt;She has a weakness for affection, you learned
&gt;Guess demons don&#039;t really get to experience it all that often
&gt;She starts letting out a low gravely purr that you wouldn&#039;t expect from a wolf like demon
&gt;But again, demon, and you yourself could pose as a third rate blue man group stand-in
&gt;The only noise you did expect is her occasional roaring
&gt;100% guaranteed when they climax tho
&gt;Her gravely purr grows even louder when you wrap an arm around her waist and pull her closer to you
&gt;No small feat considering she is at least 2 feet taller than you
&gt;It doesn&#039;t stop you from pulling her along to the couch, and the two of you begin a super intense cuddle
&gt;A knock at the door stops you from diving on in
&gt;You sit up, look around and glance out the living room window
&gt;You hear another knock
&gt;It&#039;s coming from the closet door
&gt;&quot;What?&quot; you both say, Devaki looks just as confused as you
&gt;&quot;the fuck,&quot; you finish
&gt;With a quick walk to your closet door, you prepare to cast fist at whoever was in it
&gt;Opening the door, you find a black furred wolf Anthro
&gt;Or a fox, you guess
&gt;Neither of which are important as furries are now a thing too, apparently
&gt;You get a glimpse at his crystalline blue eyes, and you relax your raised fist
&gt;&quot;Is he one of yours?&quot; you say over your shoulder
&gt;&quot;We do not know this one,&quot; you get back
&gt;You turn to him again, &quot;Who are you and why are you in my closet?&quot;
&gt;Whatever brief confusion he had, it was quickly replaced with fury
&gt;&quot;Your closet?! Where the fuck did that fucking skunk send me this time?&quot; he rants, shoving you out of the way and stepping into your apartment
&gt;He looks around, raises an eyebrow at the wolf on fire, and spots a mug that he soon swipes, and downs what ever was left
&gt;Aw man, that was the good stuff too
&gt;Confused, he flips it over, mumbles to himself and sets it back down on the table
&gt;Swearing gets involved when his fur acts like a rag for the spill
&gt;&quot;Ok, well, I think you should go,&quot; you move towards him
&gt;Ignoring you, he instead plops down on your couch
&gt;&quot;Nah,&quot; he says, wiping an arm on your couch, &quot;not until Zig pulls me out of wherever the hell I am&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re rather surprised he isn&#039;t freaking out about Devaki, you, or the fact that he totally trashed your couch
&gt;It doesn&#039;t halt your rapidly rising annoyance, which in turn Devaki seems to share
&gt;&quot;We do not want your presence here. Your life force is insufficient and too tainted for us to consume,&quot; she gets a little brighter and flamey with each word she says
&gt;&quot;You. Are. Worthless to us,&quot; you aren&#039;t sure if the living black rug could bunch up any smaller than that
&gt;&quot;Anon,&quot; you snap to attention
&gt;&quot;Yesm?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Rid us of this insufferable nuisance&quot;
&gt;You give a curt nod, and with a stiff upper lip you march to the couch
&gt;You have no mercy for this dog that interrupted your cuddle session, and now you&#039;re off the leash
&gt;Grabbing him by the scruff of his neck you drag him to the large bedroom mirror with Devaki daintily following
&gt;You aren&#039;t as gentle when you slam him into the glass, with your grip on his neck choking all words he might say
&gt;&quot;Reach deep, through reality, through the illusions of life and death,&quot; she begins to chant
&gt;&quot;And force him into that abyss,&quot; she&#039;s pretty blunt about it
&gt;You shove the wolf through the mirror into the realm you pulled Devaki from
&gt;You also left him a surprise
&gt;The wolf quickly gets up and dusts himself off while he looks around the empty void
&gt;His eyes finally fall on the exact copy of himself
&gt;&quot;Who are you?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m you but stronger!&quot;
&gt;And with that the copy pounces on the wolf thing
&gt;Devaki is sitting on the bed, and snuggle in beside her
&gt;&quot;Man, cable&#039;s gotten violent lately&quot;
&gt;The clone is tearing at the other, who&#039;s own fists flail back
&gt;&quot;Indeed&quot;
&gt;It&#039;s just like wrestling, but free, real, and with no Vince McMahon
&gt;It also doesn&#039;t matter who &quot;wins&quot; the fight between them
&gt;For you now have entertainment for the evening</textarea>
