&gt;Noxian, though not by birth or choice
&gt;your village got annexed by Noxian forces when you were a child
&gt;the deal then was join, or get killed
&gt;your parents understandably took the former option
&gt;it wasn&#039;t as bad as some people made it out to be, or at least as it was with how High Command was running shit
&gt;if you were good at what you did, people gave you leeway
&gt;if you were the best at it, you&#039;d get a crazy amount of respect and everyone would know about it
&gt;you were alright at what you did; legitimate healing magic, and not the disgusting necromancy that was rampant around Noxus
&gt;it was enough to get you by, but not enough to stop the bigger fish from pushing the thumbscrews in on you
&gt;you had considered defecting to Demacia at one point, but they hate mages, so that was a no-go
&gt;Bilgewater was too rough and tumble for you, Bandle City was full of midgets, you weren&#039;t smart enough for Piltover and Zaun didn&#039;t sound so great
&gt;fuck the Freljord forever
&gt;Ionia might be nice, but it&#039;d be a massive pain to even get there, and you really didn&#039;t think they&#039;d be too happy with a Noxian after the shit they had been through
&gt;so you were sorta stuck here
&gt;being the medic of a squad of equally mediocre soldiers, getting thrown into yet another skirmish against Demacian forces in the middle of nowhere 
&gt;mostly because the Grand General had a massive hate boner for the Demacian Prince
&gt;at least you weren&#039;t escorting (and eventually getting killed by) Sion
&gt;you were in the middle of a forest when the battle started
&gt;it wasn&#039;t so much of an ambush by the Demacians as it was your company stumbling over a ridge, each side catching sight of the other, and the Demacians doing their usual thing of charging straight the fuck at you
&gt;they were pretty direct in that way
&gt;you were sprinting from body to body, using other soldiers and the fog to cover yourself from harm despite being in the thick of it
&gt;you saw that fucker that beat you up the other week, sprinting right towards you
&gt;and away from the fucking battle
&gt;&quot;The fuck are you running from you pussy!?&quot; you yelled at him, despite not having any real way to stop him. &quot;The battle&#039;s tha-&quot;
&gt;something collided with his back as he neared you, and he fell head over heels
&gt;and clung to his neck, it&#039;s fangs buried deep inside his flesh, was a giant, dark-purple shade in the form of some canine sporting a rounded white mask
&gt;your heart stopped for a second as both the corpse of the bully and the wolf slammed into the ground at your feet
&gt;you knew exactly what the fuck that was
&gt;and you knew better than to interrupt it from its meal
&gt;guess that answered your previous question
&gt;wide-eyed and shaken, you turned away and began to wander towards the shouting and screaming
&gt;maybe you could hide in some bigger guy&#039;s pocket and feed him as many heals as you could, you might live to see tomorrow
&gt;you regrouped with a couple of younger squires, moving towards the treeline
&gt;you came across a small clearing with soldiers of both sides battling with one another
&gt;and every single one of them had the same mark hovering over their heads
&gt;and as you looked to your newfound compatriots, so did they
&gt;and they definitely knew it
&gt;their faces went pale, and they turned on their heels and ran
&gt;turning back to the battlefield, now obscured by the now thicker, heavier fog, you saw that wolf again
&gt;it&#039;s giant maw hovering right in front of you
&gt;well, there goes the idea of living
&gt;you stand there, somewhat dumbstruck and hopeless
&gt;the wolf barks out a laugh in a guttural voice
&gt;&quot;Hah! This one is no fun, but all his friends are!&quot;
&gt;and it bounds past you, leaving you alone and alive
&gt;well, that was an experience
&gt;fuck this, you were done
&gt;if you read the map right, the coast should be nearby
&gt;at least you can die with a view
&gt;you turned away from the sounds of battle, and traipse off through the woods
&gt;did it count as running if you walked away?
&gt;probably. you&#039;d know about it sooner or later
&gt;after a few minutes of walking, you came to a small cliff, the sparkling blue sea laying calm beneath it
&gt;you heard what sounded like the sound of something large and metal hit something hollow
&gt;the scream that followed was distant, but that only underlined how loud and protracted it was
&gt;&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOXUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUS&quot;
&gt;Sion had joined the battle apparently
&gt;you took a seat on a nearby rock, and looked out to the sky
&gt;everyone had that mark of death haunting them, so you only guessed that you&#039;d have it too
&gt;you couldn&#039;t see it
&gt;maybe you got lucky?
&gt;probably not. you were never lucky
&gt;something moved in your peripheral, and you turned your head 
&gt;out of the woods stepped a short figure, maybe 5 foot at best
&gt;you&#039;d never seen a white so pure and unfettered as it&#039;s fur
&gt;graceful, steady steps on hooved feet, a thick mantle of fur that seemed to explode out from beneath a dark, navy blue pointed mask, in the visage of a wolf
&gt;and a curved, intricately carved bow
&gt;that would be the counterpart to the creature from earlier
&gt;the lamb to the wolf
&gt;she was humming a sweet tune to herself as she pranced along towards you at an angle, her eyes, a roiling pink and blue light, set on you
&gt;you know what she is. what she represented, and what she was most likely here to do
&gt;and despite all that, you couldn&#039;t stop yourself from staring at her wide hips, thick thighs, and shapely rump
&gt;with a cute little tail to top it all off
&gt;she stopped a few metres in front of you, pausing for a moment before speaking
&gt;&quot;You saw our marks, and thought better to deny their end,&quot; she said, her voice making you tremble and your skin erupt into goosebumps. &quot;An uncommon action from one who wears your colours.&quot;
&gt;she fell silent, as if she was waiting for an answer
&gt;you felt their air leave your lungs; this was it
&gt;the end
&gt;...actually, you know what
&gt;fuck it all
&gt;let&#039;s get stupid
&gt;&quot;...If you&#039;re here to kill me, I have a request,&quot; you began tentatively
&gt;she tilted her head
&gt;&quot;We do not kn-&quot;
&gt;&quot;Please sit on my face.&quot;
&gt;the silence that followed was incredibly awkward
&gt;&quot;...Excuse me?&quot;
&gt;was she seriously asking you to repeat yourself?
&gt;&quot;Uh...&quot;
&gt;After another awkward pause where you attempted to recover the courage to say that stupid shit again, Lamb looks off to the side
&gt;&quot;...Wolf will be hunting for a while. No more seem willing to face their deaths peacefully.&quot;
&gt;She turned her face back to you, unreadable as it was, and brought a hand to her just in front of where you thought her mouth would be
&gt;&quot;...I suppose I have time to indulge your... perversions&quot;
&gt;what
&gt;she stepped forward, her bow fading into the air, placing her hand delicately around the collar of your armor and gently pulling you away from the rock
&gt;&quot;Lie down.&quot;
&gt;WHAT
&gt;following her guiding hand, you settle yourself underneath rock, placing your head against the grass
&gt;you felt her hand glide down your chest, and all you saw was the blue sky
&gt;before it was obscured by a giant, white, furry ass
&gt;holy fucking shit
&gt;this was absolute madman territory
&gt;you barely had time to even smile before she had placed one hand against your forehead to steady herself, and pushed her hips down
&gt;as her cheeks collided into your own, you were pleasantly surprised
&gt;they were as soft as they looked
&gt;two hands pressed down into your chest, and her thighs settled firmly around the sides of your head
&gt;it was harder to breathe, and all you could smell was a rather nostalgic scent
&gt;the smell of a meadow in the early morning
&gt;deciding to press your already incredible luck, you pushed your face upwards and your tongue outward
&gt;Lamb flinched away slgihtly as you explored through her fur and found your mark, before pushing herself down harder on your face
&gt;your dick instantly went to full mast
&gt;&quot;So this was your intention...&quot; she murmured, wiggling her hips from side to side, her hand gliding down your stomach and towards your groin. 
&gt;with almost no effort, your felt your imprisoning pants loosen and a set of furred fingers wrap around your cock
&gt;&quot;How... lecherous.&quot;
&gt;there was a particular tone to that second word that made you shudder with excitement
&gt;you felt something velvety and wet against your tongue, that elicited an encouraging squeeze of her thighs every time you brushed against it
&gt;drunk with arousal, you lapped away at her pussy with eagerness
&gt;you attempted to draw the alphabet with your tongue, girls apparently liked that
&gt;you gave up after C, and just went with whatever felt right, reaching your arms up to wrap around her plump thighs and dug in deep
&gt;Lamb was appreciative either way
&gt;she squeezed your cock, pulling upward and stroking your head with her thumb, before plunging back down to your groin
&gt;slowly and tortuously, she repeated the soft jerking motions
&gt;eventually, you felt an opening, and dove straight in, shoving your tongue into the fold
&gt;that brought a sufficient moan from Lamb, who immediately shoved her ass harder onto your face, almost pushing you into the dirt
&gt;whether that was to incite or to punish you, you weren&#039;t sure
&gt;it was significantly harder to breathe now
&gt;especially with her juices beginning to fill in for little air there was
&gt;undaunted by the concept of suffocating to death, you instead double down on your cunnilingus, while she reciprocated by increasing the pace of her stroking and squeezing
&gt;her other hand left your chest, sliding up and down your thigh before curling around your balls
&gt;she kneaded her fingers into your sack, leaning her slender body forward to press down against yours
&gt;you began to feel a warm rumbling in your gut, and started thrusting into her soft hand
&gt;her grip tightened on both your cock and your head
&gt;between the mounting pressure on your skull, the building puddle of fem-cum, her perculiar musk filling your nostrils, and your own arousal, you felt yourself become dizzy and lightheaded
&gt;and to top it all off, you felt warm breath and a wet tongue glide across the head of your penis
&gt;overwhelmed by the oppressive sensations, you let out a muffled groan of pleasure and released inside her mouth
&gt;despite the sudden orgams, Lamb continued to squeeze and pump away, making your legs spasm uncontrollably
&gt;finally spent, your vision went black

&gt;you awoke to the same blue sky you gazed upon earlier
&gt;and the faint scent of a warm, womanly scent that made you grin sheepishly despite being too groggy to have a clue what it was, or which young lass left it-
&gt;oh
&gt;OH
&gt;you raised your head to examine your body
&gt;your pants had been mercifully pulled back up, but there was dried fluids splattered everwhere
&gt;some of it yours, and some of it not
&gt;and a single, pure white arrow planted in the ground beside you
&gt;you let your head drop back to the ground in disbelief
&gt;...did you seriously just perform reciprocal oral sex on the avatar of death itself?</textarea>
