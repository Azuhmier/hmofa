            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Chapter Zero: In Medias Res</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&lt;The University of Tromsø - The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, Norway&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It was a beautiful day outside. The snow had stopped falling, giving way to a warm Norwegian sun shining across the land. Of course, warm was relative when you were a staff member in the northernmost university in the world. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The professor stood up from his oaken desk and checked his watch. The coffee maker quietly bubbled in the corner of his office. With a satisfied grunt, he straightened his cuff after noticing that it was slightly askew. Gripping the side of the desk for support, he reached out to his walking stick. He was only 65 and his hip *just* started giving him some trouble, so it really wasn’t necessary. However, the grandson who gave it to him was very proud of making it himself, and how could he deny such eager puppy-dog eyes? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Half-past noon. His guest should be arriving soon. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A representative from the Vanagandr-Mous Foundation, who apparently needed to talk to him about some historical writings regarding a “lost” city in Egypt. Of course, the professor really knew what that man was coming here to discuss. There were better places than the city of Tromsø to discuss ancient Egyptian history. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He rapped his cane on the legs of the coffee table as he walked by it, the jolt activating his “internet assistant” and its holographic projector. In its idle state, it began scrolling through some pictures that he saved on it. He smiled as he saw his seventh birthday, then a picture with his flustered wife, and finally a picture of his ten children, then all rambunctious Faunae wolf-cubs. Standing next to him was his wife, a head and a half taller than him. ‘Hm. Not bad for a 180 centimeter-tall twenty-nine year old.’ He thought. His eyes come to rest on a large hunting knife, resting behind a thick glass case. His reflection was clear in the golden blade, between the old Nordic runes engraved in the flat of the knife. Just looking at the blade brought mixed feelings. He owed a lot to it, and it had also taken much from him. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*KNOCK KNOCK*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Ah,” he thought. His guest had arrived. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yes, come in. The door is unlocked.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The door opened, allowing a smartly-dressed human man and Faunae woman inside. The lapel of his suit had a large metal VF pin on it, the logo of the Vanagandr-Mous Foundation. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Dr. Vidarsson? My name is Roland McDouglass.” Ronald extended a hand which the professor shook. “And I’m Henrietta Anderson.” The Oryx woman extended a hand as well, and on closer inspection of her features the professor noticed that a silver Vanagandr-Mous Foundation ring adorned one of her horns.   “We’re historians with the Vanagandr-Mous Foundation’s Ancient Culture Research division.” She gestured to her partner. “The Foundation sent us to you for consultation regarding some archeological data we need clarification on.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“They want a free consultation, hm? I should take the cut for this from their allowance.” The man chuckled to himself as he realized the confused looks his guests were wearing. “Ahem. I trust the journey here wasn’t too hard? It’s not often we get guests from America here.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Not at all, Doctor. I must say, compared to New York the Norwegian countryside is a breath of fresh air. And I mean that literally and figuratively.” Ronald laughs at his own jest as Henrietta rolls her eyes. “If you want to get serious, McDouglass, lets show the good professor those peculiar hieroglyphs regarding our dig site in Egypt.” She raised her briefcase to the table, moving aside the holographic projector which turned off.  “We at the Foundation think that we’ve found something rather interesting down there regarding a potential discovery of a new lost ‘wonder of the world’ and we need your help in affirming the accuracy of our translation team’s notes.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Professor Vidarsson raises a hand, interrupting the young man. “Please, before we dive into formalities may I offer you some coffee? Or do you prefer tea?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">McDouglass smiles. “Coffee is fine, thanks. You can keep it black, I don’t particularly like cream or sugar in it.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Hm, that’s the opposite of how she liked it.” The professor mused, remembering the first time his late wife tried to drink coffee. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I’m sorry, did you say something?” The Oryx’s ears perk up in response to his murmur.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vidarsson grimaced, unintentionally letting the past get to him again. “Don’t mind me, just an old man reminiscing about days gone by. Would you like some coffee too?” The Oryx woman shook her head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Get a grip. It’s been nearly ten years since you did the deed. And she wanted you to do it.” He thought to himself as his brow furrowed.  Gingerly he placed down two porcelain cups filled with the bitter, dark liquid on the table. As McDouglass requested his cup was left untouched as Vidarsson added some milk and a sugar cube to his. After taking a sip, he was ready and focused to parse through the documents, fishing his bifocals from his suit pocket.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Now then, let me see your dossier. I’ll try to give any input I can.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A few hours go by as the old man studied the documents. Dr. Vidarsson noticed that his guests would occasionally keep glancing at the golden hunting knife behind him. After some time, he became tired of their lustful eyes; their mind obviously on something else other than the pages before him. He grunted, jabbing his finger at a line of hieroglyphs, snapping the other two’s attention fully on the papers. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“These are very interesting hieroglyph patterns. Honestly nothing documented in the notes I’m familiar with matches any of these from any of the periods of ancient Egypt. Who compiled these?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">McDouglass rifled through his notepad. “It was a recent hire, a graduate student working on his doctorate. He found them at a dig site that he triangulated after picking up on clues laid out on several ancient scrolls that were overlooked by others. It’s funny, really. It all began with certain myths that spread throughout the region during the early centuries, around 200-600 BC. Something to do with talks of a strange library that dwarfed even the Library of Alexandria, and an artifact that would put the wealth of most nations to shame.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Artifact?” The professor leaned in, curious as to what the man had to say.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yes. Supposedly, it was a large obelisk made of solid gold. Apparently this city enshrined the thing in a pool in the city center. Of course, no evidence of this city exists, only trace mentions from texts scattered around the Middle East and Anatolia regions. But from that, he was able to triangulate a dig site where apparently they…found something. A box of scrolls and parchment books. That’s where these images I’m showing you now come from. They think that these show the location of something very important. I wanted a second opinion, so I came here.”  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Dr. Vidarsson raises an eyebrow. “Really? That’s quite impressive. What exactly do they think they’ll find?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">McDouglass’ visage darkened. “I really am not at liberty to say, doctor. Unfortunately, if I am to keep my position in the Foundation I must also keep my mouth shut.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I understand. Do be sure to pass on my contact information to this individual, though. I would very much like to meet him.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I will, Doctor. I’m sure he would love to meet with you.” McDouglass takes his papers and puts them back in his briefcase. As the latch snaps closed Henrietta perked up, unable to contain her questions any further. “Truth be told, professor, there is one last thing I wanted to ask you.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yes?” From his tone, Dr. Vidarsson seemed to already know what was on her mind. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“It’s about that knife, in that case behind you. May I take a look at it?” She gestured to the golden blade in the back of the room. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“By all means. Here, I will take it out for you.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The professor winced as he rose, surprising himself by actually using his cane for its intended purpose. He was going on in his sixties, and although his youth as an outdoorsman had kept him fit age was starting to catch up to him. He smiled sadly, as he knew she would have remained the same as she was forty years ago.  As young and spry as the day they met. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He lifted the glass cover over the blade, and gently took it out. It was heavy in his hand. “Here you are. Be careful, that edge is sharp.” Henrietta took it, running the edge between her fingers while studying the runes on the blade.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Elder Fuuthark…and an ancient dialect. Yet the blade is pristine.” Her voice was heavy with curiosity. At this point, McDouglass had stepped forward as well, his eyes scanning the blade. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“It should be, that is just a reproduction.” The doctor mused. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Reproduction?” McDouglass said while looking up at him. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Oh yes. The real one is kept with my family…in a location I am not willing to disclose.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Then, this really is…” McDouglass gulps. “This is the Hunting Knife of Vidar?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Again, a reproduction, but yes. The Hunting Knife is very, very real. Tell me, young lady, why did you ask about this weapon?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You won’t believe this, doctor. But one of the bound books in the chest that was found? It was written in Elder Fuuthark. It was a journal, but the text is extremely antiquated.” She gulped. “There are…rumors in the company. Rumors about the family that founded the Foundation and their history, and then this book shows up. I…I meant no disrespect but when we saw this weapon in your office…” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">At that, Dr. Vidarsson looked at his guests with an intense look. “A journal, you say?” His voice was measured, calm and holding back emotion. “A journal written in the language of the Old Gods?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yes. We were all wondering: why was a book written in the ancient Nordic language found buried under the sand in a dig site near the Toshka Lakes? Furthermore the contents of the journal confused us. It was difficult to translate, but the text within was full of notions of the apocalypse, with passages describing the world freezing over. Hell, I would have thought it’d be some kind of practical joke, if not for our carbon dating equipment placing its origin somewhere around late 500 BC.” She bit her thumb. “It ended up a critical part of triangulating the location of this ‘lost wonder’. But McDouglass and I were curious about this whole thing.” McDouglass began to speak, backing up his partner. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Being the expedition lead manager I contacted the head of the head of the Unusual Artifact Research division on his direct line. I told him about the journal and its contents, how it was out of place geographically. His tone got cold, well, colder than usual. He flatly told me that the journal was to be a valuable source of information, and that it needed to be hermetically sealed and shipped to VMF Headquarters immediately.” He sighs. “Our Artifact Recovery Containers are state of the art vacuum-sealed containers with active humidity control, capable of containing ancient artifacts for up to three years on one battery in a state of perfect stasis. Costly stuff. We had barely managed to secure three for this operation and to give up one immediately? I voiced my arguments that it was just a dusty journal, it could be shipped with a standard container.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Henrietta winced. “I supported that decision, and that was a mistake. We got a verbal lashing over that phone call and were told to bring the notes to you to discuss their validity as well as bring up the topic of the journal to you. He said that you would ‘provide adequate support to his claims’ on the importance of the journal.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vidarsson smiles. “I see my youngest is still as stoic as ever. Funny, when he was practically a daddy’s boy as a cub. Hold on, I have something you need to see.” Rising from his chair, he walks back to the glass case. Lifting the velvet cloth the blade was resting on, Vidarsson extracts a small leather-bound book. Its pages were heavily yellowed with age, and the leather binding was mummified and taut. He offered it to Henrietta who took it with care. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“This journal is dated around 576 BC. It originated from somewhere in northern Norway, and the author kept a record of their travels in it.” She looked up at him as McDouglass took the book in his hands. “And who is the author?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Dr. Vidarsson sat down, looking his guest in the eyes. “Vidar. THE Vidar. And if I’m not mistaken, he was the author of the journal you found as well.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The pair were silent for a moment. McDouglass clears his throat as he parsed the information, and Henrietta was the first one to speak up. “Yes. The Egyptian journal only credits a “Vidar” as the author. But surely it can’t be…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“It is.” Vidarsson interrupts. “Oh, it is. And that knife is his as well.” He reclines in his leather sofa. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I think I understand why my son sent you to me. He trusts you, I’m certain of that. He wants you to understand the gravity of whatever they’ve found out there. And to do that, I need to tell you about my own past, and what I discovered all those years ago. I trust you that the information I’m about to share only stays between us, and between you and my children.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">McDouglass and Henrietta quickly nodded in agreement. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Very well then. Let us begin, all those years ago in the year 2014…”  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">TRANLATION FROM THE JOURNAL OF VIDARR – EXCERPT ONE</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">To the one who seeks to resolve my mistakes, seek my blade. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Buried under the glittering mountain in the home of the Jotnar, you will find it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">But understand this, my kin. Should you find my blade you will also inherit my mistakes. And it may be improper on my part, but I hope you are strong enough to correct them. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">For all our sakes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Chapter 1: Unchained</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&lt;Jotunheimen Mountain Area, Norway, 1000 hours&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“*Helsikken*, what a night!” Arne Vidarsson was shivering in his tent, despite the layers of winter protection he was currently nestled under. He knew it would be bad, but a sudden dip to -25 degrees Celsius caught him off guard. While his arctic-rated gear kept him warm, the wind whipped his tent as the blizzard raged on. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Carefully, he got out of his sleeping bag and activated a small potassium heating pad. It may have been small, but it burned hot providing him with much needed heat. As he opened the flap of his tent, he was greeted with several feet of snow. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Good morning, mother nature.” He said with a hint of distaste. It was beautiful, yes, but dangerous. He shook his head, trying to push away his memories of the accident.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">With a resigned huff, he withdrew a small spade from his hiking pack. The snow was around three feet tall in front of the tent flap, and was densely packed. He knew that he needed to extract his tent and belongings from the snow lest they become wet, cold and soggy. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">After working for roughly thirty minutes, he reasoned that enough snow had been cleared around the tent. “There, that should be fine.” His stomach growled as his body reminded him of the fact that he still needed to eat. “Right. Breakfast. Can’t forget about that.” He took a ready-made hiker’s meal from his bag and a small burner. In a few minutes he had a steaming meal ready to eat. As he sat on his sleeping bag, eating the hot contents from the ceramic bowl he liked to listen to his travel radio to keep up-to-date on the events happening around the world. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The first channel he tuned into was BBC Radio International. &quot;And in the latest news, US President Germaine Haverford proposed a brand new economic reform bill that promises to allocate more funding towards national education, however this is raising controversy with …&quot; He swallowed and washed his mouth with fresh-brewed coffee. “Alright, let&#039;s see what else is there...” He idly thought as he switched the channel to a local radio station, which had ended its news segment and had started playing the latest in trendy music. After a few more idle flips, he switched off the radio and packed up his belongings after washing down his meal with some water. He reasoned he was closer to Glittertind now, seeing the mountain peak rise above the rest in the distance. And if that were the case, he was getting closer to the location listed in the journal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">After he stuffed the sleeping bag back into its carrying sack, he brought out the old leather-bound journal as well as his own notebook. Opening both, he thumbed through the pages of Old Norse runes and compared them to his own notes. While he had earned his degree in Nordic Anthropology, this journal was proving to be a difficult contender to decrypt. For one, it was written in Elder Fuuthark, a precursor of “modern” runic languages utilized by the Germanic people. References and resources to translate it were few and far between, but he had made some headway, enough to translate a critical portion of the text. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He brought out a red ink pen and circled a few translated lines as he reflected on the journal. It had been handed down from father to son in his family for generations now with no clear origin point. At one point, it had been his great-grandfather, then his grandfather’s, and lastly his father’s item before it came to his ownership. Relatives called the journal cursed, that it brought misfortune to the man who owned it. While it was a silly superstition, there may have been some truth to it as every one of its owners went mad with wanderlust at some point in their life.  His grandfather abandoned his family one day to explore the wilderness, never to return. His father tried actively to resist this strange “call of the wild” yet Arne remembered how he took him, as a child, on hike after hike in the forests of Norway. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A gust of wind lifted the tent flap, sending bone-chilling wind into the small shelter. Arne shivered and blew into his exposed hands. He blinked hard to calm himself. His friends at the university always noted with irony that he was a chionophobic yet lived in one of the snowiest countries in the world. His fear of snow was deep-seated from the accident, but his passion for ancient Nordic history and his drive to unlock the mystery of the journal propelled him time and time again into the icy forests. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He gave his notes one last look-through, then brought out his map and compass, drawing out a path from his current location. The journal spoke of something located in the “home of the Jotnar” along with the following instructions. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“In the shadow of Glittertind when Sunna reaches the highest peak in her never ending journey, turn your back on the mountain; Within a tomb glowing against the shadows; beyond a veil of false stars you will find stone harder than the flesh of the Jotun themselves. You shall not break through this but simply walk through if you are of like mind as I. There you shall uncover the regrets of my past and the curse I have laid for you.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The way the journal was describing a curse reminded him of the jests his friends made, and the comments made by his father as well. What if there was something driving his family to search in the wild? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Arne shut the journal and his notes, readied himself to step outside with map tucked safely away in his coat pocket. He stopped as he exited his tent, brief pangs of uncertainty ringing in his soul as he stared out into the snow-covered expanse. He shut his eyes to clear away his fears and turned his focus to stowing away his shelter. After all was put away, he began trekking.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">For an hour, the only sounds he heard were the whistling of the winter winds and the crunching of the snow underneath his boots. Gripping his map and compass as best he could he followed the path he laid out from translating the journal. It was nearly noon at this point, and the sun was practically overhead. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Okay, Glittertind is to the north. I’m facing one-hundred and fifty degrees away from it…so now what?” Arne looked around in the shadow of the great mountain. “There’s nothing but rocks and snow…hold on.” There was something glistening on the wall nearly sixty meters away. Glittering without any source of light. Arne picked up his pace until he came face to face with a rocky outcropping leading to a tunnel, lined with phosphorescent lichen in the shadows of the cave. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“False stars in the darkness, huh?” Arne switched on his flashlight. “Well, my translation is accurate at least.” He carefully made his way through the damp cave, holding onto the slick, cold walls as best he could. His excitement grew as he delved deeper, feeling the slope of the cavern taking him ever more into the mountain. Excitement which grew as cave terminated in a dead end, exactly as the journal said. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Okay, there’s gotta be something here…maybe a loose rock?” His fingers probed the surface of the cold rock, finding nothing. Suddenly his fingers brushed against a ridge in the stone. Fumbling with his knife, Arne scratched away at the moss growing on the rock to reveal a strange set of runes. “What’s this…wolf?” He asked himself. “Why would there be the rune for ‘wolf’ be here? There’s another set here…’prison’, huh. Wolf Prison.” Unable to find anything else on the rock face, Arne slumped down against the rock to think. “I’m missing something, I need to ‘be of like mind’ as the author of the journal.” He scratched the blonde stubble on his chin as he removed his scarf to breathe a little better. “False stars…the author wrote about this cavern for a reason. If I were trying to hide something I’d want it to be a little hard to find. But I’m the one designing the security, so I’d know the way around it.” An idea struck him, and he reached up to his head light to turn it off. Darkness flooded the cavern, and the soft fluorescent glow of the moss around him became more prevalent. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see that the moss was gathering around one of the corners of the wall. Leaning towards it, Arne could feel cold wind brushing against his face, which he wouldn’t’ve felt with his scarf on. Arne felt the rock, and felt that it was loose. This stone was placed here to cover up something. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Pulling it away, he found a small passage lined with the same kind of moss. Switching on his light again he entered the crawlspace, moving slowly through. Eventually he emerged in an atrium like room, with snow falling through a gap in the ceiling. Arne noted that this room was deliberately carved, with runes lining the walls and the floor. But his eyes grew wide at what was at the center of the room: a glistening golden hunting knife jammed into the stone floor. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Arne walked towards it, struck by its beauty. Tentatively he grasped the handle and pulled. The blade came out of the rock easily, and while it looked golden the weight of the weapon did not reflect the material. It was heavy, easily five kilograms in his hand despite its size. Whoever used the weapon would need both strength and dexterity to use it as a knife. But what a weapon it was! </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“This had to have been forged during the Proto-Germanic era given the state of the rock around here…but it looks like it was made yesterday.” Arne marveled. His reflection was crisp in the blade, which was etched with more runes at the hilt. “Let’s see here…it’s a name.” Arne looked at the runes, the blinked a few times. “Vidar. Vidar?” This was a monumental find. He knew the myths well, about the Hunter, Vidar and how he slew the great Beast of the river Van. Given the knife’s age, and inherent strangeness…could it really be *the* knife he used to slay the beast?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“No, I need to keep a level head here, can’t get swept up in silly myths and fairy tales. I need my journal, need to make notes…” As he fumbled in his stuffy winter gear, the knife slipped from his hands and sliced easily through the layers of wool on his arm, barely missing his foot. Even though it was dropped from a height of a meter, its blade still sank into the stone floor as if passing through paper. Arne cursed and gripped his arm, checking the cut. The gash wasn’t deep but still enough for a steadily-seeping wound to form. As he brought out his emergency kit to patch himself up, he noticed a strange vibrating noise. As if a tuning fork had been struck. Looking around the room, he noticed the blade at his feet was oscillating rapidly. The droplets of blood near it vibrated along with the blade. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Arne’s hairs stood on end. Something was very wrong. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He backed up towards the wall of the cavern when a blinding light forced him to cover his eyes, followed by the bitter sting of cold. Despite him wearing layers on layers of winter gear, this cold wind seemed to chill his very soul. And with his eyes closed, Arne realized that he could hear breathing. Strained, harsh breathing. He opened his eyes, and his blood froze. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The room was covered in chains made of the same golden material. The harsh breathing was coming from the subject they were subduing, who was thrashing against her bonds in the center of the room where the knife originally stood rooted in place. She was…enormous. Her blue-grey fur was matted with wounds and scars, and it was covered with battle-scarred leather and iron armor fit for a warrior. Every time she struggled, it seemed like the mountain itself was shaking yet the golden chains did not budge. They wrapped around her legs, her waist, her wrists and even her muzzle, denying her to do anything but growl madly. Arne shook as he realized that the knife was no longer in the ground either, but now protruded from her left eye. Her remaining eye searched the room wildly, and then it fixed on him. Her growls grew more intense, and her sole eye seemed to smolder with hatred as it saw him. Without warning, a cold gale began to blow in the room. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Something clicked in Arne’s head. That rune on the wall wasn’t just for “wolf.” It used a specific shape, one with denotation reserved for writing about Old Gods. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The rune did not mean “wolf”. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It meant Fenrir.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Chapter 0.1 – Interlude</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&lt;The University of Tromsø - The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, Norway&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“So, let me get this straight…” McDouglass sets down his cup. “The Journal of Vidar was in your family for generations, and your entire family tree was affected by it?” Dr. Arne Vidarrson nodded. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“At the time, no member of my family understood the origin nor the significance of the journal. We just saw it as a priceless heirloom made even more valuable by its age. Honestly most of my ancestors just kept it around as financial insurance to sell to some museum for a pretty penny.” Arne took the book in his aged hands. “How foolish indeed.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">McDouglass has another question on his mind. “And you said that the journal led you to the knife, which released a faunae woman when you touched it?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Not when I touched it.” Arne pulls at his sweater’s cuff, revealing a thin scar. “It was my blood. The knife seemed to react to the blood of its’ master and undid the seal holding back-“</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Fenrir.” Henrietta completed his sentence. “You expect us to believe that you released a world-ending monster from millennia-long confinement?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“She wasn’t a monster.” Arne snapped, an edge coming into his voice. “She was a Fauane, much like you. And I don’t see how it’s hard to believe in her existence, seeing as stranger things have occurred with the Knife and whatever you’re finding in Egypt.” Arne set down his cup, now devoid of coffee. “Be skeptical all you want. We’re dealing with artifacts beyond scientific explanation. I don’t want to get into any theological or superstitious arguments here, but there are documented instances of objects and phenomena that we can’t explain, yet they exist and that the Foundation is actively searching for them.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">McDouglass folds his arms. “Sir, that’s some high-clearance information you’re privy to. Knowing even that much constitutes to a major data leak and-“ </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Arne waves him off. “Please. My children own the company you work for. And they’re the ones keeping me informed about what they find or what they develop. And who would come knocking for an old man in a frozen town? Competitors? Political rivals? Assassins? My children are doing well to keep me safe, especially after their mother passed.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He hung his head. “Let me continue with my explanation. I have a feeling that listening to what I have to say will answer more of your questions.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Chapter 2 – A Beast in Chains</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&lt;The Caverns Underneath Glittertind, Norway&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The she-wolf’s good eye was fixated on Arne. His blood was like ice in his veins, his fight-or-flight response defaulting to the oft-ignored third option: freeze. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The air was thick with the feeling of intense danger. One look at her and it was clear that she’d meant to do him harm. Another gust of wind buffeted him, pelting him with sleet. Arne shielded his face with his arms. This was a chamber underground, how could there be icy wind here? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The wind subsided somewhat, and Arne glanced up. The she-wolf was now still, and glowering at him with a chilling gaze. She had stopped thrashing in her chains, and was now motionless. “Did she calm down? No…” Arne’s eyes widened in fear and realization. “She’s like a predator waiting for its prey to move.” He noticed something else too, a low rumble. A cave in? The noise grew louder, and he realized it was her, growling into the binding chains around her muzzle. She flexed her arms slowly, testing out the limits of her restraints. As she did so, copper-colored blood wept out of her impaled left eye socket, droplets splattering on the ground. His own crimson blood still stained the blade as well, collecting into a single drop which ran down her cheek like a tear. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Arne watched the red bead make its way down the side of the muzzle. The wolfess herself seemed to be focused on it, following its journey by the sensation on her fur. Just as it reached the side of her mouth she sharply inhaled, allowing the droplet to pass between her teeth despite the chains forcing her mouth shut. She closed her good eye, and when it opened Arne could see a dangerous resolve in it. She flexed all muscles in her arms, and to her surprise and Arne’s horror, a single chain around her index finger snapped. Her eye darted in his direction as she pointed the finger in his direction. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">At her command, jagged splinters of ice erupted from the ground traveling at alarming speed towards the unfortunate explorer. Seeing the sharp ice rushing towards him, Arne panicked. “S-Stay away!” He grabbed the ice pick dangling at his waist and hurled it at the ice. The pick smashed through several icicles, but to Arne’s horror more erupted from beneath it. Despite looking like normal ice, the spikes pierced the hardened metal of the ice pick, fracturing it to pieces. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Arne nearly fell over in shock as his head spun. “Ice that breaks through metal? What the hell, what the hell!?” Arne glanced over at the Faunae woman, and even through her face and body were bound he could make a look of disgust in her eye. Her finger pointed to him again, the ice surging forward at her command. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Dodging the frozen spikes rising from the floor, Arne ducked and rolled away before getting to his feet. His eyes scanned the runes on the wall. He couldn’t translate them all, but two stood out at him. One clearly said “BLADE” and another close to it spelled out “IMPRISON”. She had appeared when his blood dripped onto the knife…maybe it could go the other way too? The plan he was brewing was completely idiotic, but it was either this or get skewered by ice. Taking a deep breath and closing his eyes, Arne oriented himself facing the wolf-woman and charged forwards. He tried not to think about the otherworldly chill in the air passing through his layers of clothing, nor about the sounds of ice rushing towards him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He just ran, and kept running until he slammed into something furry. Something furry, yet built like a brick wall wearing leather armor. The wall let out a surprised grunt and he stumbled back, opening his eyes. The wolf was clearly taken by surprise by his actions, glowering at him with a hint of confusion as to what he was doing. Arne, however, wasn’t going to let an opening like this get away from him. He grabbed the hilt of the knife and began reciting the same word over and over in his head. Sounding out the extinct language in his mind, focusing on its structure and consonants. Imprison. Imprison. Imprison. Imprison…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Imprison!” With a roar the wolf’s eye went wide as she began struggling again in vain, enveloped by the chains glowing with golden light as they and she appeared to evaporate back into the blade. It hung motionless in the air for a moment before clattering to the ground hilt-first. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Arne stumbled backwards in shock, collapsing onto the ground. “What…the hell…was that?” He carefully prodded the blade with his remaining ice pick causing it to spin around on its side. Realizing that the blade was no longer reacting to anything, he slowly picked it up and placed it in the broken ice pick’s pouch. Seeing that the weapon was secure, Arne took a moment to compose himself. An eerie silence hung in the chamber, accenting the cracking ice around him. A sheet of sleet on the ceiling fell, shattering next to the hapless young man.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He bolted up to his feet. “I need to get out of here. Right now.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">-----------------------------------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Arne glanced at the golden knife laying on the passenger’s seat. He’d made it out of the cave, and over the course of a day and a half made it back to his SUV parked at a local scenic lookout. His 1990 Land Rover wasn’t the pinnacle of reliability but it crossed terrain like no other vehicle could, scampering over rocks and trudging through snow banks. Plus, it was cheap. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Damn, the snow is really picking up. I hate snow so much…” Arne muttered under his breath as he hit the wipers. Ever since he picked up the knife in the cave the winds outside had picked up, bringing more flurries with it. To make matters worse it had been getting colder as well. Arne pressed down on the accelerator just as the car hit a pothole in the road that was concealed with snow. “Damn it!” Arne swerved the vehicle as it began to slide on the slick road, causing the knife to slide around. Its edge passed seamlessly through the plastic of the center console, no harder than it had cut through his arm. Swearing, Arne picked up the knife and drove it into the seat. The upholstery was ruined but at least the knife was no longer loose in the cabin. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A few more days of driving, and Arne finally arrived at his family’s cabin outside of Tromsø. It had been in the family for generations, and now it belonged to him alone. His camping equipment was the first thing brought into the house, the bulky items stacked precariously in his arms as he walked towards the storage shed behind the house. His cut arm hadn’t healed up completely, and the tension from the load and dryness from the cold caused the scab to split. Arne grimaced, feeling the pain from the re-opened wound. Holding his sleeve, he walked back to the Land Rover and carefully extracted the blade from the seat cushion. He held the pommel gingerly, keeping the edge facing away from his body. Once inside, he set it down on the dinner table and sat in front of it, arms crossed against his chest. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">From his coat pocket, Arne fished out the journal and stared at the name on the leather cover. In runes was a single name: “Vidar”. He long thought it was some kind of pseudonym, but now? He grappled with the thought that somehow, an ancient Nordic legend was intertwined with his family history. Arne shivered, his breath wafting in front of him. Had it always been this cold in the house? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I’d better start up the furnace. That’ll warm this place up.” Opening a cupboard, the young Norwegian fished out a burlap sack of charcoal. Taking a few lumps, he opened an old cast-iron furnace in the corner of the kitchen and popped them inside. With some lighter fluid and a match, Arne was able to get some heat spreading through the room. The chill in the air lifted somewhat, and soon he was comfortable enough to remove his coat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Arne began flipping through the pages, stopping one particular one showing circles of runic text. “These are the same patterns that were in the cave…” He glanced over at the knife. The name “VIDAR” was clearly etched into the golden blade in ancient Norse runes. He grabbed a store-made sandwich from the fridge and sat down with the journal and blade next to each other. “The runes here on this page and the ones in that room were the same, I’m sure of it. And I swear I saw those chains dig into specific rune sets here, and here…” He took a bite out of the sandwich in his hand, eating as he mulled over his findings. “Okay, assuming I wasn’t hallucinating from a fear-induced high, there was a very angry Faunae woman who appeared when I got my blood on the blade of this thing.” He frowned, his brow furrowing in concentration. He was intrigued now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He grabbed a small notepad on the counter and began jotting things down. He wanted to try and see if his blood would affect the blade again, but he couldn’t just summon a crazed and possibly murderous mythological being into his house. At least not without proper preparation. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Chapter 3: A Guest In Chains</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&lt;The Outskirts of Tromsø, Norway&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Phew, okay, that should be good enough.” Arne sat down on the wooden floor, catching his breath. He’d spent the greater part of the day clearing things out of the old one-room guesthouse behind the cabin. It was used as a storage shed before, but he’d taken the time to move everything in it to either the tool shed a few feet away or into the house. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">His hands left marks on his jeans where they’d been resting; his palms and fingers were coated in a layer of chalk. Flipping open the journal, he looked around the room to make sure his handiwork was correct. Over the course of several days he’d painstakingly written down each rune on the page, starting from the center of the room outward. Scrawls of ancient Norse were drawn on the floors, walls, and even the door. Arne clapped his hands together several times to get rid of the chalk before rising to retrieve the knife. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Carefully he placed it in the center of the room, and from his coat pocket he procured a medical lancet. “Not too sure how much blood it needs, but a drop is a good place to start off as any.” Pressing his thumb against the opening of the lancet, he felt the ant-like bite of the small needle as it broke through his skin. A small droplet of blood began to ooze from his thumb, and taking care to avoid the blade’s edge he dragged his thumb down the side of the knife. A thin red line was left behind, and all he needed to do now was observe. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It was slow at first. Patches of light appearing on the blade, spreading upwards until the entire knife was glowing with an intense light. Arne backed away, shielding his face as chains burst forward from the knife, which was now impossible to look at. When Arne opened his eyes, he immediately regretted it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">--------------------------------------------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hate. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Every fiber of her being thrummed with hate. Hate for the heavens. Hate for the world. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She was death incarnate, the apocalypse made manifest. Yet here she remained, bound by the accursed magic woven into the blade jutting out of her eye. It hurt, oh, it hurt. She could feel the hunting knife embedded within her skull, piercing the divine flesh inside. To a mortal such an injury would be a deathblow, but to her? It was a mere nuisance. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">After all, she was the embodiment of the end. To end her would be a sin against natural order itself. No, instead the continuous agony only fueled her rage. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She tried to move herself, but found herself still bound by lock and chain. And unlike before, these chains were fresh. Her good eye moved then to the mortal in front of her. She sniffed the air, one of the last free actions afforded to her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hm, there was no doubt now. This was the same mortal who released her back into the physical realm of Midgard. The knife had held her for so long, she was beginning to forget the feeling of being made manifest. Looking at him…made her even more frustrated. A single mortal as her jailer? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What an insult. Her rage began to swell further, and then she felt it. The world outside still heeded her call. Yes, even if she couldn’t bring this world to its knees herself, she felt some grim satisfaction in the fact that her influence would do it for her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The mortal began to speak, in some strange and alien tongue. The language was ugly and coarse, nothing like that of the Divine Fuuthark she knew. The longer he spoke, the more it began to annoy her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">----------------------------------------------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Holy shit.” Arne swore. “Hooooly shit.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">His heart beat rapidly in his chest as he came to terms with his situation. Just like before in the cave, the knife exploded in a flash of light, and when the brightness died down a very large and very angry wolf woman had manifested. The golden chains anchoring her to the center of the wooden cabin lodged themselves in the runes around the room at specific points. “Guess that proves my theory, this pattern really was meant to help in sealing…her.” He paced the room, talking to himself. “Okay, I need to calm down. Where’s that page, I swear I marked it down. Ah, wait, here we go.” Arne swallowed and flipped to a page marked with a post-it note, and began scribbling down a set of runes on his own notebook. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Okay, now for the hard part.” He looked at the wolfess, who returned his gaze with a particularly murderous one. He gulped hard, even restrained she looked capable of killing. His breathing began to speed up despite his efforts to remain calm as he noticed a slight frost beginning to form around her, coating the floor. Arne began walking forward doing his best to ignore the fact that it was cold enough to see his breath despite the furnace running, or the snarl that was coming from her throat. It began to dawn on him that his initial estimate regarding her size was a bit off. On her knees as she was now, she was nearly looking into his eyes. If she were standing tall, she’d easily be around 3 meters in height. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Stopping just out of the final circle of runes, Arne held up the scribbled note. He’d written down the same runes as he’d seen in the cave, which he began noticing in the journal as well. On seeing the runes, the she-wolf’s eye narrowed and looked at him, almost in a demanding way. As if he’d asked her an obvious question to which she took annoyance to. Arne stepped back slowly. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Okay. She’s probably, most likely the Fenrir of legend. But…let’s see here. If I wanted to ask her “what’s your name” I’d probably write it down like this.” He wrote, to the best of his knowledge, a simple question asking if her name really was Fenrir. Holding up the paper, the wolfess growled angrily, in a manner that suggested offense. Looking at the paper, Arne realized that a single line on one of the runes was off. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">----------------------------------------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The mortal had written down “You are Fenrir, not.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Was he asking to be frozen alive? How dare he mock her! Fenrir shook the chains more furiously but they restrained her well. A bolt of pain in her left orbit caused her to shudder slightly, stoking her anger even more. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She was still bound, however, and no amount of thrashing would be able to break these renewed chains. Simmering, she opted instead to formulate battle plans in her head for her eventual escape. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">-----------------------------------------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Oh dear. Judging by her reaction to that, he must’ve insulted her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Okay, okay. Um…” An idea came to him, but it was wholly idiotic. Still, acting kind towards her might at least show her that he meant no harm and wasn’t a threat. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Well, he wasn’t a threat either way. If the legends were true she’d slain Odin, king of the Nordic Gods when she initiated Ragnarok. If a god couldn’t kill her, a human like himself wasn’t anything more than an insect to her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Insect or not, kindness does go a long way.” He mumbled to himself as he ran back to the house. Shuffling around in his camping chest, he found what he was looking for: a first-aid hiking kit, filled with emergency medical supplies. Everything from pain medication to sutures, gauze pads and disinfectant. In particular, he kept a morphine auto-injector handy in case he suffered a very, very serious accident on the hiking trails. He wasn’t sure how resistant to pain his new guest was, but judging from the fact that she had a knife sticking out of her left eye and was still thrashing about with alarming focus, probably very high. He shook his head and put it back in the kit, picking up the suturing kit and blood clot spray instead. As Arne headed out, he wrote some more runes in his notebook, this time taking his time to make sure the grammar was as correct as possible. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Gah, was it this cold outside?” The moment Arne stepped outdoors he was greeted by a flurry of snow and icy wind. Snow was everywhere, covering the ground and trees in a blanket of white. “It wasn’t this bad ten minutes ago, and nowhere on the forecast were there any warnings of increased snowfall today. Man, this sucks.” He walked quickly, trying not to let the snow unnerve him any more than he already was. While he had certified himself in emergency first-aid, this was the first time he’d be preforming it on someone. Much less, a violently angry apocalypse goddess. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He carefully stepped back into the cabin. “H-hi. Um, I’m not a threat!” He held up his hands, showing he wasn’t armed or meaning to engage her in combat. Fenrir merely stared angrily at him. “Yeah, you probably don’t understand me all that well…” Arne thought for a while, forming the words in his head. He’d only heard one person speak Elder Fuuthark and that was at a guest presentation at the university. He was about to attempt it himself, using only his research notes and the documents he’d studied. Arne looked Fenrir in her eye. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I am not threat. I wish healing, you.” His optimism wavered slightly when he saw no discernible effect in Fenrir’s demeanor. Okay, maybe actions would speak louder than words. “Thou still.” Ignoring her increasing growl as he approached her, he quickly unpacked the sterile gauze and readied the pain relief and blood clot sprays. “Right. Yank and grab. Yank and grab.” Arne chanted in his mind as he gripped the handle of the blade. Fenrir attempted to thrash and snap her jaws, but the chains binding her held her fast. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“One…two…three!” He pulled the knife, and it slid out of her head with terrifying ease. Fenrir roared with pain before settling down into rapid, labored panting. “You got this…you got this…step one done, now step two-“Arne’s self-assurance wavered when he saw two hemispheres of ice on the ground. Ice that was rapidly melting and yet, looked like someone had split an ice sculpture of an eyeball in two. He was also made aware of a dripping sound behind him, a steady tap-tap-tap. “Step two, step two, step two.” He repeated that mantra to himself as he gathered his medical supplies. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Sure enough, the tapping sound was that of Fenrir’s copper blood dripping onto the wooden floor. Arne hurried over and sprayed some antiseptic onto an absorbent pad. He pressed it against the weeping socket, and to his surprise the flow of blood was already beginning to abate. Fumbling around with the gauze and a pocket knife to cut it with, he circled her head several times to secure the pad in place. Now all that was left was to cut the gauze and-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Ow!” Damn, his hands were shaking and he nicked his thumb with the knife. He quickly tied up the gauze, then used a small bit to dab away at his own blood. As he brought his hand down, he felt a tug on the bandage. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Fenrir had gripped the loose fabric as it passed by a gap in the chains binding her muzzle, and now it was lodged between her side teeth. Arne gasped and let go of the bloodstained bandage, watching Fenrir draw it into her mouth and swallow it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">--------------------------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Fenrir tasted the mortal’s blood. It was metallic and sour, and completely unpleasant. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">When she was spawned into the world, her creator wove into her being a set of conditions. One of which was that as she felled foes by claw, teeth or ice, she could imbibe their sanguine essence to learn their knowledge and skills. The more she killed, the deadlier a warrior she’d be. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She forced the fabric down her throat, processing the information that came with it. It wasn’t much, but she now knew her captor’s name, and the foul language that he spoke. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">If he dared mock her in her native tongue, then she will lash out in his own. Before breaking free of these chains and killing him, of course. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">With that decided, she began to yell.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">-------------------------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Arne looked at his “patient” in shock as she stared him down, thrashing and spewing forth what he could only surmised as muffled hate-laden speech. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As Fenrir ranted, he glanced down at the golden knife on the floor. Back in the cave, when he told it to seal Fenrir, it did so. Maybe…maybe it could control certain sets of chains?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Careful now, okay.” Arne grabbed the handle with care, inspecting the inscription on either side. “Let’s try this out. Ahem!” He cleared his throat several times in preparation to pronounce the strange and ancient language. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Mouth. Unseal!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The chains around Fenrir’s muzzle went slack and slid off, clattering onto the floor before disappearing. She looked at them in shock as they faded before looking up again, her head still bound from turning. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Talk. Free. Thou?” Arne spluttered, butchering that sentence. Fenrir growled in response. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Speak not my tongue, mortal. I shall escape these bindings, and then you shall regret the day you brought me back to thine world.” She then launched into a vitriol-laden tirade. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Arne was shocked. Firstly because Fenrir was now cursing him in perfect, if antiquated Norwegian. And secondly because he at least expected a thank you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Chapter 4: The Beast of the River Van</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Damn you, mortal! How dare you attempt to confine me here with these…” Fenrir strains against her chains, which hold fast. “How dare you chain me with these bindings? You son of a whore! Come, I’ll rend you apart once I free myself, along with all else in this forsaken world!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Arne backed up a single step, taken back by the stream of profanity coming from the angry wolfess’ mouth. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You…speak Norwegian?” Fenrir spat on the floor in response. “Every syllable that comes out of my throat is like vomiting rocks. Ignorant men-folk, is this what you’ve perverted the language of the gods into?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">‘Okay, calm down. I’ve got to approach this rationally.’ Arne thoughts raced as he stroked the stubble on his chin. ‘I’m fairly sure the evidence points to the obvious, but I need to make sure.’ He looked at her, who had quieted down in a simmering barely-controlled rage. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You…are Fenrir? THE Fenrir?” In response to the question, Fenrir bared her fangs. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">‘Oh great, here we go again…’ Arne braced himself for another round of tirades.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“It seems rocks are not limited to your language, human, for it seems thy head is filled with them too. Your voice betrays disbelief; I sense fear in you as well.” As much as she could, Fenrir sat up straight with vicious pride. “Just as well, for I am indeed your reckoning. I am Fenrir, daughter of Loki and the harbinger of Ragnarök.” Arne simply stared at her, formulating a response in his mind. “Um, right. My name is Arne. Arne Mous Vidarsson, I’m 26 years old and I’m studying anthropology at…” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The air temperature dropped a few degrees as Fenrir’s eyes narrowed, her lips curling into a murderous snarl. “Vidarrson? Do you mean my jailor, a mere mortal, is a spawn of Vidar?” The chains binding her arms were pulled taught as she attempted to pull out of them, eliciting a snarl from her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“A divine mockery, that’s what this is.” Fenrir ceased struggling, and let her muscles go slack. The chains however remained taut, suspending her arms to either side. Arne could see a flicker of some other emotion; other than the rage she had so prevalently displayed before. For a moment, she looked almost…tired. She raised her head, and her eyes refocused with an icy glare onto the hunting knife within his grip. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Why are you waiting? Get it over with and spare me whatever tatters of dignity I still have left.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I, uh, excuse me?” Arne blinked, trying to understand what she wanted. Fenrir growled in frustration. “Are you slow in the head, mortal? You bear the blood of Vidar. He failed in his destiny to slay me, and so that destiny falls unto you now.” As much as she could, she straightened her back and pushed her chest out. “Strike me in the heart, and claim victory that you rightly should, hero.” Arne felt like she nearly spat out that last word in distain. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He glanced down at the knife in his hands, his reflection looking back at him through the polished gold blade. His eyes turned towards Fenrir, defiantly staring at him, waiting. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I’m not a killer.” He muttered, and immediately he felt the room’s temperature drop. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“What did you say?” Fenrir hissed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I won’t do it. I…I can’t do it! What, you think I can just take this thing and stab you with it? I’m just a history student, not a hunter or soldier or whatever!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Fenrir cursed in her native tongue. “A coward. You and your ancestors are all cowards! I curse your bloodline, Vidarrson! I curse your bloodline for ruination!” Arne took several steps back at her outburst until he heard something, he didn’t expect from her; a harsh giggle. It first came in between growls, but then became a steady staccato in her voice. “You…you have no idea, do you? As long as I remain, I will accomplish my goals. It doesn’t matter whether I remain trapped here like some chained cur or if I am let free to finish what I began.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Arne gripped the blade’s handle. “What do you mean by that?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You deny me a warrior’s death. So, I deny you truth, son of Vidar.” She said, flashing a wicked smile. “On the day of my defeat, I will answer your question with my last breath.” Unable to take anymore, Arne wished that she would stop talking. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And the Hunter’s Knife responded. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Brilliant gold chains branched off from the ones around her arms and wound themselves around her muzzle. Unable to speak, she continued to growl despite being muffled by chains, locking eyes with Arne as he backed out of the shack and into the cold winter night. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Arne’s mind was racing as he trudged back through the howling winds. Despite the house being only a few meters away from the shed, the trek seemed to take ages as he hastily retreated from the monster in the shed. He flung open the back door and slammed it behind him, as if she had somehow broken free and was after him. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He pulled a chair from the kitchen and crashed down onto it, staring into space as he began to process everything that had happened in the last hour. Somehow, he was able to recreate an ancient seal written in a long-extinct language. Somehow, he was able to free an ancient deity, and not just any deity but the Beast of the River Van itself…or rather herself. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He furrowed his brow. While he was familiar with the Poetic Edda and its texts, there had never been any mention that Fenrir was a Faunae woman. Most books described Fenrir as an unintelligent, feral wolf, while the fancier prose gave the imagery of an icy, violent abstract force destroying the gods and plunging the world into Ragnarök. Perhaps that was the result of information being distorted over time? Or was it done deliberately when the legends were written, to de-anthropomorphize her into something mindlessly evil? He took out his journal and began making notes about what he’d seen, summarizing everything he’d done and the results. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">His mind’s train of thought had just been launched on its tracks. He got up and grabbed several books, some journals on ancient Nordic artifacts and some from his childhood, tales from the Poetic Edda and other Norse legends and set to work. He poured over the tomes, marking things with a red pen and noting down every phrase or mention he could to Vidar, the Hunting Knife and Fenrir herself. So deep was he in his concentration that it took the rumble of his stomach to remind him that he needed to stop and eat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Damn, didn’t realize it was this late already…I think I have some leftovers that I can finish off.” He pushed away his book and shuffled over to the kitchen. Opening the fridge, he retrieved the plastic container holding a stew he made the night before and popped it into the microwave. As it began to heat up, he recalled that he had a whole chicken in the freezer bin. As he pondered what to make out of it, a thought struck him. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Food and drink had long since been signs of peace and stability, and even more so as offerings to gods. While Fenrir wasn’t the type to give out any blessings, maybe she’d appreciate it? At least, it would show that he wasn’t a threat to her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Still, he was putting himself at great risk just by letting her exist. If the legends were true then she was the herald for Ragnarök. Still, bound as she was, he couldn’t simply murder her in cold blood. He chastised himself for thinking such thoughts. Better to extend an olive branch rather than a blade’s edge. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I wonder if gods even get hungry…ah well.” He quickly dressed it with some dry spice rub he’d bought from the supermarket in town and put it in the oven. “I can wait an hour before I eat.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Around 45 minutes later, a savory smell drifted through the kitchen as Arne covered the freshly-baked chicken in foil. He grabbed a few utensils and an insulated lunchbox, packing it with the chicken and some soup in a thermos. “All right, a dinner date with a murderous she-wolf goddess dressed in Nordic combat armor. Romantic.” He mused to himself. Still, it was undeniable that she’d be his guest for the foreseeable future. Might as well try to eat dinner and get to know her better. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Neatly arranging everything and adding a few napkins for good measure he grabbed his coat and went back out into the icy night. Snow crunching underneath his feet, his breath came out in wisps as he approached the door to the guesthouse. His fingers paused over the doorknob as he took a breath before opening the door. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Fenrir’s eyes were closed, but her ears swiveled to the creak of the door’s hinges. She silently opened her one eye and stared at her visitor, unable to vocalize thanks to the binding chains around her muzzle. Arne set down the lunchbox and grabbed the Hunting Knife. Fenrir’s eye narrowed as she turned her focus to the blade, her breathing quickening slightly. Arne heard this and took a moment to look at the knife, wondering if her reaction was fear…or eagerness. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He took a moment to compose his thoughts; the blade would respond only to raw emotion or vocalized commands in Elder Fuuthark. He parsed the words together in his mind, a simple short phrase that would undo some of the bindings. With the words in place he spoke in the long-dead language. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Loosen chain – mouth.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">At once, the bindings around Fenrir’s muzzle fell away, clattering to the ground before vanishing in small flashes of light.  Fenrir stretched her jaw before speaking. “So, mortal, have you come to fulfill your destiny? Or are you yet insisting that you keep me here like some sort of trophy?” She glowered at him as he set down the red Coleman lunchbox onto a small wooden table on the side of the room. Arne kept the knife down and opened the container, extracting his thermos and the cooked chicken. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I thought you might like something to eat, I mean, it’s really not much but you’re probably hungry right?” He undid the foil wrap, letting the herbal aroma of the cooked poultry waft through the room. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Holding it and some plastic utensils in his hand, he carefully walked closer to the chained goddess. Every step he took, the air became more and more chilled until his breath was becoming visible as he stood in front of her. He was reminded of her height when, even kneeling down she was about eye-level with him. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Fenrir looked at him, then the chicken, and then back to him. “Are you mocking me?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“What? No, I’m being serious. I made this for you, you know.” He gestured to her with the cooked bird. Fenrir’s eye remained locked on him. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her eye flicked down to the meal again and then back up. “Food. You, a mortal, are offering me, a god…food?” Her tone was still angry, but now with a hint of confusion. ‘She’s trying to deny it, but she’s interested.’ Arne thought to himself.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Look, I don’t have any interest in hurting you. Like I said before I’m a scholar rather than a soldier.” He unscrewed the cap off the thermos, and filling it with tomato soup made the night before. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Pray tell, how am I supposed to eat this…thing? My arms are bound, the chains on my neck preventing me from bowing my head. You make this thing that you pass off as “food” and then bring it to me, unable to make the slightest movement, just to taunt me further.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Oh, right. He hadn’t thought of that. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I could…uh. Hm.” He put his spoon down, considering his options. “I could feed you, if you want.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Fenrir took offense to that, baring her fangs. “If you so much as even attempt to do that, I’ll freeze your arm.” Arne frowned, based on her control over temperature and ice, she very well could despite being restrained. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Okay then. How about this?” He picked up the Knife again, and spoke to it. “Restraints, arms, loosen.” Instantly the gold chains suspending her arms to either side fell slack with her arms following them. She breathed deep, rotating them, and Arne could see powerful muscles straining against the leather under-sections of the plate armor. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Then she stood up, and Arne’s blood ran cold. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her head was nearly brushing the ceiling as she brought herself up to her full height. At a little over 3 meters she towered over him. Fenrir took one deep breath, her chest unrestrained for the first time in years, her eyes closed. Then without warning she launched herself at him, claws bared. Arne yelped and, in his mortal, fear the Knife reacted, and new chains were released from the glyphs on the walls in response. 	</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">They wrapped themselves around Fenrir’s body, locking her in place. Arne slowly opened his eyes to see a hand with black-tipped claws mere centimeters from his head. The chains began to retreat into the rune circles, phasing into them, as Fenrir was dragged back to the center circle. They tightened further, forcing her to kneel once more. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You…why…” Arne croaked breathlessly as he stopped hyperventilating. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Only a fool releases a prisoner alone without a guard. I saw my freedom and saw that you were weak. If you do not have the strength to complete your duty, I will complete my own given the chance.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You mean Ragnarök, don’t you?” Arne got back to his feet. “That’s your duty, right.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yes, mortal. I am the harbinger of your world’s end. The purpose of my existence is to end yours.” Her tone was hostile, but it bore little malice. Instead it was repeated almost matter-of-factly, as if she believed that and only that. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">An awkward silence filled the air. Every fiber of Arne’s being was telling him to get up and run, but something yet persisted in him. For some reason that baffled him, he wanted to stay. And so, he sat back down in front of his thermos, and picked up the knife again. With more care in his grammar, he loosened the restraints on Fenrir’s arms slightly, enough for her to reach down to the floor and pick up the meal he’d left her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">This caught Fenrir by surprise. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“…What are you doing?” She tested out her range of movement, observing the new movement capable to her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“If I’m going to play the role of a warden, I’m not letting my prisoner go hungry.” He imbibed a spoonful of his soup. “If you’re going to end the world then I guess I do need to stop you…so I’ll do as you ask. But before that, I want you to help me.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She raised her eyebrow in surprise. “Help you?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“My ancestor, Vidar, left a journal. I can’t read it well since Elder Fuuthark is a lost language. But you speak it fluently. Help me translate it and I’ll end you, just like you asked.” She snorted. “Hmph. A scholar to the end then. Fine, as long as you uphold your end of the bargain as well. If I cannot end this world, there is no reason for me to exist.” She reached down and grabbed the chicken whole, biting into it and tearing away a chunk. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">For a moment, her expression softened as she tasted the herbs and spices. Arne was quick to catch it. “It’s not much, but it’s enough to bring out the more savory flavors of the meat. Do you like it?”  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her expression hardened again as she swallowed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“…Acceptable.”</div></li></ol>        </div>

&lt;The University of Tromsø - The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, Norway&gt;

It was a beautiful day outside. The snow had stopped falling, giving way to a warm Norwegian sun shining across the land. Of course, warm was relative when you were a staff member in the northernmost university in the world. 
The professor stood up from his oaken desk and checked his watch. The coffee maker quietly bubbled in the corner of his office. With a satisfied grunt, he straightened his cuff after noticing that it was slightly askew. Gripping the side of the desk for support, he reached out to his walking stick. He was only 65 and his hip *just* started giving him some trouble, so it really wasn’t necessary. However, the grandson who gave it to him was very proud of making it himself, and how could he deny such eager puppy-dog eyes? 
Half-past noon. His guest should be arriving soon. 

A representative from the Vanagandr-Mous Foundation, who apparently needed to talk to him about some historical writings regarding a “lost” city in Egypt. Of course, the professor really knew what that man was coming here to discuss. There were better places than the city of Tromsø to discuss ancient Egyptian history. 

He rapped his cane on the legs of the coffee table as he walked by it, the jolt activating his “internet assistant” and its holographic projector. In its idle state, it began scrolling through some pictures that he saved on it. He smiled as he saw his seventh birthday, then a picture with his flustered wife, and finally a picture of his ten children, then all rambunctious Faunae wolf-cubs. Standing next to him was his wife, a head and a half taller than him. ‘Hm. Not bad for a 180 centimeter-tall twenty-nine year old.’ He thought. His eyes come to rest on a large hunting knife, resting behind a thick glass case. His reflection was clear in the golden blade, between the old Nordic runes engraved in the flat of the knife. Just looking at the blade brought mixed feelings. He owed a lot to it, and it had also taken much from him. 

*KNOCK KNOCK*

“Ah,” he thought. His guest had arrived. 

“Yes, come in. The door is unlocked.” 

The door opened, allowing a smartly-dressed human man and Faunae woman inside. The lapel of his suit had a large metal VF pin on it, the logo of the Vanagandr-Mous Foundation. 

“Dr. Vidarsson? My name is Roland McDouglass.” Ronald extended a hand which the professor shook. “And I’m Henrietta Anderson.” The Oryx woman extended a hand as well, and on closer inspection of her features the professor noticed that a silver Vanagandr-Mous Foundation ring adorned one of her horns.   “We’re historians with the Vanagandr-Mous Foundation’s Ancient Culture Research division.” She gestured to her partner. “The Foundation sent us to you for consultation regarding some archeological data we need clarification on.”
“They want a free consultation, hm? I should take the cut for this from their allowance.” The man chuckled to himself as he realized the confused looks his guests were wearing. “Ahem. I trust the journey here wasn’t too hard? It’s not often we get guests from America here.” 

“Not at all, Doctor. I must say, compared to New York the Norwegian countryside is a breath of fresh air. And I mean that literally and figuratively.” Ronald laughs at his own jest as Henrietta rolls her eyes. “If you want to get serious, McDouglass, lets show the good professor those peculiar hieroglyphs regarding our dig site in Egypt.” She raised her briefcase to the table, moving aside the holographic projector which turned off.  “We at the Foundation think that we’ve found something rather interesting down there regarding a potential discovery of a new lost ‘wonder of the world’ and we need your help in affirming the accuracy of our translation team’s notes.” 

Professor Vidarsson raises a hand, interrupting the young man. “Please, before we dive into formalities may I offer you some coffee? Or do you prefer tea?”

McDouglass smiles. “Coffee is fine, thanks. You can keep it black, I don’t particularly like cream or sugar in it.” 

“Hm, that’s the opposite of how she liked it.” The professor mused, remembering the first time his late wife tried to drink coffee. 

“I’m sorry, did you say something?” The Oryx’s ears perk up in response to his murmur.  

Vidarsson grimaced, unintentionally letting the past get to him again. “Don’t mind me, just an old man reminiscing about days gone by. Would you like some coffee too?” The Oryx woman shook her head. 

“Get a grip. It’s been nearly ten years since you did the deed. And she wanted you to do it.” He thought to himself as his brow furrowed.  Gingerly he placed down two porcelain cups filled with the bitter, dark liquid on the table. As McDouglass requested his cup was left untouched as Vidarsson added some milk and a sugar cube to his. After taking a sip, he was ready and focused to parse through the documents, fishing his bifocals from his suit pocket.

“Now then, let me see your dossier. I’ll try to give any input I can.” 

A few hours go by as the old man studied the documents. Dr. Vidarsson noticed that his guests would occasionally keep glancing at the golden hunting knife behind him. After some time, he became tired of their lustful eyes; their mind obviously on something else other than the pages before him. He grunted, jabbing his finger at a line of hieroglyphs, snapping the other two’s attention fully on the papers. 

“These are very interesting hieroglyph patterns. Honestly nothing documented in the notes I’m familiar with matches any of these from any of the periods of ancient Egypt. Who compiled these?” 

McDouglass rifled through his notepad. “It was a recent hire, a graduate student working on his doctorate. He found them at a dig site that he triangulated after picking up on clues laid out on several ancient scrolls that were overlooked by others. It’s funny, really. It all began with certain myths that spread throughout the region during the early centuries, around 200-600 BC. Something to do with talks of a strange library that dwarfed even the Library of Alexandria, and an artifact that would put the wealth of most nations to shame.”

“Artifact?” The professor leaned in, curious as to what the man had to say.

“Yes. Supposedly, it was a large obelisk made of solid gold. Apparently this city enshrined the thing in a pool in the city center. Of course, no evidence of this city exists, only trace mentions from texts scattered around the Middle East and Anatolia regions. But from that, he was able to triangulate a dig site where apparently they…found something. A box of scrolls and parchment books. That’s where these images I’m showing you now come from. They think that these show the location of something very important. I wanted a second opinion, so I came here.”  

Dr. Vidarsson raises an eyebrow. “Really? That’s quite impressive. What exactly do they think they’ll find?” 

McDouglass’ visage darkened. “I really am not at liberty to say, doctor. Unfortunately, if I am to keep my position in the Foundation I must also keep my mouth shut.” 

“I understand. Do be sure to pass on my contact information to this individual, though. I would very much like to meet him.” 
“I will, Doctor. I’m sure he would love to meet with you.” McDouglass takes his papers and puts them back in his briefcase. As the latch snaps closed Henrietta perked up, unable to contain her questions any further. “Truth be told, professor, there is one last thing I wanted to ask you.”

“Yes?” From his tone, Dr. Vidarsson seemed to already know what was on her mind. 

“It’s about that knife, in that case behind you. May I take a look at it?” She gestured to the golden blade in the back of the room. 
“By all means. Here, I will take it out for you.”

The professor winced as he rose, surprising himself by actually using his cane for its intended purpose. He was going on in his sixties, and although his youth as an outdoorsman had kept him fit age was starting to catch up to him. He smiled sadly, as he knew she would have remained the same as she was forty years ago.  As young and spry as the day they met. 

He lifted the glass cover over the blade, and gently took it out. It was heavy in his hand. “Here you are. Be careful, that edge is sharp.” Henrietta took it, running the edge between her fingers while studying the runes on the blade.
 
“Elder Fuuthark…and an ancient dialect. Yet the blade is pristine.” Her voice was heavy with curiosity. At this point, McDouglass had stepped forward as well, his eyes scanning the blade. 

“It should be, that is just a reproduction.” The doctor mused. 

“Reproduction?” McDouglass said while looking up at him. 

“Oh yes. The real one is kept with my family…in a location I am not willing to disclose.” 

“Then, this really is…” McDouglass gulps. “This is the Hunting Knife of Vidar?”

“Again, a reproduction, but yes. The Hunting Knife is very, very real. Tell me, young lady, why did you ask about this weapon?”
“You won’t believe this, doctor. But one of the bound books in the chest that was found? It was written in Elder Fuuthark. It was a journal, but the text is extremely antiquated.” She gulped. “There are…rumors in the company. Rumors about the family that founded the Foundation and their history, and then this book shows up. I…I meant no disrespect but when we saw this weapon in your office…” 
At that, Dr. Vidarsson looked at his guests with an intense look. “A journal, you say?” His voice was measured, calm and holding back emotion. “A journal written in the language of the Old Gods?” 

“Yes. We were all wondering: why was a book written in the ancient Nordic language found buried under the sand in a dig site near the Toshka Lakes? Furthermore the contents of the journal confused us. It was difficult to translate, but the text within was full of notions of the apocalypse, with passages describing the world freezing over. Hell, I would have thought it’d be some kind of practical joke, if not for our carbon dating equipment placing its origin somewhere around late 500 BC.” She bit her thumb. “It ended up a critical part of triangulating the location of this ‘lost wonder’. But McDouglass and I were curious about this whole thing.” McDouglass began to speak, backing up his partner. 

“Being the expedition lead manager I contacted the head of the head of the Unusual Artifact Research division on his direct line. I told him about the journal and its contents, how it was out of place geographically. His tone got cold, well, colder than usual. He flatly told me that the journal was to be a valuable source of information, and that it needed to be hermetically sealed and shipped to VMF Headquarters immediately.” He sighs. “Our Artifact Recovery Containers are state of the art vacuum-sealed containers with active humidity control, capable of containing ancient artifacts for up to three years on one battery in a state of perfect stasis. Costly stuff. We had barely managed to secure three for this operation and to give up one immediately? I voiced my arguments that it was just a dusty journal, it could be shipped with a standard container.” 

Henrietta winced. “I supported that decision, and that was a mistake. We got a verbal lashing over that phone call and were told to bring the notes to you to discuss their validity as well as bring up the topic of the journal to you. He said that you would ‘provide adequate support to his claims’ on the importance of the journal.” 

Vidarsson smiles. “I see my youngest is still as stoic as ever. Funny, when he was practically a daddy’s boy as a cub. Hold on, I have something you need to see.” Rising from his chair, he walks back to the glass case. Lifting the velvet cloth the blade was resting on, Vidarsson extracts a small leather-bound book. Its pages were heavily yellowed with age, and the leather binding was mummified and taut. He offered it to Henrietta who took it with care. 

“This journal is dated around 576 BC. It originated from somewhere in northern Norway, and the author kept a record of their travels in it.” She looked up at him as McDouglass took the book in his hands. “And who is the author?”

Dr. Vidarsson sat down, looking his guest in the eyes. “Vidar. THE Vidar. And if I’m not mistaken, he was the author of the journal you found as well.”

The pair were silent for a moment. McDouglass clears his throat as he parsed the information, and Henrietta was the first one to speak up. “Yes. The Egyptian journal only credits a “Vidar” as the author. But surely it can’t be…”
 
“It is.” Vidarsson interrupts. “Oh, it is. And that knife is his as well.” He reclines in his leather sofa. 

“I think I understand why my son sent you to me. He trusts you, I’m certain of that. He wants you to understand the gravity of whatever they’ve found out there. And to do that, I need to tell you about my own past, and what I discovered all those years ago. I trust you that the information I’m about to share only stays between us, and between you and my children.”

McDouglass and Henrietta quickly nodded in agreement. 

“Very well then. Let us begin, all those years ago in the year 2014…”  

TRANLATION FROM THE JOURNAL OF VIDARR – EXCERPT ONE
To the one who seeks to resolve my mistakes, seek my blade. 
Buried under the glittering mountain in the home of the Jotnar, you will find it. 
But understand this, my kin. Should you find my blade you will also inherit my mistakes. And it may be improper on my part, but I hope you are strong enough to correct them. 
For all our sakes. 

Chapter 1: Unchained

&lt;Jotunheimen Mountain Area, Norway, 1000 hours&gt;

“*Helsikken*, what a night!” Arne Vidarsson was shivering in his tent, despite the layers of winter protection he was currently nestled under. He knew it would be bad, but a sudden dip to -25 degrees Celsius caught him off guard. While his arctic-rated gear kept him warm, the wind whipped his tent as the blizzard raged on. 

Carefully, he got out of his sleeping bag and activated a small potassium heating pad. It may have been small, but it burned hot providing him with much needed heat. As he opened the flap of his tent, he was greeted with several feet of snow. 

“Good morning, mother nature.” He said with a hint of distaste. It was beautiful, yes, but dangerous. He shook his head, trying to push away his memories of the accident.

With a resigned huff, he withdrew a small spade from his hiking pack. The snow was around three feet tall in front of the tent flap, and was densely packed. He knew that he needed to extract his tent and belongings from the snow lest they become wet, cold and soggy. 
After working for roughly thirty minutes, he reasoned that enough snow had been cleared around the tent. “There, that should be fine.” His stomach growled as his body reminded him of the fact that he still needed to eat. “Right. Breakfast. Can’t forget about that.” He took a ready-made hiker’s meal from his bag and a small burner. In a few minutes he had a steaming meal ready to eat. As he sat on his sleeping bag, eating the hot contents from the ceramic bowl he liked to listen to his travel radio to keep up-to-date on the events happening around the world. 

The first channel he tuned into was BBC Radio International. &quot;And in the latest news, US President Germaine Haverford proposed a brand new economic reform bill that promises to allocate more funding towards national education, however this is raising controversy with …&quot; He swallowed and washed his mouth with fresh-brewed coffee. “Alright, let&#039;s see what else is there...” He idly thought as he switched the channel to a local radio station, which had ended its news segment and had started playing the latest in trendy music. After a few more idle flips, he switched off the radio and packed up his belongings after washing down his meal with some water. He reasoned he was closer to Glittertind now, seeing the mountain peak rise above the rest in the distance. And if that were the case, he was getting closer to the location listed in the journal.

After he stuffed the sleeping bag back into its carrying sack, he brought out the old leather-bound journal as well as his own notebook. Opening both, he thumbed through the pages of Old Norse runes and compared them to his own notes. While he had earned his degree in Nordic Anthropology, this journal was proving to be a difficult contender to decrypt. For one, it was written in Elder Fuuthark, a precursor of “modern” runic languages utilized by the Germanic people. References and resources to translate it were few and far between, but he had made some headway, enough to translate a critical portion of the text. 

He brought out a red ink pen and circled a few translated lines as he reflected on the journal. It had been handed down from father to son in his family for generations now with no clear origin point. At one point, it had been his great-grandfather, then his grandfather’s, and lastly his father’s item before it came to his ownership. Relatives called the journal cursed, that it brought misfortune to the man who owned it. While it was a silly superstition, there may have been some truth to it as every one of its owners went mad with wanderlust at some point in their life.  His grandfather abandoned his family one day to explore the wilderness, never to return. His father tried actively to resist this strange “call of the wild” yet Arne remembered how he took him, as a child, on hike after hike in the forests of Norway. 

A gust of wind lifted the tent flap, sending bone-chilling wind into the small shelter. Arne shivered and blew into his exposed hands. He blinked hard to calm himself. His friends at the university always noted with irony that he was a chionophobic yet lived in one of the snowiest countries in the world. His fear of snow was deep-seated from the accident, but his passion for ancient Nordic history and his drive to unlock the mystery of the journal propelled him time and time again into the icy forests. 

He gave his notes one last look-through, then brought out his map and compass, drawing out a path from his current location. The journal spoke of something located in the “home of the Jotnar” along with the following instructions. 

“In the shadow of Glittertind when Sunna reaches the highest peak in her never ending journey, turn your back on the mountain; Within a tomb glowing against the shadows; beyond a veil of false stars you will find stone harder than the flesh of the Jotun themselves. You shall not break through this but simply walk through if you are of like mind as I. There you shall uncover the regrets of my past and the curse I have laid for you.” 

The way the journal was describing a curse reminded him of the jests his friends made, and the comments made by his father as well. What if there was something driving his family to search in the wild? 

Arne shut the journal and his notes, readied himself to step outside with map tucked safely away in his coat pocket. He stopped as he exited his tent, brief pangs of uncertainty ringing in his soul as he stared out into the snow-covered expanse. He shut his eyes to clear away his fears and turned his focus to stowing away his shelter. After all was put away, he began trekking.
 
For an hour, the only sounds he heard were the whistling of the winter winds and the crunching of the snow underneath his boots. Gripping his map and compass as best he could he followed the path he laid out from translating the journal. It was nearly noon at this point, and the sun was practically overhead. 

“Okay, Glittertind is to the north. I’m facing one-hundred and fifty degrees away from it…so now what?” Arne looked around in the shadow of the great mountain. “There’s nothing but rocks and snow…hold on.” There was something glistening on the wall nearly sixty meters away. Glittering without any source of light. Arne picked up his pace until he came face to face with a rocky outcropping leading to a tunnel, lined with phosphorescent lichen in the shadows of the cave. 

“False stars in the darkness, huh?” Arne switched on his flashlight. “Well, my translation is accurate at least.” He carefully made his way through the damp cave, holding onto the slick, cold walls as best he could. His excitement grew as he delved deeper, feeling the slope of the cavern taking him ever more into the mountain. Excitement which grew as cave terminated in a dead end, exactly as the journal said. 

“Okay, there’s gotta be something here…maybe a loose rock?” His fingers probed the surface of the cold rock, finding nothing. Suddenly his fingers brushed against a ridge in the stone. Fumbling with his knife, Arne scratched away at the moss growing on the rock to reveal a strange set of runes. “What’s this…wolf?” He asked himself. “Why would there be the rune for ‘wolf’ be here? There’s another set here…’prison’, huh. Wolf Prison.” Unable to find anything else on the rock face, Arne slumped down against the rock to think. “I’m missing something, I need to ‘be of like mind’ as the author of the journal.” He scratched the blonde stubble on his chin as he removed his scarf to breathe a little better. “False stars…the author wrote about this cavern for a reason. If I were trying to hide something I’d want it to be a little hard to find. But I’m the one designing the security, so I’d know the way around it.” An idea struck him, and he reached up to his head light to turn it off. Darkness flooded the cavern, and the soft fluorescent glow of the moss around him became more prevalent. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see that the moss was gathering around one of the corners of the wall. Leaning towards it, Arne could feel cold wind brushing against his face, which he wouldn’t’ve felt with his scarf on. Arne felt the rock, and felt that it was loose. This stone was placed here to cover up something. 

Pulling it away, he found a small passage lined with the same kind of moss. Switching on his light again he entered the crawlspace, moving slowly through. Eventually he emerged in an atrium like room, with snow falling through a gap in the ceiling. Arne noted that this room was deliberately carved, with runes lining the walls and the floor. But his eyes grew wide at what was at the center of the room: a glistening golden hunting knife jammed into the stone floor. 

Arne walked towards it, struck by its beauty. Tentatively he grasped the handle and pulled. The blade came out of the rock easily, and while it looked golden the weight of the weapon did not reflect the material. It was heavy, easily five kilograms in his hand despite its size. Whoever used the weapon would need both strength and dexterity to use it as a knife. But what a weapon it was! 
“This had to have been forged during the Proto-Germanic era given the state of the rock around here…but it looks like it was made yesterday.” Arne marveled. His reflection was crisp in the blade, which was etched with more runes at the hilt. “Let’s see here…it’s a name.” Arne looked at the runes, the blinked a few times. “Vidar. Vidar?” This was a monumental find. He knew the myths well, about the Hunter, Vidar and how he slew the great Beast of the river Van. Given the knife’s age, and inherent strangeness…could it really be *the* knife he used to slay the beast?

“No, I need to keep a level head here, can’t get swept up in silly myths and fairy tales. I need my journal, need to make notes…” As he fumbled in his stuffy winter gear, the knife slipped from his hands and sliced easily through the layers of wool on his arm, barely missing his foot. Even though it was dropped from a height of a meter, its blade still sank into the stone floor as if passing through paper. Arne cursed and gripped his arm, checking the cut. The gash wasn’t deep but still enough for a steadily-seeping wound to form. As he brought out his emergency kit to patch himself up, he noticed a strange vibrating noise. As if a tuning fork had been struck. Looking around the room, he noticed the blade at his feet was oscillating rapidly. The droplets of blood near it vibrated along with the blade. 

Arne’s hairs stood on end. Something was very wrong. 

He backed up towards the wall of the cavern when a blinding light forced him to cover his eyes, followed by the bitter sting of cold. Despite him wearing layers on layers of winter gear, this cold wind seemed to chill his very soul. And with his eyes closed, Arne realized that he could hear breathing. Strained, harsh breathing. He opened his eyes, and his blood froze. 

The room was covered in chains made of the same golden material. The harsh breathing was coming from the subject they were subduing, who was thrashing against her bonds in the center of the room where the knife originally stood rooted in place. She was…enormous. Her blue-grey fur was matted with wounds and scars, and it was covered with battle-scarred leather and iron armor fit for a warrior. Every time she struggled, it seemed like the mountain itself was shaking yet the golden chains did not budge. They wrapped around her legs, her waist, her wrists and even her muzzle, denying her to do anything but growl madly. Arne shook as he realized that the knife was no longer in the ground either, but now protruded from her left eye. Her remaining eye searched the room wildly, and then it fixed on him. Her growls grew more intense, and her sole eye seemed to smolder with hatred as it saw him. Without warning, a cold gale began to blow in the room. 

Something clicked in Arne’s head. That rune on the wall wasn’t just for “wolf.” It used a specific shape, one with denotation reserved for writing about Old Gods. 

The rune did not mean “wolf”. 

It meant Fenrir.

Chapter 0.1 – Interlude
&lt;The University of Tromsø - The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, Norway&gt;

“So, let me get this straight…” McDouglass sets down his cup. “The Journal of Vidar was in your family for generations, and your entire family tree was affected by it?” Dr. Arne Vidarrson nodded. 

“At the time, no member of my family understood the origin nor the significance of the journal. We just saw it as a priceless heirloom made even more valuable by its age. Honestly most of my ancestors just kept it around as financial insurance to sell to some museum for a pretty penny.” Arne took the book in his aged hands. “How foolish indeed.” 

McDouglass has another question on his mind. “And you said that the journal led you to the knife, which released a faunae woman when you touched it?” 

“Not when I touched it.” Arne pulls at his sweater’s cuff, revealing a thin scar. “It was my blood. The knife seemed to react to the blood of its’ master and undid the seal holding back-“

“Fenrir.” Henrietta completed his sentence. “You expect us to believe that you released a world-ending monster from millennia-long confinement?” 

“She wasn’t a monster.” Arne snapped, an edge coming into his voice. “She was a Fauane, much like you. And I don’t see how it’s hard to believe in her existence, seeing as stranger things have occurred with the Knife and whatever you’re finding in Egypt.” Arne set down his cup, now devoid of coffee. “Be skeptical all you want. We’re dealing with artifacts beyond scientific explanation. I don’t want to get into any theological or superstitious arguments here, but there are documented instances of objects and phenomena that we can’t explain, yet they exist and that the Foundation is actively searching for them.”

McDouglass folds his arms. “Sir, that’s some high-clearance information you’re privy to. Knowing even that much constitutes to a major data leak and-“ 

Arne waves him off. “Please. My children own the company you work for. And they’re the ones keeping me informed about what they find or what they develop. And who would come knocking for an old man in a frozen town? Competitors? Political rivals? Assassins? My children are doing well to keep me safe, especially after their mother passed.”

He hung his head. “Let me continue with my explanation. I have a feeling that listening to what I have to say will answer more of your questions.”

Chapter 2 – A Beast in Chains
&lt;The Caverns Underneath Glittertind, Norway&gt;

The she-wolf’s good eye was fixated on Arne. His blood was like ice in his veins, his fight-or-flight response defaulting to the oft-ignored third option: freeze. 

The air was thick with the feeling of intense danger. One look at her and it was clear that she’d meant to do him harm. Another gust of wind buffeted him, pelting him with sleet. Arne shielded his face with his arms. This was a chamber underground, how could there be icy wind here? 

The wind subsided somewhat, and Arne glanced up. The she-wolf was now still, and glowering at him with a chilling gaze. She had stopped thrashing in her chains, and was now motionless. “Did she calm down? No…” Arne’s eyes widened in fear and realization. “She’s like a predator waiting for its prey to move.” He noticed something else too, a low rumble. A cave in? The noise grew louder, and he realized it was her, growling into the binding chains around her muzzle. She flexed her arms slowly, testing out the limits of her restraints. As she did so, copper-colored blood wept out of her impaled left eye socket, droplets splattering on the ground. His own crimson blood still stained the blade as well, collecting into a single drop which ran down her cheek like a tear. 

Arne watched the red bead make its way down the side of the muzzle. The wolfess herself seemed to be focused on it, following its journey by the sensation on her fur. Just as it reached the side of her mouth she sharply inhaled, allowing the droplet to pass between her teeth despite the chains forcing her mouth shut. She closed her good eye, and when it opened Arne could see a dangerous resolve in it. She flexed all muscles in her arms, and to her surprise and Arne’s horror, a single chain around her index finger snapped. Her eye darted in his direction as she pointed the finger in his direction. 

At her command, jagged splinters of ice erupted from the ground traveling at alarming speed towards the unfortunate explorer. Seeing the sharp ice rushing towards him, Arne panicked. “S-Stay away!” He grabbed the ice pick dangling at his waist and hurled it at the ice. The pick smashed through several icicles, but to Arne’s horror more erupted from beneath it. Despite looking like normal ice, the spikes pierced the hardened metal of the ice pick, fracturing it to pieces. 

Arne nearly fell over in shock as his head spun. “Ice that breaks through metal? What the hell, what the hell!?” Arne glanced over at the Faunae woman, and even through her face and body were bound he could make a look of disgust in her eye. Her finger pointed to him again, the ice surging forward at her command. 

Dodging the frozen spikes rising from the floor, Arne ducked and rolled away before getting to his feet. His eyes scanned the runes on the wall. He couldn’t translate them all, but two stood out at him. One clearly said “BLADE” and another close to it spelled out “IMPRISON”. She had appeared when his blood dripped onto the knife…maybe it could go the other way too? The plan he was brewing was completely idiotic, but it was either this or get skewered by ice. Taking a deep breath and closing his eyes, Arne oriented himself facing the wolf-woman and charged forwards. He tried not to think about the otherworldly chill in the air passing through his layers of clothing, nor about the sounds of ice rushing towards him.
 
He just ran, and kept running until he slammed into something furry. Something furry, yet built like a brick wall wearing leather armor. The wall let out a surprised grunt and he stumbled back, opening his eyes. The wolf was clearly taken by surprise by his actions, glowering at him with a hint of confusion as to what he was doing. Arne, however, wasn’t going to let an opening like this get away from him. He grabbed the hilt of the knife and began reciting the same word over and over in his head. Sounding out the extinct language in his mind, focusing on its structure and consonants. Imprison. Imprison. Imprison. Imprison…

“Imprison!” With a roar the wolf’s eye went wide as she began struggling again in vain, enveloped by the chains glowing with golden light as they and she appeared to evaporate back into the blade. It hung motionless in the air for a moment before clattering to the ground hilt-first. 

Arne stumbled backwards in shock, collapsing onto the ground. “What…the hell…was that?” He carefully prodded the blade with his remaining ice pick causing it to spin around on its side. Realizing that the blade was no longer reacting to anything, he slowly picked it up and placed it in the broken ice pick’s pouch. Seeing that the weapon was secure, Arne took a moment to compose himself. An eerie silence hung in the chamber, accenting the cracking ice around him. A sheet of sleet on the ceiling fell, shattering next to the hapless young man.

He bolted up to his feet. “I need to get out of here. Right now.” 

-----------------------------------------------------------

Arne glanced at the golden knife laying on the passenger’s seat. He’d made it out of the cave, and over the course of a day and a half made it back to his SUV parked at a local scenic lookout. His 1990 Land Rover wasn’t the pinnacle of reliability but it crossed terrain like no other vehicle could, scampering over rocks and trudging through snow banks. Plus, it was cheap. 

“Damn, the snow is really picking up. I hate snow so much…” Arne muttered under his breath as he hit the wipers. Ever since he picked up the knife in the cave the winds outside had picked up, bringing more flurries with it. To make matters worse it had been getting colder as well. Arne pressed down on the accelerator just as the car hit a pothole in the road that was concealed with snow. “Damn it!” Arne swerved the vehicle as it began to slide on the slick road, causing the knife to slide around. Its edge passed seamlessly through the plastic of the center console, no harder than it had cut through his arm. Swearing, Arne picked up the knife and drove it into the seat. The upholstery was ruined but at least the knife was no longer loose in the cabin. 

A few more days of driving, and Arne finally arrived at his family’s cabin outside of Tromsø. It had been in the family for generations, and now it belonged to him alone. His camping equipment was the first thing brought into the house, the bulky items stacked precariously in his arms as he walked towards the storage shed behind the house. His cut arm hadn’t healed up completely, and the tension from the load and dryness from the cold caused the scab to split. Arne grimaced, feeling the pain from the re-opened wound. Holding his sleeve, he walked back to the Land Rover and carefully extracted the blade from the seat cushion. He held the pommel gingerly, keeping the edge facing away from his body. Once inside, he set it down on the dinner table and sat in front of it, arms crossed against his chest. 

From his coat pocket, Arne fished out the journal and stared at the name on the leather cover. In runes was a single name: “Vidar”. He long thought it was some kind of pseudonym, but now? He grappled with the thought that somehow, an ancient Nordic legend was intertwined with his family history. Arne shivered, his breath wafting in front of him. Had it always been this cold in the house? 
“I’d better start up the furnace. That’ll warm this place up.” Opening a cupboard, the young Norwegian fished out a burlap sack of charcoal. Taking a few lumps, he opened an old cast-iron furnace in the corner of the kitchen and popped them inside. With some lighter fluid and a match, Arne was able to get some heat spreading through the room. The chill in the air lifted somewhat, and soon he was comfortable enough to remove his coat.

Arne began flipping through the pages, stopping one particular one showing circles of runic text. “These are the same patterns that were in the cave…” He glanced over at the knife. The name “VIDAR” was clearly etched into the golden blade in ancient Norse runes. He grabbed a store-made sandwich from the fridge and sat down with the journal and blade next to each other. “The runes here on this page and the ones in that room were the same, I’m sure of it. And I swear I saw those chains dig into specific rune sets here, and here…” He took a bite out of the sandwich in his hand, eating as he mulled over his findings. “Okay, assuming I wasn’t hallucinating from a fear-induced high, there was a very angry Faunae woman who appeared when I got my blood on the blade of this thing.” He frowned, his brow furrowing in concentration. He was intrigued now. 

He grabbed a small notepad on the counter and began jotting things down. He wanted to try and see if his blood would affect the blade again, but he couldn’t just summon a crazed and possibly murderous mythological being into his house. At least not without proper preparation. 


Chapter 3: A Guest In Chains
&lt;The Outskirts of Tromsø, Norway&gt;

“Phew, okay, that should be good enough.” Arne sat down on the wooden floor, catching his breath. He’d spent the greater part of the day clearing things out of the old one-room guesthouse behind the cabin. It was used as a storage shed before, but he’d taken the time to move everything in it to either the tool shed a few feet away or into the house. 

His hands left marks on his jeans where they’d been resting; his palms and fingers were coated in a layer of chalk. Flipping open the journal, he looked around the room to make sure his handiwork was correct. Over the course of several days he’d painstakingly written down each rune on the page, starting from the center of the room outward. Scrawls of ancient Norse were drawn on the floors, walls, and even the door. Arne clapped his hands together several times to get rid of the chalk before rising to retrieve the knife. 

Carefully he placed it in the center of the room, and from his coat pocket he procured a medical lancet. “Not too sure how much blood it needs, but a drop is a good place to start off as any.” Pressing his thumb against the opening of the lancet, he felt the ant-like bite of the small needle as it broke through his skin. A small droplet of blood began to ooze from his thumb, and taking care to avoid the blade’s edge he dragged his thumb down the side of the knife. A thin red line was left behind, and all he needed to do now was observe. 

It was slow at first. Patches of light appearing on the blade, spreading upwards until the entire knife was glowing with an intense light. Arne backed away, shielding his face as chains burst forward from the knife, which was now impossible to look at. When Arne opened his eyes, he immediately regretted it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Hate. 

Every fiber of her being thrummed with hate. Hate for the heavens. Hate for the world. 

She was death incarnate, the apocalypse made manifest. Yet here she remained, bound by the accursed magic woven into the blade jutting out of her eye. It hurt, oh, it hurt. She could feel the hunting knife embedded within her skull, piercing the divine flesh inside. To a mortal such an injury would be a deathblow, but to her? It was a mere nuisance. 

After all, she was the embodiment of the end. To end her would be a sin against natural order itself. No, instead the continuous agony only fueled her rage. 

She tried to move herself, but found herself still bound by lock and chain. And unlike before, these chains were fresh. Her good eye moved then to the mortal in front of her. She sniffed the air, one of the last free actions afforded to her. 
Hm, there was no doubt now. This was the same mortal who released her back into the physical realm of Midgard. The knife had held her for so long, she was beginning to forget the feeling of being made manifest. Looking at him…made her even more frustrated. A single mortal as her jailer? 

What an insult. Her rage began to swell further, and then she felt it. The world outside still heeded her call. Yes, even if she couldn’t bring this world to its knees herself, she felt some grim satisfaction in the fact that her influence would do it for her. 
The mortal began to speak, in some strange and alien tongue. The language was ugly and coarse, nothing like that of the Divine Fuuthark she knew. The longer he spoke, the more it began to annoy her.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

“Holy shit.” Arne swore. “Hooooly shit.” 

His heart beat rapidly in his chest as he came to terms with his situation. Just like before in the cave, the knife exploded in a flash of light, and when the brightness died down a very large and very angry wolf woman had manifested. The golden chains anchoring her to the center of the wooden cabin lodged themselves in the runes around the room at specific points. “Guess that proves my theory, this pattern really was meant to help in sealing…her.” He paced the room, talking to himself. “Okay, I need to calm down. Where’s that page, I swear I marked it down. Ah, wait, here we go.” Arne swallowed and flipped to a page marked with a post-it note, and began scribbling down a set of runes on his own notebook. 

“Okay, now for the hard part.” He looked at the wolfess, who returned his gaze with a particularly murderous one. He gulped hard, even restrained she looked capable of killing. His breathing began to speed up despite his efforts to remain calm as he noticed a slight frost beginning to form around her, coating the floor. Arne began walking forward doing his best to ignore the fact that it was cold enough to see his breath despite the furnace running, or the snarl that was coming from her throat. It began to dawn on him that his initial estimate regarding her size was a bit off. On her knees as she was now, she was nearly looking into his eyes. If she were standing tall, she’d easily be around 3 meters in height. 

Stopping just out of the final circle of runes, Arne held up the scribbled note. He’d written down the same runes as he’d seen in the cave, which he began noticing in the journal as well. On seeing the runes, the she-wolf’s eye narrowed and looked at him, almost in a demanding way. As if he’d asked her an obvious question to which she took annoyance to. Arne stepped back slowly. 
“Okay. She’s probably, most likely the Fenrir of legend. But…let’s see here. If I wanted to ask her “what’s your name” I’d probably write it down like this.” He wrote, to the best of his knowledge, a simple question asking if her name really was Fenrir. Holding up the paper, the wolfess growled angrily, in a manner that suggested offense. Looking at the paper, Arne realized that a single line on one of the runes was off. 

----------------------------------------------------------------
The mortal had written down “You are Fenrir, not.” 

Was he asking to be frozen alive? How dare he mock her! Fenrir shook the chains more furiously but they restrained her well. A bolt of pain in her left orbit caused her to shudder slightly, stoking her anger even more. 

She was still bound, however, and no amount of thrashing would be able to break these renewed chains. Simmering, she opted instead to formulate battle plans in her head for her eventual escape. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Oh dear. Judging by her reaction to that, he must’ve insulted her. 

“Okay, okay. Um…” An idea came to him, but it was wholly idiotic. Still, acting kind towards her might at least show her that he meant no harm and wasn’t a threat. 

Well, he wasn’t a threat either way. If the legends were true she’d slain Odin, king of the Nordic Gods when she initiated Ragnarok. If a god couldn’t kill her, a human like himself wasn’t anything more than an insect to her. 

“Insect or not, kindness does go a long way.” He mumbled to himself as he ran back to the house. Shuffling around in his camping chest, he found what he was looking for: a first-aid hiking kit, filled with emergency medical supplies. Everything from pain medication to sutures, gauze pads and disinfectant. In particular, he kept a morphine auto-injector handy in case he suffered a very, very serious accident on the hiking trails. He wasn’t sure how resistant to pain his new guest was, but judging from the fact that she had a knife sticking out of her left eye and was still thrashing about with alarming focus, probably very high. He shook his head and put it back in the kit, picking up the suturing kit and blood clot spray instead. As Arne headed out, he wrote some more runes in his notebook, this time taking his time to make sure the grammar was as correct as possible. 

“Gah, was it this cold outside?” The moment Arne stepped outdoors he was greeted by a flurry of snow and icy wind. Snow was everywhere, covering the ground and trees in a blanket of white. “It wasn’t this bad ten minutes ago, and nowhere on the forecast were there any warnings of increased snowfall today. Man, this sucks.” He walked quickly, trying not to let the snow unnerve him any more than he already was. While he had certified himself in emergency first-aid, this was the first time he’d be preforming it on someone. Much less, a violently angry apocalypse goddess. 

He carefully stepped back into the cabin. “H-hi. Um, I’m not a threat!” He held up his hands, showing he wasn’t armed or meaning to engage her in combat. Fenrir merely stared angrily at him. “Yeah, you probably don’t understand me all that well…” Arne thought for a while, forming the words in his head. He’d only heard one person speak Elder Fuuthark and that was at a guest presentation at the university. He was about to attempt it himself, using only his research notes and the documents he’d studied. Arne looked Fenrir in her eye. 

“I am not threat. I wish healing, you.” His optimism wavered slightly when he saw no discernible effect in Fenrir’s demeanor. Okay, maybe actions would speak louder than words. “Thou still.” Ignoring her increasing growl as he approached her, he quickly unpacked the sterile gauze and readied the pain relief and blood clot sprays. “Right. Yank and grab. Yank and grab.” Arne chanted in his mind as he gripped the handle of the blade. Fenrir attempted to thrash and snap her jaws, but the chains binding her held her fast. 

“One…two…three!” He pulled the knife, and it slid out of her head with terrifying ease. Fenrir roared with pain before settling down into rapid, labored panting. “You got this…you got this…step one done, now step two-“Arne’s self-assurance wavered when he saw two hemispheres of ice on the ground. Ice that was rapidly melting and yet, looked like someone had split an ice sculpture of an eyeball in two. He was also made aware of a dripping sound behind him, a steady tap-tap-tap. “Step two, step two, step two.” He repeated that mantra to himself as he gathered his medical supplies. 

Sure enough, the tapping sound was that of Fenrir’s copper blood dripping onto the wooden floor. Arne hurried over and sprayed some antiseptic onto an absorbent pad. He pressed it against the weeping socket, and to his surprise the flow of blood was already beginning to abate. Fumbling around with the gauze and a pocket knife to cut it with, he circled her head several times to secure the pad in place. Now all that was left was to cut the gauze and-

“Ow!” Damn, his hands were shaking and he nicked his thumb with the knife. He quickly tied up the gauze, then used a small bit to dab away at his own blood. As he brought his hand down, he felt a tug on the bandage. 
Fenrir had gripped the loose fabric as it passed by a gap in the chains binding her muzzle, and now it was lodged between her side teeth. Arne gasped and let go of the bloodstained bandage, watching Fenrir draw it into her mouth and swallow it. 

--------------------------------------------------
Fenrir tasted the mortal’s blood. It was metallic and sour, and completely unpleasant. 

When she was spawned into the world, her creator wove into her being a set of conditions. One of which was that as she felled foes by claw, teeth or ice, she could imbibe their sanguine essence to learn their knowledge and skills. The more she killed, the deadlier a warrior she’d be. 

She forced the fabric down her throat, processing the information that came with it. It wasn’t much, but she now knew her captor’s name, and the foul language that he spoke. 

If he dared mock her in her native tongue, then she will lash out in his own. Before breaking free of these chains and killing him, of course. 

With that decided, she began to yell.
-------------------------------------------------

Arne looked at his “patient” in shock as she stared him down, thrashing and spewing forth what he could only surmised as muffled hate-laden speech. 

As Fenrir ranted, he glanced down at the golden knife on the floor. Back in the cave, when he told it to seal Fenrir, it did so. Maybe…maybe it could control certain sets of chains?

“Careful now, okay.” Arne grabbed the handle with care, inspecting the inscription on either side. “Let’s try this out. Ahem!” He cleared his throat several times in preparation to pronounce the strange and ancient language. 

“Mouth. Unseal!” 

The chains around Fenrir’s muzzle went slack and slid off, clattering onto the floor before disappearing. She looked at them in shock as they faded before looking up again, her head still bound from turning. 

“Talk. Free. Thou?” Arne spluttered, butchering that sentence. Fenrir growled in response. 

“Speak not my tongue, mortal. I shall escape these bindings, and then you shall regret the day you brought me back to thine world.” She then launched into a vitriol-laden tirade. 

Arne was shocked. Firstly because Fenrir was now cursing him in perfect, if antiquated Norwegian. And secondly because he at least expected a thank you.

Chapter 4: The Beast of the River Van

“Damn you, mortal! How dare you attempt to confine me here with these…” Fenrir strains against her chains, which hold fast. “How dare you chain me with these bindings? You son of a whore! Come, I’ll rend you apart once I free myself, along with all else in this forsaken world!” 

Arne backed up a single step, taken back by the stream of profanity coming from the angry wolfess’ mouth. 

“You…speak Norwegian?” Fenrir spat on the floor in response. “Every syllable that comes out of my throat is like vomiting rocks. Ignorant men-folk, is this what you’ve perverted the language of the gods into?” 

‘Okay, calm down. I’ve got to approach this rationally.’ Arne thoughts raced as he stroked the stubble on his chin. ‘I’m fairly sure the evidence points to the obvious, but I need to make sure.’ He looked at her, who had quieted down in a simmering barely-controlled rage. 

“You…are Fenrir? THE Fenrir?” In response to the question, Fenrir bared her fangs. 

‘Oh great, here we go again…’ Arne braced himself for another round of tirades.
 
“It seems rocks are not limited to your language, human, for it seems thy head is filled with them too. Your voice betrays disbelief; I sense fear in you as well.” As much as she could, Fenrir sat up straight with vicious pride. “Just as well, for I am indeed your reckoning. I am Fenrir, daughter of Loki and the harbinger of Ragnarök.” Arne simply stared at her, formulating a response in his mind. “Um, right. My name is Arne. Arne Mous Vidarsson, I’m 26 years old and I’m studying anthropology at…” 

The air temperature dropped a few degrees as Fenrir’s eyes narrowed, her lips curling into a murderous snarl. “Vidarrson? Do you mean my jailor, a mere mortal, is a spawn of Vidar?” The chains binding her arms were pulled taught as she attempted to pull out of them, eliciting a snarl from her. 

“A divine mockery, that’s what this is.” Fenrir ceased struggling, and let her muscles go slack. The chains however remained taut, suspending her arms to either side. Arne could see a flicker of some other emotion; other than the rage she had so prevalently displayed before. For a moment, she looked almost…tired. She raised her head, and her eyes refocused with an icy glare onto the hunting knife within his grip. 

“Why are you waiting? Get it over with and spare me whatever tatters of dignity I still have left.” 

“I, uh, excuse me?” Arne blinked, trying to understand what she wanted. Fenrir growled in frustration. “Are you slow in the head, mortal? You bear the blood of Vidar. He failed in his destiny to slay me, and so that destiny falls unto you now.” As much as she could, she straightened her back and pushed her chest out. “Strike me in the heart, and claim victory that you rightly should, hero.” Arne felt like she nearly spat out that last word in distain. 

He glanced down at the knife in his hands, his reflection looking back at him through the polished gold blade. His eyes turned towards Fenrir, defiantly staring at him, waiting. 

“I’m not a killer.” He muttered, and immediately he felt the room’s temperature drop. 

“What did you say?” Fenrir hissed. 

“I won’t do it. I…I can’t do it! What, you think I can just take this thing and stab you with it? I’m just a history student, not a hunter or soldier or whatever!” 

Fenrir cursed in her native tongue. “A coward. You and your ancestors are all cowards! I curse your bloodline, Vidarrson! I curse your bloodline for ruination!” Arne took several steps back at her outburst until he heard something, he didn’t expect from her; a harsh giggle. It first came in between growls, but then became a steady staccato in her voice. “You…you have no idea, do you? As long as I remain, I will accomplish my goals. It doesn’t matter whether I remain trapped here like some chained cur or if I am let free to finish what I began.” 

Arne gripped the blade’s handle. “What do you mean by that?” 

“You deny me a warrior’s death. So, I deny you truth, son of Vidar.” She said, flashing a wicked smile. “On the day of my defeat, I will answer your question with my last breath.” Unable to take anymore, Arne wished that she would stop talking. 
And the Hunter’s Knife responded. 

Brilliant gold chains branched off from the ones around her arms and wound themselves around her muzzle. Unable to speak, she continued to growl despite being muffled by chains, locking eyes with Arne as he backed out of the shack and into the cold winter night. 
Arne’s mind was racing as he trudged back through the howling winds. Despite the house being only a few meters away from the shed, the trek seemed to take ages as he hastily retreated from the monster in the shed. He flung open the back door and slammed it behind him, as if she had somehow broken free and was after him. 

He pulled a chair from the kitchen and crashed down onto it, staring into space as he began to process everything that had happened in the last hour. Somehow, he was able to recreate an ancient seal written in a long-extinct language. Somehow, he was able to free an ancient deity, and not just any deity but the Beast of the River Van itself…or rather herself. 

He furrowed his brow. While he was familiar with the Poetic Edda and its texts, there had never been any mention that Fenrir was a Faunae woman. Most books described Fenrir as an unintelligent, feral wolf, while the fancier prose gave the imagery of an icy, violent abstract force destroying the gods and plunging the world into Ragnarök. Perhaps that was the result of information being distorted over time? Or was it done deliberately when the legends were written, to de-anthropomorphize her into something mindlessly evil? He took out his journal and began making notes about what he’d seen, summarizing everything he’d done and the results. 

His mind’s train of thought had just been launched on its tracks. He got up and grabbed several books, some journals on ancient Nordic artifacts and some from his childhood, tales from the Poetic Edda and other Norse legends and set to work. He poured over the tomes, marking things with a red pen and noting down every phrase or mention he could to Vidar, the Hunting Knife and Fenrir herself. So deep was he in his concentration that it took the rumble of his stomach to remind him that he needed to stop and eat.

“Damn, didn’t realize it was this late already…I think I have some leftovers that I can finish off.” He pushed away his book and shuffled over to the kitchen. Opening the fridge, he retrieved the plastic container holding a stew he made the night before and popped it into the microwave. As it began to heat up, he recalled that he had a whole chicken in the freezer bin. As he pondered what to make out of it, a thought struck him. 

Food and drink had long since been signs of peace and stability, and even more so as offerings to gods. While Fenrir wasn’t the type to give out any blessings, maybe she’d appreciate it? At least, it would show that he wasn’t a threat to her. 
Still, he was putting himself at great risk just by letting her exist. If the legends were true then she was the herald for Ragnarök. Still, bound as she was, he couldn’t simply murder her in cold blood. He chastised himself for thinking such thoughts. Better to extend an olive branch rather than a blade’s edge. 

“I wonder if gods even get hungry…ah well.” He quickly dressed it with some dry spice rub he’d bought from the supermarket in town and put it in the oven. “I can wait an hour before I eat.” 

Around 45 minutes later, a savory smell drifted through the kitchen as Arne covered the freshly-baked chicken in foil. He grabbed a few utensils and an insulated lunchbox, packing it with the chicken and some soup in a thermos. “All right, a dinner date with a murderous she-wolf goddess dressed in Nordic combat armor. Romantic.” He mused to himself. Still, it was undeniable that she’d be his guest for the foreseeable future. Might as well try to eat dinner and get to know her better. 

Neatly arranging everything and adding a few napkins for good measure he grabbed his coat and went back out into the icy night. Snow crunching underneath his feet, his breath came out in wisps as he approached the door to the guesthouse. His fingers paused over the doorknob as he took a breath before opening the door. 

Fenrir’s eyes were closed, but her ears swiveled to the creak of the door’s hinges. She silently opened her one eye and stared at her visitor, unable to vocalize thanks to the binding chains around her muzzle. Arne set down the lunchbox and grabbed the Hunting Knife. Fenrir’s eye narrowed as she turned her focus to the blade, her breathing quickening slightly. Arne heard this and took a moment to look at the knife, wondering if her reaction was fear…or eagerness. 

He took a moment to compose his thoughts; the blade would respond only to raw emotion or vocalized commands in Elder Fuuthark. He parsed the words together in his mind, a simple short phrase that would undo some of the bindings. With the words in place he spoke in the long-dead language. 

“Loosen chain – mouth.” 

At once, the bindings around Fenrir’s muzzle fell away, clattering to the ground before vanishing in small flashes of light.  Fenrir stretched her jaw before speaking. “So, mortal, have you come to fulfill your destiny? Or are you yet insisting that you keep me here like some sort of trophy?” She glowered at him as he set down the red Coleman lunchbox onto a small wooden table on the side of the room. Arne kept the knife down and opened the container, extracting his thermos and the cooked chicken. 

“I thought you might like something to eat, I mean, it’s really not much but you’re probably hungry right?” He undid the foil wrap, letting the herbal aroma of the cooked poultry waft through the room. 

Holding it and some plastic utensils in his hand, he carefully walked closer to the chained goddess. Every step he took, the air became more and more chilled until his breath was becoming visible as he stood in front of her. He was reminded of her height when, even kneeling down she was about eye-level with him. 

Fenrir looked at him, then the chicken, and then back to him. “Are you mocking me?” 

“What? No, I’m being serious. I made this for you, you know.” He gestured to her with the cooked bird. Fenrir’s eye remained locked on him. 

Her eye flicked down to the meal again and then back up. “Food. You, a mortal, are offering me, a god…food?” Her tone was still angry, but now with a hint of confusion. ‘She’s trying to deny it, but she’s interested.’ Arne thought to himself.  
“Look, I don’t have any interest in hurting you. Like I said before I’m a scholar rather than a soldier.” He unscrewed the cap off the thermos, and filling it with tomato soup made the night before. 

“Pray tell, how am I supposed to eat this…thing? My arms are bound, the chains on my neck preventing me from bowing my head. You make this thing that you pass off as “food” and then bring it to me, unable to make the slightest movement, just to taunt me further.” 
Oh, right. He hadn’t thought of that. 

“I could…uh. Hm.” He put his spoon down, considering his options. “I could feed you, if you want.” 

Fenrir took offense to that, baring her fangs. “If you so much as even attempt to do that, I’ll freeze your arm.” Arne frowned, based on her control over temperature and ice, she very well could despite being restrained. 

“Okay then. How about this?” He picked up the Knife again, and spoke to it. “Restraints, arms, loosen.” Instantly the gold chains suspending her arms to either side fell slack with her arms following them. She breathed deep, rotating them, and Arne could see powerful muscles straining against the leather under-sections of the plate armor. 

Then she stood up, and Arne’s blood ran cold. 

Her head was nearly brushing the ceiling as she brought herself up to her full height. At a little over 3 meters she towered over him. Fenrir took one deep breath, her chest unrestrained for the first time in years, her eyes closed. Then without warning she launched herself at him, claws bared. Arne yelped and, in his mortal, fear the Knife reacted, and new chains were released from the glyphs on the walls in response. 	

They wrapped themselves around Fenrir’s body, locking her in place. Arne slowly opened his eyes to see a hand with black-tipped claws mere centimeters from his head. The chains began to retreat into the rune circles, phasing into them, as Fenrir was dragged back to the center circle. They tightened further, forcing her to kneel once more. 

“You…why…” Arne croaked breathlessly as he stopped hyperventilating. 

“Only a fool releases a prisoner alone without a guard. I saw my freedom and saw that you were weak. If you do not have the strength to complete your duty, I will complete my own given the chance.” 

“You mean Ragnarök, don’t you?” Arne got back to his feet. “That’s your duty, right.” 

“Yes, mortal. I am the harbinger of your world’s end. The purpose of my existence is to end yours.” Her tone was hostile, but it bore little malice. Instead it was repeated almost matter-of-factly, as if she believed that and only that. 

An awkward silence filled the air. Every fiber of Arne’s being was telling him to get up and run, but something yet persisted in him. For some reason that baffled him, he wanted to stay. And so, he sat back down in front of his thermos, and picked up the knife again. With more care in his grammar, he loosened the restraints on Fenrir’s arms slightly, enough for her to reach down to the floor and pick up the meal he’d left her. 

This caught Fenrir by surprise. 

“…What are you doing?” She tested out her range of movement, observing the new movement capable to her. 

“If I’m going to play the role of a warden, I’m not letting my prisoner go hungry.” He imbibed a spoonful of his soup. “If you’re going to end the world then I guess I do need to stop you…so I’ll do as you ask. But before that, I want you to help me.” 

She raised her eyebrow in surprise. “Help you?” 

“My ancestor, Vidar, left a journal. I can’t read it well since Elder Fuuthark is a lost language. But you speak it fluently. Help me translate it and I’ll end you, just like you asked.” She snorted. “Hmph. A scholar to the end then. Fine, as long as you uphold your end of the bargain as well. If I cannot end this world, there is no reason for me to exist.” She reached down and grabbed the chicken whole, biting into it and tearing away a chunk. 

For a moment, her expression softened as she tasted the herbs and spices. Arne was quick to catch it. “It’s not much, but it’s enough to bring out the more savory flavors of the meat. Do you like it?”  
Her expression hardened again as she swallowed. 

“…Acceptable.”</textarea>
