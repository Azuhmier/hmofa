&gt;Your outfit is a black and orange heavy jacket, lined with fire retardant oils or fabric.
&gt;Things you knew about but didn&#039;t care to go over.
&gt;This wasn&#039;t the time to worry about your equipment.
&gt;You had your Fire Axe in hand, its red paint harboring a few scratches here and there.
&gt;Gripping it tight you moved within the corridors of the building ahead. You had to move fast. Fire waits for no one.
&gt;Ahead was a door, wooden, scuffed and slightly charred from the heat. Beyond was the last room you need to check.
&gt;Wasting no time, you approach the door and raise up your axe and swing to the door.

&gt;A test dummy
&quot;Congratulations Anon.&quot; A feminine voice. Familiar. Your thoughts return to you.
&gt;Your in a testing facility for your Fire Department. You just ran one of the courses designed to test your speed and efficiency.
&gt;As you put down the test dummy down onto a nearby bench you move outside the door into a much cooler area
&gt;Outdoors
&gt;To your right is another part of the building, the control room.
&gt;You can see inside through a reinforced glass window.
&gt;Probably also protected with fireproofing, just in case.
&gt;Inside was your partner and the owner of the voice over the speaker.
&gt;An anthro Dalmatian woman. 
&gt;She stood at about Five Feet Eight inches, but her height can be useful in your line of work.
&gt;Muscular with a healthy chest on her. You know better than to ask her size but you could guess she was a comfortable C cup.
&gt;She&#039;s also thrown you over her shoulder once or twice during training.
&gt;She was wearing the helmet of your Fire Department, 58034. 
&gt;As well as a open firefighter jumpsuit that revealed a somewhat sweaty white shirt underneath.
&gt;You swore you could see her spots through it, but you stared at her face immediately upon realizing what you&#039;ve done.
&gt;&quot;What was my time?&quot; You asked
&gt;&quot;Eighteen-Fourty.&quot;
&gt;Not a bad time, considering hers was Seventeen Even.
&gt;You gave her a thumbs up and reached up to grip off that helmet and bring it under your arm.
&gt;Man that fresh air feels good.
&gt;How are you Sun?
&gt;&quot;You up for another set?&quot; You hear her ask and you look over at her again with a smile.
&gt;&quot;Nah. Let the next guy take their chance.&quot; You were exausted. This was the third set today.
&gt;She smiles and nods, turning to the computer console and hits a few switches before heading to the door on the other end of the control room.
&gt;She comes around the building and approaches you
&gt;Wait, something about her walk is off.
&gt;&quot;You want to get some drinks, big boy?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sure. Let me get cleaned up first, Don&#039;t think we want to walk into &quot;The Drink&quot; smelling like fire.
&gt;She laughed at that and moved close to you and wrapped an arm around your waist.
&gt;&quot;Come on then.&quot;
&gt;You grin and then make your way with your lovable companion off towards the Firehouse across the courtyard.
&gt;You can almost hear her sniffing her nose as you walk together.
&gt;Something definitely off about this.
&gt;You were okay with it though. You always had the hots for her.
&gt;It did not take either of you long to enter the showers, the only thing that was really off is, she didn&#039;t drift off towards the woman&#039;s showers.
&gt;&quot;Wait. What if we get caught?&quot; You ask immediately staring down at her.
&gt;&quot;Then we better make it quick, think we can beat both our times?&quot;
&gt;You mentally hear the buzzer again, and the timer starts as you feel her start to remove your jumpsuit.</textarea>
