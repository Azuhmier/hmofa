why bailey is mad at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you gently lay your cargo next to the door since you know if you don&#039;t then as soon as you open that door it&#039;s going everywhere</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;fishing your keys out of your pocket, you unlock the door and let yourself in   </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hey girls I&#039;m home&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the words had barely left your lips when bailey grabs you by the collar and yanks your head down to hers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;this is exactly what you were expecting and you&#039;re much better prepared for it then when coco tried a similar trick on you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;not content to let the enemy be the one to make first contact you fearlessly press on, catching bailey&#039;s lips with yours </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;despite losing the element of surprise bailey still went ahead with her offensive, pushing her lips against yours in a desperate bid to reclaim the initiative</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it would all be for naught as your forward forces began their double flanking maneuver, your left hand reaching down and grabbing her by her soft tush and lifting her up to your level thus regaining the height advantage, forcing her to either hold onto you for support or dangle her limbs uselessly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;just as according to plan she chose to support herself, wrapping her legs around your waist as she simultaneously used her hands to try to push you away, a blatant attempt to retreat and regroup to go in for another assault</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;this is where the second half of your flank came into play, right hand reaching up to cup the back of her head, cutting off any hope of retreat  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with victory nearly in your grasp you throw everything you have into this attack even as bailey still weakly struggle against you, frantically looking for a path of retreat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the realization of defeat, that all paths to victory are closed off to her, causes her to, in a moment of weakness, whine pitifully into your mouth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she probably hoped this would net some mercy for her but you will accept nothing less then complete and unconditional surrender</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;that moment of weakness left her completely defenseless against your final assault, exploiting a tiny opening you forcefully push your tongue inside her mouth to to do one on one combat with her tongue</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;baileys tongue is a worthy foe, covered in tiny spikes any brush against it is like rubbing against sandpaper</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but the superior size and strength of your tongue ultimately wins the day, forcing your opponent into submission you&#039;re allowed to run wild inside her mouth, running your tongue along her sharp predatory teeth, caressing the inside of her cheeks and the roof of her mouth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;even her bodies struggle against you has ceased, now only holding herself close against you, letting you do whatever you wanted to her body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with that final admission of defeat you let up on the pressure, removing your mouth from hers and easing her to her feet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;that should get the jealousy out of her system </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it takes a second for her to regain her composure, but when she does all she can manage is an embarrassed look at you and coco before turning and running down the hallway towards the living room without a word</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;luckily for you coco has a few words to break the silence</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Me next! Me next!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;quickly bounding up to you coco is able to plant her lips right on yours since there is not nearly as much of a height disparity between you and coco as there is between you and bailey</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after coco takes a few quick licks against your lips you decide the best course of action is total surrender</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you know that coco could keep up the fight all day if she needed to and letting her do what she wants would be far better than any pyrrhic victory you could eck out against her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;throwing open the gates you let her tongue past your lips and into your mouth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as she hugs herself against you, you offer no resistance as she plunders your body for all the pleasure she can get out of it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re even complicit in it as you raise your hand and begin to pet her head causing her to moan out into your mouth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;once she has satisfied her lust for you she lets go of you and tells you that she loves you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you offer a scratch under her chin which she gladly accepts, tail wagging slowly, before turning around to gather your loot  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;closing the door behind you, you make your way down the hallway with coco close in tow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Ooooh what do you got? I thought you were just getting money, Is it food?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you tell her to just be patient as you round the corner into the living room/kitchen, not wanting the surprise to be ruined for her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;bailey is lying on the couch as she holds a large pillow against herself, still not saying a word as you entered</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you lay all your stuff on the counter and put everything except the tub the old lady gave you where it belongs as coco watches you closely</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as soon as you pop the top of the tupperware container you can already hear both coco and bailey sniffing the air in interest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you use your body to hide what your doing as you portion out the meal onto 3 plates</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;now with both of their eyes locked on you, you turn around with a plate of turkey diner in each hand, walking over and placing 1 in the paws of coco and the other on the table in front of bailey</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;bowing with a little flourish you told coco and bailey to dig in, not that they needed such invitation, already devouring the turkey like wild animals</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you go back and grab your plate and pop it into the microwave</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;before the timer even dings coco and bailey have already completely cleaned their plates</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;taking the warmed up turkey over to the living room table you plop yourself down next to bailey</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;coco comes and sits down on the other side of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a relaxing dinner cuddling up with your 2 loving pets sounds real good after a day of hard work providing for them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;unfortunately you get no such thing as you have to watch both coco and bailey like a hawk because they both keep tying to steal your food every 10 seconds</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;no rest for the weary</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;at least bailey is over her embarrassment</div></li></ol>        </div>

&quot;Hey girls I&#039;m home&quot;

&gt;the words had barely left your lips when bailey grabs you by the collar and yanks your head down to hers
&gt;this is exactly what you were expecting and you&#039;re much better prepared for it then when coco tried a similar trick on you
&gt;not content to let the enemy be the one to make first contact you fearlessly press on, catching bailey&#039;s lips with yours 
&gt;despite losing the element of surprise bailey still went ahead with her offensive, pushing her lips against yours in a desperate bid to reclaim the initiative
&gt;it would all be for naught as your forward forces began their double flanking maneuver, your left hand reaching down and grabbing her by her soft tush and lifting her up to your level thus regaining the height advantage, forcing her to either hold onto you for support or dangle her limbs uselessly
&gt;just as according to plan she chose to support herself, wrapping her legs around your waist as she simultaneously used her hands to try to push you away, a blatant attempt to retreat and regroup to go in for another assault
&gt;this is where the second half of your flank came into play, right hand reaching up to cup the back of her head, cutting off any hope of retreat  
&gt;with victory nearly in your grasp you throw everything you have into this attack even as bailey still weakly struggle against you, frantically looking for a path of retreat
&gt;the realization of defeat, that all paths to victory are closed off to her, causes her to, in a moment of weakness, whine pitifully into your mouth
&gt;she probably hoped this would net some mercy for her but you will accept nothing less then complete and unconditional surrender
&gt;that moment of weakness left her completely defenseless against your final assault, exploiting a tiny opening you forcefully push your tongue inside her mouth to to do one on one combat with her tongue
&gt;baileys tongue is a worthy foe, covered in tiny spikes any brush against it is like rubbing against sandpaper
&gt;but the superior size and strength of your tongue ultimately wins the day, forcing your opponent into submission you&#039;re allowed to run wild inside her mouth, running your tongue along her sharp predatory teeth, caressing the inside of her cheeks and the roof of her mouth
&gt;even her bodies struggle against you has ceased, now only holding herself close against you, letting you do whatever you wanted to her body
&gt;with that final admission of defeat you let up on the pressure, removing your mouth from hers and easing her to her feet
&gt;that should get the jealousy out of her system 
&gt;it takes a second for her to regain her composure, but when she does all she can manage is an embarrassed look at you and coco before turning and running down the hallway towards the living room without a word
&gt;luckily for you coco has a few words to break the silence

&quot;Me next! Me next!&quot;

&gt;quickly bounding up to you coco is able to plant her lips right on yours since there is not nearly as much of a height disparity between you and coco as there is between you and bailey
&gt;after coco takes a few quick licks against your lips you decide the best course of action is total surrender
&gt;you know that coco could keep up the fight all day if she needed to and letting her do what she wants would be far better than any pyrrhic victory you could eck out against her
&gt;throwing open the gates you let her tongue past your lips and into your mouth
&gt;as she hugs herself against you, you offer no resistance as she plunders your body for all the pleasure she can get out of it
&gt;you&#039;re even complicit in it as you raise your hand and begin to pet her head causing her to moan out into your mouth
&gt;once she has satisfied her lust for you she lets go of you and tells you that she loves you
&gt;you offer a scratch under her chin which she gladly accepts, tail wagging slowly, before turning around to gather your loot  
&gt;closing the door behind you, you make your way down the hallway with coco close in tow

&quot;Ooooh what do you got? I thought you were just getting money, Is it food?&quot;

&gt;you tell her to just be patient as you round the corner into the living room/kitchen, not wanting the surprise to be ruined for her
&gt;bailey is lying on the couch as she holds a large pillow against herself, still not saying a word as you entered
&gt;you lay all your stuff on the counter and put everything except the tub the old lady gave you where it belongs as coco watches you closely
&gt;as soon as you pop the top of the tupperware container you can already hear both coco and bailey sniffing the air in interest
&gt;you use your body to hide what your doing as you portion out the meal onto 3 plates
&gt;now with both of their eyes locked on you, you turn around with a plate of turkey diner in each hand, walking over and placing 1 in the paws of coco and the other on the table in front of bailey
&gt;bowing with a little flourish you told coco and bailey to dig in, not that they needed such invitation, already devouring the turkey like wild animals
&gt;you go back and grab your plate and pop it into the microwave
&gt;before the timer even dings coco and bailey have already completely cleaned their plates
&gt;taking the warmed up turkey over to the living room table you plop yourself down next to bailey
&gt;coco comes and sits down on the other side of you
&gt;a relaxing dinner cuddling up with your 2 loving pets sounds real good after a day of hard work providing for them
&gt;unfortunately you get no such thing as you have to watch both coco and bailey like a hawk because they both keep tying to steal your food every 10 seconds
&gt;no rest for the weary
&gt;at least bailey is over her embarrassment</textarea>
