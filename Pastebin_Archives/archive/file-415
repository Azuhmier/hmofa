I go by Axel. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1"> I know this is going to sound insane, But Please lend me your eyes: Anon is NOT a terrorist. I have been his best friend since childhood, and I used to talk with him until he went missing suddenly nine months ago. I had discovered that he had been visiting this hulking animal that he had befriended a few days prior. Upon my discovery, Anon had begged me to keep quiet and to act like I had seen nothing. But I must have been followed because then I was hit with something and passed out, only to awake back in my home. Starting from that day, anon and the creature went missing. I tried to contact local enforcement but they did nothing to help my case. Anon’s parents came to visit him and contacted me when they found that he was missing. They attempted to send out a missing persons notice but it never got the light of day. There is far more going on with Anon that we are being told, every time Anon has been spotted nobody gets hurt. If Anon is really as bad as we are being told, he would be killing people as to make sure he isn’t reported, or to stop them from contacting authorities! Hell, call it fear mongering but given that his capture ensures his death he would likely cause some sort of bloodbath everywhere he went. This is if he really is the terrorist that he is alleged to be. I ask for this to go public because I at least want people to be weary and think over what is happening with him. “</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You put your heart and soul into this.

Follow me, I’ll take you there. We’ll get you some food and water.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re somewhat weary.

Except with modern houses.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you enter the area, the man starts talking about the place </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”We’re a more secluded folk. We live a comfortable life with power and such, but we have our own food from hunting, fishing, farming, you name it. On specific occasions, someone will leave town to go shopping and bring back some things.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Secluded?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So… they don’t know about..</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This could be good. Very good.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”What about when you have kids? Surely you must have a housing issue?” you ask</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Well... we can have houses built here. But there are some people that chop away their own lot and, with help, build a cabin. But as it currently stands, we have plenty of room for people. Some of these houses hold multiple families with room to spare.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wow…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The man eventually leads you to his house</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’m Jackson, by the way.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Ah.. Michael.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t know why and how you came up with that lie so quickly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Same name as my son!” Jackson cackles </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Haha..” you chuckle as well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reach his doorstep, and he leads you inside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You close the door behind you, of course.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Honey, we have a visitor!” Jackson calls out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Who is it?” you hear a soft female voice chime from a different location in the building </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”A camper that had to run from that damned bear!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Are they alright?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jackson takes a look at you for a moment before turning away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”His clothes are a bit rough but he’s fine!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He turns to you again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You can stay here tonight, and we’ll see about getting you back to town tomorrow, okay?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t want to stay here all night</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a moment of silence, you nod “Alright.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’ll just sneak out at night.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Thank you so much.” You say</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jackson nods “Make yourself at home.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jackson showed you to the room you would be ‘sleeping’ in tonight</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s pretty simple.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bed with the usual sheets, blanket, two pillows.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A dresser, nightstand, a lamp. All on the second floor with a single window</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Seems like they’re prepared for a resident here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You thanked him and laid down to relax for the next half hour</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually, you hear a knock at the bedroom door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Dinner’s ready, Michael.” You hear Jackson’s voice speak from behind said door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Thank you, on my way.” You reply, getting up from your anxiety filled respite</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia is going to be worried sick.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After pausing for that brief moment, you exit your room and find the kitchen.

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tires squealing, you only give a passing glance towards the sound</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You see a right arm coming straight for your

class="de1">&gt;You make a sharp left, speeding through a downtown area</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;People are now scattering away from the sidewalks for their own sake.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Traffic is cluttered here, but given that you are on a bike, you make your way through it by force. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;By a stroke of luck you don&#039;t get hit as you zip through an intersection. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Speeding through the town, you take a turn into an alley and continue speeding through downtown until you come out the other end.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have no idea where you&#039;re going.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The helicopter is still onto you, and the sirens are still in the distance.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You continue racing, but no ideas come to mind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Soon enough the cruisers have caught back up and you are fighting to not get caught.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You think about trying to hide out in woods.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As if that would work.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You spot a neighborhood that is under construction to your right</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After speeding forward for another few hundred feet, you swing to the side and suddenly break, your bike leaning forward heavily</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At this point it&#039;s instinct.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were a party guy and learned a few things.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Swing the bike 180 degrees with the momentum, turning around on the spot.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Proceed to start back towards the neighborhood, swinging around a few cops in the process.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You break to cut speed and send yourself into said neighborhood.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Roads are done but houses are being made.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Upon hearing you roaring down the street, and the sirens following suit, workers clear the roads. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Except one guy who had headphones on, carrying some 2x4s while listening to music</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lucky him, he spots you out of the corner of his eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That, and the cops behind you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He throws down the boards and sprints away just in time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You go right over the boards, feeling a few kick up after your rear tire passes over them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The sounds that followed tells you they hit the cruiser and caused the cruiser to stop.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That&#039;s just one.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You notice that one of the buildings only has a wooden frame finished, and that on the other side there&#039;s another road.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Proceed to steer left off the road and go through said building.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One stops, the other continues speeding down the road towards another turn.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take another left on the following road and speed down, only to see the previous van turn into the road and start speeding towards you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Speeding?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quickly realize they&#039;re playing chicken with you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re in a motorcycle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Initiate a U-turn and start speeding the other way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At least the bike is faster than the van.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Cruiser comes down from the other end of the road</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s already been at least ten minutes into the chase.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You come to a stop a fair distance between the two.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thankfully enough the cruiser stopped.</div></li><li

time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There were no other noises you could hear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One moment, on your bike.</div></li><li

&gt;This will allow you to catch up to the current time in the story. but if you insist here is a summary:
&gt;You are Anon in current year
&gt;After going to a friend&#039;s party you discover some massive anthro wolf in the woods on the way home
&gt;She is initially violent towards you but you quickly become friendly
&gt;You name her &quot;Mia&quot;
&gt;Eventually you are both discovered by the government and knocked unconscious, being taken to an underground facility.
&gt;You are given an ultimatum: either work with the facility on their bioweapon project, or serve prison time for interfering.
&gt;You choose to stay there. 
&gt;You spend over 3/4ths of a year here with Mia.
&gt;You are put through gruesome training and you yourself become a weapon with time.
&gt;Eventually you and Mia Escape
&gt;This is a continuation of that story.


==========================================================


--------------- POV: T H O M A S    L A R K  -----------------
-=-=- ONE WEEK SINCE ESCAPE -=-=-
&gt;&quot;Mr. Lark, you are responsible for allowing this escape to happen.&quot;
&gt;As fucking if
&gt;It was the fucking schedule fuckup that the scientists caused.
&gt;Anon was waiting for that god damned moment and he exploited it the instant he could.
&gt;You hold your tongue
&gt;&quot;I-I apologize, Chairman.&quot; You stammer
&gt;&quot;Now we will be giving you a gracious opportunity, Mr. Lark. Despite your incompetence, we are allowing you access to our resources so that you can track and execute your problem child.&quot;
&gt;Execute?
&gt;So they want you to kill the subject?
&gt;You almost ask why, but you stop yourself
&gt;&quot;Thank you for your kindness, Chairman.&quot;
&gt;&quot;If you complete this objective and prove yourself Mr. Lark, you will be paid a generous sum. Generous enough that you can retire with your family for the rest of your days.&quot; He speaks calmly.
&gt;Your eyes widen
&gt;&quot;I will not fail you, Chairman!&quot;
&gt;You hear a chuckle
&gt;&quot;Of Course not. you are free to go, Mr. Lark.&quot;
&gt;You are then escorted out of the room by guards

&gt;Though your mind wavers about the payment, you immediately get to work
&gt;You quickly establish communications with investigators.
&gt;”Give me a rundown of our leads.” You speak to your earpiece.
&gt;”Sir, With the sightings that have been noted, we expect they are on the northern half of the Kansas/Missouri line and moving northeast.”
&gt;Not too far off. They must have ran south when they initially escaped. Perhaps Anon is hoping to reach back home?
&gt;He can’t possibly be that stupid.
&gt;You hope he is.
&gt;”As for our eyes on his colleagues?” You ask
&gt;”No notable activity. No calls have been attempted.” 
&gt;”How about the scouting teams?” 
&gt;”Nothing, sir.”
&gt;You grit your teeth in agitation
&gt;”Keep me posted.” You say, biding your anger.
&gt;”Yes sir!” is the response you get
&gt;You will slip up, Anon. And I will be there.
&gt;You don’t realize the hell that you have released upon yourself.
&gt;”Get me a vehicle, escort, and investigation grew in three hours. we’re making a trip to that border.” you calmly command.
&gt;”Immediately, sir.”
&gt;I’m going to have both of your heads mounted on my wall, fuckwit.

---------------------------POV CHANGE:   A N D Y  “A X E L”  H O L D T -----------------------------------

&gt;You’re sitting at home
&gt;Watching the morning news while relaxing in sweatpants and a t-shirt.
&gt;Having a damn good bowl of grits.
&gt;Every few days they *have* to emphasize this. They’re repeating it so that the public believes it.
&gt;Here it comes.
&gt;Sure enough, the news ticker swaps to “ANON, DANGEROUS TERRORIST WITHIN MISSOURI AREA”
&gt;A female news anchor starts speaking
&gt;”Now for the ongoing story about Anon.”
&gt;”Enforcement services and sources are saying that The man is within the Missouri area, and that civilians should remain vigilant for spotting this terrorist so that he can be punished. Anon is wanted for mass murder, attempted murder, treason, espionage, alongside other horrid crimes.”
&gt;”We cannot exclaim enough how important it is that you remain safe while this person is loose.” She is making so many hand motions… Is this supposed to be brainwashing? 
&gt;”If you see anyone who resembles this person do not hesitate to IMMEDEATELY contact enforcement.” 
&gt;They then show a picture of Anon.
&gt;A few different ones, actually.
&gt;With your mood quickly going south, you change the channel.
&gt;This is completely set up.
&gt;Anon is NOT a terrorist
&gt;NOT a traitor to his country
&gt;None of the shit they’re spewing on the news is true.
&gt;You’ll be outed as a madman if you try and call them out alone.
&gt;But people may at least question the full story if someone steps out.
&gt;But..
&gt;He does look very different from when you last saw him
&gt;Anon.. I tell myself that you haven’t changed but that obviously isn’t true.
&gt;You’re still my best friend, right?..
&gt;Is that wolf alright?
&gt;You look like you’ve been through hell, friend…

&gt;After sitting in silence thinking about your childhood friend, you make up your mind.
&gt;You’re going to offer reports to local journalists and hope you can score an interview with a local news group.
&gt;No way any journalist can resist the chance to make an article about a criminal and his best friend.
&gt;You start posting online about you having information regarding Anon.
&gt;You’re blown off as some shitposter trying to get attention.
&gt;Though you do eventually get a PM from someone going by the username “Infwr”
&gt;The message reads “You seem like you’re batshit insane, but you should send a whistleblower message to infowars. Your message will be read and if they believe you and you give them your info you’ll be contacted for an interview. A lot of people push it off as a meme, but Infowars has been correct more times than some people would like to admit. You’ll definitely be heard here and cause a shitstorm in the media. I hope you’re being truthful here, because this could be worse than snowden. It’s not every day that someone is framed as a national enemy.”
&gt;You reply to the user, sending your thanks.


&gt;You get to the infowars website via your laptop and find their contact page.
&gt;As the message told you, you can enter your contact info.
&gt;You sit there in anxiety for a minute
&gt;It’s all or nothing.
&gt;The idea that the entire nation may hear of this both bolsters you and makes you scared.
&gt;Your heart begins to race
&gt;Anon is being wronged and outed as a terrorist, and you’re afraid because a few eyes may look your way?
&gt;You feel your blood begin to boil
&gt;No! This is for your best friend!
&gt;You enter your cellphone number and your email so that they can contact you back, and your message is as follows:

&gt;” My name is Andy Holdt. I go by Axel. 
 I know this is going to sound insane, But Please lend me your eyes: Anon is NOT a terrorist. I have been his best friend since childhood, and I used to talk with him until he went missing suddenly nine months ago. I had discovered that he had been visiting this hulking animal that he had befriended a few days prior. Upon my discovery, Anon had begged me to keep quiet and to act like I had seen nothing. But I must have been followed because then I was hit with something and passed out, only to awake back in my home. Starting from that day, anon and the creature went missing. I tried to contact local enforcement but they did nothing to help my case. Anon’s parents came to visit him and contacted me when they found that he was missing. They attempted to send out a missing persons notice but it never got the light of day. There is far more going on with Anon that we are being told, every time Anon has been spotted nobody gets hurt. If Anon is really as bad as we are being told, he would be killing people as to make sure he isn’t reported, or to stop them from contacting authorities! Hell, call it fear mongering but given that his capture ensures his death he would likely cause some sort of bloodbath everywhere he went. This is if he really is the terrorist that he is alleged to be. I ask for this to go public because I at least want people to be weary and think over what is happening with him. “

&gt;You put your heart and soul into this. You pray that your message is seen and that this goes public.
&gt;You close your laptop and sit in silence, leaning into the arm of your couch and holding your head 
&gt;”Don’t give in yet, Anon, your fight has only begun.” You mumble to yourself

&gt;You sit in silence, eyeing your phone.


=======================POV CHANGE: A N O N ====================

&gt;”Hey you’ve gotta pay for- oh shit!”
&gt;You don’t even bother trying to hide it,
&gt;You’re stealing from a gas station for food and water.
&gt;The Clerk at the counter just recognized you.
&gt;Within seconds you sprint out the door and down the street, feeling the cold breeze rush past you
&gt;You’ve been stuck inside for months, you almost welcome the cold sensation.
&gt;You’re a few blocks from a turn that leads you into a forest that you and Mia are residing in at the moment.
&gt;You stole meat products for Mia and a variety of things for yourself
&gt;You’re trying to make your way home.
&gt;Not sure why but it feels like the right thing to do.
&gt;You know they will likely be waiting for you there.
&gt;It’s scary…
&gt;Living on your own, afraid of being caught, having to steal because you can’t get a job to make money.
&gt;But you have to fight against this
&gt;It seems futile and you’ve broken down thinking about this before.
&gt;But you aren’t going to keel over so easily.
&gt;For Mia’s sake.

&gt;You quickly and easily make your way into the forest and made your way to Mia.
&gt;She was waiting for you, and her tail wags quickly and her ears perk up once she sees you
&gt;”I’m  back, Mia.” You smile and greet her.
&gt;You walk over to her and sit next to her, she quickly moves her tail to cover you partially
&gt;She knows that you get cold, so she has a good excuse to cuddle with you at night, and actions such as this.
&gt;You begin splitting the food with Mia.
&gt;You mostly open Bags of beef jerky for her and she ends up pouring the bag into her mouth and chews it all
&gt;She really likes beef jerky.
&gt;She leans over and kisses your cheek after this, while you’re eating some food of your own
&gt;You’re watching your nutrients so that you can maintain this body.
&gt;You also have a morning routine alongside this.
&gt;Meanwhile, you’re thinking about home
&gt;Axel, The family back at the restaurant, mom and dad.
&gt;You start thinking about your times growing up
&gt;All the trouble you and Axel got in, your first crush, that elementary school teacher who gave you advice that followed you through highschool, the whole nine yards.
&gt;You feel Mia poke you
&gt;You were being dead silent while eating, drifting off.
&gt;You smile up at her “Sorry, I was thinking about a few things.”
&gt;She looks worried
&gt;”I’m alright, don’t worry.”
&gt;Mia leans down, and slightly nuzzles you
&gt;You feel your qualms get whisked away in the moment, and you reach to hold her muzzle
&gt;”I love you too, Mia. We’ll find a way out of this mess, me and you.” 
&gt;She quietly wraps her arms around you, and pulls you into a hug
&gt;The gown you made her is dirty, and has a few rips due to thorns, twigs, issues that clothing gets when in the wilderness for extended periods of time.
&gt;You return her hug
&gt;She holds you for at least a minute, before letting go
&gt;You pet her head, and finish eating your bootleg meal.
&gt;”Perhaps we’ll find another beautiful sight today while we’re on the move.” You calmly speak to Mia
&gt;She nods, and stands up, taking a few steps away and looking at you expectantly.
&gt;Even though you just ate, you know you need to keep moving.
&gt;You stand up and climb onto Mia, holding onto tufts of fur.
&gt;”I’m ready, Mia.”
&gt;She nods, and takes position, before starting into a sprint
&gt;How quickly she accelerates; you can’t get used to it.
&gt;She eventually leans over and starts running on all fours.
&gt;You never quite appreciated the wilderness as much as you do now.
&gt;With her, at least.

&gt;You spend the rest of the day traveling on Mia’s back. Giving her directions occasionally.
&gt;You had initially found regularly riding on her back a bit demeaning, but you came to deal with it.
&gt;Mia managed to find a cave that a bear was living in
&gt;Past tense because she scared it away.
&gt;She never did hunt for food…
&gt;Probably for a few reasons
&gt;The idea of her acting savagely like that pains your heart for some reason
&gt;You’re glad she doesn’t. or that you don’t have to ask her to.

&gt;You two are cozying up to one another and getting ready to sleep when you feel hunger settle in.
&gt;As much as you want to ignore it, you decide that the sooner you take care of this, the sooner you can properly sleep.
&gt;You get up, and start walking towards the entrance when you suddenly hear Mia wimper
&gt;You turn and see here looking at you with a concerned look
&gt;”I’m fine, just a bit hungry. I’m gonna go look for some berries or something to eat.”
&gt;You return to her momentarily to kiss her and pet her ears 
&gt;”I’ll be back, sweetheart.” You coo gently, and touch your forehead to hers
&gt;She eases up, and you can hear her tail thumping against the ground 
&gt;”Go ahead and sleep, you did a lot of running today.”
&gt;Your words and show of affection seem to really be getting to her. She rolls a bit in a fit of happiness, before looking at you and nodding.
&gt;You feel yourself grinning, before standing up and exiting the cave.
&gt;The sun is setting, but there is plenty of light for you to be able to know where you are going.

&gt;You’ve been looking around for what you are assuming to be half an hour, and the sun is setting fast 
&gt;No berries, nothing of the sort that you would think is edible 
&gt;You hear rustling behind you
&gt;Your heart skips a beat as you turn around and ready yourself for a fight
&gt;Instead, it’s a middle-aged man.
&gt;With a rifle
&gt;You freeze
&gt;”Hello, stranger. Are you alright? Are you lost?”
&gt;He hasn’t drawn his rifle 
&gt;He doesn’t seem to recognize you, either.
&gt;”Speak up, kid.”
&gt;”Ah.. I was camping out here with a friend when a bear attacked our camp. I’ve been running.”
&gt;When was the last time you told your honest truth to anyone except Mia?
&gt;”I think I’ve been left here, I don’t know what way is back to my camp.”
&gt;The man seems concerned.
&gt;”Damn bear. I was coming out here to end that pain in the ass.”
&gt;Your stomach growls.
&gt;”I’m from a small nearby town. Follow me, I’ll take you there. We’ll get you some food and water.”
&gt;You’re somewhat weary. What if he is leading you into a trap?
&gt;’You can run.’
&gt;Good point.
&gt;Sure enough, the man leads you back to a town.
&gt;It shouldn’t even be called a town.
&gt;It’s small enough it should be a village of sorts. Except with modern houses.
&gt;As you enter the area, the man starts talking about the place 
&gt;”We’re a more secluded folk. We live a comfortable life with power and such, but we have our own food from hunting, fishing, farming, you name it. On specific occasions, someone will leave town to go shopping and bring back some things.”
&gt;Secluded?
&gt;So… they don’t know about..
&gt;This could be good. Very good.
&gt;”What about when you have kids? Surely you must have a housing issue?” you ask
&gt;”Well... we can have houses built here. But there are some people that chop away their own lot and, with help, build a cabin. But as it currently stands, we have plenty of room for people. Some of these houses hold multiple families with room to spare.”
&gt;Wow…

&gt;The man eventually leads you to his house
&gt;”I’m Jackson, by the way.” 
&gt;”Ah.. Michael.”
&gt;You don’t know why and how you came up with that lie so quickly.
&gt;”Same name as my son!” Jackson cackles 
&gt;”Haha..” you chuckle as well
&gt;You reach his doorstep, and he leads you inside.
&gt;You close the door behind you, of course.
&gt;”Honey, we have a visitor!” Jackson calls out
&gt;”Who is it?” you hear a soft female voice chime from a different location in the building 
&gt;”A camper that had to run from that damned bear!”
&gt;”Are they alright?”
&gt;Jackson takes a look at you for a moment before turning away
&gt;”His clothes are a bit rough but he’s fine!”
&gt;He turns to you again
&gt;”You can stay here tonight, and we’ll see about getting you back to town tomorrow, okay?”
&gt;You don’t want to stay here all night
&gt;After a moment of silence, you nod “Alright.”
&gt;You’ll just sneak out at night.
&gt;”Thank you so much.” You say
&gt;Jackson nods “Make yourself at home.”

&gt;Jackson showed you to the room you would be ‘sleeping’ in tonight
&gt;It’s pretty simple.
&gt;Bed with the usual sheets, blanket, two pillows.
&gt;A dresser, nightstand, a lamp. All on the second floor with a single window
&gt;Seems like they’re prepared for a resident here.
&gt;You thanked him and laid down to relax for the next half hour
&gt;Eventually, you hear a knock at the bedroom door.
&gt;”Dinner’s ready, Michael.” You hear Jackson’s voice speak from behind said door
&gt;”Thank you, on my way.” You reply, getting up from your anxiety filled respite
&gt;Mia is going to be worried sick.
&gt;After pausing for that brief moment, you exit your room and find the kitchen. You see Jackson and his family
&gt;His wife is beautiful, but has a soft demeanor.
&gt;Jackson himself- now that he seems to be in attire more fitting to be at home, rather than hunting- seems like your average joe. 
&gt;And then there is someone that seems about your age.
&gt;”Michael, meet my son, Micheal.”
&gt;When he looks at you, you can tell he doesn’t like you already.
&gt;”Nice to meet you.” You politely say
&gt;”You as well.”
&gt;”And my wife, Michelle.”
&gt;She gives you a beaming smile
&gt;”I’m glad you’re alright, that bear has been a hassle for us, especially recently.”
&gt;”Thank you again for your hospitality, and the meal, ma’am.”
&gt;”Of course, help yourself.”
&gt;You take your seat at the table, and begin eating
&gt;It’s a soup of sorts.
&gt;It’s delicious, fresh, unlike anything you had previously eaten
&gt;Your eyes widen, and you have to speak up
&gt;”It’s Amazing. Nothing in the cities can compare to this.”
&gt;You hear Jackson’s wife giggle.
&gt;”Fresh ingredients after all, I’m glad you like it.”
&gt;The table then falls silent as everyone enjoys their meal.
&gt;God knows you are.

==================POV CHANGE===================

&gt;You’re in a car, part of a crew that are driving out to the border in an attempt to finally end this bullshit. You’re sitting in shotgun
&gt;”Mr. Lark.”  A voice speaks from behind you
&gt;”Yes?” you respond
&gt;”I’m getting an update that Andy Holdt has made a phonecall to a media group called Infowars.”
&gt;You let out a ‘tsk’ and reply. “Nobody listens to what they say. Don’t worry about it.”
&gt;You’re sitting in the car for the next few hours.
&gt;Flying would be too high-profile, this is the better option.
&gt;”Sir.” The same voice again.
&gt;”What is it?”
&gt;”Another update on Andy Holdt, appearently a journalist did some research after hearing the interview on infowars, and they posted an article, it had initially gone under our radar but it is quickly becoming popular.”
&gt;”How many views on the page?”
&gt;”Under five million viewers in traffic.”
&gt;”You know what to do. Shut it down and set an official investigation against Axel. Have him detained until this is over.”
&gt;”On it, Sir.”
&gt;You couldn&#039;t try to touch infowars. Though It&#039;s a meme on the internet, if you tried to remove their interview shit would be even worse.  

=================POV CHANGE====================

------------------------POV: A X E L -----------------------
&gt;you’re on the phone
&gt;Alex jones has you live on air on a radio.
&gt;”Now.. just to go over this again, You’re saying that Anon is NOT a terrorist, and that there is something behind the scenes?” He says inquisitively 
&gt;”Yes sir.”
&gt;”I think you’re loopy.” He says bluntly.
&gt;You’re silent
&gt;”But something does feel off.” He then speaks back up
&gt;”You’re right. He has been on the run, yet… not a single casualty.” 
&gt;”Whistleblower, You’re onto something. We have found no records of anyone being buried due to Anon. No deaths, no information as to what makes him a traitor, no speckle of a detail of this sudden event.”
&gt;”If you are right, our entire system is going to be flipped bottom-up to root out the filth.”
&gt;”I’m sorry for speaking so much but we’ve gotta get to break now. Any parting words?”
&gt;”Don’t watch for Anon, watch for what they’ll do to keep you quiet.” You say the first thing that comes to your mind, and almost immediately you regret it.
&gt;”Thank you again for coming on and AMERICA! THINK THIS OVER!”
&gt;”Goodbye whistleblower, and godspeed.”
&gt;And just like that, it’s over
&gt;You feel your heart sink
&gt;You lock your doors and sit silently on your couch
&gt;You’re afraid, but you hope they believe you.

&gt;You spend the rest of your day ever so slightly paranoid, but watching television.
&gt;It’s evening now, and you’re checking a message on your phone.
&gt;”HEY MAN”
&gt;Oh it’s your buddy that always uses caps.
&gt;Everyone has someone like that, right?
&gt;”What’s up?”
&gt;”I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE NEWS, AND THIS IS GETTING POPULAR, IS THIS THE SAME ANON YOU TELL ME ABOUT? ALSO IS THIS YOU? IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU.”
&gt;He links you an article labeled: “DOUBT FOLLOWING TERRORIST LEGITIMANCY” 
&gt;…?
&gt;Holy fuck
&gt;It’s you.
&gt;They have a recording of your chat with Alex Jones
&gt;They say that they couldn’t find any information or a blood trail for Anon’s appearances.
&gt;Yes!
&gt;This is it!
&gt;You have at least planted the seed of doubt for Anon!
&gt;The page refreshes suddenly and-
&gt;404
&gt;Huh?
&gt;Where did it go?
&gt;You&#039;re refreshing the page
&gt;Sorry, the page you&#039;re looking for is not available, or does not exist. 
&gt;Again.
&gt;Sorry, the page you&#039;re looking for is not available, or does not exist. 
&gt;AGAIN, GOD DAMNIT!
&gt;Sorry, the page you&#039;re looking for is not available, or does not exist. 
&gt;You try opening the link your friend sent you
&gt;Sorry, the page you&#039;re looking for-
&gt;You close the page and message your friend
&gt;&quot;Hey, what happened to the page? I was reading and it 404&#039;d&quot;
&gt;&quot;DUNNO MAN, MY BEST GUESS IS EITHER THE SITE DOESN&#039;T WANT A LOONIE, OR THE BIG MAN HIMSELF SAID &#039;NO&#039; AND HAD IT SHUT DOWN, LOL.&quot;
&gt;After reading this, you have a sudden burst of rage and throw your phone.
&gt;You can hear it crack against the wall without even looking
&gt;&#039;I can get another&#039; you think to yourself
&gt;Of course that was a possibility. 
&gt;Why you didn&#039;t think of it sooner is beyond you. 
&gt;Within moments you find yourself pacing back and forth
&gt;Debating with yourself what you should do next
&gt;Bide your time and let it take this take hold?
&gt;Take the initiative and keep pushing this?
&gt;Damnit, damnit!
&gt;Takes you a few minutes before you make your decision
&gt;You sit back down
&gt;You’ll bide your time.
&gt;Not for too long.
&gt;You could be skipping a few steps.
&gt;Just because you found one article that a friend said is ‘popular’ doesn’t mean you can start anything..
&gt;But… you do know some people you can rely on..
&gt;You jog over to your phone, and pick it up
&gt;Damaged, but still functioning
&gt;Good.
&gt;You quickly take your phone and start making calls.

&gt;Jimmy, a ghetto black guy that has a decent side to him. He is a troublemaker, but only because he is a one man neighborhood watch. Same goes for when you were in school with him; Some dumbass trying to harass some sexy girl to get her number though she said to leave her alone, he&#039;d lay them out. Some guy checking car doors, he&#039;d knock their lights out.
&gt;You tell Jimmy you&#039;re starting a vigilante group
&gt;&quot;Mob justice? listen man, I may get in some shit, but I don&#039;t have a direct plan to years behind bars.&quot;
&gt;You sigh
&gt;&quot;Then how about I ask you this: I would like you to join not because of what we stand for, but what we will do.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh? and what is that? Beat up some man in his early twenties for pick-pocketing?&quot; 
&gt;&quot;No, we plan to pull up a rotten stump by it&#039;s roots. Something is wrong with the news, Jimmy. That is all I can say.&quot;
&gt;He goes silent for a moment, before letting out a agitated growl
&gt;&quot; Tch... Man... ugh. Fine, I&#039;ll join, but, I&#039;m not doing anything stupid. You know how to reach me, brotha.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Thanks, man. I&#039;ll call you and see where we can meet up, alright?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sounds cool. Later man.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Bye&quot;
&gt;You hang up
&gt;Next.

&gt;Alex, Built like a brick house, he planned to get into boxing, but quickly stepped back when he began doubting his skills, and claimed that he had a glimpse at the underground. He now practices martial arts alongside his boxing, but only ever used it five times, tops. All of those times were either in self defense, or defense of another person, and the person attempting whatever he declared a threat left on a stretcher. 
&gt;&quot;Alex, dude, I want to ask a big favor of you.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not gonna fight off another loanshark.&quot;
&gt;&quot;N-Not that!&quot; you quickly respond
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s up?&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s about Anon.&quot;
&gt;&quot;What of him? he killed a few people and is now an enemy of the state. Looks like he could crack necks like a nutcracker cracks nuts.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t think that&#039;s true.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Listen, Axel. You may have known him for a while, but I am sure there are things even you don&#039;t know about him.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Alex, nobody has died, we would have gotten names and interviews from mourning families.&quot; 
&gt;&quot;. . . Andy. You speak awful highly of a terrorist.&quot;
&gt;&quot;HE IS NOT A TERRORIST FOR FUCKS SAKE!&quot; you shout
&gt;&quot;THERE IS NO BLOODTRAIL FOLLOWING HIS FUCKING SIGHTINGS, NO NAMES, NO CRYING CHILDREN OF THEIR FUCKING PAPA OR MAMA BEING DEAD!&quot; 
&gt;You snapped for a moment there
&gt;Taking a few breaths, you open your mouth to speak
&gt;&quot;You really believe this, Andy.&quot; Alex speaks
&gt;&quot;I do. because Anon is my best friend.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sigh... Alright man, count me in. What&#039;re we gonna do?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nothing at the moment, I&#039;ll call you when we&#039;ll meet up and discuss this in person.&quot;
&gt;&quot;... Okay, bye Axel.&quot; Alex hangs up
&gt;Alex wasn&#039;t easy to convince of anything, but you&#039;re sure that he believes you now.

&gt;You prepare to make another call, and realize that your phone suddenly has no connection.
&gt;Just a moment ago you had full bars.
&gt;What the-
&gt;You hear a knock at your door
&gt;Your heart sinks
&gt;. . . 
&gt;Another knock, kinda agitated this time
&gt;You slowly and quietly step over to a window near the front door.
&gt;You part the curtains and blinds slightly.
&gt;Oh. Just Sarah.
&gt;She always had a crush on anon, now that you think about it.
&gt;You open your front door, and she comes barging in.
&gt;&quot;A-a-Anon! i-i-it can&#039;t be true, r-right!?&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s crying
&gt;So much that she is doing that hyperventilating, doing that &#039;hic&#039; thing people do. 
&gt;&quot;Sarah, please, you suddenly show up and-&quot;
&gt;&quot;A-Anon was your best friend, if anyone I should come to y-you!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sarah, Sit down, please.&quot; 
&gt;After a moment of sobbing, she sits down.
&gt;Thank god.
&gt;&quot;N-No way Anon is a terrorist...&quot; 
&gt;The news has been out for a while... if she is like this now... how bad was she initially?

---------------- POV: A N O N ----------------

&gt;You couldn&#039;t sleep in that room.
&gt;You had been with Mia for so long that any other bed wouldn&#039;t work.
&gt;Not to mention you were worried about her, and she was probably worried about you. 
&gt;So, right as the house goes quiet, you climb out the window and jump down.
&gt;You begin jogging away into the forest, having to rub your eyes and get adjusted to the darkness
&gt;Sure enough, you find your way back to the cave, and step inside, but the cave is too dark for you to see in.
&gt;You hear some shuffling.
&gt;Then swishing of something on the ground
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m back, Mia.&quot; 
&gt;Your only warning is a momentarily grumble of a stomach before you feel her tongue brush your cheek
&gt;But that grumble ached your heart.
&gt;You had eaten a full meal with a family, and she waited here the whole time.
&gt;You smile and feel over to your right, where you feel her chest, and push closer to her, hugging her.
&gt;&quot;Sorry I was gone for so long, Mia. I must have scared you.&quot;
&gt;All you get is a quiet whine in response, and she hugs you in return, nuzzling you
&gt;You kiss the side of her muzzle, and lean into her
&gt;&quot;These people.... Don&#039;t know about us. I was thinking... Perhaps we could stay around here. Just for now. They grow their own food, sell excess crops.. I could start staying with them and perhaps earn my keep. I could start bringing us some good food to eat.&#039;
&gt;Another soft whine.
&gt;That would mean constant separation. She was probably worried that something could happen, and she wouldn&#039;t know.
&gt;Both of you had lived in anxiety of discovery, getting light amounts of sleep, other such things.
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s talk it over in the morning. It&#039;s getting late.&quot;
&gt;He quietly wraps her large arms around you
&gt;She slowly leans over onto her side, pulling you close.
&gt;You close your eyes, and soon enough blankness overcomes your senses and you drift off

&gt;You awake with a gasp.
&gt;Only to inhale fur.
&gt;You roll onto your back and sit up, coughing.
&gt;Soft.
&gt;Soft?
&gt;You look below yourself.
&gt;Oh, Mia had rolled over in her sleep and you were laying on top of her
&gt;She stirred from her slumber from your coughing and was looking at you, ears perked
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not sick, I just woke up to have fur in my mouth.&quot;
&gt;Her tail wags momentarily and she smiles.
&gt;You get off of her and start stretching
&gt;She lets out a yawn and rolls onto her stomach, watching you do your morning routine.
&gt;She didn&#039;t have to do what you did to maintain your body.
&gt;At least not as often as you do.
&gt;Squats, sit-ups, push-ups, handstand, the list goes on
&gt;You finish your workout soon enough and look at Mia
&gt;When you do her ears perk up as she meets your gaze
&gt;You can almost hear her say: &quot;Hm?&quot;
&gt;&quot;For now, let&#039;s try and trust these people. The family that took me in is probably worried about me disappearing last night.&quot; 
&gt;Her ears lower and she looks to the side.
&gt;She lets out a huff, and nods. Then standing up and yawning while she stretched.
&gt;You move over to kiss her hand, before stepping out of the cave
&gt;You hear Mia&#039;s stomach grumble again.
&gt;You sigh.
&gt;&quot;Mia, try and get some berries for the time being, I&#039;ll see about bringing you some food soon, okay?&quot;
&gt;Her ears fold back again
&gt;She doesn&#039;t want to be left alone.
&gt;&quot;Hey.. I&#039;ll be back, alright? I promise that.&quot;
&gt;She seems to slouch slightly, looking away before looking at you, and nodding.
&gt;&quot;Mia?&quot;
&gt;She holds her gaze on you
&gt;&quot;I love you.&quot;
&gt;Her ears perk up, you can see her blush and her tail swishes on the ground, kicking up leaves as she straightens back up
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll bring food for you, and I&#039;ll come out here at night as well.&quot;
&gt;She nods, and you turn to jog off. It was early in the morning.
&gt;The sun had barely risen, and you don&#039;t know what time it is, but you felt like you slept at least decently last night.

&gt;You must be one lucky devil. 
&gt;Seems their community is so tightly knit that they leave their doors unlocked, and nobody was awake, excluding a few people.
&gt;They didn&#039;t give you any strange looks, they just continued on their way.
&gt;This will work in your favor if you make this regular.
&gt;You couldn&#039;t stomach leaving Mia out there on her own.
&gt;You slip into the fridge, and find leftovers.
&gt;Target spotted, but not now.
&gt;You were at least making sure there was something to bring.
&gt;There was half a pot of last night&#039;s soup.
&gt;Plenty even for Mia.
&gt;It&#039;s a factor of finding a time and place to slip out with said pot.
&gt;You hear something to your right and your head jerks almost instinctively.
&gt;You&#039;re staring at a wall suddenly
&gt;It was just a showerhead being turned on, but it made you jump.
&gt;Your body was still paranoid, even if at the moment you were relatively calm.
&gt;You let out a long breath.
&gt;Honestly you could use a shower yourself.
&gt;Your clothes were absolutely filthy.
&gt;You probably stink, but you have gone noseblind to your own smell long ago
&gt;How they didn&#039;t say anything about that is beyond you.

&gt;You hear footsteps approaching from a hallway behind you
&gt;In a swift motion you close the fridge and start calmly searching through their kitchen for glasses
&gt;&quot;Looking for something?&quot;
&gt;It was Micheal.
&gt;You look at him and chuckle
&gt;&quot;Ah.. This looks bad, doesn&#039;t it? I&#039;m just trying to look for the cups.&quot; 
&gt;It wasn&#039;t completely false, you were somewhat parched.
&gt;&quot;Ah.&quot; He calmly says, nodding as he steps over next to you and opens up a cupboard that was right next to where you were searching.
&gt;He pulls out a plastic green cup and offers it to you
&gt;&quot;Our water here is probably better than the water in the cities, too. The piping has to come all the way over to us, so I assume there might be some difference in the quality of the piping so they don&#039;t have to come all the way out here again.&quot; 
&gt;You take the cup, and chuckle, moving over to the sink as you spoke.
&gt;&quot;Doesn&#039;t sound like they&#039;d do something like that to be honest. Not like a government to put effort into things. Local or as a whole.&quot;
&gt;You hear him chuckle behind you as you fill your glass, drinking. Your smile from moments ago faded instantly.
&gt;&quot;God forbid they see anything but their own interests.&quot; he responds
&gt;If there was a difference in the water, you couldn&#039;t tell. It had been a long time since you had anything but individual bottles you&#039;d steal from a quick stop.
&gt;You proceed to drink down four or five cup fulls.
&gt;&quot;If you&#039;re drinking that much, I&#039;d think you were on death&#039;s door.&quot; 
&gt;You turn to him, smirking again.
&gt;&quot;I didn&#039;t have anything since when your dad saved me from that bear.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Fair enough.&quot; He looks to the pantry
&gt;&quot;Want cereal or something?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well... First I could really use a shower.&quot;
&gt;Whoever was showering is still in there
&gt;&quot;well, we only have one bathroom in that house, so that&#039;ll have to wait.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ah... Well, any cereal will do I guess.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Suit yourself.&quot;

------------------ POV: T H O M A S  L A R K  ------------------------------------

&gt;You&#039;ve reached the border, and your crew is starting to investigate, splitting up and asking anyone they can if they&#039;ve spotted Anon or his pooch.
&gt;You&#039;re looking over what evidence you can, and you&#039;re brainstorming about every fucking move he could make
&gt;You have the means of taking them down, you just have to find their asses.
&gt;You&#039;re going between being angry and calmly thinking it over
&gt;Some people are saying they saw something big moving in the woods, but can&#039;t remember which direction it was going.
&gt;They are covering their trails and search dogs aren&#039;t finding anything in the local area.
&gt;&quot;Mr. Lark.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Better be good news for both of our sakes.&quot; You snarkily reply
&gt;&quot;It is, sir. We have a general area of his last location.&quot;
&gt;Your brows raise &quot;Well, why are you here and not there searching?&quot;
&gt;&quot;There&#039;s a small rural community that has taken residence there.&quot;
&gt;&quot;And? Let&#039;s fucking go. Pronto! Asap! Go!&quot; 
&gt;You stroll back over to your car, the agent who just informed you now informing everyone else
&gt;You&#039;ll rip up that whole fucking hick community if you have to.
&gt;This is all to catch a &#039;terrorist&#039; after all.
&gt;You smile to yourself.
&gt;Your time is nigh, Anon. For you and your bitch.
&gt;You&#039;re the one that fucked up, deal with it.

&gt;Your men have weapons that will make short work of a man and an overgrown mutt.
&gt;All he has is an overgrown mutt. 

------------------------ POV: A N D Y  &quot; A X E L &quot;  H O L D T ---------------

&gt;You only hear wind rushing past your ears, sirens and horns blaring 
&gt;Your forehead stings like hell
&gt;You&#039;re weaving in and out of traffic.
&gt;They busted into your house without another word, you had moved only just fast enough for a taser to fly past your shoulder.
&gt;Sarah was already gone.
&gt;She had left only ten minutes prior. Lucky her.
&gt;You threw your table to the ground and ran for your garage.
&gt;It was those MiB you suspected were camping out.
&gt;You had a car, but you last left your keys in your Kawasaki.
&gt;You had no time to put on your helmet or leather, you were going out in a t-shirt and jeans.
&gt;You heard shouting right next to you as your bike starts up.
&gt;Tires squealing, you only give a passing glance towards the sound
&gt;You see a right arm coming straight for your head
&gt;Someone was trying to clothesline you right down.
&gt;You don&#039;t quite duck.
&gt;Thrust your chest down against the bike right as your tires catch their grip.
&gt;The arm misses, and you&#039;re out the garage and going 60mph in under 10 seconds.
&gt;Shouting quickly fades, but sirens pick up nearby right as you pull out onto the highway
&gt;Seems someone tipped off the cops too.
&gt;You peek behind yourself.
&gt;Yep, there&#039;s a cruiser gaining on you, and more lights in the not-so-far distance.
&gt;You turn forward again, right for a stray ice-cube from someone&#039;s burger-king cup to slam right into your forehead.
&gt;Fucking hurt, but you wipe your forehead and continue.
&gt;From your right comes another cruiser from an intersection, moving to cut you off.
&gt;Lucky for you almost everyone is being a good citizen and pulling over.
&gt;Right as the cruiser comes to a stop in front of you, you swing right to go behind it, mind working in overdrive
&gt;He was likely still in drive, better to go behind than risk him just inching to send you skidding.
&gt;&quot;STOP YOUR VEHICLE!&quot;
&gt;Sorry officer, if we&#039;re at this point yelling that is kinda pointless, isn&#039;t it?
&gt;Your little maneuver didn&#039;t slow down the now three cruisers that were already on your ass.
&gt;And you hear a chopper above now.
&gt;Glorious.
&gt;All because you tried to help your friend.
&gt;If they want to chase, you&#039;ll give them one.
&gt;More weaving in and out of traffic, around some cars.
&gt;You make a sharp left, speeding through a downtown area
&gt;People are now scattering away from the sidewalks for their own sake.
&gt;Traffic is cluttered here, but given that you are on a bike, you make your way through it by force. 
&gt;By a stroke of luck you don&#039;t get hit as you zip through an intersection. 
&gt;Speeding through the town, you take a turn into an alley and continue speeding through downtown until you come out the other end.
&gt;You have no idea where you&#039;re going.
&gt;The helicopter is still onto you, and the sirens are still in the distance.
&gt;You continue racing, but no ideas come to mind.
&gt;Soon enough the cruisers have caught back up and you are fighting to not get caught.
&gt;You think about trying to hide out in woods.
&gt;As if that would work.
&gt;You spot a neighborhood that is under construction to your right
&gt;After speeding forward for another few hundred feet, you swing to the side and suddenly break, your bike leaning forward heavily
&gt;At this point it&#039;s instinct.
&gt;You were a party guy and learned a few things.
&gt;Swing the bike 180 degrees with the momentum, turning around on the spot.
&gt;Proceed to start back towards the neighborhood, swinging around a few cops in the process.
&gt;You break to cut speed and send yourself into said neighborhood.
&gt;Roads are done but houses are being made.
&gt;Upon hearing you roaring down the street, and the sirens following suit, workers clear the roads. 
&gt;Except one guy who had headphones on, carrying some 2x4s while listening to music
&gt;Lucky him, he spots you out of the corner of his eyes
&gt;That, and the cops behind you.
&gt;He throws down the boards and sprints away just in time.
&gt;You go right over the boards, feeling a few kick up after your rear tire passes over them.
&gt;The sounds that followed tells you they hit the cruiser and caused the cruiser to stop.
&gt;That&#039;s just one.
&gt;You notice that one of the buildings only has a wooden frame finished, and that on the other side there&#039;s another road.
&gt;Proceed to steer left off the road and go through said building.
&gt;One stops, the other continues speeding down the road towards another turn.
&gt;You take another left on the following road and speed down, only to see the previous van turn into the road and start speeding towards you.
&gt;Wait.
&gt;Speeding?
&gt;You quickly realize they&#039;re playing chicken with you.
&gt;You&#039;re in a motorcycle.
&gt;Initiate a U-turn and start speeding the other way.
&gt;At least the bike is faster than the van.
&gt;Cruiser comes down from the other end of the road
&gt;It&#039;s already been at least ten minutes into the chase.
&gt;You come to a stop a fair distance between the two.
&gt;Thankfully enough the cruiser stopped.
&gt;You turn to look at the van.
&gt;It didn&#039;t.
&gt;There was no time.
&gt;There were no other noises you could hear.
&gt;One moment, on your bike.
&gt;The next, breaks squealing.
&gt;Steel grille meets you and your Ninja.
&gt;You are thrown from your bike down the road.
&gt;The world is spinning.
&gt;Everything is light.
&gt;These are the following sounds you can process before your senses instantly go out.
&gt;Crack.
&gt;Tear.
&gt;Snap.
&gt;CRASH.
&gt;Crack.
&gt;CRASH.

----------------- P O V:   ? ? ? -----------------------

&gt;This is bad.
&gt;Beyond bad.
&gt;There&#039;s no hospital for you to take him to.
&gt;You had seen him on live TV being chased down.
&gt;As foolish as it may have been, you weren&#039;t going to let him get caught.
&gt;There are people you would trust more than your parents, even some authorities.
&gt;Axel was one of them.
&gt;At least to you.
&gt;He was laid out in the back of your 1970 dodge charger bleeding like someone stabbed a bag full of soup
&gt;Going to have to get that all cleaned out and replace the seats. 
&gt;the front end of your &quot;All American Muscle&quot; was fucked
&gt;This was the car your dad had given you. He had previously taken it and worked on it himself
&gt;Your old man was a car nut
&gt;At least explains why it&#039;s still running after T-boning that van.
&gt;It said Dodge on your car. They didn&#039;t.
&gt;Hood had fluttered away in the wind
&gt;Engine was heating up as the cooling hose was dangling around
&gt;But you had at least shaken off the officials.
&gt;Your memory barely remembers it
&gt;You aren&#039;t used to acting and thinking at the same time
&gt;Not in these kinds of situations
&gt;Axel had a bone sticking out of his arm, his ribs are most assuredly broken, his head was bleeding, and god knows what else under his torn clothing.
&gt;You calm down enough to pull into some woods, and shuffle your hands over his pockets to see if he has his phone on him
&gt;Nope.
&gt;&quot;FUCK!&quot; 
&gt;You call out in a short bout of anger, rubbing your face and looking around before pulling out your own phone and desperately searching through your contacts. 
&gt;No.
&gt;Not them.
&gt;They SURELY won&#039;t.
&gt;Not this one either.
&gt;Why do you still have this one added?
&gt;You don&#039; think the-
&gt;You quickly ring up sarah
&gt;You know she and Axel got along
&gt;You got her number in hopes of getting a date, but you hadn&#039;t called her yet
&gt;Riiiiing...... riiiinnggg.... riiiinngg...
&gt;&quot;Hello?&quot;
&gt;&quot;SARAH!- Sarah! Sarah-&quot;
&gt;&quot;Uhm- What?&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Alright you need to listen closely. Axel is bleeding like a stuck pig in the back of my car and I can&#039;-&quot;
&gt;&quot;472 Wyden street.&quot;
&gt;Without hesitating you go into reverse and pull out onto the road
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s something to do with Anon, yeah?!&quot; She asks
&gt;No clue who that is. Must be another friend of Axel&#039;s 
&gt;&quot;No clue but he was being chased down and labeled as a terrorist sympathizer. There&#039;s no hospitals to take him to where they won&#039;t just lock him up!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I uh... I uh...&quot; 
&gt;She stutters and slaps what sounds like a counter a few times
&gt;&quot;AXEL IS GOING TO DIE IF WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING SARAH!&quot;
&gt;&quot;JUST GET HIM HERE I&#039;LL DO SOMETHING!&quot; 
&gt;And then she hung up
&gt;you toss your phone into the passenger seat, wiping your face as you speed down roads. You knew that Wyden street was downtown, rich part of the city. You could make it there.
&gt;But the question is if Axel will.

&gt;You floor it through the city, reaching a tall building.
&gt;Seems her dad bought out the whole place.
&gt;There&#039;s a few cars parked out front, in front of the entrance.
&gt;There wasn&#039;t time to waste, you come to a sudden stop in your trashed muscle car, and essentially fly out of the driver side door.
&gt;You swing open the back seat, and drag Axel out.
&gt;He wasn&#039;t breathing anymore.
&gt;There was a lot of blood.
&gt;It was like you dunked your hand into a thin paint. 
&gt;You start to stumble towards the front door of the building.
&gt;Your heart is racing.
&gt;You bust through the front door using your shoulder, looking around in panic
&gt;&quot;SARAH!&quot; You cry out
&gt;&quot;Put him down, we&#039;ll take care of it!&quot;
&gt;You turn your head, and see a group of people in medical uniforms.
&gt;Sarah is there as well, but her hands are over her mouth at the mangled sight of Axel.
&gt;It&#039;s grim.
&gt;Reluctantly, you lay Axel out on the floor.
&gt;They seem to snap out a stretcher as they jog towards you.
&gt;You step aside, in the moment realizing that you are now covered in blood.
&gt;&#039;Dear god... Axel... Don&#039;t kick it yet...&#039; you think to yourself.


------------------------- P O V:  T H O M A S  L A R K -------------------------------
&gt;You have since arrived in the general vicinity of the border location where you and your team suspect The subject is located.
&gt;There are a few different squads investigating a circular area, with weapons, tranquilizers, and hounds.
&gt;Thankfully enough you aren&#039;t drawing attention, as the area here is less than active, and those who do ask are simply told that there is an investigation for a terrorist. 
&gt;you&#039;re staring at a map, thinking of various possibilities while you wait for any possible updates on your radio for possible leads.</textarea>
