            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Sometimes, a little push is all you need to start a relationship.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">      _______________________________________________________</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	A cold rush of wind blows past you, the sound of rustling autumn leaves filling the dusk sky. Shivering slightly, you pull up your flat cap, looking up at the familiar glowing sign of the corner cafe, the word ‘Timbers’ brightly lit above you. Tipping your hat down, you ‘greet’ the cafe’s mascot sitting next to the large lettering, a happy and proud Timber wolf smiling at passersby.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Continuing on, you push the door open, a bell chiming out as you take a few steps inside and give a polite wave to the Aardwolf worker. “Hey, Belle. I’ll take the usual, feel free to take however long, I don’t have much to do this evening.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She’d let out a dry chuckle. “You know we have more than just our special blend coffee, right?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Shrugging the Aardwolf would continue. “Buuuut, as long as it keeps you coming back I won’t complain,” she says, finishing with a wink, followed by a snicker a few seconds later.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Rolling your eyes, you raise your arms in faux surrender. “Don’t blame me when you guys are the only shop here that knows how to make a good cup of coffee.” Giving her a light smile you look around the decently sized cafe, inspecting the Canid workers lazing around during this late hour, a thought that never crossed you suddenly coming to the forefront of your mind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Belle, why does it feel like this place only employs Canines?” Tilting your head slightly as you ask. Placing a hand on her hip she looks upwards slightly and lets out a quiet ‘hmmm’ as she thinks, “No clue, it’s always been like this. I’m not gonna question it.” She finally answers with a shrug.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Sighing you sarcastically reply, “Gee, thanks Belle, that was very enlightening. Would you please indulge me by sharing more of your wisdom about your job?” Finishing with a laugh. She’d give you an evil grin while putting on her best customer service voice. “You’re welcome, I’d love to tell you more about this amazing job I have.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Shaking your head you give a final smile to her before sauntering off to a free table, pulling out your phone you look at the time, ‘Huh, nearly 9 already. Oh well.’ shrugging, you place your phone back in your pocket and stare out into the starry night, letting your imagination go wild.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You’re only pulled out of your trance-like state when someone taps your shoulder. “Uh, sir? Your Woods mix coffee.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Looking around you come face to face with a tall Black back Jackal woman holding your cup. “Oh- Erm... T-thank you.” You sputter out as you try to regain your composure “Uh, take this.” Fumbling around you quickly take out your wallet and pull out 5 dollars and hand it to her. “Just a little tip for you.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her yellow eyes widen a bit in surprise before taking the bill. “Thank you, Anon!” she’d excitedly say before turning back around, a bushy black tail wagging behind her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A single thought hits you. ‘Wait, how’d she know my name?’ but it’s quickly shot down by another ‘You’re a regular here, of course the workers would know your name.’</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As you drink your coffee, Belle sits down next to you giving a cheeky smile. “Got nothing else to do for the next hour, why not just talk to the only interesting person here?” You’d merely chuff in response to the Aardwolf.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As you two talked the night away,  the other workers left early as customers weren’t coming in, leaving you and Belle as the last two souls in the cafe. Saying your goodbyes to each other, you’d leave the cafe and let her close it for the night on her own as you walk the same familiar sidewalk home. Taking a few steps away from the cafe, the smile on your face quickly disappears. Pulling out your phone, you open your texts only to be greeted by a mostly empty wasteland, the only names on there being your mother’s, father’s, and Belle’s. Pressing your mother’s tab, you’re greeted by a photo of her in a hospital bed, cables hooked up all around her body.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You want to put your phone back down but continue on, a voice mail  attached to the photo. Pressing it, you move your phone to your ear, quietly listening to your mother’s frail voice. “Oh, Anon. Honey I’m doing fine, don’t worry sweetie.” Tearing the phone from your ear, you let your arm fall limply to your side, tear droplets stinging the corner of your eyes. Taking a deep breath, you close your eyes and try to get your feelings back in control.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Sighing, you start to move again before you’re suddenly pulled into the alleyway you stood in front of, an odd smelling piece of cloth shoved against your mouth and nose with a furred arm wrapping around your neck. It takes you a few seconds to register what’s happening, before you start to fight back in a futile attempt, as your eyelids begin to get heavy and your vision blurs. The last thing you see is a pair of glowing yellow eyes piercing the darkness enveloping you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As you fade off into unconsciousness, faded images dance around your vision as sounds repeat themselves in your mind. Your mother’s words, your conversation with Belle before you’re suddenly torn from them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Groggily lifting your head you slowly open your eyes before hissing at the light suddenly intruding on your adjusting eyes. “Agh! Jeez… these dreams are getting weirder and weir-” You stop yourself as you try to move your sore arms to find them bound in rope sitting on your stomach. Panicking you quickly look around your surroundings suddenly realizing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">This isn’t your home.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Your panic quickly elevates into a full blown freak out, you scream for help desperately looking for any possible escape routes. Struggling against your bindings, you hear quick footsteps moving to the room you were in, swallowing the invisible lump in your throat, you hasten your actions, trying with more futile desperation to get the ropes off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Giving up on trying to wear the ropes out, your eyes immediately lock on the door waiting anxiously for the footsteps to finally stop. As the doorknob twists and the door creaks open, you’re greeted by the same Jackal  from yesterday, her worried expression suddenly changing to one of total glee. Nearly skipping towards you, she kneels down a bit, bringing her lanky frame down to be face to face with you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Oh Anon, You’re awake!” She’d happily squeal out before making a gesture towards you. “Oh oh oh, I made your favorite! Bolognese… Erm, heh heh… Let me go grab it so you can eat.” Standing up to her full height, she would hurry off leaving you in a confused stupor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You lie there slack jawed at a total loss of what to say, questions fly through your mind, the biggest at the forefront. ‘What’s my plan to get out of here.’ Glancing down to the restraints around both your hands and feet, you throw away the idea of sneaking out. As you lie on the bed thinking of escape plans, you don’t realize the Jackal snuck back in holding a bed tray of assorted food items, and like she said, all of them being your personal favorites.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As she places the tray over your legs, she sits on the edge of the bed and gives you a loving smile. Staring at the food on the tray you look her in the same yellow eyes you saw that night.  “How the fuck did you know this?” She’d giggle in response. “Oh, Anon.

As you continue your waddle you think to start hopping towards the door, thinking for a few seconds while you move, you shake your head ‘I don’t trust myself enough to not make noise when hopping’.

        <textarea class="textarea">	Sometimes, a little push is all you need to start a relationship.
      _______________________________________________________

	A cold rush of wind blows past you, the sound of rustling autumn leaves filling the dusk sky. Shivering slightly, you pull up your flat cap, looking up at the familiar glowing sign of the corner cafe, the word ‘Timbers’ brightly lit above you. Tipping your hat down, you ‘greet’ the cafe’s mascot sitting next to the large lettering, a happy and proud Timber wolf smiling at passersby.

Continuing on, you push the door open, a bell chiming out as you take a few steps inside and give a polite wave to the Aardwolf worker. “Hey, Belle. I’ll take the usual, feel free to take however long, I don’t have much to do this evening.”

She’d let out a dry chuckle. “You know we have more than just our special blend coffee, right?” 

Shrugging the Aardwolf would continue. “Buuuut, as long as it keeps you coming back I won’t complain,” she says, finishing with a wink, followed by a snicker a few seconds later.

Rolling your eyes, you raise your arms in faux surrender. “Don’t blame me when you guys are the only shop here that knows how to make a good cup of coffee.” Giving her a light smile you look around the decently sized cafe, inspecting the Canid workers lazing around during this late hour, a thought that never crossed you suddenly coming to the forefront of your mind.

“Belle, why does it feel like this place only employs Canines?” Tilting your head slightly as you ask. Placing a hand on her hip she looks upwards slightly and lets out a quiet ‘hmmm’ as she thinks, “No clue, it’s always been like this. I’m not gonna question it.” She finally answers with a shrug.

Sighing you sarcastically reply, “Gee, thanks Belle, that was very enlightening. Would you please indulge me by sharing more of your wisdom about your job?” Finishing with a laugh. She’d give you an evil grin while putting on her best customer service voice. “You’re welcome, I’d love to tell you more about this amazing job I have.”

Shaking your head you give a final smile to her before sauntering off to a free table, pulling out your phone you look at the time, ‘Huh, nearly 9 already. Oh well.’ shrugging, you place your phone back in your pocket and stare out into the starry night, letting your imagination go wild.

You’re only pulled out of your trance-like state when someone taps your shoulder. “Uh, sir? Your Woods mix coffee.” 

Looking around you come face to face with a tall Black back Jackal woman holding your cup. “Oh- Erm... T-thank you.” You sputter out as you try to regain your composure “Uh, take this.” Fumbling around you quickly take out your wallet and pull out 5 dollars and hand it to her. “Just a little tip for you.”

Her yellow eyes widen a bit in surprise before taking the bill. “Thank you, Anon!” she’d excitedly say before turning back around, a bushy black tail wagging behind her. 

A single thought hits you. ‘Wait, how’d she know my name?’ but it’s quickly shot down by another ‘You’re a regular here, of course the workers would know your name.’

As you drink your coffee, Belle sits down next to you giving a cheeky smile. “Got nothing else to do for the next hour, why not just talk to the only interesting person here?” You’d merely chuff in response to the Aardwolf.

As you two talked the night away,  the other workers left early as customers weren’t coming in, leaving you and Belle as the last two souls in the cafe. Saying your goodbyes to each other, you’d leave the cafe and let her close it for the night on her own as you walk the same familiar sidewalk home. Taking a few steps away from the cafe, the smile on your face quickly disappears. Pulling out your phone, you open your texts only to be greeted by a mostly empty wasteland, the only names on there being your mother’s, father’s, and Belle’s. Pressing your mother’s tab, you’re greeted by a photo of her in a hospital bed, cables hooked up all around her body.

You want to put your phone back down but continue on, a voice mail  attached to the photo. Pressing it, you move your phone to your ear, quietly listening to your mother’s frail voice. “Oh, Anon. Honey I’m doing fine, don’t worry sweetie.” Tearing the phone from your ear, you let your arm fall limply to your side, tear droplets stinging the corner of your eyes. Taking a deep breath, you close your eyes and try to get your feelings back in control.

Sighing, you start to move again before you’re suddenly pulled into the alleyway you stood in front of, an odd smelling piece of cloth shoved against your mouth and nose with a furred arm wrapping around your neck. It takes you a few seconds to register what’s happening, before you start to fight back in a futile attempt, as your eyelids begin to get heavy and your vision blurs. The last thing you see is a pair of glowing yellow eyes piercing the darkness enveloping you.

As you fade off into unconsciousness, faded images dance around your vision as sounds repeat themselves in your mind. Your mother’s words, your conversation with Belle before you’re suddenly torn from them.

Groggily lifting your head you slowly open your eyes before hissing at the light suddenly intruding on your adjusting eyes. “Agh! Jeez… these dreams are getting weirder and weir-” You stop yourself as you try to move your sore arms to find them bound in rope sitting on your stomach. Panicking you quickly look around your surroundings suddenly realizing.

This isn’t your home.

Your panic quickly elevates into a full blown freak out, you scream for help desperately looking for any possible escape routes. Struggling against your bindings, you hear quick footsteps moving to the room you were in, swallowing the invisible lump in your throat, you hasten your actions, trying with more futile desperation to get the ropes off.

Giving up on trying to wear the ropes out, your eyes immediately lock on the door waiting anxiously for the footsteps to finally stop. As the doorknob twists and the door creaks open, you’re greeted by the same Jackal  from yesterday, her worried expression suddenly changing to one of total glee. Nearly skipping towards you, she kneels down a bit, bringing her lanky frame down to be face to face with you.

“Oh Anon, You’re awake!” She’d happily squeal out before making a gesture towards you. “Oh oh oh, I made your favorite! Bolognese… Erm, heh heh… Let me go grab it so you can eat.” Standing up to her full height, she would hurry off leaving you in a confused stupor.

You lie there slack jawed at a total loss of what to say, questions fly through your mind, the biggest at the forefront. ‘What’s my plan to get out of here.’ Glancing down to the restraints around both your hands and feet, you throw away the idea of sneaking out. As you lie on the bed thinking of escape plans, you don’t realize the Jackal snuck back in holding a bed tray of assorted food items, and like she said, all of them being your personal favorites.

As she places the tray over your legs, she sits on the edge of the bed and gives you a loving smile. Staring at the food on the tray you look her in the same yellow eyes you saw that night.  “How the fuck did you know this?” She’d giggle in response. “Oh, Anon. Why wouldn’t your girlfriend know this?” You’d cringe back at the use of the word ‘girlfriend’. The two of you were the farthest you could be from the term ‘girlfriend’ and ‘boyfriend’.

Deciding not to push your luck farther with more questions you opt to look at the tray of Bolognese, your baser instincts yelling at you to eat it while your rationale tells you to keep your wits about you, you don’t want to develop some sort of Stockholm syndrome towards her. As you stare at the food the woman stands back up and rounds the bed soon finding herself nestled up lying next to you, a fuzzy arm finding itself draped over your chest.

Snuggling closer to you she’d turn on the T.V across the room and place down the remote, then grabbing a fork and stabbing it into the untouched meal. “Honey, you know you have to eat. Here let me help.” lifting a chunk of a meatball towards your mouth, pulling yourself as far as you could away from her you’d look away and grunt, a sudden jerking bringing you closer to her again.

Groaning, you lie on your side, trying to force yourself to stay awake but soon slip into unconsciousness without noticing, as you slip into a dreamless sleep you stare into the vast emptiness of the black void faint images and sounds appearing once more, your eyes snap open as you gasp for air looking around to find yourself in the same room as yesterday.

Sitting up, you realize the Jackal was gone, looking around the room once more you take a deep breath, ‘If you don’t take your chance now, you’ll never get it again.’ Kicking your legs off the sides of the bed you stand up and start an awkward waddle towards the door.
