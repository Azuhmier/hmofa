Winter is almost here so its already dark outside and the temperature is taking a nose dive.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your coming up to the corner of the suburb where you live when you are flagged down by a guy in overalls. He is standing by a black van with what looks to be a hastily stenciled on Animal Control logo on the side.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Can I help you?&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The guy is remarkably well groomed for a dog catcher.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Do you live around here sir?&quot; He asks in response.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Yeah I do, what&#039;s this about?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He gestures back to his van where you notice a second guy sitting in the passengers seat. It&#039;s dark out now but he seems to be wearing a large pair of black sunglasses anyway. Weird.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;We&#039;ve been called in to investigate reports of a wild animal in the area, we&#039;re just informing all locals to keep an eye out for it and to not approach if they see anything.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You really don&#039;t need this, not today.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Really?&quot; You ask. &quot;What kind of animal? We&#039;ve had strays wander around out here before and there were no warnings put out then.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The control guy is completely deadpan when he answers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Its some kind of reptile.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Wut.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Reptile? Like as in what? A snake? Lizard? Crocodile or whatever?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The town where you live isn&#039;t exactly in the middle of croc country and the last thing to saunter down this street sporting scales was your idiot neighbour Ted who bought himself a pair of alligator skin boots, which turned out to be fake, and promptly dissolved when his dog took a whiz on them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Again with the same blank look and an annoyingly monotone voice he answered.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;We are uncertain at this time sir but we believe it to be dangerous.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Handing you a card through the car window he continues.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;If you do see anything out of the ordinary then please call the number on that card immediately and we will be there in minutes.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Questions come to mind at this point, such as if he doesn&#039;t know what it is then how does he know it&#039;s dangerous? Or since when does animal control hand out business cards with nothing on them but a cell phone number? No name or anything?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As you move to ask however he cuts you off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;If you do happen to encounter anything then please don&#039;t try to take pictures either. Sudden flashes of light or loud noises may make it hostile. Just call the number and leave the area&quot;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Again a lot of info on something they haven&#039;t even got a description of.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Oh and one last thing. Make sure to secure all of your doors and windows tonight. With the temperature going down it may try find shelter indoors.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Now that you were thoroughly freaked out he simply turned and went back to his van. Ignoring your attempts to question him further.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With little other choice you continue the short journey home.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Quickly getting inside your front door you breathe a sigh of relief. It was the weekend at last. Plenty of things to keep you busy but it would be stuff you enjoy and at your own pace. Unless anything eats you that is.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With a stretch you drop your jacket and head for the kitchen, time for a snack and probably bed. The chill in the air stops you in your tracks however.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You are currently in the process of renovating the house by yourself with the intention of selling it on when your done, the heating hasn&#039;t been installed yet so cold is expected but a breeze?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Looking in to the kitchen you see the source of the problem. The previous owners had a cat, which meant a cat flap; replacing the door had been on your list but not just yet, the gaping hole where the flap used to be however would certainly merit a change of plan...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You stand there for a second, your tired mind trying to comprehend what you see...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;  A small, desperate part of you hopes that this is the work of some regular old burglars, but a closer look at the damage suggests otherwise.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The cat flap lay in pieces on the floor over by the fridge, not a cheap piece of plastic but a sturdy electronic type designed not to open for just anything...  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; What really catches your eye though, the claw marks.  Something had left deep gouges in the splintered wood around the hole.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Something had kicked in the flap pulled itself in, widening the hole in the process.  Something... Big.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Apart from the main downstairs hall and the kitchen, the house was in darkness.  What if it was still in here?  Whatever it was?  Watching you!?!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You spin around and scan the room and doorway.  Nothing.  You hold your breath and listen.  Still nothing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The thought of searching the rest of the dark house for some nameless horror by yourself somehow didn&#039;t appeal to you at this point.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The odd card in your pocket sprung to mind.  There were two weirdos around the corner actually looking for this thing that could help.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Trying to keep a wary eye on your surroundings you pull out your phone and punch in the number.  Almost immediately a voice answers.  One you recognise.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Pest control.&quot;  Its Mr Monotone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Uh yeah its Anon?  We spoke outside just a few minutes ago?  I think there&#039;s something in my... wait a minute.  Did you say Pest Control?  I thought you said you were Animal Control?&quot;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Silence.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Well whoever you are I think the thing your looking for has broken into my house!  Can you help me or not!?!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; There was some muffled whispering on the other side for a moment before he answered.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Address?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; To be fair he was true to his word, in less than two minutes they had found their way to your front door.  Rather than waiting for you to let them in however, they opted to kick it down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; If it hadn&#039;t been your life going down the tubes you might have found the ensuing mayhem quite funny.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The two dog catchers/pest controllers/fancy dress enthusiasts or whatever stood in your hallway, panting, they must have run all the way here.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Monotone in his perfectly clean overalls wile Mr Sunglasses stood in a crisp black suit.  Both were holding what you could only describe as an oversized hand cannon.  The kind of weapon that could leave a hole in your wall the size of a watermelon and seriously ruin the day of your next-door neighbours.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Where is it?&quot; Oh look, sunglasses speaks.  You just stand there and point at your ruined backdoor.  Then at your ruined front door.  Unable to speak</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; They nod to each other and start searching the house, breaking just about everything not nailed down and stopping to tear up everything that was.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Now the house was still a work in progress, nowhere near finished and covered in paint sheets so theoretically it should be difficult to make a mess of.  It was still (at least in your opinion) unnecessary to tip out the contents of your toolbox over the floor, pull up all the sheets and THEN tip over the paint cans and walk it all through the house.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; They made sure to check (and in some way break) every inch of the house before finally coming back down to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You all stand there staring at each other for a few seconds before Monotone breaks the silence.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;There&#039;s nothing here.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;You think!?!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Where your home had started as a worksite it now resembled a war zone and you were ready to blow.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Who are you people?!?  What the hell is going on and WHAT THE FUCK DID THAT TO MY DOOR!?!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With that Sunglasses steps forward and you find yourself on your ass.  The sight of the two large handguns in your face tells you its not a good idea to get back up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Sunglasses stoops down to your level and smiles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Let me make this simple for you. It doesn&#039;t matter who we are, it doesn&#039;t matter what has been here or where it went. All that should matter to you is that it is not here now.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He reaches over and pats you on the shoulder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;You&#039;ve been very lucky, more than you know. We are going to leave now and carry on with our search. If your smart, your going to forget any of this happened. Its either that or you become a problem. One that needs to be dealt with. Do we understand each other?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The smile never left his face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You nod slowly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With that they holster their weapons and walk back out through the broken front door. Monotone stops at the the threshold and calls back to you over his shoulder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Remember Mr Anon, we will be around if you see anything else tonight. Just give us a shout if you need us.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With the chuckle brothers gone you are left alone, cold and feeling very exposed. With two gaping holes into your home, the knowledge that the only so called &#039;help&#039; in the area just threatened to have you dealt with, and of course, some unknown creature lurking outside... You just really want to curl up in a ball and cry.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Outside the two figures get back into their van and wait.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;You think she&#039;ll come back?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;She made the effort to break into this one, cant see that she would spook so easily. If we wait she&#039;ll make an appearance.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Sending an update to the other search teams they settle in and wait.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">--------------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Chapter 2</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Not being one to sit back and take what life dishes out you spend the next hour sealing the breaches.  Your front door is re mounted back on its hinges and locked up tight.  You even use some spare lumber to sure it up so that no one (or no thing) can break it down again, for tonight at least.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You patch the hole in the backdoor but, feeling a bit worried about any uninvited guests, shuffle the big old fridge over and block it completely.  There is an outlet near the door so gone off milk will not be a problem for tomorrow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The mess left by your other guests is not going to be so easy to deal with.  Weeks of work undone in minutes and weeks more added to the schedule before you can get back on track.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You have a local day job in town to cover your day to day bills and spend your weekends working on the house, the prospect of starting it all over again tonight is just too much so you call it a day.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Upstairs is as much a mess as the rest of the house but your bed seems untouched.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Thank heavens for small mercies...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Entering your bedroom you realise that it is not completely unscathed.  There was not much in there to start with but your king size bed, a night table, a few boxes and a closet.  Everything but the bed and table has been toppled, emptied or scattered around the room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With a sigh you decide to leave it til morning.  You want nothing more than to curl up in bed and just sleep.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Before you do however, one last thing.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You shut the bedroom door, lock it and wedge it shut with some of the boxes.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With your repairs downstairs and these extra precautions you should survive til morning, or at least feel safe enough to get some sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Stripping down to your boxers and an old t-shirt you finally hit the sack.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A few minutes in you realise something is wrong.  The reason why eludes you but something in the back of your mind wont let you sleep until you figure out what it is.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Sitting in the dark you close your eyes and try to work out what&#039;s bothering you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Putting together a mental checklist usually helps sort through your problems so here goes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Doors? - all locked and blocked.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Windows? - all sealed shut.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Creepy places something can hide? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You have to stop and think about this one.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The chuckle brothers (as you now considered them) had if nothing else, been thorough.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; They had opened every cupboard, closet, box and door in the place and there had been no sign of anything.  Whatever had broken in must have left the same way.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You were safely locked in here, in your nice warm bed with...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your bed.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The only thing in the house they didn&#039;t apparently rip, flip or trash.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; They would have checked it though right?  The first place anyone looks for monsters is under the bed right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Just as a sense of panic starts to build you stop dead.  No breathing, thinking, even your heart goes quiet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; From somewhere near the end of your bed you hear the smallest of scratches across the wooden floor.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You lay there in the dark with your eyes shut, hoping against hope that its just your overtired imagination playing tricks on you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You feel a pressure on the bottom end of the bed as someone, no, something climbs up ever so silently.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You open your eyes and slowly try to see what is there.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; In the darkness is the faintest of silhouettes, as you adjust to the lightless room it feels as if time itself has stopped.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A light &quot;hissssssss&quot; drifts up towards you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Shit.  Shit shit shit shit shit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Fight or flight time, going to make this thing work for its meal!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your body chooses to freeze instead.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Crap.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The figure crawls slowly further up the bed, becoming clearer with each movement.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The first detail that strikes you is a pair of slightly glowing orbs, its eyes.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; They shine dimly in the dark almost like a cats.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It is approaching on all fours but you are frozen, too terrified to try run or even look away...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The creature has moved close enough to be almost on top of you now, hissing more frequently as it closes the gap.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It takes a car passing outside to finally break the spell on you, its headlights momentarily flashing across your visitor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It balances atop of you, its reptilian head hovering over yours.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A row of razor sharp teeth slashed across its partially open maw, almost like a grin.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You just about make out the outline of a large pointed tail waving behind it before the light is gone, temporarily stealing your night vision along with it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Then its on you.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With another hiss it grabs your shoulders as you try to flip out of bed.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You make it half way out before it pulls you back in.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A scream starts but dies in your throat as its fiendishly strong but lithe arms wrap around your chest from behind, a set of large and sharp talons prick at your chest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You wait for the inevitable feeling of teeth sinking into your throat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The world throws you another curveball however.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Its snout comes to a stop just to the left of your sweating head, and it speaks.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Cold, so cold.&quot; It whispers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;You are warm, so warm.  Stay.  You stay here, in warm.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With that it pulls you down into the covers and wraps itself around you.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; In your shock you note that it is indeed icy cold, you feel its smooth scaled body pressing against yours as it pulls you in tighter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It whispers to you again as you lay entwined in the dark.  &quot;Mmmgghissssss.. Yessss you are warm.  We sleep...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With that it fell silent, except for the steady rhythm of its breathing.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The words of Mr Monotone came back to haunt you then.  &quot;Its getting cold out.  It may try getting inside to warm up.&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As you lay there in the dark, a glorified body pillow for the scaled intruder you had inadvertently locked yourself in with, you realised it was going to be a long night.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">---------------------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; For the first hour or so you try various ways to extract yourself from the brain bending situation you have somehow landed in.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; When you started your trip home earlier this evening the sirens call of your bed was just about all you could hear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Now that you were trapped here however, escape was the only thing on your mind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; First you tried a direct approach.  The sound of the creature&#039;s breathing seemed to suggest that it had fallen asleep.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It had its arms clutched tightly around your chest and midsection from behind, so you started there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With your still free arms and hands you slowly try to pry it&#039;s clawed hands (at least they feel like hands, not enough light to check) free.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; If you could just loosen it&#039;s grip and slip out of bed then you had a fighting chance of making it to the door, or throwing yourself through the window.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The result was not what you hoped.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With a displeased hiss coming from behind you it tightened it&#039;s grip around you and actually snuggled in closer.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Whereas before you only had the sensation of its arms and upper body to deal with it now placed its snout up against the base of your neck, just where it meets your back.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You feel it&#039;s legs pull up behind yours and tuck in close.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A third appendage slinked down between your legs and looped around your left leg.  Either the tail you caught sight of earlier was really quite dexterous or this thing was a male, scarily well endowed, and getting excited.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You tensed and waited.  The grip it had on you made breathing a bit more difficult and with something wrapped around your leg your mind was playing all kinds of nightmare scenarios.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nothing happened.  You couldn&#039;t feel any teeth on your neck and the tail (breathe Anon, just breathe) made no more moves.  After a moment you feel a warm blast down your back as the creature lets out a contented &#039;huff&#039; and continues sleeping.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Ok, time for plan B.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The direct approach hadn&#039;t worked.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; If anything it had made matters worse.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The creature had you in what felt like a death grip and you had been promoted from body pillow to full on little spoon.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You had never been the &#039;little&#039; part of this equation before.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Before climbing in to bed you had left your cell on the night table, your hands were still free so it dawned on you that reaching for it was a real option.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The number for the chuckle brothers should still be on there.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You pause and ponder this for a second before trying anything.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Images of them kicking in your door again, falling over themselves in the dark and inadvertently shooting you along with your guest, dance before your eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Fuck those idiots.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You&#039;re going to call the cops, or the army, or a priest or someone... anyone at this point!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your hand slowly moves out from under the covers towards where the table should be... and finds nothing but air.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Adjusting your search area also finds nothing.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; In the process of pulling you down into the bed the creature had kicked the blanket up over you both and was serving now more like a nest, keeping the heat in and blocking your vision.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Pulling back you risk moving the covers up slightly to give you a better look...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Well shit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; In your earlier scuffle you must have knocked the table over, as you can just make out what looks like your phone over by the door.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The battery is sitting next to it.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The thing must have come apart when it hit the floor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; So much for plan B.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; This process of trial, error, and abject failure continued on for a while longer as the creature enjoyed its snooze against you.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Until finally, you give up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The realisation that escape was impossible hit you hard.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It was only a matter of time before it woke up and you graduated from snuggle buddy to breakfast in bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Damn, now you&#039;re hungry.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">-------------------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Cahpter 3</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The sound of chirping birds and the gentle light shining through your blinds herald the arrival of morning.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Sleepily you consider getting up and making some breakfast, the prospect of leaving your warn and cozy bed however is not all that appealing just yet.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It has been some time since you have felt this comfortable first thing in the morning and decide ten more minutes couldn&#039;t hurt.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Hazy memories of shadowy figures with rows of grinning teeth press at the edges of your still semiconscious mind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Damn you had some messed up dreams last night.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It feels like you have been sleeping awkwardly as your left arm is all numb and slightly tingly, you are currently on your back and move to roll over on to your side.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; An unexpected weight on the said arm pins you in place however.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Opening your eyes you slowly look to your left, a feeling of mounting dread rousing you out of your sleepy stupor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Sleeping peacefully at your side is the creature.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your arm is between its head and the pillow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your arm IS its pillow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The events of last night come flooding back.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Not a dream... definitely not a dream.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You must have fallen asleep.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; How exactly you don&#039;t know, with that thing wrapped around you under the covers sleep had not been on the cards.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Keeping very still you take the opportunity to examine the creature properly.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Last night it had been too dark to get a proper look and with it holding you from behind there had been nothing else you could do but lay there and let your imagination go wild.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It lay facing you, still snuggled under the covers and seemingly fast asleep, only it&#039;s head was visible but that was more than enough for you to cope with for the time being.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; There could be no doubt that it was some sort of reptile.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; At fist glance it resembled something from that movie you watched as a kid; Jurassic Park.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Specifically, one of the velocirapters.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It had a long snout, covered with mottled green scales.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Where its teeth had been on full display last night they were now mostly covered with some thin scaled lips, the exception being where its mouth rested upon your arm, affording you a glimpse of the terrifying flesh renderers within.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Its eyes, although still closed, strangely held your attention more than it&#039;s teeth.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The scales surrounding them were not green, but were a slightly darker shade of lilac, almost violet, while the brows were risen and lined with a set of small spikes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; From where its slightly flared nostrils sat at the end of the nose, up the snout and between it&#039;s eyes, the scales were a darker green, almost black.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; From what you could see at this angle, they looked like they might continue down its back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Apart from one clawed hand poking out between you, the rest of it remained hidden from view.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The sensible part of your brain noted that you were now only one trapped arm from freedom, if you could just wriggle out from under its head then you might actually make it out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As you lay there a strange thought took you.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; How did it end up on your arm?  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your last waking memory had been of it clutching to your back, to get to your current position it would have had to let you go, you would have had have flipped over and...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You remember that comfy feeling you had waking up, the one you hadn&#039;t felt in a long time...  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It was when you had last shared a bed with another.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; While you slept you must have hugged it back...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Instead of following this particularly troubling line of thought any further down the rabbit hole you instead try focusing on the task at hand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Acutely aware that a set of razor sharp teeth were resting on your trapped arm.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Very slowly, and very carefully, you try pulling away from the creature. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You are met with mixed results.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You manage to pull about an inch out before it stirs, a low rumble rolls from it&#039;s throat as it reacts to the movement.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Its eyelids flutter and the clawed hand begins to move upwards towards the pillow, and your arm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As you consider just bolting from the bed and preying for a miracle the hand stops, barely a whisker away from your exposed bicep.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Its eyes remain closed,it exhales softly but doesn&#039;t awaken.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Waiting a few minutes to make sure its safe, you try again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Changing tac this time you opt for slowly twisting your arm upwards and away rather than pulling.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Success!  Your free!  All that&#039;s left is to get out the bed and unlock the door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Before you make a move however, that part of your brain pipes up again.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; When the creature moved its arm before it pulled some of the covers up, the thought pops into your head to maybe sneak a peek under the covers at this thing before you run.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; After all... once your out the house and the authorities get here you will in all likelihood never see anything like this creature again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As you reach forward, the other part of your mind chips in.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Nope.  Bad Anon.  Your in bed with some sort of scaled death machine, against your will, and now that your free you want to risk it all for what?  To see if it has tits or something?  Get out while you can you idiot!!!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The life preserving part of your brain wins, this round at least.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You slowly slip out of bed, making sure not to pull on the covers as you go.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The floor is freaking freezing!  It must have been colder last night than you realised.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Tiptoeing across to the door you slowly move the boxes out the way, cursing that they were more likely to get you killed than safe as you had planned.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; There is still no movement from the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; All that&#039;s left is the lock, a simple key turn and...

The treacherous door had turned on you at the last second.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Looking over your shoulder you see... nothing.  No movement from the bed or sounds of angry lizards.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Opening the door you step out into the upstairs landing, almost there!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Directly opposite your room is the bathroom, to the left leads towards the stairs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As you make a move, you hear a hissing noise.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Shit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Looking once more behind you you see the creature is awake.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Its looking right at you, wide awake and only a few feet away.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You try to make a dash for the stairs but end up tripping backwards over some of the clutter from yesterday, sending you falling backwards into the bathroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You&#039;ve barely hit the floor before the covers are off the bed and the creature is dashing forwards, with only a second to react you scoot back and shut the bathroom door with your foot.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; What follows is a dead silence.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nothing collides with the door, no claws come tearing through the thin wood, no hissing or shouting from the creature...  Nothing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; After a few minutes you begin to wonder what the fuck is going on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The door downstairs had been sturdier than this one, even taking the cat flap into consideration.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It had torn through it like it was nothing, why isn&#039;t it coming through now?  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Looking at your options you realise that, although free from the bed, your still boned.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; There is a window in here but unless you somehow drop to the weight and size of a four year old, and chop off your arms, there is no way your going to fit through.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Its also locked, ironically to stop anything trying to get in.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With thick double glazed glass in the frame there was little hope of breaking it with your bare hands to try get attention, even if you did it would cut you to ribbons.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Enticing the thing outside with the smell of fresh blood was not a good idea.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Looking around there is nothing that would make a good weapon either.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You haven&#039;t set a towel rail so no ripping one off the wall as a bludgeon.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; If the crime shows you used to watch are anything to go by then your toothbrush could be cut into a shank maybe?  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With nothing to sharpen it with though there didn&#039;t seem much hope of being able to do anything except give it minty breath when it eats you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Another problem presents itself...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You need to pee.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The thought of turning your back to the door to go or the noise it would make didn&#039;t make it look like the best idea, if that thing charged the door however while you had a full bladder you might just piss yourself.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You would like to think that whoever found your remains would believe you had gone down swinging, not cowering in a pool of your own urine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With that you cautiously get up, turn around and do the business.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; There&#039;s no reaction from outside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With that done you begin to get curious.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; What if its not out there anymore?  What if the sight of you up and moving around while it was still half asleep had spooked it?  What if it had just wanted a warm bed for the night and has left?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your mind pondered these possibilities for another few minutes to the deafening sound of silence outside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You could try wait it out but no one would miss you until at least Monday. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Feeling oddly brave you decide to take a peep out the door, with a just remembered toilet brush in hand you open the door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; What waits for you outside is what you feared most, but not how you expected it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">------------------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Standing outside the bathroom door is the creature.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Rather than poised and ready to pounce however it is actually wrapped almost completely in your bed covers.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; All you can see of it is its head poking out through the top and a pair of large, green scaled feet at the bottom, each sporting three large clawed toes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The sight of it just standing there (looking absurdly adorable) causes your thought processes to stall.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It makes no move to grab or otherwise disembowel you.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A full minute goes by before anything happens, somehow its you who makes the first move.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Rather than trying to make a run or it or bashing it on the nose with your trusty toilet brush, you croak out a &quot;Hi&quot;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The creature cocks its head to the side and responds with a chipper &quot;Hi!&quot; of its own.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Wtf.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your mouth drops open.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It apparently wants to talk.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Whereas it had spoken last night in a raspy whisper it had now responded with a coarse but recognizably female voice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As you try to work out a response it speaks again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Where going?&quot;  It asks.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot; Uhh nowhere...&quot; you respond uncertainty.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; This was going in a very different direction to what you had expected.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It continued to stare at you.  At this point you noticed its eyes, they were an amber colour flecked with small strands of red.  Its pupils were vertical slits of black.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With a huff of relief (it was worried?) it takes a step closer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Good, good!  Is cold.  Come back to warm, yes?&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With that it throws open the covers and gives you a full flash of itself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Oh shit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Answering your hypothetical question from earlier, you notice that it does indeed seem to have tits... of a sort.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Its scaled breast is of a lighter hue than its head or arms.  Starting from the bottom of its long neck, smooth yellow-ochre scales descended down past its abdomen and disappeared between its legs.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The &#039;tits&#039; as you had thought of them, were two mounds where they would be on a woman, except there did not seem to be any sign of areolas or nipples.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Its arms, while partially obscured by the covers she (It silly Anon, not she!!) held seemed to be the same green as the scales on her head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Something that drew your attention were her (don&#039;t make me tell you again Anon) hips.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; While her frame (warning you) was thin and precise she sported a set of hips that your ex would have killed or.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her legs (damn it) were are marvel.  The coloring was the same as her arms and head but flecked here and there with the purple from around her eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The back of your mind recognised the strange shape of them too, it was called digitigrade or something, where she almost seemed to stand on her toes rather than the soles of her feet, but the rest of the brain wasn&#039;t listening.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With a swish the blanket closed back up as she looked at you expectantly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As she stood there, beckoning you back to your own bed, your mind couldn&#039;t quite get itself back into gear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Despite the random turn of events you really should be making a run for it, the thought of climbing back into bed with the strange lizard woman in front of you though was strangely... inviting.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Before your confusion could resolve itself there was a sharp knock from the door downstairs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The demeanor of the creature changed instantly. She dropped the blanket and stood up to her full height, you noted she was a good few inches taller than your 6 foot 2, but much thinner.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her eyes were open wide and her now visible tail stood stretched out behind. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Another, louder set of bangs came from downstairs and a familiar voice shouted out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Mr Anon. Please open the door.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It was Mr Sunglasses.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The effect on your guest was immediate, and she dropped down into what you could only describe as a &#039;combat stance&#039;. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her arms bent out in front of her as if ready to strike, the claws actually got larger at the end of her fingers as she curled them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her face, where a happy (if albeit scary looking) smile had just been changed completely. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The lips pulled back to expose the gleaming teeth within, the small lines of red in her eyes had somehow expanded, changing them from gentle amber to crimson.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; An angry hiss slipped from between the bared fangs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She was within touching distance of you of course while all this was happening. You were suddenly very glad you had decided to take a piss before it had been scared out of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Sunglasses must have come back to check on you and see if anything else had happened during the night, if you didn&#039;t answer then he and his buddy would probably kick the door in again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As you try and work out if screaming would be in your best interests the creature turns.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It quickly speaks in a panicked tone &quot;Make go away! No go back!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She was starting to get hysterical.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It would not be beneficial to your long term health to do anything else but comply.  This may even be a golden opportunity to make your escape after all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Putting your hands up carefully you first try and calm her down, getting panic mauled on the eve of your possible rescue would be bad.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Ok ok I&#039;ll make them go alright?  Just calm down and put those claws away ok?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The angry hissing died down and her eyes focused on yours. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Before any more could be said Sunglasses piped up again outside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Mr Anon?  Please come down to the door.  I wont ask again.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Ok I&#039;m coming!  Keep your pants on!&quot; You yell back at him, making the worried lizard jump slightly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Wait up here ok?&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; If she&#039;s up here then you have a better chance of escape.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Wasting no time you head down the stairs and go to the patched up front door.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As you pull away the pieces of wood you had set the night before you realise there is a flaw to your newest escape plan: your guest had not stayed upstairs like you&#039;d hoped.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She had matched your speed coming down and had hidden herself against the wall to your side.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; When the door opened she would be hidden from view to the outside, but close enough to get stabby if you tried anything.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With the door open you are greeted by Sunglasses, he is still in the same black suit and sporting the fuck you smile from yesterday.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Morning Mr Anon.&quot; He says cheerily.  &quot;I hope I didn&#039;t wake you?&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He&#039;s messing with you now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot; What do you want?&quot; You ask, none to friendly either. The idea of this man somehow being your saviour was beginning to stick in your craw.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Just checking up on you, after last night we wanted to make sure nothing had come back to visit.&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Blurting out that it was right behind you, panto style, was not going to go down well.  You were going to have to try alerting him to the danger without letting on to the creature.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Stuck between a dick and a sharp scaly place...  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Crap.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A plan came to mind...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She could only see your back, not your face.  If you could somehow communicate what was happening to Sunglasses without letting on what you were doing then there was still hope.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You decided to try a few facial expressions and eye movements to signal what&#039;s happening.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;So... have you found any sign of whatever smashed my door?&quot;  This was accompanied by a couple of winks and a few twitches of your cheek.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The expression on Sunglasses&#039; face remained unchanged.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Nothing yet, there hasn&#039;t been any more sightings.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He obviously hadn&#039;t caught the drift.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Trying again, you think up another question.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Where did it come from, this thing (wink wink)?  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;That&#039;s not important Mr Anon, just that we catch it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Son of a bitch.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your face had been performing a full gymnastics routine by this point and he still hadn&#039;t taken any notice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; This went on for a little while longer, him dodging your questions, and somehow not getting any of your signals.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Just as you began to despair, his face suddenly gets a spark of understanding.  Finally!  The dense fucker gets it!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He leans in close, the smile getting... bigger?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;I see what&#039;s happening here.  I disturbed something didn&#039;t I?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;I&#039;ll give you some advice that worked for me.  Prunes.  Every morning.  It&#039;ll get you going like clockwork.  Remember to give us a call if you see anything else!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Leaving you stupefied and shivering on the doorstep, still in you boxers from last night, he turned away and left you to your fate.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The idiot had taken your non verbal pleas for help as a sign of... what?  Goddamned constipation!!!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You could still try and run...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A green scaled hand reached out and pushed the door closed.  Cutting off the last hope of escape.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You turned and prepared to accept the inevitable.  Whatever that may be.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She stood there, in the hall.  Nothing  between you now.  No door, no incompetent FBI wannabes, not even a blanket.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her eyes were still the unsettling crimson from before, her teeth still bared.  It looks like its breakfast time at last.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her posture dips slightly as she prepares to pounce.  You close your eyes and wait.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It would seem that there might just be a God after all, and its favourite thing to do is screw with you.  Repeatedly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; When she finally makes contact, her arms are around you again.  No teeth or claws rake your flesh.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Instead of tearing you apart, she holds you in a tight bear hug and lifts you clean off the ground.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She doesn&#039;t say a word at first, just holds you there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You realize she&#039;s shaking, not from the exertion of holding you up but...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With a sniffle and a hiccup she starts whispering.  Her words are too quiet and broken for you to make out at the start, but after a moment you begin to understand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Thank..you (hiccup) thank you...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Over and over again she says it.  You even feel a wet patch forming on your chest from where she&#039;s holding you against her face.  She&#039;s crying.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It wasn&#039;t homicidal rage that you saw upstairs when Sunglasses knocked.  It wasn&#039;t with monstrous hunger that she held you close now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Its fear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; This creature... Armed with talons, fangs and the strength to lift a grown man... Is afraid of the two armed clowns outside.  She&#039;s holding you like her life depends on it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; At a loss as to how any of this is supposed to make sense you do the only thing you can.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You lift your one free hand and softly pat her on the head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;...Its ok&quot; you manage to wheeze.  &quot;He&#039;s gone, you can put me down now.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With a final squeeze she steps back and drops you back to your feet.  You don&#039;t know what she&#039;s packing under those scales considering how thin she is but damn, she has one hell of a grip.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Looking at her standing there, still sniffling, you realise there&#039;s more going on here than you thought.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">---------------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; After the events of last night and this morning you were already exhausted, according to the clock retrieved from the tip that was once the front room it was only 11am.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; After calming down the still jittery lizard you had decided to try and get some answers.  Despite first impressions she hadn&#039;t actually done anything to harm you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Trapping you in your own bed and freaking you out with her fearsome appearance aside, you didn&#039;t have so much as a scratch on you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; For better or for worse you had decided to question her.  Maybe she could fill in the blanks that the two guys outside had left open.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; First things first however, you were still in your boxers.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Somehow you convinced her to wait in the kitchen while you threw on some clothes.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; While there you also retrieve your phone and piece it back together.  Apart from a cracked screen it seemed to work ok.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The smart thing to do here would be to call in the cavalry.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Something about this whole situation was... off, however.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The fact that there was a giant lizard woman in your kitchen aside, the way those guys outside acted and her reaction to you...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Coming back down the stairs you take a quick peek over the banister towards the kitchen to see what your guest is up to.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She has plopped herself onto one of the chairs you keep in there by a small table.  Her tail has gone through the gap below the back rest and is swaying slowly back and forth across the floor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your eyes linger on the point where the tail meets her body, the thick base sitting at the point where the spine would normally end on a human.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your scrutiny reveals more than a sudden twang of shame for letting your eyes linger, she is visibly shivering.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Its definitely a bit on the chilly side in here but not exactly freezing...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A piece clicks into place.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A distant memory of evenings watching the discovery channel, of reptiles being generally cold blooded.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Last night, when she held you so tightly...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She had felt so cold...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With the temperature outside dropping so low and the lack of heating in your work in progress house, you had been the closest source of heat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You couldn&#039;t just let her sit there shivering like that, you quickly dart back upstairs and retrieve your blanket, still where she had dropped it.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Slightly dismayed over the visible tears from her claws, you scoop it up and head back down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Once in the kitchen you hand her the blanket.  &quot;Here, take this.&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She takes it from your outstretched hands and quickly wraps it around herself, leaving only her head free.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With that sorted you take a seat opposite.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Looking at her in the cold light of day and without the pressing fear of evisceration, she didn&#039;t seem as threatening as before.  It helped that her eyes weren&#039;t red any more too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Do you think you can answer some questions for me?&quot; you ask.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With a little nod of her head she confirms that she is.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Ok... lets start with something basic.  Where do you come from?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The likelihood of her being some sort of alien had crossed your mind, it would explain why the two looking for her were dressed in black.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She cocked her head slightly and seemed to think about it for a second before answering.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Lifting her scaled arm from the blanket she pointed at the west wall and said simply &quot;That way&quot;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Feeling a bit let down by so simple an answer you try and press her further.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Could you tell me what&#039;s over there?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Cocking her head again she looks at you quizzically.  &quot;Place I was at, but now am not.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Either she doesn&#039;t know or she doesn&#039;t really have a concept of place names as of yet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Perhaps you should start smaller.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Ok how about your name?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She gives you a confused look at this.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Name?  What this?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; This you didn&#039;t expect, but press on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Your name is what your called, my name is Anon, that&#039;s how others know me.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She seems to understand what you mean.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Ah!  Fathers called me (she struggled with the pronunciation at first) Ex.. Expen... Experiment thirteen!&quot;  She beamed at you, proud that she had managed to say the full thing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; That sounded like something from a lab, a designation more than a name.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Is that the only thing they called you?  Its a bit of a mouthful...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She thought about it again.  You hoped that if she had come from some sort of crazy experiment lab they had least given her more than a number.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With a sharp inhale she suddenly looked ready to blurt something out to you, but stopped.  Her expression going from happy to heartbroken in a heartbeat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She remained silent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;What&#039;s wrong?  Did I say something to upset you?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Looking down, she answered in little more than a whisper.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;My sisters, we were all called experiment, but we had own word for us.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She looked on the verge of tears again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;They called me secret word, all had own word Fathers didn&#039;t know.  They call me... Nyssa.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Well, you had a name for her at least.  Along with some clues to her origins.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She was also upset.  You hadn&#039;t set out to make her sad.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Nyssa huh?  That&#039;s a pretty name, it suits you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She perked up a bit at this, but she still didn&#039;t look up at you.  Without further prodding from you she soon revealed why.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Sisters all gone now.  Only I left.  Masters take all away.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her hand was resting on the table, she hadn&#039;t hidden it away again after pointing at the wall.  You suddenly feel compelled to put yours over hers, taken aback by how much emotion this cold blooded creature is capable of expressing you want to show her some compassion.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1"> &gt; &quot;I&#039;m sorry Nyssa.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; At this little show of support she seemed to shake off some of her sadness.  With a little smile back on her face she starts talking again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Thank you... Anon.  Been alone for long time, is cold being alone, but... maybe not cold anymore?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Oh dear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Seems like she&#039;s getting the wrong idea here, you might be warming up to her a bit but you&#039;re not ready to adopt her or anything. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Best thing to do is ask more questions for now, then once you know enough you can decide who the best people are to call in to sort this mess out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; For the next few hours you continue asking your questions and she slowly answers the best she can.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; What you learn leaves you more troubled than when you began.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; From what you can gather she is one of thirteen test subjects at some sort of lab.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With her designation being thirteen and her admitting to being the youngest of her &#039;sisters&#039; it was easy to do the math.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; These &#039;Fathers&#039; she spoke of seemed to be human like you rather than actual biological parents, most likely the scientists or people in charge of the lab.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her broken way of speaking seemed to be down to how she learned: they taught the subjects to understand spoken English but not to speak it.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The intention looked to have been that they know enough to follow commands but not answer back.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The sisters were allowed some time together for exercise where they managed to start speaking to each other, the result was the best they could do by themselves.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Things went bad however when the &#039;masters&#039; were introduced.  Each subject was assigned a trainer to instruct them.  What they taught was how to hunt and kill, or as Nyssa called it, &quot;rip and tear&quot;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; If they did well then they were rewarded, if they failed they were punished.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nyssa actually stopped at one point to flash you some of the scales on her chest.  As you did your best to look away like the gentleman you fooled yourself into thinking you were, she directed you so something more serious.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Between some of the scales were some discoloured lines, as if they had been parted and stuck back together again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; They were scars.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Some she explained were from the punishments, others were from the fathers when they &quot;made her better&quot; with their shiny knives.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Surgical incisions if you had to guess.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; They each had a &quot;warm light&quot; in their cells in which to sleep, a heat lamp of some sort from how she described it.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; If they misbehaved then the light would go out.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; When this happened the cold would come, sometimes the sisters would be together when this happened and they would snuggle up to each other to try and stay warm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Sounded like they were deliberately using the temperature as a means of control too, and added another explanation as to why she chose to hug for warmth than say, gut you and hide in your warm entrails star wars style.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It all came to a head when the masters ordered them to fight each other.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The goal was apparently to find the weakest of the thirteen and have the others kill her.  Some sort of lesson about strength or the weakest link perhaps?  Nyssa didn&#039;t know what the point was and you couldn&#039;t see it either.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; What had happened instead was the &#039;eldest&#039; (she couldn&#039;t bring herself to use their secret names) turned on the masters, the others joined in and they somehow staged a jailbreak.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; They broke out the lab and ran for it.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; They got separated into smaller groups as they ran, and as they were hunted by the masters.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; One by one they fell, either to &quot;the master&#039;s big bang&quot; (she made a good approximation of the sound a gun makes, which was both heartbreakingly cute and sad) or to the elements.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; By the time she had reached here, your house, she had been alone, cold and scared.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She didn&#039;t know if any of her sisters had survived, the ones she had been with were all dead.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You knew the rest.  It involved breaking into your house to hide and then desperately searching for somewhere warm and safe to sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You had fit the bill perfectly, that you weren&#039;t a consenting partner hadn&#039;t occurred to her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With her story done Nyssa slumped into the blanket and huffed out a little sigh.  It was coming up to around 3pm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Now that you knew what had brought her here you didn&#039;t want to just wash your hands of it all.  The chuckle brothers outside must be some of the &#039;masters&#039; searching for her.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; If you handed her over now then they would either kill her outright or worse, take her back to that hellhole for punishing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; If you called the cops or the authorities then... What?  Would they help her or would they act as you had?  See a giant lizard monster and shoot first?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Who could you call?  The press?  Scientists?  Would they be trustworthy?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; There was too much info here for any kind of snap decision.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With a rumble from your stomach you realise that you haven&#039;t actually eaten anything since yesterday.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Getting up you decide to check the fridge.  Not a lot on offer.  Grocery shopping was on your list of jobs for the weekend but it had taken a bit of a back seat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Another stomach rumble caused you to jump slightly.  It hadn&#039;t come from you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nyssa had got up and stood behind you with the blanket without making a sound.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You could tell she was hungry too, if her story was true then she couldn&#039;t have eaten anything for quite some time, perhaps explaining why she was so skinny.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Rummaging through your fridge however only revealed a small portion of ground meat and some milk.  The rest was expired take out boxes which, by the smell, was due to go into the trash.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The beef had been left over from when you last bothered cooking for yourself.  There was just enough left to put something basic together but without other ingredients it wouldn&#039;t stretch between two.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Considering the... carnivorous nature of your guest, you figure the meat is the way to go.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Pulling it out you try and work out the best way to do this, you don&#039;t really know what she can eat or not, or if maybe she only eats live things like the little box of crickets you used to see in the pet store for bearded dragons.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Deciding that it would be best to ask first you turn and offer it to Nyssa, after all she may prefer her meat raw.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;This any good? you ask hopefully.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With a little sniff she gives you your answer.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Is cold.&quot; she states flatly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Well that told you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Ok.... how about I cook it up then annndd... (genius strikes you hard) I got some bread in one of these cupboards that should still be good!  I&#039;ll make us some cooked beef sandwiches!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The puzzled look she gave you said everything, she didn&#039;t know what a sandwich was.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Ok well that settles it then!  Wait right there and I&#039;ll cook you up something nice ok?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1"> &gt; With that she shuffled back over to the table, still wrapped in the blanket and sat down.  You on the other hand made yourself busy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The old cooker had been left by the previous owner, an old but sturdy gas one.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Two of the four rings didn&#039;t work anymore and the inside stank of burnt turkey fat regardless of what you put in there but it still lit first time every time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Adding some oil to your trusty (and only) pan you prepare to start frying the beef.  It wouldn&#039;t exactly by fine cuisine but it would be edible.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; After a few minutes the smell of cooking meat filled the kitchen, now out the tray you can see there is less here than you originally thought but its all you had.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nyssa had certainly noticed the smell, and she had a very hungry look about her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It didn&#039;t take long for the meat to cook, a quick loot around your bare cupboards revealed the last of your bread, all three slices of it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Grumbling to yourself about the general lack of bread in the world you take out some plates and serve up your creation.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A filled sandwich for the waiting Nyssa while you stuffed what you could in the folded final slice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The plate had barely touched the table before the hungry lizard was on it, snatching up the contents and and shoving it into her mouth with a loud snap.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You sit there and watch with a morbid fascination as she quickly works her jaw, shredding the contents with her razor teeth and swallowing it all with a satisfied gulp.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As you move to pick up your smaller helping you cant help but notice the look on her face.  She has her eyes locked on to your plate, the hungry look from before was still there.  She sat completely still with her mouth slightly open.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She was obviously still ravenously hungry, should she try and snatch it you doubted there was anything you could do to stop it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Yet... She made no move.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Thinking back to her story you realise she hasn&#039;t had anything approaching a full meal in quite some time, bar your small offering. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Putting your own hunger to the side for now you push your plate towards Nyssa.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Here, you have it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She looks up from the sandwich up at you in shock.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;B-b-but is yours!&quot; she exclaims.  Not really understanding.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;I&#039;m  giving it to you, I think you need it more than I do right now.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Not needing much in the way of prompting she swallows it down as quickly as the first.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; When she&#039;s done she looks over at you again, are those tears in her eyes?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Th-th-thank you A-Anon...&quot; she stutters.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;It was only a..&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The table flew up in the air and clattered to the side.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Before you could work out what had happened she had pounced from her blanket and on to your lap.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Yet again you were pinned in place by a hugging lizard.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She had her arms wrapped around you, your own trapped at your sides.  Her legs straddled your hips and her tail dangled down between your legs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She tucked her head in against your neck, any illusions you may have once had about personal space were very much shattered.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She was still sniffling, her whole body jumping slightly with each one.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Between her closeness and the movements she was making... You couldn&#039;t help but feel a stirring &#039;downstairs&#039;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Oh hell no.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; This wasn&#039;t happening.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Reality had already gone spinning well out of your control.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; What would happen if you suddenly started poking her &#039;down there&#039; with her sitting on you like this?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Images of the suddenly very angry Nyssa chowing down on your manhood like she did the food just a minute ago...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With an effort worthy of the most devout Tibetan monks you willed your boner to subside.  Conjuring every image you could think of to try scare it away, politicians faces, that creepy clown from that new movie remake, your former best friend&#039;s smug face...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With the beast temporarily back in its cage you get to work removing Nyssa from your lap, time was of the essence.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Uhh Nyssa?  It was only a sandwich.  Can you let me up please?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Thankfully she seemed to come out of her hug fueled trance and climbed off of you.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Crisis averted.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She stood there looking at you, she had brought the tip of her tail into her hands and was fidgeting with it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot; I&#039;m sorry Anon.&quot; she sniffled again.  &quot;You gave me your last food, tasty food.  Not even sisters shared food from masters.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You had somehow unwittingly made some sort of grand meaningful gesture to her with half a beef sandwich.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Its ok Nyssa, don&#039;t worry about it, really.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She gave a little nod and a smile, but her eyes never left yours.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Oh boy, what have you got yourself into now?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">---------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Chapter 4</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Time was moving on, despite learning a great deal today you were aware that there were some things you were going to have to deal with.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; There was now no food left in the house, you hadn&#039;t eaten since yesterday, there was a naked lizard girl in your kitchen giving you funny looks and you were no closer to working out what to do about all this.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Ok, keep calm and mental checklist it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; First things first, deal with Nyssa.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It would perhaps make things easier if you could get her to wear some clothes...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Next, work out how to get more food.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Ordering takeout or groceries online were both options but would involve someone coming to the front door.  Considering Nyssa&#039;s reaction before that wasn&#039;t a good idea.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You decide to tackle one thing at a time.  Having her walk around in nothing but her colorful scales or occasionally springing out of the blanket to hug you for warmth was getting... distracting.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Taking her back upstairs to your room you have a rummage through your clothes.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The best you can do for now is a pair of baggy sweatpants and an old hoodie.  Not a perfect fit but it should be enough to keep her warm for the time being.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; At first she doesn&#039;t seem to get what your trying to do.  She hadn&#039;t worn any clothes of her own back at wherever she had come from, the idea was as alien to her as walking around town butt naked was to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; After a bit of convincing you manage to pull the hoodie up over her head and get her arms into the sleeves.  She seems a bit unsure but she trusts your promise it will keep her warm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The sweatpants are a different matter.  Her legs are not the same shape as yours, not to mention the tail.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With a bit of work you manage to get both her big clawed feet in the right holes, you tried to do this with her sitting on the end of the bed, she insisted however on standing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; In theory this should have made it easier to fit the pants, except for the fact that reaching down around her ankles put your head at crotch level.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Mental images of your boner getting munched kept your eyes from getting too adventurous however.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her tail was causing a bigger problem than you anticipated.  The plan had been to rip a hole in the back for it to poke through.  Once they were on her though the tail put too much pressure on top and the waste band began to unravel.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Forced to think on your feet you ended up tying the broken waist into a little knot just above her tail, creating an anchor of sorts to stop it all falling down.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; This had resulted with you again spending alot of time essentially fiddling about around her ass.  Not that she seemed to mind though.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With the clothing issue solved you next had to sort out supplies.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You had been thinking about this while working on dressing her (as a way of trying to distract yourself more than anything else) and the only plan you could think of was to make a run down to the store.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; This would mean leaving Nyssa here alone but it would be necessary as taking her shopping simply wasn&#039;t an option.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; When you explained this to her she didn&#039;t like it, not one bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Nope.  You stay here with me. No go out.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Sorry Nyssa but we need some supplies.  There&#039;s no more food here, there&#039;s no heating and I cant take you with me.&quot;  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You did have a mini heater here which would have tided you over until the heating got fixed but it was one of the items broken during the search yesterday.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;But...&quot;  she started, but you were adamant.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;No, I&#039;m sorry but you have to stay here.  Its not safe out there right now and it shouldn&#039;t be so cold in here as long as you stay upstairs with the blanket.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Eventually she gave in and retreated upstairs.  You felt kinda guilty but nothing about this was right and you had to try limit the risks.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Before heading out you made a few preparations.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; To protect Nyssa from any curious passers-by you made sure all the downstairs blinds were closed.  You also gathered up a few of the larger broken items from yesterday and took them out to the car.  Might as well get rid while you were out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nyssa was pouting.  You had no idea that reptiles could pout or that their scaled faces could do it so expressively but every minute with her was a learning experience.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She sat at the top of the stairs first, watching you in silence while you gathered the clutter.  When you were about done though she had disappeared.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You had moved the fridge away from the backdoor so you could slip out the back way.  No point giving the chuckle brothers out front a show.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The car was parked in a small attached garage, it could only be accessed through the main door at the front or a small one at the rear which lead into the garden.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You left the boot open while you packed in the junk, only closing it when you were done.  Going back inside you lock everything back up and go say a goodbye to Nyssa.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; When you got upstairs there was not immediately any sign of her.  A quick search found your blanket bundled up on the bed, she must be sulking under the covers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Ok I&#039;m heading out, I&#039;ll be quick as I can, promise.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; There was no response.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Just stay up here and don&#039;t make any loud noises ok?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The blankets didn&#039;t so much as twitch.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She must be mad.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Sighing you make your way down and leave through the front door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Heading back  to the garage you get in your car and get on your way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As you pull out and turn the corner your flagged down by a familiar figure.  Wearing a black suit this time like his partner its Monotone.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He&#039;s standing out in the road waving at you so there&#039;s no chance of just passing him by, unless you go all death race on him maybe. (how many points would he be worth I wonder...)</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Stopping like the perfectly well behaved motorist you are, you roll down the window to see what he wants.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Good afternoon Mr Anon, would you mind stepping out of the vehicle for a moment?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Aw nuts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Good afternoon Mr...&quot; (he still hasn&#039;t told you his name) You wait for him to answer but he just stands there staring at you expectantly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He wasn&#039;t going to move until you get out it seems.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Cutting the ignition you step out and wait.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Thank you Mr Anon.  There is something important I need to ask you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Ok...  What do you need now?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He reacts to you annoyed tone by ignoring it, becoming that much more grating in the process.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;My associate came to check up on you this morning, he told me that you were having some problems of a... delicate nature?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; This again?  Was he going to give you some advice on how to take a shit now too?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;My associate is sometimes not the most... perceptive person.  It occurred to me that you may have been trying to tell him something quite different.  Something that you couldn&#039;t say to him openly.  Am I correct?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Shit.  Looks like Monotone isn&#039;t quite as stupid as his partner.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;No not really.&quot;  (Think Anon think!)</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;I uhh was just a little tired that&#039;s all!  I was up late cleaning up the mess you guys made and I wasn&#039;t really in the mood for a chat.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Smooth Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He stood at you and stared for a moment, weighing up what you had come out with.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;I see.  Very well, I wont keep you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Phew, close one.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As you move to get back in your car he suddenly stops you, grabbing your shoulder, hard, and pulling you close.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;We are here to help Mr Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; His voice had taken on a menacing tone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; This somehow didn&#039;t fill you with confidence.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;If we find out however, that you haven&#039;t been straight with us...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Looks like threat time again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Listen, I got the message yesterday loud and clear ok?  Don&#039;t get in your way.  Got it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You hoped this would be enough to satisfy him.  Sadly it wasn&#039;t.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Please let me finish, Mr Anon.&quot; He got even closer to you for the next part.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;If we find that you have been lying, or actively disrupting our search in any way...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He cracked a smile, unlike Sunglasses&#039; however, this one chilled you to your core.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;There wont even be a corner of hell dark enough to hide you from what we&#039;ll do.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Letting you go, he then stepped away from the road and started walking back towards his van.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Over his shoulder he called out a casual &quot;Enjoy the rest of your day Sir!&quot; and that was that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Quickly retreating to the safety of your car, you continue your journey.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It took a good bit of time before you let out that breath you&#039;d been holding.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Again the feeling that you were way out of your depth took you.  Was it too late to maybe just make a break for the boarder?  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The thought of Nyssa waiting patiently at home for you shut down that idea, far more quickly than you realised too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As you tried to focus on the road ahead you became aware of something behind you.  A slight brushing of air on the back of your neck...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Slowly turning around, you are confronted with a large scaly face.  A big toothy smile on display.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Hi Anon!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Clever girl.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Oh shit!!!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; In your surprise you damn near lose control of the car, swerving across lanes as you fight with the wheel.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A few desperate seconds and you manage to pull over to the side of the road.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Turning around in your seat you get a better look at what is happening behind you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nyssa has somehow got herself wedged through the middle of the back seat.  Her front half sticking out where the folding armrest pulls down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It looks like she must have been hiding in the trunk, tried to crawl out through to the back seat and got her sizeable hips stuck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Nyssa!  What are you doing here!?!&quot; you yell.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Why aren&#039;t you back home like said?  Do you have any idea how dangerous this is?  What if someone saw you?  Like those guys in black?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nyssa simply sat there best she could, stuck as she was, and looked at you with an almost puppy dog expression.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Didn&#039;t want to be alone again.  Maybe Anon not come back!  What if masters came when Anon gone!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; To that you didn&#039;t really have an answer.  Still... it was pretty risky having her out and about with you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Going back wasn&#039;t an option at this point.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Ok just hang on a minute.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Regardless of which direction you decided to go next you couldn&#039;t do it with Nyssa wedged in the back like that.  If you got pulled over you would have a hard time talking your way out of something like this...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Luckily there was not much traffic on this particular stretch of road, your scare with Nyssa just now would have ended very differently otherwise.  It also meant you could get out and try to free your wriggling stowaway without an audience.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; First you tried going in through the rear passenger door to see if you could pull her through or shift the seat itself.  Your only reward was a couple of hisses and an annoyed snap of her jaws, she was stuck fast.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Deciding that tackling the problem from the back might be the better (and safer) option you close door and head to the trunk.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Great.  The scratches around the latch told the story of how she had fiddled with it before gaining access, her claws leaving large gouges in your paintwork.  It would take more than a quick buff to get those out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your own annoyance died a death once you had the trunk open however.  The sight of Nyssa&#039;s trapped rump sticking up into the air, although expected, caught you off guard.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her large tail swished from side to side as she continued to struggle, her butt wiggling in time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A long moment passed before Nyssa&#039;s voice snapped you back to attention.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;A Anon..? You still there?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You had been staring, caught in the hypnotic swaying of her...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nope nope nope!  Mind on the job at hand Anon!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With a shake of your head you try and work out the best way to get her free.  Good thing there was a shortage of hot water back home, you were going to need a cold shower or two when you got back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She had pulled herself most of the way through so pulling her back this way wasn&#039;t going to work, and would most likely end with large rips in your upholstery.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; There was only one thing for it.  You were going to have to push.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Nyssa?&quot; you call out cautiously.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;If we&#039;re going to get you out of there I&#039;m gonna have to push.  I haven&#039;t got much to work with back here so... prepare yourself okay?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Ok here goes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;When I push you try twist yourself to the left a bit, that should get you out.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;O-o-okay Anon.&quot; she calls through.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;I trust you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With the position she was in there was only one place for your hands to go.  Her Ass.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Offering a prayer up to whatever gods might be responsible for boner control you grab a cheek in each hand and start to push.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A loud &quot;Eeeek!&quot; comes from the backseat and Nyssa&#039;s tail suddenly slaps you across the face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Ouch!  Damn Nyssa watch it!&quot; you shout, stopping to rub your stinging face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Sorry Anon!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Ok lets try this again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Once more taking hold you get to work. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You couldn&#039;t help but consider the feeling under your hands.  She was thankfully still wearing the pants you had given her but you could feel the smooth scales underneath.  This wasn&#039;t the first time you had had your hands wrapped around a girl&#039;s ass, last time had been a bit less... awkward though.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Unlike a human&#039;s rear, Nyssa&#039;s didn&#039;t have the softness you would expect to find there.  It was firm but still gave to your touch as you pushed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Twisting to the side you managed to get some movement.  With your combined effort she finally popped through the gap and into the backseat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With a sigh of relief you grab the old car blanket from the trunk and close up.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Getting back to the drivers seat was a bit difficult, despite your prayers you were sporting a good half mast in your pants and walking was a bit painful.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Getting in you toss the blanket over into the back seat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Ok Nyssa, we still have to go to the store so I need you to stay low and hide under this, can you do that?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She wrapped herself up but didn&#039;t drop immediately down.  Instead she gave you a strange look.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Ok Anon... I&#039;ll be good.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; ...Not sure how to take that...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">--------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The rest of the ride to the store was thankfully uneventful, apart from Nyssa curiously reaching forward and nearly pulling at the hand break once or twice that is.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your destination was the wall mart, it had become a little run down after driving the other local businesses out but it should have what you need.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You pull into a parking space at the edge of the lot, it meant a longer walk to the store and back but less chance of anyone noticing your passenger.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Before heading off you turn around and look at Nyssa.  She had curled up on the back seat under the old blanket and was flipping through a magazine of some sort.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your speech about staying hidden finds itself on hold as you wonder what she&#039;s got and where it came from.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She&#039;s happily flipping through the pages, stopping from time to time and examining it closer.  She doesn&#039;t even realize the car has stopped as she&#039;s that enthralled.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;What you got there Nyssa?&quot; you ask curiously. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Looking up at you and flashing you a toothy grin, she hands over the magazine.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Its one of those holliday brochures you get sometimes stuffed inside newspapers, one must have fallen out at some time or other and she&#039;s found it under the seat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She had been looking at a section focusing on somewhere near the coast (it wasn&#039;t a very high class brochure).</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The pictures show a happy couple walking hand in hand across a small beach.  The sun is shining and they are wearing nothing but swim suits and sandals.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The next page has them sitting in deckchairs on a private balcony, a drink in their hands and not a care in the world.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As you hand it back she sits up under her blanket and gives you a curious look.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Where that place Anon?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Its a beach Nyssa, its over on the west coast I think.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She ponders this for a second, takes another long look and then peeps through the window, as if hoping to spot something outside from the picture.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You could do nothing but sit there, marveling at her innocence.  From what you had gathered she had been grown in a lab to be a killing machine, yet here she was, in the back of your car, looking through the windows at a grubby wall mart car park for signs of a beach from the brochure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You smile, and try to convince her to get back down in case anyone sees.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;The beach is a very long way away, you cant see it from here.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She drops down again under the blanket with a disappointed look on her face.  After another mournful glance at the pictures on the page she quickly looks back up to you, a hopeful look adorning her features.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Anon!  We go to beach after get food?&quot; she asks quickly.  Lifting up the brochure again and pointing at the first page, she starts bouncing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;We go there yes?  No masters there!  Just me and... and Anon!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It was at this point you reached the lowest point in your life so far, you chose to lie to this innocent creature.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Ok ok calm down, the car&#039;s starting to shake!&quot; you yell in an effort to calm the excited lizard.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Tell you what, we cant go right now but I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll be able to go when things quiet down.  I&#039;ll take you myself ok?  Now just calm down!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; In response she let out a little squee noise and tried to pounce on you again.  Luckily the blanket and car seat joined forces and kept her from launching you through the windscreen with her attempted power hug.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Ohhh thank you thank you Anon!! she cried.  The bouncing hadn&#039;t stopped as you had hoped.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Ok that&#039;s enough!&quot; you laughed.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;I&#039;ve still got to go get the food so you have to be quiet and stay here under the blanket.  Do you understand?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With that she dropped back down once more and nodded her head, trying and failing to supress her adorable smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You were going to hell.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Walking through the store, pushing a cart, you think about the lie you told.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;I&#039;ll take you myself!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Why had you said it?  You knew it was pretty much impossible.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; If the people looking for her were who you thought then getting out of the county would be a nightmare, let alone the state, before they caught you.  The only reason you were able to go shopping was because they were probably using you as bait to lure their target back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Then again, was it really that cruel to give the bouncing lizard a bit of false hope?  To let her have a dream of her own for a while?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You had been thinking almost non stop about what you were going to do next, getting food was a short term problem, it was tomorrow, and the days after that were important.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Wracking your brains had not revealed an answer.  The authorities wouldn&#039;t be able to help, they may even answer to the guys outside your house.  As for calling the press or scientist types?  You didn&#039;t know any trustworthy ones, or have a clue where to find them even.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The cold hard truth was that Nyssa&#039;s days were numbered.  You couldn&#039;t protect her or that smile for long.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; At best, even if you did find a way to reveal her to the public and shield her with some limelight, she would end up in a zoo or another research lab.  She didn&#039;t deserve that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; At worst those fucks in black would put her in a body bag, or take her back to where she came from and &#039;punish&#039; her for the escape.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You needed a miracle.  For now though the best you could do was throw another pack of jerky in the cart and keep moving.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Trying to put your bleak thoughts out of mind for now, you head for the meat counter.  A little stop at the cooked section too was in order.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">----------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Arriving back at the car you are relieved to see it all as you left it.  No broken windows, angry rampaging lizards or bloody corpses littering the area.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A quick look in through the window tells you she&#039;s still under the blanket.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You can tell she&#039;s actually there this time (not like the fake bundle she made on your bed earlier) as you can see the tip of her tail sticking out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You remember the last thing you had said before heading for the store.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Promise me you wont try following me this time ok?  There&#039;s more people out there that could see you, you wont be able to sneak past them.  So please, promise you wont go anywhere.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She had looked you straight in the eye, and said simply - &quot;I promise Anon.  I wont go anywhere and leave you.  Promise.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The more you thought about it the more you got a sense she was speaking about more than just leaving the car...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Shaking off your reverie you open up the trunk to deposit your shopping. You had ended up buying more than you had intended, but you regretted nothing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nyssa poked her head over the backseat with a beaming smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Hi Anon!  You got food?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Yup, I got what we need.  Just need to load up and we can go back home.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Something had been bothering you since the whole butt stuck in seat incident and it finally dawned on you what it was.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Hey Nyssa?  What happened to all the stuff I put in the trunk before I left?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She cocked her head, &quot;Was no room for hiding, so made room.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A mental image of all the junk you had carefully packed into the trunk sitting on the garage floor where she had tossed it came to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Ok never mind...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Packing all but one of the bags you get back into the drivers seat and shut the door.  Nyssa&#039;s nostrils start to flare almost immediately as the bag&#039;s contents catch her attention.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;I figured that you were probably still hungry so rather than wait til we got home I thought you may want something now.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; From the bag you pull a plastic pouch containing a whole cooked chicken.  One you had scored from the cooked section, still warm from the store ovens.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nyssa&#039;s eyes go wide and her jaw drops open as she inspects the heavenly smelling bounty before her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As she moves to grab the bag you suddenly pull it back out of reach, eliciting a hiss.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Now don&#039;t be like that.&quot; you chide.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Before you eat it, there&#039;s lots of small bones in this so don&#039;t just wolf it all down, take your time and spit any hard bits out into the bag ok?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her response was a blur of motion and the realisation that you were holding nothing in your hand now but a small piece of torn plastic.  She on the other hand was going in the bag snout first, taking deep sniffs in and savouring the smell.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Deciding to leave her to it you retrieve your own food, a cooked chicken burger.  It wasn&#039;t really a meal but it would keep you going for now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The journey home was... interesting.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; While you had finished yours quickly and got on with the task of driving, Nyssa had taken your advice and was slowly savouring the chicken.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She took it apart piece by piece using her long claws, tearing of a strip and dropping it into her mouth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It was when she got to the legs that you found your eyes spending more time on the rearview mirror than the road.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She nibbled at the drumsticks with her large teeth at first, carefully stripping the bulk of the skin and meat from the bone with ease.  When she could not get at the last few morsels however she changed tactics, lifting the bone up into her mouth she dipped it in and started working on it with her tongue. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; For some reason you had expected her to have a snake like one based on the hissing, what she had was a rather long and thick affair.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It wrapped around the bone with ease, and when she pulled it deeper, closing her lips around her fingers as she did, began making lewd sucking noises.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You sat there, trying desperately to concentrate on the road, transfixed on the show behind you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Goddamnit Anon eyes front! Eyes front!  She&#039;s just really enjoying that chicken...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As your mind warred with itself trying to make sense of your emotions, Nyssa&#039;s eye caught yours in the mirror, and held it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The rest of the journey was spent in relative silence, only broken by the occasional sounds of happy chomping and slurping from the back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You keep your eyes firmly on the road.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">--------------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Chapter 5</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It was already evening when you finally make it back home.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Pulling up to the house you notice two things: first is that there&#039;s no sign of the chuckle brothers, you hadn&#039;t passed their van anywhere on the way back and it wasn&#039;t here either.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The second thing was how quiet everything was.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The light was on its way out but there were no lights on in any of your neighbours houses, there were no cars parked outside any of them either.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; That was odd.  It was a Saturday evening and everyone was out at the same time at a party or something?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Come to think of it, they had done that before, the bastards.  One of the pitfalls of being an outsider in a neighborhood where everyone is in some way related to everyone else.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Getting out the car you move over to the garage and open the door.  There at the back of course is the crap Nyssa pulled out of the car.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It will have to wait.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You jump back in the car and reverse in, making sure to close the door back up to make it safe for Nyssa to show herself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nyssa waited in the garage while you went in through the front of the house, you&#039;d have to unblock the backdoor from inside before she could enter.  You couldn&#039;t risk her being seen out the front.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Once inside you hit the lights and head for the kitchen, a bit of effort opens the way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A moment later Nyssa joins you in the kitchen, still covered up by the car blanket.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You notice that she hasn&#039;t come empty handed, she is clutching most... no, all the shopping bags to her as well.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Hey I was coming back for those, you didn&#039;t need to carry them...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nyssa smiles sweetly at you.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Is ok Anon, want to help!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She had carried in all the bags with ease, impressive considering how heavy you knew they were.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You wondered how she had managed to get the bags out the car, visions of more scratches in the paintwork around the car door convinced you not to think too hard about it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A final dash back to the garage to lock up and you were done.  The air outside felt.. wrong however, tense, like it was waiting for something.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Getting back inside you lock the door and blocked it with the fridge.  The lizard it had originally been put there to keep out had already made herself at home, but you still felt safer doing it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; For the next hour, Nyssa helped you pack away all the shopping, stopping every now and again for her to inspect some of the goodies and for you to explain what they were.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She showed particular interest in what you had bought from the meat section.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You had chosen some cuts of beef to make steak, gammon, some uncooked chicken and more.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As tempted as you were to start cooking some up now to see her reactions to the different tastes and smells she told you she wasn&#039;t hungry.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The whole chicken in the car had hit the spot for now.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You made a mental note to cook her something nice for breakfast instead.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With all the food sorted you moved on to the next item, a small mini heater.  You had spotted it in the store and bought it to replace the broken one.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With this you should be able to make things more comfortable for Nyssa.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; When you tried to explain this to her though she didn&#039;t seem convinced.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;This will make things a bit warmer around here.&quot; you began.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nyssa wasn&#039;t buying it though.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She poked it with one of her long claws, giving a little grunt of disapproval to the metal clanging noise it produced.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;That not warm, is cold.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;It is now but give it a chance and you&#039;ll see.&quot; you reassured her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; By this point it was starting to get late, the interrupted sleep from last night and the stresses from today had left you more warn out than you should be.  Nyssa was looking tired too, she gave a big toothy yawn.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The size of her fully open maw left you a little unsettled, you could probably fit your entire head in there...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The prospect of bedtime left you a little worried too.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; After the shenanigans last night you wanted to try and regain control of your sleeping space.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You were sure she had every intention of jumping back into your bed and hugging you into oblivion again but your fragile male ego dictated that you reassert yourself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The problem with this was that your house was low on furniture right now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With renovations still under way you had been surviving here by yourself on bare minimum.  You didn&#039;t so much as have a sofa to crash on, let alone another bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With Nyssa having trouble regulating her body temperature and it getting colder outside, she couldn&#039;t sleep on the cold uncarpeted floors.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; If she took the bed where did that leave you?  With the mini heater on you should be ok on the floor you guess, it will just mean you have to sleep in the same room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Upstairs, with bathroom needs attended to, you got ready for bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You had done your best to explain your decision about the sleeping arrangements to Nyssa but she still didn&#039;t seem to get it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; While she jumped into bed quite merrily, you spread some spare sheets on the cold floor and tried to find a comfortable spot.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The mini heater had been set up over the other side of the bed to give Nyssa the maximum benefit, hopefully she was because from where you were sitting it may as well not be on at all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nyssa&#039;s head popped over the side of the bed and looked down at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Anon?  What doing down there?  Is cold!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;I told you, I&#039;m going to sleep down here for tonight.  You can have the bed all to yourself.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She still didn&#039;t get it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;But Anon...  It cold down there by self.  It cold up here with only me.  You sleep here, Ok?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Further arguments were cut short as she made a tutting sound in her throat and made a grab for you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Again you were caught off guard by Nyssa&#039;s strength, from her position on the bed she grabbed hold and lifted you up next to her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Things had gone like this last night, she had overpowered and subjected you to a long night of forced cuddling.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It was not happening again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As she reached out, preparing to ensnare you in her arms, you state &quot;no&quot; in a loud and stern voice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She stops in her tracks, the smile on her face replaced with a frown of surprise.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You glare at her, a sudden anger brewing in your chest, rising from a place you didn&#039;t quite understand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Anon?  What wrong?&quot; she asks, sounding unsure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Is cold here, you and me together will stay warm, like last time yes?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;No Nyssa, not like last time.&quot;  There&#039;s an edge in your voice now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Last night only happened because you didn&#039;t give me a choice in the matter.  You just jumped on in here and trapped me until morning!  Its not happening again.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The unbidden anger started to leave as suddenly as it had arrived.  The look on Nyssa&#039;s scaly face told you that you had been too harsh.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She shuffled backwards along the bed and dropped her gaze from yours, just about managing a little &quot;oh.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; After a few minutes of uncomfortable silence she spoke again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;I wont make you stay Anon.  Will leave now.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; In these short minutes her whole demeanor had changed.  Instead of the smiling excitable lizard ready to power hug you to a sullen, withdrawn one on the verge of tears.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You felt like an asshole.  You were one.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her little heart had broken in front of you and now she was going to leave.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Despite the still present knot of... whatever the hell it was, in your chest, you couldn&#039;t just send her away either.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The rest of the house was freezing cold and if she tried going outside...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You decide to compromise.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Listen... Nyssa...&quot; you begin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;You don&#039;t have to go, its going to be icy out there now, and its dark.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She gives a little sniffle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;I&#039;ll stay here in the bed tonight ok?  All I ask though is that you stay on that side of the bed ok?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A brief explanation was required at this point on what defined &#039;my side&#039; and what was &#039;her side&#039; but she understood quickly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With the light off you settle down to get some sleep.  Nyssa has retreated under the covers and has her back to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Looks like you found a way to top the cruel stakes after lying to her before.  Asshole.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">--------------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You lay in the darkness.  Sleep doesn&#039;t come.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your outburst towards Nyssa earlier still playing on your mind.  Turning it around in your head, you cant quite understand why you had been so angry.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Yes she had essentially cuddle raped you the night before... But despite everything, and after spending the day talking to her, she was actually kinda... sweet... for a giant lizard with razor claws.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As your mind wanders you begin to take stock of your life, replaying in your mind, for the hundredth time, how you ended up here, alone in a crap old house, alienated from everyone you knew.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Five short years ago you had been living the dream.  Nice big apartment, in a committed relationship with the woman of your dreams.  A good job, friends the works.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You had been together since high school.  A lifetime of plans and memories to make together.  You had actually been building up to popping the big question.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It all fell apart so suddenly that you didn&#039;t quite believe it at first.  You had sat down with your best friend to talk over your plans and show him the ring you had bought your beau.  Tomorrow night you were gonna do it and you wanted his advice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Instead of being supportive however, he actually tried talking you out of it.  When he didn&#039;t come around things actually got heated and he walked out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The next day, the love of your life left.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; There was no explanation other than &quot;This isn&#039;t working Anon, we&#039;ve just grown apart...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Which was goddamned news to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; After a couple of weeks of unreturned phone calls and texts, the news hit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It was through social media you got it.  When she left her status had changed to &#039;single&#039;.  Then one day it changed again, and she posted a nice picture of her and your best friend.  They were an item.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Neither bothered responding when you called.  Your so called friends later revealed that she had been seeing him behind your back, for months.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; They had all known but none had the balls to tell you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It only got worse from there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A few weeks later they moved in together.  A short time after that they were engaged.  It was when they started telling everyone that she was pregnant that you finally just... broke.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; All the dreams and plans you had together, she was living them out with someone else.  Your best friend.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You left town shortly after.  Cutting ties with everyone you knew and just heading out to anywhere that wasn&#039;t here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; In time you used your savings to buy a small property and fix it up, selling it later for a profit.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You did this a couple more times before landing this old place.  Working any random job in that particular town to pay the bills, while spending your evenings and weekends working on the house.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You had almost managed to lose yourself.  To accept the broken loneliness as normal and simply... exist.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Then Nyssa had climbed into your bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The realisation was slow coming, but it came all the same.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; When you woke up this morning, you hadn&#039;t been that comfortable in such a long time, not since...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Not since those lazy mornings in bed with your beloved.  Spent simply dozing in each other&#039;s arms.  Content with only one another, the world could go fuck itself in those moments.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nyssa had brought that feeling back, just for an instant.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The anger made a bit more sense.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You had spent so long running from what had happened, the future you had lost, when even a sliver of the happiness you once felt came back... you had reacted.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Looking over to your left, you couldn&#039;t see any sign of Nyssa.  She was completely hidden under the covers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Into the darkness you whisper &quot;I&#039;m sorry.&quot; before closing your eyes and drifting off to an uneasy sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The bright numbers on the phone screen next to you said that it had only been about twenty minutes since when you last checked.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Something had woken you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The cause was easily discovered.  Nyssa.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; After you had drifted off she had scooted closer to you.  She had been careful not to make contact but she was very much on your side of the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Even without touching you could tell she was cold.  The heater had apparently died.  Piece of cheap crap.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She still had her back to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Reaching out slowly, you take her into your arms, pulling her close and in towards your chest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She wakes with a start.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Anon?  What...?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Shhhh Nyssa.  Its cold.  Lets just go to sleep.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With a contented little sigh, she curls up in your arms.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A feeling of peace spreads through you, one that you had told yourself was gone forever.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Tomorrow your going to have to leave, you&#039;ll take Nyssa as far away as you can from the people chasing her.  You might even be able to keep your promise... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; For now however all is well.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The rest of the world can go fuck itself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">--------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Chapter 6</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Morning comes around again all too soon.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You rouse slowly, for the second time in so many days you wake feeling a sense of ease you hadn&#039;t even realised you&#039;d been missing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The events of last night drift hazily back into focus.  Feelings of anger, memories of loneliness and despair, the feeling of someone in your arms again, of everything else fading away...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You realise that there is a noticeable lack of lizard based hugging going on right now, you yearn for that sense of belonging again and reach over to find Nyssa.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your hand finds... nothing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With a yawn you sit up and try to locate the missing lizard, rubbing the sleep out of your eyes in the process.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; There&#039;s no sign of her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Getting worried now you call out for her, &quot;Nyssa you there?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nothing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your a bit more than worried now.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She&#039;s been almost attached to you in some way since the moment she got here, even the shopping trip had turned into a strange and oddly funny road trip when she stowed away in the trunk.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Quickly throwing on some clothes you make for the door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; At the top of the stairs your struck by a smell of something meaty... and burning.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You charge downstairs and head for the kitchen.  Your confronted by the sight of a burning pan on top of the old cooker, flames just starting to flicker from the contents.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; There is no sign of Nyssa.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Grabbing a towel you switch off the gas and gingerly move the pan over to the sink.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Once the pan is extinguished you call out again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Nyssa?  What&#039;s going on?  Where&#039;d you go?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nothing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Looking at the ruins of your good pan you can piece together what seems to have happened.  Nyssa had taken some of the meat from the fridge, gammon by the looks of it, and attempted to... cook it?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; How did she even know to work the gas?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She must have watched you yesterday cooking the beef and tried to copy you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Had she just... tried to cook you breakfast?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The most pressing questions you had now were simply, where had she gone?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Had she got worried when the pan caught fire?

Well done Mr Anon, your just full of surprises aren&#039;t you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Despite the bash to the brain you recognise the voice instantly, its Monotone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You manage to turn over onto your back, and get a good look at your attacker.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Standing over you is Monotone, the creepy smile back on his face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Well Mr Anon, I think you have some explaining to do, don&#039;t you?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He has his big ass hand cannon out again, its pointed directly at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You manage to take a look at the rest of the room from where you are, it is still a mess from their last visit, your tools and gear scattered about.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A bit behind you stands Sunglasses, he has his back to you.  Unlike Monotone however he has an extra bit of kit to go along with his gun, what looks like an industrial grade cattle prod.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; At his feet you can just make out what looks like... your old hoodie.  Nyssa.  She&#039;s not moving.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;You sonofa...&quot; you start.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A swift boot from Monotone cuts off the rest of your sentence.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your roughly pulled up into a sitting position against the wall, gun still pointed at your head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Your probably wondering Mr Anon, why we haven&#039;t just killed you yet?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Trying to shake the dizziness from your head you just about manage a shrug.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;I figured it was just my boyish good looks...&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; This elicits a guffaw from Sunglasses.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Monotone however is unimpressed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;No Mr Anon, that&#039;s not why.  If you think back to our last conversation I clearly told you it would be in your best interests not to impede our search.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He kneeled down closer for this bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So imagine my surprise, that when I come over to check you are all safe and sound I find our quarry, in your house, wearing your clothes, attempting to &#039;cook&#039; of all things.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You remain silent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Sunglasses chimed in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Yeah, and why it called out YOUR name when we took it down?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He sets off his prod to make his point, a large spark of blue light flashed from the end followed by the loud &#039;crack&#039; you had heard earlier.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You look again at Nyssa, she seems to be unconsciousness.  There are a couple of burn marks on the hoodie from where they must of zapped her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Something new takes root inside of you.  Something even your cheating ex hadn&#039;t stirred in you before.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Its cold.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The closest you can come to describing it, is hate.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Ignoring the daggers your mentally stabbing him with, Monotone continues.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;When we created these creatures, we had a very specific purpose in mind.  We spliced in the best parts from the finest sources, in order to make the perfect killing machine.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He punctuated the last two words by tapping you on the forehead with his gun.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;The only thing we couldn&#039;t seem to instill in them, was obedience.  We inspired fear, hate, even terror in some of them, but not one would follow orders without a serious amount of... incentive.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Sunglasses set of the prod again into the air.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Now what we want to know is this, how exactly, in just two days, did you train this one to follow you around?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You look up at him in surprise.  They think you somehow taught Nyssa to be obedient.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You remain silent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;You are going to answer me to our satisfaction Mr Anon.&quot; Monotone sneers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Your answers will determine if this ends with a bullet to the head, or one to each of your joints.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Sunglasses was starting to look excited.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; While they waited for you to ponder your own mortality, you notice that less than a foot away is your hammer.  Its still lying on the floor from when those idiots tipped your tool box all over the place.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Either they hadn&#039;t seen it, or they were stupid enough to not see it as a threat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; All you need is a distraction and it would be in your grasp.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Have you decided if your going to help us or not Mr Anon?&quot; asked Monotone.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;We&#039;re taking it back to where it belongs either way but your input will help determine if it can be salvaged, or if we&#039;re going to have to start from scratch.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Sunglasses was taking this opportunity to smile smugly at you, so he didn&#039;t notice Nyssa&#039;s eye crack open ever so slightly, or that it was shining a solid crimson hue...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Times up Mr Anon.  What is it going to be?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; They both have their attention on you now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Hmm lets see... you muse.  &quot;Do I spill my guts and then get executed, or do I keep quiet and get horribly tortured and then executed...  Tough call.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Just as Monotone raised his gun once again to your head, Nyssa let off a groggy &#039;Hhiisssssss&#039;.  Causing Sunglasses to turn around and Monotone to take his attention off you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It was all the distraction you needed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You grab the hammer and go for Monotone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Stop.  Its hammer time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You lash out with the claw side first, striking him at his gun hand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; With a startled cry he drops it, and his trigger finger too you notice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The return swing sees the flat end connect with his head.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A satisfying crunch is followed by him toppling to the floor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Yeah that blond bitch Thor got nothing on you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Leaping to your feet you go for gold, lobbing your weapon straight at Sunglasses&#039; head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your jubilation quickly evaporates as it flies clean past his head and smashes out through the living room window.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Well shit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Sunglasses by now has turned and got a bead on you.  At this range there&#039;s little chance he&#039;ll miss.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As he pulls the trigger however, a clawed hand reaches up and sinks into his hip.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He screams.  The shot goes wide even as you make a leap to the hallway, and punches a hole through to the kitchen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; At this point Nyssa has pulled herself up from the ground and is giving Sunglasses a demonstration of what she learnt from the master&#039;s instruction.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She shows him exactly how to Rip and Tear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her razor sharp teeth sink into his right shoulder, her clawed hands tear through the black suit and into the flesh beneath.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He screams some more.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your desperate evasion had taken you back out into the hall.  Your head was still throbbing from the hit Monotone had given you so getting back up wasn&#039;t all that easy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As you struggle to stand Nyssa is busy making short work of Sunglasses.  His face is locked in a rictus of pain as she tears into him, he&#039;s dropped his gun but the prod is still waving around in his other hand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Despite the horror show playing out in front of you, your attention is drawn elsewhere.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Over the smell of gunpowder and blood there is something else... Gas.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A quick look over to the hole in the wall made by the hand cannon tells you where its coming from.  The stupidly huge calibre round had punched clean through to the kitchen, and blown a chunk out of the old cooker in there.  Some small miracle had stopped the house from going up but gas was leaking out, fast.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; One small spark and it was bye bye birdie.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; By now Sunglasses had dropped the prod, it lay on the floor, still clutched by his severed hand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He had dropped to his knees and fallen silent, but Nyssa still tore into him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You stumble towards her, intending to pull her back towards the door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As you reach out however her head snaps up and she hisses.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Nyssa come on we have to go!  There&#039;s gas!  Its not safe here!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her eyes are wild, her snout covered in gore and pink foam coats the corners of her mouth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Nyssa?&quot; you ask uncertainly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She drops what&#039;s left of her victim, even as he hits the floor you notice his sunglasses are somehow still in place.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She starts moving towards you.  Her head lowering down and her clawed hands extending outwards. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It doesn&#039;t look like she&#039;s in a hugging mood anymore...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You back away from her slowly, whether from the cruel punishment at the hands of her masters or from the taste of their blood dripping from her maw, the Nyssa you knew wasn&#039;t in control right now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The angry lizard advancing on you was breathing heavily, the loose fitting clothes you had given her stained red and scorched by the prod.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She was acting on instinct, ready to take out any and all threats, including you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your back hits the wall, somehow you had got turned around and Nyssa was between you and the door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Ok its me its Anon calm down...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your words have no effect.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She is in striking distance now.  One swipe of her claws or snap of her jaws and you would be looking just as pretty as your friend on the floor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She stops in front of you, her jaws are open, pieces of Sunglasses caught in her teeth.  You literally stare into the jaws of death.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As all is lost you come up with one last desperate plan.  All or nothing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She moves to strike, while you move directly into her grip... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her claws sink into your back, as you wrap your own arms around her and hold on for dear life.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She freezes.  Pain blossoms from where she has you, but she doesn&#039;t stab any deeper.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Its... ok... Nyssa...&quot; you manage to say through gritted teeth.  &quot;Its me... Anon... remember?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You hold her there, in the most painful, but also most sincere hug of your life.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Tense moments pass as the house slowly fills with gas, neither of you moving.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Eventually you feel the claws retract, the pain worsens for a second as they leave your flesh, you don&#039;t let her go.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her own arms tighten around you, turning the one sided hug into a mutual embrace.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;An..on..?  she whispers, her voice cracking.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;It&#039;s ok, we&#039;re ok.  Everything&#039;s going to be alright.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; There&#039;s no time to enjoy the thought of your continued survival however, the smell of gas is getting worse.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Nyssa, come with me.  Lets get away from here.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As you start moving towards the door things take a turn for the worse. Monotone is back on his feet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; His right hand is bleeding badly from where you took his finger, his left eye socket has caved in, the result of your second blow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He looks dazed, but his remaining eye is fixed on you. In his other hand he was holding his gun.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Nyssa hissed but there wasn&#039;t time for a fight, one blast of that gun would end you all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Instead you make for the window. Hopefully Monotone had enough sense in his damaged head to notice the gas and not shoot.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Nyssa leave him! There&#039;s no time! We have go, quick the window!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The window had been broken by your earlier hammer throw, it was your only chance to escape.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Grabbing Nyssa you make a break for it. You just needed a few seconds...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Monotone either didn&#039;t notice the gas or didn&#039;t care, raising the hand cannon he took aim, his hand wavering with the effort, and with one final creepy smile he pulls the trigger.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The house disintegrates as the shot ignites the gas, the force of the blast totalling it completely and blowing out the windows of the surrounding neighbour&#039;s homes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; When silence returned, nothing remained of Anon&#039;s house save for a debris strewn crater and a surprisingly sturdy garage.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; For the first responders from the emergency services, there were many questions but little in the way of answers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">----------------------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Epilogue</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; In the days following the explosion there had been a flurry of activity.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; At first there had been confusion, there was no immediate sign of the homeowner, or any of his neighbours in fact.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; What they did find was two unidentified corpses amongst the wreckage and a large amount of abandoned surveillance equipment in the house across the street.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Considering the corpses were armed with outlawed weaponry and not one of the missing neighbour&#039;s families had heard from them in the last couple of days, a manhunt was launched.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; At first there was no sign, no leads and a media frenzy over the mysterious vanishing of so many families.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Things opened up however when the police found Monotone and Sunglasses&#039; van.  When they cracked it open they found a treasure trove of information.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A whole cache of weapons, outlandish animal traps and a stack of files marked Destroy after reading - confidential&#039;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The files led the investigators to two locations.  The first was an old disused motel a couple of miles outside of town.  It was there the missing families had been held.  Their kidnappers taken without a fight, were surprisingly eager to talk.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The second location was a private medical research facility out west belonging to an organisation known as Getrix.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; What they found there never made it to the papers, a taskforce of government agents saw to that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Despite the media interest little more came out, until the missing homeowner, Anon, reappeared.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">----------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; They had taken you to the local police station but it was not the local boys in blue that did the questioning.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It was another pair of chuckle brothers, although a bit more on the professional side than the first two.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The conversation had gone something like this...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Mr Anon..&quot; they began, but you were in no mood for smiles and games this time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Its just Anon actually.  Your two buddies made that mistake too.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; They share a look and start again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Well... &#039;just Anon&#039;... I assume you mean the two gentlemen who visited you last time.  They were not ours I assure you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Taking nothing for granted this time you go on the offensive.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Actually I was wondering about that, they never showed me any ID and they didn&#039;t give me any names.  How about you boys introduce yourselves this time and then we go from there?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; They exchange another look.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Very well.&quot; says the chuckle on the left.  &quot;My name is Agent Smith.&quot;  He shows you an FBI card with his mug on it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The chuckle on the right produced an almost identical card with an almost identical mug shot (they did look kinda similar actually...).  &quot;I am also Agent Smith.  No relation.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You wait for the drum tap and confetti, but they&#039;re both serious.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Do you know why your here Anon?&quot;  Smith one... you think.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Oh yes I do.&quot; You reply.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Good, then we can dispense with the pleasantries.  Where is it?&quot;  Smith two this time (god this is confusing).</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;No.&quot;  You say simply.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;No?  Your in no position to-&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Oh really?&quot; you interrupt.  &quot;I&#039;ve been listening to the news, I know what you guys are covering up and I think its time I got some answers.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; They sit there and share another little look.  Your ready for their response.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Answers Anon?  If you don&#039;t cooperate things will go badly for you, very badly.  There are places in this world that make Guantanamo look like a holiday camp.  Please consider this before you next speak.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You show them your best shit eater smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The last guys threatened me too, funny that huh?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Before they could respond you press on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Here&#039;s how I see it. The guys that totalled my house were chasing something, it was big, scaly and, here&#039;s the good part, liked to talk.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Another look.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;It told me where it came from, it told me what they did there and a few other things. You two are going to fill in the blanks.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Your not doing yourself any-&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You interrupt again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;I also had access to my smart phone, which means I took pictures, recorded some footage, and hid the memory card. And no its not in my ass do don&#039;t get any funny ideas.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Their paying you more attention now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Oh, I made sure to tip off the press still camping out in the square that I would be making an appearance so they saw me come in here. If I magically disappear down one of those dark holes you just mentioned, not only will they know where I disappeared from but the memory card &#039;will&#039; find its way too them.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; They look a bit pissed now, but you had come prepared today, with a very specific goal in mind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Long and short of it is this, I want some answers, I want some damned compensation and a guarantee that I&#039;ll be left alone. In return I give you the card, I tell you everything that the creature told me, and... I&#039;ll tell you where I buried its body.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; After a bit of discussion and a few phone calls to whoever was wearing the big boy pants, they agree to your terms. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You&#039;re a bit surprised that they gave in so quickly but what they tell you next goes some way to explain why.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Turns out Getrix had been building bioweapons in secret, with a plan to show them off to the powers that be and sell their secrets to the highest bidder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The reason the FBI guys were so ancy was that one of the planned bidders had been someone very high up in the Defence department. If the truth got out it would cause one hell of a political clusterfuck. They wanted to deal with it behind closed doors, the appropriate people were being quietly &quot;retired&quot; but without an audience.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Your revelations would upset the applecart so to speak.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; In return for your cooperation, you would give them everything, sign an ironclad confidentiality agreement, and get a very, very large &#039;consultants fee&#039;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When everything was signed, sealed and in the right bank account, you led them to the middle of the woods.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It was here you had told them you had buried Nyssa. She had suffered fatal wounds during the fight with Monotone and died after your escape.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; When you got there however, they find only a hole.

&gt; Be Anon.
&gt; It&#039;s been a long day at the office and your on your way home. Winter is almost here so its already dark outside and the temperature is taking a nose dive.
&gt; Your coming up to the corner of the suburb where you live when you are flagged down by a guy in overalls. He is standing by a black van with what looks to be a hastily stenciled on Animal Control logo on the side.
&gt; &quot;Can I help you?&quot; 
&gt; The guy is remarkably well groomed for a dog catcher.
&gt; &quot;Do you live around here sir?&quot; He asks in response.
&gt; &quot;Yeah I do, what&#039;s this about?&quot;
&gt; He gestures back to his van where you notice a second guy sitting in the passengers seat. It&#039;s dark out now but he seems to be wearing a large pair of black sunglasses anyway. Weird.
&gt; &quot;We&#039;ve been called in to investigate reports of a wild animal in the area, we&#039;re just informing all locals to keep an eye out for it and to not approach if they see anything.&quot;
&gt; You really don&#039;t need this, not today.
&gt; &quot;Really?&quot; You ask. &quot;What kind of animal? We&#039;ve had strays wander around out here before and there were no warnings put out then.&quot;
&gt; The control guy is completely deadpan when he answers.
&gt; &quot;Its some kind of reptile.&quot;
&gt; Wut.
&gt; &quot;Reptile? Like as in what? A snake? Lizard? Crocodile or whatever?&quot;
&gt; The town where you live isn&#039;t exactly in the middle of croc country and the last thing to saunter down this street sporting scales was your idiot neighbour Ted who bought himself a pair of alligator skin boots, which turned out to be fake, and promptly dissolved when his dog took a whiz on them.
&gt; Again with the same blank look and an annoyingly monotone voice he answered.
&gt; &quot;We are uncertain at this time sir but we believe it to be dangerous.&quot;
&gt; Handing you a card through the car window he continues.
&gt; &quot;If you do see anything out of the ordinary then please call the number on that card immediately and we will be there in minutes.&quot;
&gt; Questions come to mind at this point, such as if he doesn&#039;t know what it is then how does he know it&#039;s dangerous? Or since when does animal control hand out business cards with nothing on them but a cell phone number? No name or anything?
&gt; As you move to ask however he cuts you off.
&gt; &quot;If you do happen to encounter anything then please don&#039;t try to take pictures either. Sudden flashes of light or loud noises may make it hostile. Just call the number and leave the area&quot;.
&gt; Again a lot of info on something they haven&#039;t even got a description of.
&gt; &quot;Oh and one last thing. Make sure to secure all of your doors and windows tonight. With the temperature going down it may try find shelter indoors.
&gt; Now that you were thoroughly freaked out he simply turned and went back to his van. Ignoring your attempts to question him further.
&gt; With little other choice you continue the short journey home.

&gt; Quickly getting inside your front door you breathe a sigh of relief. It was the weekend at last. Plenty of things to keep you busy but it would be stuff you enjoy and at your own pace. Unless anything eats you that is.
&gt; With a stretch you drop your jacket and head for the kitchen, time for a snack and probably bed. The chill in the air stops you in your tracks however.
&gt; You are currently in the process of renovating the house by yourself with the intention of selling it on when your done, the heating hasn&#039;t been installed yet so cold is expected but a breeze?
&gt; Looking in to the kitchen you see the source of the problem. The previous owners had a cat, which meant a cat flap; replacing the door had been on your list but not just yet, the gaping hole where the flap used to be however would certainly merit a change of plan...
&gt; You stand there for a second, your tired mind trying to comprehend what you see...
&gt;  A small, desperate part of you hopes that this is the work of some regular old burglars, but a closer look at the damage suggests otherwise.  
&gt; The cat flap lay in pieces on the floor over by the fridge, not a cheap piece of plastic but a sturdy electronic type designed not to open for just anything...  
&gt; What really catches your eye though, the claw marks.  Something had left deep gouges in the splintered wood around the hole.  
&gt; Something had kicked in the flap pulled itself in, widening the hole in the process.  Something... Big.
&gt; Apart from the main downstairs hall and the kitchen, the house was in darkness.  What if it was still in here?  Whatever it was?  Watching you!?!
&gt; You spin around and scan the room and doorway.  Nothing.  You hold your breath and listen.  Still nothing.
&gt; The thought of searching the rest of the dark house for some nameless horror by yourself somehow didn&#039;t appeal to you at this point.
&gt; The odd card in your pocket sprung to mind.  There were two weirdos around the corner actually looking for this thing that could help.
&gt; Trying to keep a wary eye on your surroundings you pull out your phone and punch in the number.  Almost immediately a voice answers.  One you recognise.
&gt; &quot;Pest control.&quot;  Its Mr Monotone.
&gt; &quot;Uh yeah its Anon?  We spoke outside just a few minutes ago?  I think there&#039;s something in my... wait a minute.  Did you say Pest Control?  I thought you said you were Animal Control?&quot;.
&gt; Silence.
&gt; &quot;Well whoever you are I think the thing your looking for has broken into my house!  Can you help me or not!?!&quot;
&gt; There was some muffled whispering on the other side for a moment before he answered.  
&gt; &quot;Address?&quot;

&gt; To be fair he was true to his word, in less than two minutes they had found their way to your front door.  Rather than waiting for you to let them in however, they opted to kick it down.
&gt; If it hadn&#039;t been your life going down the tubes you might have found the ensuing mayhem quite funny.  
&gt; The two dog catchers/pest controllers/fancy dress enthusiasts or whatever stood in your hallway, panting, they must have run all the way here.  
&gt; Monotone in his perfectly clean overalls wile Mr Sunglasses stood in a crisp black suit.  Both were holding what you could only describe as an oversized hand cannon.  The kind of weapon that could leave a hole in your wall the size of a watermelon and seriously ruin the day of your next-door neighbours.
&gt; &quot;Where is it?&quot; Oh look, sunglasses speaks.  You just stand there and point at your ruined backdoor.  Then at your ruined front door.  Unable to speak
&gt; They nod to each other and start searching the house, breaking just about everything not nailed down and stopping to tear up everything that was.
&gt; Now the house was still a work in progress, nowhere near finished and covered in paint sheets so theoretically it should be difficult to make a mess of.  It was still (at least in your opinion) unnecessary to tip out the contents of your toolbox over the floor, pull up all the sheets and THEN tip over the paint cans and walk it all through the house.  
&gt; They made sure to check (and in some way break) every inch of the house before finally coming back down to you.
&gt; You all stand there staring at each other for a few seconds before Monotone breaks the silence.
&gt; &quot;There&#039;s nothing here.&quot;
&gt; &quot;You think!?!&quot;
&gt; Where your home had started as a worksite it now resembled a war zone and you were ready to blow.  
&gt; Who are you people?!?  What the hell is going on and WHAT THE FUCK DID THAT TO MY DOOR!?!&quot;
&gt; With that Sunglasses steps forward and you find yourself on your ass.  The sight of the two large handguns in your face tells you its not a good idea to get back up.
&gt; Sunglasses stoops down to your level and smiles.
&gt; &quot;Let me make this simple for you. It doesn&#039;t matter who we are, it doesn&#039;t matter what has been here or where it went. All that should matter to you is that it is not here now.&quot;
&gt; He reaches over and pats you on the shoulder.
&gt; &quot;You&#039;ve been very lucky, more than you know. We are going to leave now and carry on with our search. If your smart, your going to forget any of this happened. Its either that or you become a problem. One that needs to be dealt with. Do we understand each other?&quot;
&gt; The smile never left his face.
&gt; You nod slowly.
&gt; With that they holster their weapons and walk back out through the broken front door. Monotone stops at the the threshold and calls back to you over his shoulder.
&gt; &quot;Remember Mr Anon, we will be around if you see anything else tonight. Just give us a shout if you need us.&quot;
&gt; With the chuckle brothers gone you are left alone, cold and feeling very exposed. With two gaping holes into your home, the knowledge that the only so called &#039;help&#039; in the area just threatened to have you dealt with, and of course, some unknown creature lurking outside... You just really want to curl up in a ball and cry.

&gt; Outside the two figures get back into their van and wait.
&gt; &quot;You think she&#039;ll come back?&quot;
&gt; &quot;She made the effort to break into this one, cant see that she would spook so easily. If we wait she&#039;ll make an appearance.&quot;
&gt; Sending an update to the other search teams they settle in and wait.

--------------------------------------
Chapter 2

&gt; Not being one to sit back and take what life dishes out you spend the next hour sealing the breaches.  Your front door is re mounted back on its hinges and locked up tight.  You even use some spare lumber to sure it up so that no one (or no thing) can break it down again, for tonight at least.
&gt; You patch the hole in the backdoor but, feeling a bit worried about any uninvited guests, shuffle the big old fridge over and block it completely.  There is an outlet near the door so gone off milk will not be a problem for tomorrow.
&gt; The mess left by your other guests is not going to be so easy to deal with.  Weeks of work undone in minutes and weeks more added to the schedule before you can get back on track.  
&gt; You have a local day job in town to cover your day to day bills and spend your weekends working on the house, the prospect of starting it all over again tonight is just too much so you call it a day.
&gt; Upstairs is as much a mess as the rest of the house but your bed seems untouched.  
&gt; Thank heavens for small mercies...
&gt; Entering your bedroom you realise that it is not completely unscathed.  There was not much in there to start with but your king size bed, a night table, a few boxes and a closet.  Everything but the bed and table has been toppled, emptied or scattered around the room.
&gt; With a sigh you decide to leave it til morning.  You want nothing more than to curl up in bed and just sleep.  
&gt; Before you do however, one last thing.  
&gt; You shut the bedroom door, lock it and wedge it shut with some of the boxes.  
&gt; With your repairs downstairs and these extra precautions you should survive til morning, or at least feel safe enough to get some sleep.
&gt; Stripping down to your boxers and an old t-shirt you finally hit the sack.

&gt; A few minutes in you realise something is wrong.  The reason why eludes you but something in the back of your mind wont let you sleep until you figure out what it is.
&gt; Sitting in the dark you close your eyes and try to work out what&#039;s bothering you.
&gt; Putting together a mental checklist usually helps sort through your problems so here goes.
&gt; Doors? - all locked and blocked.
&gt; Windows? - all sealed shut.
&gt; Creepy places something can hide? 
&gt; You have to stop and think about this one.  
&gt; The chuckle brothers (as you now considered them) had if nothing else, been thorough.  
&gt; They had opened every cupboard, closet, box and door in the place and there had been no sign of anything.  Whatever had broken in must have left the same way.  
&gt; You were safely locked in here, in your nice warm bed with...
&gt; Your bed.  
&gt; The only thing in the house they didn&#039;t apparently rip, flip or trash.  
&gt; They would have checked it though right?  The first place anyone looks for monsters is under the bed right?
&gt; Just as a sense of panic starts to build you stop dead.  No breathing, thinking, even your heart goes quiet.
&gt; From somewhere near the end of your bed you hear the smallest of scratches across the wooden floor.  
&gt; You lay there in the dark with your eyes shut, hoping against hope that its just your overtired imagination playing tricks on you.
&gt; You feel a pressure on the bottom end of the bed as someone, no, something climbs up ever so silently.
&gt; You open your eyes and slowly try to see what is there.  
&gt; In the darkness is the faintest of silhouettes, as you adjust to the lightless room it feels as if time itself has stopped.  
&gt; A light &quot;hissssssss&quot; drifts up towards you.
&gt; Shit.  Shit shit shit shit shit.
&gt; Fight or flight time, going to make this thing work for its meal!
&gt; Your body chooses to freeze instead.
&gt; Crap.  
&gt; The figure crawls slowly further up the bed, becoming clearer with each movement.
&gt; The first detail that strikes you is a pair of slightly glowing orbs, its eyes.  
&gt; They shine dimly in the dark almost like a cats.
&gt; It is approaching on all fours but you are frozen, too terrified to try run or even look away...
&gt; The creature has moved close enough to be almost on top of you now, hissing more frequently as it closes the gap.
&gt; It takes a car passing outside to finally break the spell on you, its headlights momentarily flashing across your visitor.
&gt; It balances atop of you, its reptilian head hovering over yours.  
&gt; A row of razor sharp teeth slashed across its partially open maw, almost like a grin.  
&gt; You just about make out the outline of a large pointed tail waving behind it before the light is gone, temporarily stealing your night vision along with it.
&gt; Then its on you.  
&gt; With another hiss it grabs your shoulders as you try to flip out of bed.  
&gt; You make it half way out before it pulls you back in.  
&gt; A scream starts but dies in your throat as its fiendishly strong but lithe arms wrap around your chest from behind, a set of large and sharp talons prick at your chest.
&gt; You wait for the inevitable feeling of teeth sinking into your throat.
&gt; The world throws you another curveball however.  
&gt; Its snout comes to a stop just to the left of your sweating head, and it speaks.
&gt; &quot;Cold, so cold.&quot; It whispers.
&gt; &quot;You are warm, so warm.  Stay.  You stay here, in warm.&quot;
&gt; With that it pulls you down into the covers and wraps itself around you.  
&gt; In your shock you note that it is indeed icy cold, you feel its smooth scaled body pressing against yours as it pulls you in tighter.
&gt; It whispers to you again as you lay entwined in the dark.  &quot;Mmmgghissssss.. Yessss you are warm.  We sleep...&quot;

&gt; With that it fell silent, except for the steady rhythm of its breathing.  
&gt; The words of Mr Monotone came back to haunt you then.  &quot;Its getting cold out.  It may try getting inside to warm up.&quot; 
&gt; As you lay there in the dark, a glorified body pillow for the scaled intruder you had inadvertently locked yourself in with, you realised it was going to be a long night.

---------------------------------------------
&gt; For the first hour or so you try various ways to extract yourself from the brain bending situation you have somehow landed in.  
&gt; When you started your trip home earlier this evening the sirens call of your bed was just about all you could hear.
&gt; Now that you were trapped here however, escape was the only thing on your mind.
&gt; First you tried a direct approach.  The sound of the creature&#039;s breathing seemed to suggest that it had fallen asleep.  
&gt; It had its arms clutched tightly around your chest and midsection from behind, so you started there.
&gt; With your still free arms and hands you slowly try to pry it&#039;s clawed hands (at least they feel like hands, not enough light to check) free.  
&gt; If you could just loosen it&#039;s grip and slip out of bed then you had a fighting chance of making it to the door, or throwing yourself through the window.
&gt; The result was not what you hoped.  
&gt; With a displeased hiss coming from behind you it tightened it&#039;s grip around you and actually snuggled in closer.  
&gt; Whereas before you only had the sensation of its arms and upper body to deal with it now placed its snout up against the base of your neck, just where it meets your back.  
&gt; You feel it&#039;s legs pull up behind yours and tuck in close.
&gt; A third appendage slinked down between your legs and looped around your left leg.  Either the tail you caught sight of earlier was really quite dexterous or this thing was a male, scarily well endowed, and getting excited.
&gt; You tensed and waited.  The grip it had on you made breathing a bit more difficult and with something wrapped around your leg your mind was playing all kinds of nightmare scenarios.
&gt; Nothing happened.  You couldn&#039;t feel any teeth on your neck and the tail (breathe Anon, just breathe) made no more moves.  After a moment you feel a warm blast down your back as the creature lets out a contented &#039;huff&#039; and continues sleeping.

&gt; Ok, time for plan B.
&gt; The direct approach hadn&#039;t worked.  
&gt; If anything it had made matters worse.  
&gt; The creature had you in what felt like a death grip and you had been promoted from body pillow to full on little spoon.  
&gt; You had never been the &#039;little&#039; part of this equation before.
&gt; Before climbing in to bed you had left your cell on the night table, your hands were still free so it dawned on you that reaching for it was a real option.  
&gt; The number for the chuckle brothers should still be on there.  
&gt; You pause and ponder this for a second before trying anything.
&gt; Images of them kicking in your door again, falling over themselves in the dark and inadvertently shooting you along with your guest, dance before your eyes.
&gt; Fuck those idiots.  
&gt; You&#039;re going to call the cops, or the army, or a priest or someone... anyone at this point!
&gt; Your hand slowly moves out from under the covers towards where the table should be... and finds nothing but air.
&gt; Adjusting your search area also finds nothing.  
&gt; In the process of pulling you down into the bed the creature had kicked the blanket up over you both and was serving now more like a nest, keeping the heat in and blocking your vision.
&gt; Pulling back you risk moving the covers up slightly to give you a better look...
&gt; Well shit.
&gt; In your earlier scuffle you must have knocked the table over, as you can just make out what looks like your phone over by the door.  
&gt; The battery is sitting next to it.  
&gt; The thing must have come apart when it hit the floor.
&gt; So much for plan B.

&gt; This process of trial, error, and abject failure continued on for a while longer as the creature enjoyed its snooze against you.  
&gt; Until finally, you give up.
&gt; The realisation that escape was impossible hit you hard.  
&gt; It was only a matter of time before it woke up and you graduated from snuggle buddy to breakfast in bed.
&gt; Damn, now you&#039;re hungry.

-------------------------------------------
Cahpter 3

&gt; The sound of chirping birds and the gentle light shining through your blinds herald the arrival of morning.
&gt; Sleepily you consider getting up and making some breakfast, the prospect of leaving your warn and cozy bed however is not all that appealing just yet.  
&gt; It has been some time since you have felt this comfortable first thing in the morning and decide ten more minutes couldn&#039;t hurt.
&gt; Hazy memories of shadowy figures with rows of grinning teeth press at the edges of your still semiconscious mind.
&gt; Damn you had some messed up dreams last night.
&gt; It feels like you have been sleeping awkwardly as your left arm is all numb and slightly tingly, you are currently on your back and move to roll over on to your side.
&gt; An unexpected weight on the said arm pins you in place however.  
&gt; Opening your eyes you slowly look to your left, a feeling of mounting dread rousing you out of your sleepy stupor.
&gt; Sleeping peacefully at your side is the creature.  
&gt; Your arm is between its head and the pillow.
&gt; Your arm IS its pillow.
&gt; The events of last night come flooding back.  
&gt; Not a dream... definitely not a dream.
&gt; You must have fallen asleep.  
&gt; How exactly you don&#039;t know, with that thing wrapped around you under the covers sleep had not been on the cards.
&gt; Keeping very still you take the opportunity to examine the creature properly.  
&gt; Last night it had been too dark to get a proper look and with it holding you from behind there had been nothing else you could do but lay there and let your imagination go wild.
&gt; It lay facing you, still snuggled under the covers and seemingly fast asleep, only it&#039;s head was visible but that was more than enough for you to cope with for the time being.  
&gt; There could be no doubt that it was some sort of reptile.  
&gt; At fist glance it resembled something from that movie you watched as a kid; Jurassic Park.  
&gt; Specifically, one of the velocirapters.
&gt; It had a long snout, covered with mottled green scales.  
&gt; Where its teeth had been on full display last night they were now mostly covered with some thin scaled lips, the exception being where its mouth rested upon your arm, affording you a glimpse of the terrifying flesh renderers within.
&gt; Its eyes, although still closed, strangely held your attention more than it&#039;s teeth.  
&gt; The scales surrounding them were not green, but were a slightly darker shade of lilac, almost violet, while the brows were risen and lined with a set of small spikes.
&gt; From where its slightly flared nostrils sat at the end of the nose, up the snout and between it&#039;s eyes, the scales were a darker green, almost black.  
&gt; From what you could see at this angle, they looked like they might continue down its back.
&gt; Apart from one clawed hand poking out between you, the rest of it remained hidden from view.
&gt; The sensible part of your brain noted that you were now only one trapped arm from freedom, if you could just wriggle out from under its head then you might actually make it out.
&gt; As you lay there a strange thought took you.  
&gt; How did it end up on your arm?  
&gt; Your last waking memory had been of it clutching to your back, to get to your current position it would have had to let you go, you would have had have flipped over and...
&gt; You remember that comfy feeling you had waking up, the one you hadn&#039;t felt in a long time...  
&gt; It was when you had last shared a bed with another.  
&gt; While you slept you must have hugged it back...
&gt; Instead of following this particularly troubling line of thought any further down the rabbit hole you instead try focusing on the task at hand.
&gt; Acutely aware that a set of razor sharp teeth were resting on your trapped arm.  
&gt; Very slowly, and very carefully, you try pulling away from the creature. 
&gt; You are met with mixed results.
&gt; You manage to pull about an inch out before it stirs, a low rumble rolls from it&#039;s throat as it reacts to the movement.  
&gt; Its eyelids flutter and the clawed hand begins to move upwards towards the pillow, and your arm.
&gt; As you consider just bolting from the bed and preying for a miracle the hand stops, barely a whisker away from your exposed bicep.  
&gt; Its eyes remain closed,it exhales softly but doesn&#039;t awaken.
&gt; Waiting a few minutes to make sure its safe, you try again.
&gt; Changing tac this time you opt for slowly twisting your arm upwards and away rather than pulling.
&gt; Success!  Your free!  All that&#039;s left is to get out the bed and unlock the door.
&gt; Before you make a move however, that part of your brain pipes up again.  
&gt; When the creature moved its arm before it pulled some of the covers up, the thought pops into your head to maybe sneak a peek under the covers at this thing before you run.  
&gt; After all... once your out the house and the authorities get here you will in all likelihood never see anything like this creature again.
&gt; As you reach forward, the other part of your mind chips in.  
&gt; &quot;Nope.  Bad Anon.  Your in bed with some sort of scaled death machine, against your will, and now that your free you want to risk it all for what?  To see if it has tits or something?  Get out while you can you idiot!!!&quot;
&gt; The life preserving part of your brain wins, this round at least.
&gt; You slowly slip out of bed, making sure not to pull on the covers as you go.  
&gt; The floor is freaking freezing!  It must have been colder last night than you realised.
&gt; Tiptoeing across to the door you slowly move the boxes out the way, cursing that they were more likely to get you killed than safe as you had planned.
&gt; There is still no movement from the bed.
&gt; All that&#039;s left is the lock, a simple key turn and... CLICK.
&gt; You freeze.  The treacherous door had turned on you at the last second.  
&gt; Looking over your shoulder you see... nothing.  No movement from the bed or sounds of angry lizards.
&gt; Opening the door you step out into the upstairs landing, almost there!
&gt; Directly opposite your room is the bathroom, to the left leads towards the stairs.
&gt; As you make a move, you hear a hissing noise.
&gt; Shit.
&gt; Looking once more behind you you see the creature is awake.
&gt; Its looking right at you, wide awake and only a few feet away.
&gt; You try to make a dash for the stairs but end up tripping backwards over some of the clutter from yesterday, sending you falling backwards into the bathroom.
&gt; You&#039;ve barely hit the floor before the covers are off the bed and the creature is dashing forwards, with only a second to react you scoot back and shut the bathroom door with your foot.
&gt; What follows is a dead silence.  
&gt; Nothing collides with the door, no claws come tearing through the thin wood, no hissing or shouting from the creature...  Nothing.
&gt; After a few minutes you begin to wonder what the fuck is going on.
&gt; The door downstairs had been sturdier than this one, even taking the cat flap into consideration.  
&gt; It had torn through it like it was nothing, why isn&#039;t it coming through now?  
&gt; Looking at your options you realise that, although free from the bed, your still boned.  
&gt; There is a window in here but unless you somehow drop to the weight and size of a four year old, and chop off your arms, there is no way your going to fit through.  
&gt; Its also locked, ironically to stop anything trying to get in.  
&gt; With thick double glazed glass in the frame there was little hope of breaking it with your bare hands to try get attention, even if you did it would cut you to ribbons.  
&gt; Enticing the thing outside with the smell of fresh blood was not a good idea.
&gt; Looking around there is nothing that would make a good weapon either.  
&gt; You haven&#039;t set a towel rail so no ripping one off the wall as a bludgeon.  
&gt; If the crime shows you used to watch are anything to go by then your toothbrush could be cut into a shank maybe?  
&gt; With nothing to sharpen it with though there didn&#039;t seem much hope of being able to do anything except give it minty breath when it eats you.
&gt; Another problem presents itself...
&gt; You need to pee.
&gt; The thought of turning your back to the door to go or the noise it would make didn&#039;t make it look like the best idea, if that thing charged the door however while you had a full bladder you might just piss yourself.  
&gt; You would like to think that whoever found your remains would believe you had gone down swinging, not cowering in a pool of your own urine.
&gt; With that you cautiously get up, turn around and do the business.  
&gt; There&#039;s no reaction from outside.
&gt; With that done you begin to get curious.  
&gt; What if its not out there anymore?  What if the sight of you up and moving around while it was still half asleep had spooked it?  What if it had just wanted a warm bed for the night and has left?
&gt; Your mind pondered these possibilities for another few minutes to the deafening sound of silence outside.
&gt; You could try wait it out but no one would miss you until at least Monday. 
&gt; Feeling oddly brave you decide to take a peep out the door, with a just remembered toilet brush in hand you open the door.
&gt; What waits for you outside is what you feared most, but not how you expected it.

------------------------------------------

&gt; Standing outside the bathroom door is the creature.  
&gt; Rather than poised and ready to pounce however it is actually wrapped almost completely in your bed covers.  
&gt; All you can see of it is its head poking out through the top and a pair of large, green scaled feet at the bottom, each sporting three large clawed toes.
&gt; The sight of it just standing there (looking absurdly adorable) causes your thought processes to stall.  
&gt; It makes no move to grab or otherwise disembowel you.  
&gt; A full minute goes by before anything happens, somehow its you who makes the first move.
&gt; Rather than trying to make a run or it or bashing it on the nose with your trusty toilet brush, you croak out a &quot;Hi&quot;.
&gt; The creature cocks its head to the side and responds with a chipper &quot;Hi!&quot; of its own.
&gt; Wtf.
&gt; Your mouth drops open.  
&gt; It apparently wants to talk.
&gt; Whereas it had spoken last night in a raspy whisper it had now responded with a coarse but recognizably female voice.
&gt; As you try to work out a response it speaks again.
&gt; &quot;Where going?&quot;  It asks.
&gt; &quot; Uhh nowhere...&quot; you respond uncertainty.  
&gt; This was going in a very different direction to what you had expected.
&gt; It continued to stare at you.  At this point you noticed its eyes, they were an amber colour flecked with small strands of red.  Its pupils were vertical slits of black.
&gt; With a huff of relief (it was worried?) it takes a step closer.
&gt; &quot;Good, good!  Is cold.  Come back to warm, yes?&quot; 
&gt; With that it throws open the covers and gives you a full flash of itself.
&gt; Oh shit.
&gt; Answering your hypothetical question from earlier, you notice that it does indeed seem to have tits... of a sort.
&gt; Its scaled breast is of a lighter hue than its head or arms.  Starting from the bottom of its long neck, smooth yellow-ochre scales descended down past its abdomen and disappeared between its legs.  
&gt; The &#039;tits&#039; as you had thought of them, were two mounds where they would be on a woman, except there did not seem to be any sign of areolas or nipples.  
&gt; Its arms, while partially obscured by the covers she (It silly Anon, not she!!) held seemed to be the same green as the scales on her head.
&gt; Something that drew your attention were her (don&#039;t make me tell you again Anon) hips.  
&gt; While her frame (warning you) was thin and precise she sported a set of hips that your ex would have killed or.  
&gt; Her legs (damn it) were are marvel.  The coloring was the same as her arms and head but flecked here and there with the purple from around her eyes.
&gt; The back of your mind recognised the strange shape of them too, it was called digitigrade or something, where she almost seemed to stand on her toes rather than the soles of her feet, but the rest of the brain wasn&#039;t listening.
&gt; With a swish the blanket closed back up as she looked at you expectantly.
&gt; As she stood there, beckoning you back to your own bed, your mind couldn&#039;t quite get itself back into gear.
&gt; Despite the random turn of events you really should be making a run for it, the thought of climbing back into bed with the strange lizard woman in front of you though was strangely... inviting.
&gt; Before your confusion could resolve itself there was a sharp knock from the door downstairs.
&gt; The demeanor of the creature changed instantly. She dropped the blanket and stood up to her full height, you noted she was a good few inches taller than your 6 foot 2, but much thinner.
&gt; Her eyes were open wide and her now visible tail stood stretched out behind. 
&gt; Another, louder set of bangs came from downstairs and a familiar voice shouted out.
&gt; &quot;Mr Anon. Please open the door.&quot;
&gt; It was Mr Sunglasses.
&gt; The effect on your guest was immediate, and she dropped down into what you could only describe as a &#039;combat stance&#039;. 
&gt; Her arms bent out in front of her as if ready to strike, the claws actually got larger at the end of her fingers as she curled them.
&gt; Her face, where a happy (if albeit scary looking) smile had just been changed completely. 
&gt; The lips pulled back to expose the gleaming teeth within, the small lines of red in her eyes had somehow expanded, changing them from gentle amber to crimson.
&gt; An angry hiss slipped from between the bared fangs.
&gt; She was within touching distance of you of course while all this was happening. You were suddenly very glad you had decided to take a piss before it had been scared out of you.
&gt; Sunglasses must have come back to check on you and see if anything else had happened during the night, if you didn&#039;t answer then he and his buddy would probably kick the door in again.
&gt; As you try and work out if screaming would be in your best interests the creature turns.
&gt; It quickly speaks in a panicked tone &quot;Make go away! No go back!&quot;
&gt; She was starting to get hysterical.  
&gt; It would not be beneficial to your long term health to do anything else but comply.  This may even be a golden opportunity to make your escape after all.
&gt; Putting your hands up carefully you first try and calm her down, getting panic mauled on the eve of your possible rescue would be bad.
&gt; &quot;Ok ok I&#039;ll make them go alright?  Just calm down and put those claws away ok?&quot;
&gt; The angry hissing died down and her eyes focused on yours. 
&gt; Before any more could be said Sunglasses piped up again outside.
&gt; &quot;Mr Anon?  Please come down to the door.  I wont ask again.&quot;
&gt; &quot;Ok I&#039;m coming!  Keep your pants on!&quot; You yell back at him, making the worried lizard jump slightly.
&gt; &quot;Wait up here ok?&quot; 
&gt; If she&#039;s up here then you have a better chance of escape.
&gt; Wasting no time you head down the stairs and go to the patched up front door.  
&gt; As you pull away the pieces of wood you had set the night before you realise there is a flaw to your newest escape plan: your guest had not stayed upstairs like you&#039;d hoped.
&gt; She had matched your speed coming down and had hidden herself against the wall to your side.  
&gt; When the door opened she would be hidden from view to the outside, but close enough to get stabby if you tried anything.
&gt; With the door open you are greeted by Sunglasses, he is still in the same black suit and sporting the fuck you smile from yesterday.
&gt; &quot;Morning Mr Anon.&quot; He says cheerily.  &quot;I hope I didn&#039;t wake you?&quot; 
&gt; He&#039;s messing with you now.
&gt; &quot; What do you want?&quot; You ask, none to friendly either. The idea of this man somehow being your saviour was beginning to stick in your craw.
&gt; &quot;Just checking up on you, after last night we wanted to make sure nothing had come back to visit.&quot; 
&gt; Blurting out that it was right behind you, panto style, was not going to go down well.  You were going to have to try alerting him to the danger without letting on to the creature.
&gt; Stuck between a dick and a sharp scaly place...  
&gt; Crap.
&gt; A plan came to mind...
&gt; She could only see your back, not your face.  If you could somehow communicate what was happening to Sunglasses without letting on what you were doing then there was still hope.
&gt; You decided to try a few facial expressions and eye movements to signal what&#039;s happening.  
&gt; &quot;So... have you found any sign of whatever smashed my door?&quot;  This was accompanied by a couple of winks and a few twitches of your cheek.
&gt; The expression on Sunglasses&#039; face remained unchanged.
&gt; &quot;Nothing yet, there hasn&#039;t been any more sightings.&quot;
&gt; He obviously hadn&#039;t caught the drift.
&gt; Trying again, you think up another question.
&gt; &quot;Where did it come from, this thing (wink wink)?  
&gt; &quot;That&#039;s not important Mr Anon, just that we catch it.&quot;
&gt; Son of a bitch.
&gt; Your face had been performing a full gymnastics routine by this point and he still hadn&#039;t taken any notice.
&gt; This went on for a little while longer, him dodging your questions, and somehow not getting any of your signals.
&gt; Just as you began to despair, his face suddenly gets a spark of understanding.  Finally!  The dense fucker gets it!
&gt; He leans in close, the smile getting... bigger?
&gt; &quot;I see what&#039;s happening here.  I disturbed something didn&#039;t I?&quot;
&gt; &quot;I&#039;ll give you some advice that worked for me.  Prunes.  Every morning.  It&#039;ll get you going like clockwork.  Remember to give us a call if you see anything else!&quot;
&gt; Leaving you stupefied and shivering on the doorstep, still in you boxers from last night, he turned away and left you to your fate.
&gt; The idiot had taken your non verbal pleas for help as a sign of... what?  Goddamned constipation!!!
&gt; You could still try and run...
&gt; A green scaled hand reached out and pushed the door closed.  Cutting off the last hope of escape.
&gt; You turned and prepared to accept the inevitable.  Whatever that may be.
&gt; She stood there, in the hall.  Nothing  between you now.  No door, no incompetent FBI wannabes, not even a blanket.
&gt; Her eyes were still the unsettling crimson from before, her teeth still bared.  It looks like its breakfast time at last.  
&gt; Her posture dips slightly as she prepares to pounce.  You close your eyes and wait.
&gt; It would seem that there might just be a God after all, and its favourite thing to do is screw with you.  Repeatedly.
&gt; When she finally makes contact, her arms are around you again.  No teeth or claws rake your flesh.
&gt; Instead of tearing you apart, she holds you in a tight bear hug and lifts you clean off the ground.
&gt; She doesn&#039;t say a word at first, just holds you there.
&gt; You realize she&#039;s shaking, not from the exertion of holding you up but...
&gt; With a sniffle and a hiccup she starts whispering.  Her words are too quiet and broken for you to make out at the start, but after a moment you begin to understand.
&gt; &quot;Thank..you (hiccup) thank you...&quot;
&gt; Over and over again she says it.  You even feel a wet patch forming on your chest from where she&#039;s holding you against her face.  She&#039;s crying.
&gt; It wasn&#039;t homicidal rage that you saw upstairs when Sunglasses knocked.  It wasn&#039;t with monstrous hunger that she held you close now.
&gt; Its fear.
&gt; This creature... Armed with talons, fangs and the strength to lift a grown man... Is afraid of the two armed clowns outside.  She&#039;s holding you like her life depends on it.
&gt; At a loss as to how any of this is supposed to make sense you do the only thing you can.
&gt; You lift your one free hand and softly pat her on the head.
&gt; &quot;...Its ok&quot; you manage to wheeze.  &quot;He&#039;s gone, you can put me down now.&quot;
&gt; With a final squeeze she steps back and drops you back to your feet.  You don&#039;t know what she&#039;s packing under those scales considering how thin she is but damn, she has one hell of a grip.
&gt; Looking at her standing there, still sniffling, you realise there&#039;s more going on here than you thought.

---------------------------------------

&gt; After the events of last night and this morning you were already exhausted, according to the clock retrieved from the tip that was once the front room it was only 11am.
&gt; After calming down the still jittery lizard you had decided to try and get some answers.  Despite first impressions she hadn&#039;t actually done anything to harm you.
&gt; Trapping you in your own bed and freaking you out with her fearsome appearance aside, you didn&#039;t have so much as a scratch on you.
&gt; For better or for worse you had decided to question her.  Maybe she could fill in the blanks that the two guys outside had left open.
&gt; First things first however, you were still in your boxers.  
&gt; Somehow you convinced her to wait in the kitchen while you threw on some clothes.  
&gt; While there you also retrieve your phone and piece it back together.  Apart from a cracked screen it seemed to work ok.
&gt; The smart thing to do here would be to call in the cavalry.  
&gt; Something about this whole situation was... off, however.
&gt; The fact that there was a giant lizard woman in your kitchen aside, the way those guys outside acted and her reaction to you...
&gt; Coming back down the stairs you take a quick peek over the banister towards the kitchen to see what your guest is up to.
&gt; She has plopped herself onto one of the chairs you keep in there by a small table.  Her tail has gone through the gap below the back rest and is swaying slowly back and forth across the floor.
&gt; Your eyes linger on the point where the tail meets her body, the thick base sitting at the point where the spine would normally end on a human.  
&gt; Your scrutiny reveals more than a sudden twang of shame for letting your eyes linger, she is visibly shivering.
&gt; Its definitely a bit on the chilly side in here but not exactly freezing...
&gt; A piece clicks into place.  
&gt; A distant memory of evenings watching the discovery channel, of reptiles being generally cold blooded.
&gt; Last night, when she held you so tightly...
&gt; She had felt so cold...
&gt; With the temperature outside dropping so low and the lack of heating in your work in progress house, you had been the closest source of heat.
&gt; You couldn&#039;t just let her sit there shivering like that, you quickly dart back upstairs and retrieve your blanket, still where she had dropped it.  
&gt; Slightly dismayed over the visible tears from her claws, you scoop it up and head back down.
&gt; Once in the kitchen you hand her the blanket.  &quot;Here, take this.&quot; 
&gt; She takes it from your outstretched hands and quickly wraps it around herself, leaving only her head free.
&gt; With that sorted you take a seat opposite.
&gt; Looking at her in the cold light of day and without the pressing fear of evisceration, she didn&#039;t seem as threatening as before.  It helped that her eyes weren&#039;t red any more too.
&gt; &quot;Do you think you can answer some questions for me?&quot; you ask.
&gt; With a little nod of her head she confirms that she is.
&gt; &quot;Ok... lets start with something basic.  Where do you come from?&quot;
&gt; The likelihood of her being some sort of alien had crossed your mind, it would explain why the two looking for her were dressed in black.
&gt; She cocked her head slightly and seemed to think about it for a second before answering.  
&gt; Lifting her scaled arm from the blanket she pointed at the west wall and said simply &quot;That way&quot;.
&gt; Feeling a bit let down by so simple an answer you try and press her further.
&gt; Could you tell me what&#039;s over there?&quot;
&gt; Cocking her head again she looks at you quizzically.  &quot;Place I was at, but now am not.&quot;
&gt; Either she doesn&#039;t know or she doesn&#039;t really have a concept of place names as of yet.
&gt; Perhaps you should start smaller.
&gt; &quot;Ok how about your name?&quot;
&gt; She gives you a confused look at this.
&gt; &quot;Name?  What this?&quot;
&gt; This you didn&#039;t expect, but press on.
&gt; &quot;Your name is what your called, my name is Anon, that&#039;s how others know me.&quot;
&gt; She seems to understand what you mean.
&gt; &quot;Ah!  Fathers called me (she struggled with the pronunciation at first) Ex.. Expen... Experiment thirteen!&quot;  She beamed at you, proud that she had managed to say the full thing.
&gt; That sounded like something from a lab, a designation more than a name.
&gt; &quot;Is that the only thing they called you?  Its a bit of a mouthful...&quot;
&gt; She thought about it again.  You hoped that if she had come from some sort of crazy experiment lab they had least given her more than a number.
&gt; With a sharp inhale she suddenly looked ready to blurt something out to you, but stopped.  Her expression going from happy to heartbroken in a heartbeat.
&gt; She remained silent.
&gt; &quot;What&#039;s wrong?  Did I say something to upset you?&quot;
&gt; Looking down, she answered in little more than a whisper.
&gt; &quot;My sisters, we were all called experiment, but we had own word for us.&quot;
&gt; She looked on the verge of tears again.
&gt; &quot;They called me secret word, all had own word Fathers didn&#039;t know.  They call me... Nyssa.&quot;
&gt; Well, you had a name for her at least.  Along with some clues to her origins.  
&gt; She was also upset.  You hadn&#039;t set out to make her sad.
&gt; &quot;Nyssa huh?  That&#039;s a pretty name, it suits you.&quot;
&gt; She perked up a bit at this, but she still didn&#039;t look up at you.  Without further prodding from you she soon revealed why.
&gt; &quot;Sisters all gone now.  Only I left.  Masters take all away.&quot;
&gt; Her hand was resting on the table, she hadn&#039;t hidden it away again after pointing at the wall.  You suddenly feel compelled to put yours over hers, taken aback by how much emotion this cold blooded creature is capable of expressing you want to show her some compassion.
 &gt; &quot;I&#039;m sorry Nyssa.&quot;
&gt; At this little show of support she seemed to shake off some of her sadness.  With a little smile back on her face she starts talking again.
&gt; &quot;Thank you... Anon.  Been alone for long time, is cold being alone, but... maybe not cold anymore?&quot;
&gt; Oh dear.
&gt; Seems like she&#039;s getting the wrong idea here, you might be warming up to her a bit but you&#039;re not ready to adopt her or anything. 
&gt; Best thing to do is ask more questions for now, then once you know enough you can decide who the best people are to call in to sort this mess out.

&gt; For the next few hours you continue asking your questions and she slowly answers the best she can.
&gt; What you learn leaves you more troubled than when you began.
&gt; From what you can gather she is one of thirteen test subjects at some sort of lab.  
&gt; With her designation being thirteen and her admitting to being the youngest of her &#039;sisters&#039; it was easy to do the math.
&gt; These &#039;Fathers&#039; she spoke of seemed to be human like you rather than actual biological parents, most likely the scientists or people in charge of the lab.
&gt; Her broken way of speaking seemed to be down to how she learned: they taught the subjects to understand spoken English but not to speak it.  
&gt; The intention looked to have been that they know enough to follow commands but not answer back.  
&gt; The sisters were allowed some time together for exercise where they managed to start speaking to each other, the result was the best they could do by themselves.
&gt; Things went bad however when the &#039;masters&#039; were introduced.  Each subject was assigned a trainer to instruct them.  What they taught was how to hunt and kill, or as Nyssa called it, &quot;rip and tear&quot;.
&gt; If they did well then they were rewarded, if they failed they were punished.  
&gt; Nyssa actually stopped at one point to flash you some of the scales on her chest.  As you did your best to look away like the gentleman you fooled yourself into thinking you were, she directed you so something more serious.  
&gt; Between some of the scales were some discoloured lines, as if they had been parted and stuck back together again.
&gt; They were scars.  
&gt; Some she explained were from the punishments, others were from the fathers when they &quot;made her better&quot; with their shiny knives.
&gt; Surgical incisions if you had to guess.
&gt; They each had a &quot;warm light&quot; in their cells in which to sleep, a heat lamp of some sort from how she described it.  
&gt; If they misbehaved then the light would go out.  
&gt; When this happened the cold would come, sometimes the sisters would be together when this happened and they would snuggle up to each other to try and stay warm.
&gt; Sounded like they were deliberately using the temperature as a means of control too, and added another explanation as to why she chose to hug for warmth than say, gut you and hide in your warm entrails star wars style.
&gt; It all came to a head when the masters ordered them to fight each other.  
&gt; The goal was apparently to find the weakest of the thirteen and have the others kill her.  Some sort of lesson about strength or the weakest link perhaps?  Nyssa didn&#039;t know what the point was and you couldn&#039;t see it either.
&gt; What had happened instead was the &#039;eldest&#039; (she couldn&#039;t bring herself to use their secret names) turned on the masters, the others joined in and they somehow staged a jailbreak.
&gt; They broke out the lab and ran for it.  
&gt; They got separated into smaller groups as they ran, and as they were hunted by the masters.
&gt; One by one they fell, either to &quot;the master&#039;s big bang&quot; (she made a good approximation of the sound a gun makes, which was both heartbreakingly cute and sad) or to the elements.
&gt; By the time she had reached here, your house, she had been alone, cold and scared.  
&gt; She didn&#039;t know if any of her sisters had survived, the ones she had been with were all dead.
&gt; You knew the rest.  It involved breaking into your house to hide and then desperately searching for somewhere warm and safe to sleep.
&gt; You had fit the bill perfectly, that you weren&#039;t a consenting partner hadn&#039;t occurred to her.
&gt; With her story done Nyssa slumped into the blanket and huffed out a little sigh.  It was coming up to around 3pm.
&gt; Now that you knew what had brought her here you didn&#039;t want to just wash your hands of it all.  The chuckle brothers outside must be some of the &#039;masters&#039; searching for her.  
&gt; If you handed her over now then they would either kill her outright or worse, take her back to that hellhole for punishing.
&gt; If you called the cops or the authorities then... What?  Would they help her or would they act as you had?  See a giant lizard monster and shoot first?
&gt; Who could you call?  The press?  Scientists?  Would they be trustworthy?
&gt; There was too much info here for any kind of snap decision.
&gt; With a rumble from your stomach you realise that you haven&#039;t actually eaten anything since yesterday.
&gt; Getting up you decide to check the fridge.  Not a lot on offer.  Grocery shopping was on your list of jobs for the weekend but it had taken a bit of a back seat.
&gt; Another stomach rumble caused you to jump slightly.  It hadn&#039;t come from you.
&gt; Nyssa had got up and stood behind you with the blanket without making a sound.  
&gt; You could tell she was hungry too, if her story was true then she couldn&#039;t have eaten anything for quite some time, perhaps explaining why she was so skinny.
&gt; Rummaging through your fridge however only revealed a small portion of ground meat and some milk.  The rest was expired take out boxes which, by the smell, was due to go into the trash.
&gt; The beef had been left over from when you last bothered cooking for yourself.  There was just enough left to put something basic together but without other ingredients it wouldn&#039;t stretch between two.
&gt; Considering the... carnivorous nature of your guest, you figure the meat is the way to go.
&gt; Pulling it out you try and work out the best way to do this, you don&#039;t really know what she can eat or not, or if maybe she only eats live things like the little box of crickets you used to see in the pet store for bearded dragons.
&gt; Deciding that it would be best to ask first you turn and offer it to Nyssa, after all she may prefer her meat raw.
&gt; &quot;This any good? you ask hopefully.  
&gt; With a little sniff she gives you your answer.  
&gt; &quot;Is cold.&quot; she states flatly.
&gt; Well that told you.
&gt; &quot;Ok.... how about I cook it up then annndd... (genius strikes you hard) I got some bread in one of these cupboards that should still be good!  I&#039;ll make us some cooked beef sandwiches!&quot;
&gt; The puzzled look she gave you said everything, she didn&#039;t know what a sandwich was.
&gt; &quot;Ok well that settles it then!  Wait right there and I&#039;ll cook you up something nice ok?&quot;
 &gt; With that she shuffled back over to the table, still wrapped in the blanket and sat down.  You on the other hand made yourself busy.
&gt; The old cooker had been left by the previous owner, an old but sturdy gas one.  
&gt; Two of the four rings didn&#039;t work anymore and the inside stank of burnt turkey fat regardless of what you put in there but it still lit first time every time.
&gt; Adding some oil to your trusty (and only) pan you prepare to start frying the beef.  It wouldn&#039;t exactly by fine cuisine but it would be edible.
&gt; After a few minutes the smell of cooking meat filled the kitchen, now out the tray you can see there is less here than you originally thought but its all you had.
&gt; Nyssa had certainly noticed the smell, and she had a very hungry look about her.
&gt; It didn&#039;t take long for the meat to cook, a quick loot around your bare cupboards revealed the last of your bread, all three slices of it.
&gt; Grumbling to yourself about the general lack of bread in the world you take out some plates and serve up your creation.  
&gt; A filled sandwich for the waiting Nyssa while you stuffed what you could in the folded final slice.
&gt; The plate had barely touched the table before the hungry lizard was on it, snatching up the contents and and shoving it into her mouth with a loud snap.  
&gt; You sit there and watch with a morbid fascination as she quickly works her jaw, shredding the contents with her razor teeth and swallowing it all with a satisfied gulp.
&gt; As you move to pick up your smaller helping you cant help but notice the look on her face.  She has her eyes locked on to your plate, the hungry look from before was still there.  She sat completely still with her mouth slightly open.
&gt; She was obviously still ravenously hungry, should she try and snatch it you doubted there was anything you could do to stop it.
&gt; Yet... She made no move.
&gt; Thinking back to her story you realise she hasn&#039;t had anything approaching a full meal in quite some time, bar your small offering. 
&gt; Putting your own hunger to the side for now you push your plate towards Nyssa.
&gt; &quot;Here, you have it.&quot;
&gt; She looks up from the sandwich up at you in shock.
&gt; &quot;B-b-but is yours!&quot; she exclaims.  Not really understanding.
&gt; &quot;I&#039;m  giving it to you, I think you need it more than I do right now.&quot;
&gt; Not needing much in the way of prompting she swallows it down as quickly as the first.
&gt; When she&#039;s done she looks over at you again, are those tears in her eyes?
&gt; &quot;Th-th-thank you A-Anon...&quot; she stutters.
&gt; &quot;It was only a..&quot;
&gt; The table flew up in the air and clattered to the side.  
&gt; Before you could work out what had happened she had pounced from her blanket and on to your lap.
&gt; Yet again you were pinned in place by a hugging lizard.
&gt; She had her arms wrapped around you, your own trapped at your sides.  Her legs straddled your hips and her tail dangled down between your legs.
&gt; She tucked her head in against your neck, any illusions you may have once had about personal space were very much shattered.
&gt; She was still sniffling, her whole body jumping slightly with each one.
&gt; Between her closeness and the movements she was making... You couldn&#039;t help but feel a stirring &#039;downstairs&#039;.
&gt; Oh hell no.
&gt; This wasn&#039;t happening.
&gt; Reality had already gone spinning well out of your control.  
&gt; What would happen if you suddenly started poking her &#039;down there&#039; with her sitting on you like this?
&gt; Images of the suddenly very angry Nyssa chowing down on your manhood like she did the food just a minute ago...
&gt; With an effort worthy of the most devout Tibetan monks you willed your boner to subside.  Conjuring every image you could think of to try scare it away, politicians faces, that creepy clown from that new movie remake, your former best friend&#039;s smug face...
&gt; With the beast temporarily back in its cage you get to work removing Nyssa from your lap, time was of the essence.
&gt; &quot;Uhh Nyssa?  It was only a sandwich.  Can you let me up please?&quot;
&gt; Thankfully she seemed to come out of her hug fueled trance and climbed off of you.  
&gt; Crisis averted.
&gt; She stood there looking at you, she had brought the tip of her tail into her hands and was fidgeting with it.
&gt; &quot; I&#039;m sorry Anon.&quot; she sniffled again.  &quot;You gave me your last food, tasty food.  Not even sisters shared food from masters.&quot;
&gt; You had somehow unwittingly made some sort of grand meaningful gesture to her with half a beef sandwich.
&gt; &quot;Its ok Nyssa, don&#039;t worry about it, really.&quot;
&gt; She gave a little nod and a smile, but her eyes never left yours.
&gt; Oh boy, what have you got yourself into now?

---------------------------
Chapter 4

&gt; Time was moving on, despite learning a great deal today you were aware that there were some things you were going to have to deal with.
&gt; There was now no food left in the house, you hadn&#039;t eaten since yesterday, there was a naked lizard girl in your kitchen giving you funny looks and you were no closer to working out what to do about all this.
&gt; Ok, keep calm and mental checklist it.
&gt; First things first, deal with Nyssa.  
&gt; It would perhaps make things easier if you could get her to wear some clothes...
&gt; Next, work out how to get more food.  
&gt; Ordering takeout or groceries online were both options but would involve someone coming to the front door.  Considering Nyssa&#039;s reaction before that wasn&#039;t a good idea.
&gt; You decide to tackle one thing at a time.  Having her walk around in nothing but her colorful scales or occasionally springing out of the blanket to hug you for warmth was getting... distracting.  
&gt; Taking her back upstairs to your room you have a rummage through your clothes.  
&gt; The best you can do for now is a pair of baggy sweatpants and an old hoodie.  Not a perfect fit but it should be enough to keep her warm for the time being.
&gt; At first she doesn&#039;t seem to get what your trying to do.  She hadn&#039;t worn any clothes of her own back at wherever she had come from, the idea was as alien to her as walking around town butt naked was to you.
&gt; After a bit of convincing you manage to pull the hoodie up over her head and get her arms into the sleeves.  She seems a bit unsure but she trusts your promise it will keep her warm.
&gt; The sweatpants are a different matter.  Her legs are not the same shape as yours, not to mention the tail.
&gt; With a bit of work you manage to get both her big clawed feet in the right holes, you tried to do this with her sitting on the end of the bed, she insisted however on standing.
&gt; In theory this should have made it easier to fit the pants, except for the fact that reaching down around her ankles put your head at crotch level.  
&gt; Mental images of your boner getting munched kept your eyes from getting too adventurous however.
&gt; Her tail was causing a bigger problem than you anticipated.  The plan had been to rip a hole in the back for it to poke through.  Once they were on her though the tail put too much pressure on top and the waste band began to unravel.
&gt; Forced to think on your feet you ended up tying the broken waist into a little knot just above her tail, creating an anchor of sorts to stop it all falling down.  
&gt; This had resulted with you again spending alot of time essentially fiddling about around her ass.  Not that she seemed to mind though.

&gt; With the clothing issue solved you next had to sort out supplies.  
&gt; You had been thinking about this while working on dressing her (as a way of trying to distract yourself more than anything else) and the only plan you could think of was to make a run down to the store.
&gt; This would mean leaving Nyssa here alone but it would be necessary as taking her shopping simply wasn&#039;t an option.
&gt; When you explained this to her she didn&#039;t like it, not one bit.
&gt; &quot;Nope.  You stay here with me. No go out.&quot;
&gt; &quot;Sorry Nyssa but we need some supplies.  There&#039;s no more food here, there&#039;s no heating and I cant take you with me.&quot;  
&gt; You did have a mini heater here which would have tided you over until the heating got fixed but it was one of the items broken during the search yesterday.  
&gt; &quot;But...&quot;  she started, but you were adamant.
&gt; &quot;No, I&#039;m sorry but you have to stay here.  Its not safe out there right now and it shouldn&#039;t be so cold in here as long as you stay upstairs with the blanket.&quot;
&gt; Eventually she gave in and retreated upstairs.  You felt kinda guilty but nothing about this was right and you had to try limit the risks.

&gt; Before heading out you made a few preparations.  
&gt; To protect Nyssa from any curious passers-by you made sure all the downstairs blinds were closed.  You also gathered up a few of the larger broken items from yesterday and took them out to the car.  Might as well get rid while you were out.
&gt; Nyssa was pouting.  You had no idea that reptiles could pout or that their scaled faces could do it so expressively but every minute with her was a learning experience.
&gt; She sat at the top of the stairs first, watching you in silence while you gathered the clutter.  When you were about done though she had disappeared.
&gt; You had moved the fridge away from the backdoor so you could slip out the back way.  No point giving the chuckle brothers out front a show.
&gt; The car was parked in a small attached garage, it could only be accessed through the main door at the front or a small one at the rear which lead into the garden.
&gt; You left the boot open while you packed in the junk, only closing it when you were done.  Going back inside you lock everything back up and go say a goodbye to Nyssa.
&gt; When you got upstairs there was not immediately any sign of her.  A quick search found your blanket bundled up on the bed, she must be sulking under the covers.
&gt; &quot;Ok I&#039;m heading out, I&#039;ll be quick as I can, promise.&quot;
&gt; There was no response.
&gt; &quot;Just stay up here and don&#039;t make any loud noises ok?&quot;
&gt; The blankets didn&#039;t so much as twitch.
&gt; She must be mad.
&gt; Sighing you make your way down and leave through the front door.
&gt; Heading back  to the garage you get in your car and get on your way.
&gt; As you pull out and turn the corner your flagged down by a familiar figure.  Wearing a black suit this time like his partner its Monotone.  
&gt; He&#039;s standing out in the road waving at you so there&#039;s no chance of just passing him by, unless you go all death race on him maybe. (how many points would he be worth I wonder...)
&gt; Stopping like the perfectly well behaved motorist you are, you roll down the window to see what he wants.
&gt; &quot;Good afternoon Mr Anon, would you mind stepping out of the vehicle for a moment?&quot;
&gt; Aw nuts.
&gt; &quot;Good afternoon Mr...&quot; (he still hasn&#039;t told you his name) You wait for him to answer but he just stands there staring at you expectantly.
&gt; He wasn&#039;t going to move until you get out it seems.
&gt; Cutting the ignition you step out and wait.
&gt; &quot;Thank you Mr Anon.  There is something important I need to ask you.&quot;
&gt; &quot;Ok...  What do you need now?&quot;
&gt; He reacts to you annoyed tone by ignoring it, becoming that much more grating in the process.
&gt; &quot;My associate came to check up on you this morning, he told me that you were having some problems of a... delicate nature?&quot;
&gt; This again?  Was he going to give you some advice on how to take a shit now too?
&gt; &quot;My associate is sometimes not the most... perceptive person.  It occurred to me that you may have been trying to tell him something quite different.  Something that you couldn&#039;t say to him openly.  Am I correct?&quot;
&gt; Shit.  Looks like Monotone isn&#039;t quite as stupid as his partner.
&gt; &quot;No not really.&quot;  (Think Anon think!)
&gt; &quot;I uhh was just a little tired that&#039;s all!  I was up late cleaning up the mess you guys made and I wasn&#039;t really in the mood for a chat.&quot;
&gt; Smooth Anon.
&gt; He stood at you and stared for a moment, weighing up what you had come out with.
&gt; &quot;I see.  Very well, I wont keep you.&quot;
&gt; Phew, close one.
&gt; As you move to get back in your car he suddenly stops you, grabbing your shoulder, hard, and pulling you close.
&gt; &quot;We are here to help Mr Anon.&quot;
&gt; His voice had taken on a menacing tone.
&gt; This somehow didn&#039;t fill you with confidence.
&gt; &quot;If we find out however, that you haven&#039;t been straight with us...&quot;
&gt; Looks like threat time again.
&gt; &quot;Listen, I got the message yesterday loud and clear ok?  Don&#039;t get in your way.  Got it.&quot;
&gt; You hoped this would be enough to satisfy him.  Sadly it wasn&#039;t.
&gt; &quot;Please let me finish, Mr Anon.&quot; He got even closer to you for the next part.
&gt; &quot;If we find that you have been lying, or actively disrupting our search in any way...&quot;
&gt; He cracked a smile, unlike Sunglasses&#039; however, this one chilled you to your core.
&gt; &quot;There wont even be a corner of hell dark enough to hide you from what we&#039;ll do.&quot;
&gt; Letting you go, he then stepped away from the road and started walking back towards his van.
&gt; Over his shoulder he called out a casual &quot;Enjoy the rest of your day Sir!&quot; and that was that.
&gt; Quickly retreating to the safety of your car, you continue your journey.
&gt; It took a good bit of time before you let out that breath you&#039;d been holding.
&gt; Again the feeling that you were way out of your depth took you.  Was it too late to maybe just make a break for the boarder?  
&gt; The thought of Nyssa waiting patiently at home for you shut down that idea, far more quickly than you realised too.
&gt; As you tried to focus on the road ahead you became aware of something behind you.  A slight brushing of air on the back of your neck...
&gt; Slowly turning around, you are confronted with a large scaly face.  A big toothy smile on display.  
&gt; &quot;Hi Anon!&quot;
&gt; Clever girl.
&gt; &quot;Oh shit!!!&quot;
&gt; In your surprise you damn near lose control of the car, swerving across lanes as you fight with the wheel.
&gt; A few desperate seconds and you manage to pull over to the side of the road.
&gt; Turning around in your seat you get a better look at what is happening behind you.
&gt; Nyssa has somehow got herself wedged through the middle of the back seat.  Her front half sticking out where the folding armrest pulls down.
&gt; It looks like she must have been hiding in the trunk, tried to crawl out through to the back seat and got her sizeable hips stuck.
&gt; &quot;Nyssa!  What are you doing here!?!&quot; you yell.
&gt; &quot;Why aren&#039;t you back home like said?  Do you have any idea how dangerous this is?  What if someone saw you?  Like those guys in black?&quot;
&gt; Nyssa simply sat there best she could, stuck as she was, and looked at you with an almost puppy dog expression.
&gt; &quot;Didn&#039;t want to be alone again.  Maybe Anon not come back!  What if masters came when Anon gone!&quot;
&gt; To that you didn&#039;t really have an answer.  Still... it was pretty risky having her out and about with you.&quot;
&gt; Going back wasn&#039;t an option at this point.
&gt; &quot;Ok just hang on a minute.&quot;
&gt; Regardless of which direction you decided to go next you couldn&#039;t do it with Nyssa wedged in the back like that.  If you got pulled over you would have a hard time talking your way out of something like this...
&gt; Luckily there was not much traffic on this particular stretch of road, your scare with Nyssa just now would have ended very differently otherwise.  It also meant you could get out and try to free your wriggling stowaway without an audience.
&gt; First you tried going in through the rear passenger door to see if you could pull her through or shift the seat itself.  Your only reward was a couple of hisses and an annoyed snap of her jaws, she was stuck fast.
&gt; Deciding that tackling the problem from the back might be the better (and safer) option you close door and head to the trunk.
&gt; Great.  The scratches around the latch told the story of how she had fiddled with it before gaining access, her claws leaving large gouges in your paintwork.  It would take more than a quick buff to get those out.
&gt; Your own annoyance died a death once you had the trunk open however.  The sight of Nyssa&#039;s trapped rump sticking up into the air, although expected, caught you off guard.
&gt; Her large tail swished from side to side as she continued to struggle, her butt wiggling in time.
&gt; A long moment passed before Nyssa&#039;s voice snapped you back to attention.
&gt; &quot;A Anon..? You still there?&quot;
&gt; You had been staring, caught in the hypnotic swaying of her...
&gt; Nope nope nope!  Mind on the job at hand Anon!
&gt; With a shake of your head you try and work out the best way to get her free.  Good thing there was a shortage of hot water back home, you were going to need a cold shower or two when you got back.
&gt; She had pulled herself most of the way through so pulling her back this way wasn&#039;t going to work, and would most likely end with large rips in your upholstery.
&gt; There was only one thing for it.  You were going to have to push.
&gt; &quot;Nyssa?&quot; you call out cautiously.  
&gt; &quot;If we&#039;re going to get you out of there I&#039;m gonna have to push.  I haven&#039;t got much to work with back here so... prepare yourself okay?&quot;
&gt; Ok here goes.
&gt; &quot;When I push you try twist yourself to the left a bit, that should get you out.&quot;
&gt; &quot;O-o-okay Anon.&quot; she calls through.
&gt; &quot;I trust you.&quot;
&gt; With the position she was in there was only one place for your hands to go.  Her Ass.
&gt; Offering a prayer up to whatever gods might be responsible for boner control you grab a cheek in each hand and start to push.
&gt; A loud &quot;Eeeek!&quot; comes from the backseat and Nyssa&#039;s tail suddenly slaps you across the face.
&gt; &quot;Ouch!  Damn Nyssa watch it!&quot; you shout, stopping to rub your stinging face.
&gt; &quot;Sorry Anon!&quot;
&gt; Ok lets try this again.
&gt; Once more taking hold you get to work. 
&gt; You couldn&#039;t help but consider the feeling under your hands.  She was thankfully still wearing the pants you had given her but you could feel the smooth scales underneath.  This wasn&#039;t the first time you had had your hands wrapped around a girl&#039;s ass, last time had been a bit less... awkward though.
&gt; Unlike a human&#039;s rear, Nyssa&#039;s didn&#039;t have the softness you would expect to find there.  It was firm but still gave to your touch as you pushed.
&gt; Twisting to the side you managed to get some movement.  With your combined effort she finally popped through the gap and into the backseat.
&gt; With a sigh of relief you grab the old car blanket from the trunk and close up.  
&gt; Getting back to the drivers seat was a bit difficult, despite your prayers you were sporting a good half mast in your pants and walking was a bit painful.
&gt; Getting in you toss the blanket over into the back seat.
&gt; &quot;Ok Nyssa, we still have to go to the store so I need you to stay low and hide under this, can you do that?&quot;
&gt; She wrapped herself up but didn&#039;t drop immediately down.  Instead she gave you a strange look.
&gt; &quot;Ok Anon... I&#039;ll be good.&quot;
&gt; ...Not sure how to take that...

--------------------------

&gt; The rest of the ride to the store was thankfully uneventful, apart from Nyssa curiously reaching forward and nearly pulling at the hand break once or twice that is.
&gt; Your destination was the wall mart, it had become a little run down after driving the other local businesses out but it should have what you need.
&gt; You pull into a parking space at the edge of the lot, it meant a longer walk to the store and back but less chance of anyone noticing your passenger.
&gt; Before heading off you turn around and look at Nyssa.  She had curled up on the back seat under the old blanket and was flipping through a magazine of some sort.
&gt; Your speech about staying hidden finds itself on hold as you wonder what she&#039;s got and where it came from.
&gt; She&#039;s happily flipping through the pages, stopping from time to time and examining it closer.  She doesn&#039;t even realize the car has stopped as she&#039;s that enthralled.
&gt; &quot;What you got there Nyssa?&quot; you ask curiously. 
&gt; Looking up at you and flashing you a toothy grin, she hands over the magazine.  
&gt; Its one of those holliday brochures you get sometimes stuffed inside newspapers, one must have fallen out at some time or other and she&#039;s found it under the seat.
&gt; She had been looking at a section focusing on somewhere near the coast (it wasn&#039;t a very high class brochure).
&gt; The pictures show a happy couple walking hand in hand across a small beach.  The sun is shining and they are wearing nothing but swim suits and sandals.  
&gt; The next page has them sitting in deckchairs on a private balcony, a drink in their hands and not a care in the world.
&gt; As you hand it back she sits up under her blanket and gives you a curious look.
&gt; &quot;Where that place Anon?&quot;
&gt; &quot;Its a beach Nyssa, its over on the west coast I think.&quot;
&gt; She ponders this for a second, takes another long look and then peeps through the window, as if hoping to spot something outside from the picture.
&gt; You could do nothing but sit there, marveling at her innocence.  From what you had gathered she had been grown in a lab to be a killing machine, yet here she was, in the back of your car, looking through the windows at a grubby wall mart car park for signs of a beach from the brochure.
&gt; You smile, and try to convince her to get back down in case anyone sees.
&gt; &quot;The beach is a very long way away, you cant see it from here.&quot;
&gt; She drops down again under the blanket with a disappointed look on her face.  After another mournful glance at the pictures on the page she quickly looks back up to you, a hopeful look adorning her features.
&gt; &quot;Anon!  We go to beach after get food?&quot; she asks quickly.  Lifting up the brochure again and pointing at the first page, she starts bouncing.
&gt; &quot;We go there yes?  No masters there!  Just me and... and Anon!&quot;
&gt; It was at this point you reached the lowest point in your life so far, you chose to lie to this innocent creature.  
&gt; &quot;Ok ok calm down, the car&#039;s starting to shake!&quot; you yell in an effort to calm the excited lizard.
&gt; Tell you what, we cant go right now but I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll be able to go when things quiet down.  I&#039;ll take you myself ok?  Now just calm down!&quot;
&gt; In response she let out a little squee noise and tried to pounce on you again.  Luckily the blanket and car seat joined forces and kept her from launching you through the windscreen with her attempted power hug.
&gt; &quot;Ohhh thank you thank you Anon!! she cried.  The bouncing hadn&#039;t stopped as you had hoped.
&gt; &quot;Ok that&#039;s enough!&quot; you laughed.  
&gt; &quot;I&#039;ve still got to go get the food so you have to be quiet and stay here under the blanket.  Do you understand?&quot;
&gt; With that she dropped back down once more and nodded her head, trying and failing to supress her adorable smile.
&gt; You were going to hell.

------------------------------

&gt; Walking through the store, pushing a cart, you think about the lie you told.
&gt; &quot;I&#039;ll take you myself!&quot;
&gt; Why had you said it?  You knew it was pretty much impossible.  
&gt; If the people looking for her were who you thought then getting out of the county would be a nightmare, let alone the state, before they caught you.  The only reason you were able to go shopping was because they were probably using you as bait to lure their target back.
&gt; Then again, was it really that cruel to give the bouncing lizard a bit of false hope?  To let her have a dream of her own for a while?
&gt; You had been thinking almost non stop about what you were going to do next, getting food was a short term problem, it was tomorrow, and the days after that were important.
&gt; Wracking your brains had not revealed an answer.  The authorities wouldn&#039;t be able to help, they may even answer to the guys outside your house.  As for calling the press or scientist types?  You didn&#039;t know any trustworthy ones, or have a clue where to find them even.
&gt; The cold hard truth was that Nyssa&#039;s days were numbered.  You couldn&#039;t protect her or that smile for long.
&gt; At best, even if you did find a way to reveal her to the public and shield her with some limelight, she would end up in a zoo or another research lab.  She didn&#039;t deserve that.
&gt; At worst those fucks in black would put her in a body bag, or take her back to where she came from and &#039;punish&#039; her for the escape.
&gt; You needed a miracle.  For now though the best you could do was throw another pack of jerky in the cart and keep moving.
&gt; Trying to put your bleak thoughts out of mind for now, you head for the meat counter.  A little stop at the cooked section too was in order.
----------------------------------

&gt; Arriving back at the car you are relieved to see it all as you left it.  No broken windows, angry rampaging lizards or bloody corpses littering the area.
&gt; A quick look in through the window tells you she&#039;s still under the blanket.
&gt; You can tell she&#039;s actually there this time (not like the fake bundle she made on your bed earlier) as you can see the tip of her tail sticking out.
&gt; You remember the last thing you had said before heading for the store.
&gt; &quot;Promise me you wont try following me this time ok?  There&#039;s more people out there that could see you, you wont be able to sneak past them.  So please, promise you wont go anywhere.&quot;
&gt; She had looked you straight in the eye, and said simply - &quot;I promise Anon.  I wont go anywhere and leave you.  Promise.&quot;
&gt; The more you thought about it the more you got a sense she was speaking about more than just leaving the car...
&gt; Shaking off your reverie you open up the trunk to deposit your shopping. You had ended up buying more than you had intended, but you regretted nothing.
&gt; Nyssa poked her head over the backseat with a beaming smile.
&gt; &quot;Hi Anon!  You got food?&quot;
&gt; &quot;Yup, I got what we need.  Just need to load up and we can go back home.&quot;
&gt; Something had been bothering you since the whole butt stuck in seat incident and it finally dawned on you what it was.
&gt; &quot;Hey Nyssa?  What happened to all the stuff I put in the trunk before I left?&quot;
&gt; She cocked her head, &quot;Was no room for hiding, so made room.&quot;
&gt; A mental image of all the junk you had carefully packed into the trunk sitting on the garage floor where she had tossed it came to you.
&gt; &quot;Ok never mind...&quot;
&gt; Packing all but one of the bags you get back into the drivers seat and shut the door.  Nyssa&#039;s nostrils start to flare almost immediately as the bag&#039;s contents catch her attention.
&gt; &quot;I figured that you were probably still hungry so rather than wait til we got home I thought you may want something now.&quot;
&gt; From the bag you pull a plastic pouch containing a whole cooked chicken.  One you had scored from the cooked section, still warm from the store ovens.
&gt; Nyssa&#039;s eyes go wide and her jaw drops open as she inspects the heavenly smelling bounty before her.
&gt; As she moves to grab the bag you suddenly pull it back out of reach, eliciting a hiss.
&gt; &quot;Now don&#039;t be like that.&quot; you chide.
&gt; &quot;Before you eat it, there&#039;s lots of small bones in this so don&#039;t just wolf it all down, take your time and spit any hard bits out into the bag ok?&quot;
&gt; Her response was a blur of motion and the realisation that you were holding nothing in your hand now but a small piece of torn plastic.  She on the other hand was going in the bag snout first, taking deep sniffs in and savouring the smell.
&gt; Deciding to leave her to it you retrieve your own food, a cooked chicken burger.  It wasn&#039;t really a meal but it would keep you going for now.

&gt; The journey home was... interesting.
&gt; While you had finished yours quickly and got on with the task of driving, Nyssa had taken your advice and was slowly savouring the chicken.
&gt; She took it apart piece by piece using her long claws, tearing of a strip and dropping it into her mouth.
&gt; It was when she got to the legs that you found your eyes spending more time on the rearview mirror than the road.
&gt; She nibbled at the drumsticks with her large teeth at first, carefully stripping the bulk of the skin and meat from the bone with ease.  When she could not get at the last few morsels however she changed tactics, lifting the bone up into her mouth she dipped it in and started working on it with her tongue. 
&gt; For some reason you had expected her to have a snake like one based on the hissing, what she had was a rather long and thick affair.  
&gt; It wrapped around the bone with ease, and when she pulled it deeper, closing her lips around her fingers as she did, began making lewd sucking noises.
&gt; You sat there, trying desperately to concentrate on the road, transfixed on the show behind you.
&gt; Goddamnit Anon eyes front! Eyes front!  She&#039;s just really enjoying that chicken...
&gt; As your mind warred with itself trying to make sense of your emotions, Nyssa&#039;s eye caught yours in the mirror, and held it.

&gt; The rest of the journey was spent in relative silence, only broken by the occasional sounds of happy chomping and slurping from the back.
&gt; You keep your eyes firmly on the road.

--------------------------------------
Chapter 5

&gt; It was already evening when you finally make it back home.  
&gt; Pulling up to the house you notice two things: first is that there&#039;s no sign of the chuckle brothers, you hadn&#039;t passed their van anywhere on the way back and it wasn&#039;t here either.
&gt; The second thing was how quiet everything was.  
&gt; The light was on its way out but there were no lights on in any of your neighbours houses, there were no cars parked outside any of them either.
&gt; That was odd.  It was a Saturday evening and everyone was out at the same time at a party or something?
&gt; Come to think of it, they had done that before, the bastards.  One of the pitfalls of being an outsider in a neighborhood where everyone is in some way related to everyone else.
&gt; Getting out the car you move over to the garage and open the door.  There at the back of course is the crap Nyssa pulled out of the car.
&gt; It will have to wait.
&gt; You jump back in the car and reverse in, making sure to close the door back up to make it safe for Nyssa to show herself.
&gt; Nyssa waited in the garage while you went in through the front of the house, you&#039;d have to unblock the backdoor from inside before she could enter.  You couldn&#039;t risk her being seen out the front.
&gt; Once inside you hit the lights and head for the kitchen, a bit of effort opens the way.
&gt; A moment later Nyssa joins you in the kitchen, still covered up by the car blanket.
&gt; You notice that she hasn&#039;t come empty handed, she is clutching most... no, all the shopping bags to her as well.
&gt; &quot;Hey I was coming back for those, you didn&#039;t need to carry them...&quot;
&gt; Nyssa smiles sweetly at you.  
&gt; &quot;Is ok Anon, want to help!&quot;
&gt; She had carried in all the bags with ease, impressive considering how heavy you knew they were.
&gt; You wondered how she had managed to get the bags out the car, visions of more scratches in the paintwork around the car door convinced you not to think too hard about it.
&gt; A final dash back to the garage to lock up and you were done.  The air outside felt.. wrong however, tense, like it was waiting for something.
&gt; Getting back inside you lock the door and blocked it with the fridge.  The lizard it had originally been put there to keep out had already made herself at home, but you still felt safer doing it.
&gt; For the next hour, Nyssa helped you pack away all the shopping, stopping every now and again for her to inspect some of the goodies and for you to explain what they were.
&gt; She showed particular interest in what you had bought from the meat section.  
&gt; You had chosen some cuts of beef to make steak, gammon, some uncooked chicken and more.  
&gt; As tempted as you were to start cooking some up now to see her reactions to the different tastes and smells she told you she wasn&#039;t hungry.  
&gt; The whole chicken in the car had hit the spot for now.  
&gt; You made a mental note to cook her something nice for breakfast instead.

&gt; With all the food sorted you moved on to the next item, a small mini heater.  You had spotted it in the store and bought it to replace the broken one.
&gt; With this you should be able to make things more comfortable for Nyssa.
&gt; When you tried to explain this to her though she didn&#039;t seem convinced.
&gt; &quot;This will make things a bit warmer around here.&quot; you began.
&gt; Nyssa wasn&#039;t buying it though.
&gt; She poked it with one of her long claws, giving a little grunt of disapproval to the metal clanging noise it produced.
&gt; &quot;That not warm, is cold.&quot;
&gt; &quot;It is now but give it a chance and you&#039;ll see.&quot; you reassured her.

&gt; By this point it was starting to get late, the interrupted sleep from last night and the stresses from today had left you more warn out than you should be.  Nyssa was looking tired too, she gave a big toothy yawn.
&gt; The size of her fully open maw left you a little unsettled, you could probably fit your entire head in there...
&gt; The prospect of bedtime left you a little worried too.  
&gt; After the shenanigans last night you wanted to try and regain control of your sleeping space.  
&gt; You were sure she had every intention of jumping back into your bed and hugging you into oblivion again but your fragile male ego dictated that you reassert yourself.
&gt; The problem with this was that your house was low on furniture right now.
&gt; With renovations still under way you had been surviving here by yourself on bare minimum.  You didn&#039;t so much as have a sofa to crash on, let alone another bed.
&gt; With Nyssa having trouble regulating her body temperature and it getting colder outside, she couldn&#039;t sleep on the cold uncarpeted floors.
&gt; If she took the bed where did that leave you?  With the mini heater on you should be ok on the floor you guess, it will just mean you have to sleep in the same room.

&gt; Upstairs, with bathroom needs attended to, you got ready for bed.
&gt; You had done your best to explain your decision about the sleeping arrangements to Nyssa but she still didn&#039;t seem to get it.
&gt; While she jumped into bed quite merrily, you spread some spare sheets on the cold floor and tried to find a comfortable spot.
&gt; The mini heater had been set up over the other side of the bed to give Nyssa the maximum benefit, hopefully she was because from where you were sitting it may as well not be on at all.

&gt; Nyssa&#039;s head popped over the side of the bed and looked down at you.
&gt; &quot;Anon?  What doing down there?  Is cold!&quot;
&gt; &quot;I told you, I&#039;m going to sleep down here for tonight.  You can have the bed all to yourself.&quot;
&gt; She still didn&#039;t get it.
&gt; &quot;But Anon...  It cold down there by self.  It cold up here with only me.  You sleep here, Ok?&quot;
&gt; Further arguments were cut short as she made a tutting sound in her throat and made a grab for you.
&gt; Again you were caught off guard by Nyssa&#039;s strength, from her position on the bed she grabbed hold and lifted you up next to her.
&gt; Things had gone like this last night, she had overpowered and subjected you to a long night of forced cuddling.
&gt; It was not happening again.
&gt; As she reached out, preparing to ensnare you in her arms, you state &quot;no&quot; in a loud and stern voice.
&gt; She stops in her tracks, the smile on her face replaced with a frown of surprise.
&gt; You glare at her, a sudden anger brewing in your chest, rising from a place you didn&#039;t quite understand.
&gt; &quot;Anon?  What wrong?&quot; she asks, sounding unsure.
&gt; &quot;Is cold here, you and me together will stay warm, like last time yes?&quot;
&gt; &quot;No Nyssa, not like last time.&quot;  There&#039;s an edge in your voice now.
&gt; &quot;Last night only happened because you didn&#039;t give me a choice in the matter.  You just jumped on in here and trapped me until morning!  Its not happening again.&quot;
&gt; The unbidden anger started to leave as suddenly as it had arrived.  The look on Nyssa&#039;s scaly face told you that you had been too harsh.
&gt; She shuffled backwards along the bed and dropped her gaze from yours, just about managing a little &quot;oh.&quot;
&gt; After a few minutes of uncomfortable silence she spoke again.
&gt; &quot;I wont make you stay Anon.  Will leave now.&quot;
&gt; In these short minutes her whole demeanor had changed.  Instead of the smiling excitable lizard ready to power hug you to a sullen, withdrawn one on the verge of tears.
&gt; You felt like an asshole.  You were one.
&gt; Her little heart had broken in front of you and now she was going to leave.
&gt; Despite the still present knot of... whatever the hell it was, in your chest, you couldn&#039;t just send her away either.
&gt; The rest of the house was freezing cold and if she tried going outside...
&gt; You decide to compromise.
&gt; &quot;Listen... Nyssa...&quot; you begin.
&gt; &quot;You don&#039;t have to go, its going to be icy out there now, and its dark.&quot;
&gt; She gives a little sniffle.
&gt; &quot;I&#039;ll stay here in the bed tonight ok?  All I ask though is that you stay on that side of the bed ok?&quot;
&gt; A brief explanation was required at this point on what defined &#039;my side&#039; and what was &#039;her side&#039; but she understood quickly.
&gt; With the light off you settle down to get some sleep.  Nyssa has retreated under the covers and has her back to you.
&gt; Looks like you found a way to top the cruel stakes after lying to her before.  Asshole.

--------------------------------------

&gt; You lay in the darkness.  Sleep doesn&#039;t come.
&gt; Your outburst towards Nyssa earlier still playing on your mind.  Turning it around in your head, you cant quite understand why you had been so angry.
&gt; Yes she had essentially cuddle raped you the night before... But despite everything, and after spending the day talking to her, she was actually kinda... sweet... for a giant lizard with razor claws.
&gt; As your mind wanders you begin to take stock of your life, replaying in your mind, for the hundredth time, how you ended up here, alone in a crap old house, alienated from everyone you knew.

&gt; Five short years ago you had been living the dream.  Nice big apartment, in a committed relationship with the woman of your dreams.  A good job, friends the works.
&gt; You had been together since high school.  A lifetime of plans and memories to make together.  You had actually been building up to popping the big question.
&gt; It all fell apart so suddenly that you didn&#039;t quite believe it at first.  You had sat down with your best friend to talk over your plans and show him the ring you had bought your beau.  Tomorrow night you were gonna do it and you wanted his advice.
&gt; Instead of being supportive however, he actually tried talking you out of it.  When he didn&#039;t come around things actually got heated and he walked out.
&gt; The next day, the love of your life left.
&gt; There was no explanation other than &quot;This isn&#039;t working Anon, we&#039;ve just grown apart...&quot;
&gt; Which was goddamned news to you.
&gt; After a couple of weeks of unreturned phone calls and texts, the news hit.
&gt; It was through social media you got it.  When she left her status had changed to &#039;single&#039;.  Then one day it changed again, and she posted a nice picture of her and your best friend.  They were an item.
&gt; Neither bothered responding when you called.  Your so called friends later revealed that she had been seeing him behind your back, for months.  
&gt; They had all known but none had the balls to tell you.
&gt; It only got worse from there.
&gt; A few weeks later they moved in together.  A short time after that they were engaged.  It was when they started telling everyone that she was pregnant that you finally just... broke.
&gt; All the dreams and plans you had together, she was living them out with someone else.  Your best friend.
&gt; You left town shortly after.  Cutting ties with everyone you knew and just heading out to anywhere that wasn&#039;t here.
&gt; In time you used your savings to buy a small property and fix it up, selling it later for a profit.  
&gt; You did this a couple more times before landing this old place.  Working any random job in that particular town to pay the bills, while spending your evenings and weekends working on the house.
&gt; You had almost managed to lose yourself.  To accept the broken loneliness as normal and simply... exist.
&gt; Then Nyssa had climbed into your bed.
&gt; The realisation was slow coming, but it came all the same.
&gt; When you woke up this morning, you hadn&#039;t been that comfortable in such a long time, not since...
&gt; Not since those lazy mornings in bed with your beloved.  Spent simply dozing in each other&#039;s arms.  Content with only one another, the world could go fuck itself in those moments.
&gt; Nyssa had brought that feeling back, just for an instant.  
&gt; The anger made a bit more sense.
&gt; You had spent so long running from what had happened, the future you had lost, when even a sliver of the happiness you once felt came back... you had reacted.
&gt; Looking over to your left, you couldn&#039;t see any sign of Nyssa.  She was completely hidden under the covers.
&gt; Into the darkness you whisper &quot;I&#039;m sorry.&quot; before closing your eyes and drifting off to an uneasy sleep.

&gt; The bright numbers on the phone screen next to you said that it had only been about twenty minutes since when you last checked.  
&gt; Something had woken you.
&gt; The cause was easily discovered.  Nyssa.
&gt; After you had drifted off she had scooted closer to you.  She had been careful not to make contact but she was very much on your side of the bed.
&gt; Even without touching you could tell she was cold.  The heater had apparently died.  Piece of cheap crap.
&gt; She still had her back to you.
&gt; Reaching out slowly, you take her into your arms, pulling her close and in towards your chest.
&gt; She wakes with a start.
&gt; &quot;Anon?  What...?&quot;
&gt; &quot;Shhhh Nyssa.  Its cold.  Lets just go to sleep.&quot;
&gt; With a contented little sigh, she curls up in your arms.  
&gt; A feeling of peace spreads through you, one that you had told yourself was gone forever.
&gt; Tomorrow your going to have to leave, you&#039;ll take Nyssa as far away as you can from the people chasing her.  You might even be able to keep your promise... 
&gt; For now however all is well.
&gt; The rest of the world can go fuck itself.

--------------------------
Chapter 6

&gt; Morning comes around again all too soon.  
&gt; You rouse slowly, for the second time in so many days you wake feeling a sense of ease you hadn&#039;t even realised you&#039;d been missing.
&gt; The events of last night drift hazily back into focus.  Feelings of anger, memories of loneliness and despair, the feeling of someone in your arms again, of everything else fading away...
&gt; You realise that there is a noticeable lack of lizard based hugging going on right now, you yearn for that sense of belonging again and reach over to find Nyssa.
&gt; Your hand finds... nothing.
&gt; With a yawn you sit up and try to locate the missing lizard, rubbing the sleep out of your eyes in the process.
&gt; There&#039;s no sign of her.
&gt; Getting worried now you call out for her, &quot;Nyssa you there?&quot;
&gt; Nothing.
&gt; Your a bit more than worried now.  
&gt; She&#039;s been almost attached to you in some way since the moment she got here, even the shopping trip had turned into a strange and oddly funny road trip when she stowed away in the trunk.
&gt; Quickly throwing on some clothes you make for the door.
&gt; At the top of the stairs your struck by a smell of something meaty... and burning.
&gt; You charge downstairs and head for the kitchen.  Your confronted by the sight of a burning pan on top of the old cooker, flames just starting to flicker from the contents.
&gt; There is no sign of Nyssa.
&gt; Grabbing a towel you switch off the gas and gingerly move the pan over to the sink.
&gt; Once the pan is extinguished you call out again.
&gt; &quot;Nyssa?  What&#039;s going on?  Where&#039;d you go?&quot;
&gt; Nothing.
&gt; Looking at the ruins of your good pan you can piece together what seems to have happened.  Nyssa had taken some of the meat from the fridge, gammon by the looks of it, and attempted to... cook it?
&gt; How did she even know to work the gas?
&gt; She must have watched you yesterday cooking the beef and tried to copy you.
&gt; Had she just... tried to cook you breakfast?
&gt; The most pressing questions you had now were simply, where had she gone?
&gt; Had she got worried when the pan caught fire?  Did the pan catch fire because she had gone away somewhere?
&gt; You move out into the hall in order to start your search, but something odd stops you.
&gt; The front door is open.
&gt; Had she left?
&gt; As you move to investigate a sharp &#039;crack&#039; suddenly comes from the living room.
&gt; Throwing open the door you charge in... only to see stars as pain explodes from the back of your head.
&gt; You go down, but you cling to consciousness, somehow.
&gt; As you lay on the ground, head spinning, a dry chuckle floats down from above.
&gt; &quot;Your still awake?  Well done Mr Anon, your just full of surprises aren&#039;t you.&quot;
&gt; Despite the bash to the brain you recognise the voice instantly, its Monotone.
&gt; You manage to turn over onto your back, and get a good look at your attacker.
&gt; Standing over you is Monotone, the creepy smile back on his face.
&gt; &quot;Well Mr Anon, I think you have some explaining to do, don&#039;t you?&quot;

&gt; He has his big ass hand cannon out again, its pointed directly at you.
&gt; You manage to take a look at the rest of the room from where you are, it is still a mess from their last visit, your tools and gear scattered about.  
&gt; A bit behind you stands Sunglasses, he has his back to you.  Unlike Monotone however he has an extra bit of kit to go along with his gun, what looks like an industrial grade cattle prod.
&gt; At his feet you can just make out what looks like... your old hoodie.  Nyssa.  She&#039;s not moving.
&gt; &quot;You sonofa...&quot; you start.
&gt; A swift boot from Monotone cuts off the rest of your sentence.
&gt; Your roughly pulled up into a sitting position against the wall, gun still pointed at your head.
&gt; &quot;Your probably wondering Mr Anon, why we haven&#039;t just killed you yet?&quot;
&gt; Trying to shake the dizziness from your head you just about manage a shrug.
&gt; &quot;I figured it was just my boyish good looks...&quot; 
&gt; This elicits a guffaw from Sunglasses.
&gt; Monotone however is unimpressed.
&gt; &quot;No Mr Anon, that&#039;s not why.  If you think back to our last conversation I clearly told you it would be in your best interests not to impede our search.&quot;
&gt; He kneeled down closer for this bit.
&gt;&quot;So imagine my surprise, that when I come over to check you are all safe and sound I find our quarry, in your house, wearing your clothes, attempting to &#039;cook&#039; of all things.&quot;
&gt; You remain silent.
&gt; Sunglasses chimed in.
&gt; &quot;Yeah, and why it called out YOUR name when we took it down?&quot;
&gt; He sets off his prod to make his point, a large spark of blue light flashed from the end followed by the loud &#039;crack&#039; you had heard earlier.
&gt; You look again at Nyssa, she seems to be unconsciousness.  There are a couple of burn marks on the hoodie from where they must of zapped her.
&gt; Something new takes root inside of you.  Something even your cheating ex hadn&#039;t stirred in you before.  
&gt; Its cold.  
&gt; The closest you can come to describing it, is hate.
&gt; Ignoring the daggers your mentally stabbing him with, Monotone continues.
&gt; &quot;When we created these creatures, we had a very specific purpose in mind.  We spliced in the best parts from the finest sources, in order to make the perfect killing machine.&quot;
&gt; He punctuated the last two words by tapping you on the forehead with his gun.
&gt; &quot;The only thing we couldn&#039;t seem to instill in them, was obedience.  We inspired fear, hate, even terror in some of them, but not one would follow orders without a serious amount of... incentive.&quot;
&gt; Sunglasses set of the prod again into the air.
&gt; &quot;Now what we want to know is this, how exactly, in just two days, did you train this one to follow you around?&quot;
&gt; You look up at him in surprise.  They think you somehow taught Nyssa to be obedient.  
&gt; You remain silent.
&gt; &quot;You are going to answer me to our satisfaction Mr Anon.&quot; Monotone sneers.
&gt; &quot;Your answers will determine if this ends with a bullet to the head, or one to each of your joints.&quot;
&gt; Sunglasses was starting to look excited.
&gt; While they waited for you to ponder your own mortality, you notice that less than a foot away is your hammer.  Its still lying on the floor from when those idiots tipped your tool box all over the place.  
&gt; Either they hadn&#039;t seen it, or they were stupid enough to not see it as a threat.
&gt; All you need is a distraction and it would be in your grasp.
&gt; &quot;Have you decided if your going to help us or not Mr Anon?&quot; asked Monotone.  
&gt; &quot;We&#039;re taking it back to where it belongs either way but your input will help determine if it can be salvaged, or if we&#039;re going to have to start from scratch.&quot;
&gt; Sunglasses was taking this opportunity to smile smugly at you, so he didn&#039;t notice Nyssa&#039;s eye crack open ever so slightly, or that it was shining a solid crimson hue...
&gt; &quot;Times up Mr Anon.  What is it going to be?&quot;
&gt; They both have their attention on you now.
&gt; &quot;Hmm lets see... you muse.  &quot;Do I spill my guts and then get executed, or do I keep quiet and get horribly tortured and then executed...  Tough call.&quot;
&gt; Just as Monotone raised his gun once again to your head, Nyssa let off a groggy &#039;Hhiisssssss&#039;.  Causing Sunglasses to turn around and Monotone to take his attention off you.
&gt; It was all the distraction you needed.
&gt; You grab the hammer and go for Monotone.

&gt; Stop.  Its hammer time.

&gt; You lash out with the claw side first, striking him at his gun hand.
&gt; With a startled cry he drops it, and his trigger finger too you notice.
&gt; The return swing sees the flat end connect with his head.  
&gt; A satisfying crunch is followed by him toppling to the floor.
&gt; Yeah that blond bitch Thor got nothing on you.
&gt; Leaping to your feet you go for gold, lobbing your weapon straight at Sunglasses&#039; head.
&gt; Your jubilation quickly evaporates as it flies clean past his head and smashes out through the living room window.
&gt; Well shit.
&gt; Sunglasses by now has turned and got a bead on you.  At this range there&#039;s little chance he&#039;ll miss.
&gt; As he pulls the trigger however, a clawed hand reaches up and sinks into his hip.
&gt; He screams.  The shot goes wide even as you make a leap to the hallway, and punches a hole through to the kitchen.
&gt; At this point Nyssa has pulled herself up from the ground and is giving Sunglasses a demonstration of what she learnt from the master&#039;s instruction.
&gt; She shows him exactly how to Rip and Tear.
&gt; Her razor sharp teeth sink into his right shoulder, her clawed hands tear through the black suit and into the flesh beneath.
&gt; He screams some more.
&gt; Your desperate evasion had taken you back out into the hall.  Your head was still throbbing from the hit Monotone had given you so getting back up wasn&#039;t all that easy.
&gt; As you struggle to stand Nyssa is busy making short work of Sunglasses.  His face is locked in a rictus of pain as she tears into him, he&#039;s dropped his gun but the prod is still waving around in his other hand.
&gt; Despite the horror show playing out in front of you, your attention is drawn elsewhere.  
&gt; Over the smell of gunpowder and blood there is something else... Gas.
&gt; A quick look over to the hole in the wall made by the hand cannon tells you where its coming from.  The stupidly huge calibre round had punched clean through to the kitchen, and blown a chunk out of the old cooker in there.  Some small miracle had stopped the house from going up but gas was leaking out, fast.
&gt; One small spark and it was bye bye birdie.
&gt; By now Sunglasses had dropped the prod, it lay on the floor, still clutched by his severed hand.
&gt; He had dropped to his knees and fallen silent, but Nyssa still tore into him.
&gt; You stumble towards her, intending to pull her back towards the door.
&gt; As you reach out however her head snaps up and she hisses.
&gt; &quot;Nyssa come on we have to go!  There&#039;s gas!  Its not safe here!&quot;
&gt; Her eyes are wild, her snout covered in gore and pink foam coats the corners of her mouth.
&gt; &quot;Nyssa?&quot; you ask uncertainly.
&gt; She drops what&#039;s left of her victim, even as he hits the floor you notice his sunglasses are somehow still in place.
&gt; She starts moving towards you.  Her head lowering down and her clawed hands extending outwards. 
&gt; It doesn&#039;t look like she&#039;s in a hugging mood anymore...
&gt; You back away from her slowly, whether from the cruel punishment at the hands of her masters or from the taste of their blood dripping from her maw, the Nyssa you knew wasn&#039;t in control right now.
&gt; The angry lizard advancing on you was breathing heavily, the loose fitting clothes you had given her stained red and scorched by the prod.
&gt; She was acting on instinct, ready to take out any and all threats, including you.
&gt; Your back hits the wall, somehow you had got turned around and Nyssa was between you and the door.
&gt; &quot;Ok its me its Anon calm down...&quot;
&gt; Your words have no effect.
&gt; She is in striking distance now.  One swipe of her claws or snap of her jaws and you would be looking just as pretty as your friend on the floor.
&gt; She stops in front of you, her jaws are open, pieces of Sunglasses caught in her teeth.  You literally stare into the jaws of death.
&gt; As all is lost you come up with one last desperate plan.  All or nothing.
&gt; She moves to strike, while you move directly into her grip... 
&gt; Her claws sink into your back, as you wrap your own arms around her and hold on for dear life.
&gt; She freezes.  Pain blossoms from where she has you, but she doesn&#039;t stab any deeper.
&gt; &quot;Its... ok... Nyssa...&quot; you manage to say through gritted teeth.  &quot;Its me... Anon... remember?&quot;
&gt; You hold her there, in the most painful, but also most sincere hug of your life.
&gt; Tense moments pass as the house slowly fills with gas, neither of you moving.
&gt; Eventually you feel the claws retract, the pain worsens for a second as they leave your flesh, you don&#039;t let her go.
&gt; Her own arms tighten around you, turning the one sided hug into a mutual embrace.
&gt; &quot;An..on..?  she whispers, her voice cracking.  
&gt; &quot;It&#039;s ok, we&#039;re ok.  Everything&#039;s going to be alright.&quot;
&gt; There&#039;s no time to enjoy the thought of your continued survival however, the smell of gas is getting worse.
&gt; &quot;Nyssa, come with me.  Lets get away from here.&quot;
&gt; As you start moving towards the door things take a turn for the worse. Monotone is back on his feet.
&gt; His right hand is bleeding badly from where you took his finger, his left eye socket has caved in, the result of your second blow.
&gt; He looks dazed, but his remaining eye is fixed on you. In his other hand he was holding his gun.
&gt; Nyssa hissed but there wasn&#039;t time for a fight, one blast of that gun would end you all.
&gt; Instead you make for the window. Hopefully Monotone had enough sense in his damaged head to notice the gas and not shoot.
&gt; &quot;Nyssa leave him! There&#039;s no time! We have go, quick the window!&quot;
&gt; The window had been broken by your earlier hammer throw, it was your only chance to escape.
&gt; Grabbing Nyssa you make a break for it. You just needed a few seconds...
&gt; Monotone either didn&#039;t notice the gas or didn&#039;t care, raising the hand cannon he took aim, his hand wavering with the effort, and with one final creepy smile he pulls the trigger.

&gt;The house disintegrates as the shot ignites the gas, the force of the blast totalling it completely and blowing out the windows of the surrounding neighbour&#039;s homes.

&gt; When silence returned, nothing remained of Anon&#039;s house save for a debris strewn crater and a surprisingly sturdy garage.
&gt; For the first responders from the emergency services, there were many questions but little in the way of answers.

----------------------------------------------
Epilogue

&gt; In the days following the explosion there had been a flurry of activity.  
&gt; At first there had been confusion, there was no immediate sign of the homeowner, or any of his neighbours in fact.
&gt; What they did find was two unidentified corpses amongst the wreckage and a large amount of abandoned surveillance equipment in the house across the street.
&gt; Considering the corpses were armed with outlawed weaponry and not one of the missing neighbour&#039;s families had heard from them in the last couple of days, a manhunt was launched.
&gt; At first there was no sign, no leads and a media frenzy over the mysterious vanishing of so many families.
&gt; Things opened up however when the police found Monotone and Sunglasses&#039; van.  When they cracked it open they found a treasure trove of information.
&gt; A whole cache of weapons, outlandish animal traps and a stack of files marked Destroy after reading - confidential&#039;.
&gt; The files led the investigators to two locations.  The first was an old disused motel a couple of miles outside of town.  It was there the missing families had been held.  Their kidnappers taken without a fight, were surprisingly eager to talk.
&gt; The second location was a private medical research facility out west belonging to an organisation known as Getrix.
&gt; What they found there never made it to the papers, a taskforce of government agents saw to that.

&gt; Despite the media interest little more came out, until the missing homeowner, Anon, reappeared.

----------------------------------

&gt; They had taken you to the local police station but it was not the local boys in blue that did the questioning.
&gt; It was another pair of chuckle brothers, although a bit more on the professional side than the first two.
&gt; The conversation had gone something like this...

&gt; &quot;Mr Anon..&quot; they began, but you were in no mood for smiles and games this time.
&gt; &quot;Its just Anon actually.  Your two buddies made that mistake too.&quot;
&gt; They share a look and start again.
&gt; &quot;Well... &#039;just Anon&#039;... I assume you mean the two gentlemen who visited you last time.  They were not ours I assure you.&quot;
&gt; Taking nothing for granted this time you go on the offensive.
&gt; &quot;Actually I was wondering about that, they never showed me any ID and they didn&#039;t give me any names.  How about you boys introduce yourselves this time and then we go from there?&quot;
&gt; They exchange another look.
&gt; &quot;Very well.&quot; says the chuckle on the left.  &quot;My name is Agent Smith.&quot;  He shows you an FBI card with his mug on it.
&gt; The chuckle on the right produced an almost identical card with an almost identical mug shot (they did look kinda similar actually...).  &quot;I am also Agent Smith.  No relation.&quot;
&gt; You wait for the drum tap and confetti, but they&#039;re both serious.
&gt; &quot;Do you know why your here Anon?&quot;  Smith one... you think.
&gt; &quot;Oh yes I do.&quot; You reply.
&gt; &quot;Good, then we can dispense with the pleasantries.  Where is it?&quot;  Smith two this time (god this is confusing).
&gt; &quot;No.&quot;  You say simply.  
&gt; &quot;No?  Your in no position to-&quot;
&gt; &quot;Oh really?&quot; you interrupt.  &quot;I&#039;ve been listening to the news, I know what you guys are covering up and I think its time I got some answers.&quot;
&gt; They sit there and share another little look.  Your ready for their response.
&gt; &quot;Answers Anon?  If you don&#039;t cooperate things will go badly for you, very badly.  There are places in this world that make Guantanamo look like a holiday camp.  Please consider this before you next speak.&quot;
&gt; You show them your best shit eater smile.
&gt; The last guys threatened me too, funny that huh?&quot;
&gt; Before they could respond you press on.
&gt; &quot;Here&#039;s how I see it. The guys that totalled my house were chasing something, it was big, scaly and, here&#039;s the good part, liked to talk.&quot;
&gt; Another look.
&gt; &quot;It told me where it came from, it told me what they did there and a few other things. You two are going to fill in the blanks.&quot;
&gt; &quot;Your not doing yourself any-&quot;
&gt; You interrupt again.
&gt; &quot;I also had access to my smart phone, which means I took pictures, recorded some footage, and hid the memory card. And no its not in my ass do don&#039;t get any funny ideas.&quot;
&gt; Their paying you more attention now.
&gt; &quot;Oh, I made sure to tip off the press still camping out in the square that I would be making an appearance so they saw me come in here. If I magically disappear down one of those dark holes you just mentioned, not only will they know where I disappeared from but the memory card &#039;will&#039; find its way too them.&quot;
&gt; They look a bit pissed now, but you had come prepared today, with a very specific goal in mind.
&gt; &quot;Long and short of it is this, I want some answers, I want some damned compensation and a guarantee that I&#039;ll be left alone. In return I give you the card, I tell you everything that the creature told me, and... I&#039;ll tell you where I buried its body.&quot;
&gt; After a bit of discussion and a few phone calls to whoever was wearing the big boy pants, they agree to your terms. 
&gt; You&#039;re a bit surprised that they gave in so quickly but what they tell you next goes some way to explain why.

&gt; Turns out Getrix had been building bioweapons in secret, with a plan to show them off to the powers that be and sell their secrets to the highest bidder.
&gt; The reason the FBI guys were so ancy was that one of the planned bidders had been someone very high up in the Defence department. If the truth got out it would cause one hell of a political clusterfuck. They wanted to deal with it behind closed doors, the appropriate people were being quietly &quot;retired&quot; but without an audience.
&gt; Your revelations would upset the applecart so to speak.
&gt; In return for your cooperation, you would give them everything, sign an ironclad confidentiality agreement, and get a very, very large &#039;consultants fee&#039;.

&gt;When everything was signed, sealed and in the right bank account, you led them to the middle of the woods.
&gt; It was here you had told them you had buried Nyssa. She had suffered fatal wounds during the fight with Monotone and died after your escape.
&gt; When you got there however, they find only a hole. Claw marks marked the edges where something had seemingly dug themselves out. A trail of ripped and bloodstained clothes pointed to something making for the north.
&gt; The Smiths weren&#039;t happy.

&gt; &quot;The deal Anon was for the body! Its not here! No body no deal!&quot;
&gt; &quot;Actually I just promised to show you where I buried it. If she decided to get back up and make a run for it then that&#039;s your problem, not mine.&quot;
&gt; They give you a dirty look.
&gt; &quot;She? Don&#039;t you mean it...?&quot;
&gt; &quot;Uhh yeah... he, she it or whatever... Either way its your problem.&quot;
&gt; You turn to leave.
&gt; Their choice of expletives gives you a chuckle. The last thing they say before you leave earshot however gives you pause.
&gt; &quot;Damn it! We almost had all twelve...&quot;

---------------------------------------

&gt; A month later your sitting on a beach, not just any beach either, its yours.
&gt; Using the substantial payment from Uncle Sam you had decided to move to somewhere hot.  
&gt; It was on the coast and came with three important features, a private stretch of seaside (not very big but private), a big ass wall around the perimeter and it was hot most of the year.
&gt; The rest of the money had been put to work, a clever bit of accountancy (by your new money guy, since you fucking hate maths) had meant you had a modest but steady income.  It wasn&#039;t going to make you richer but you didn&#039;t have to do a 9 to 5 anymore either.  You were pretty much enjoying early retirement.
&gt; The reason why you had made all this happen?  Why you hadn&#039;t just got in your beat up car and hit the road?
&gt; The lizard currently sunbathing on your private beach of course.
&gt; In those moments after the explosion, as you both sat outside the ruins of your empty life, you&#039;d clung to each other, not quite believing you&#039;d survived.
&gt; It was there you decided to do more than run, she deserved more.
&gt; One overly convoluted plan later and here you were.
&gt; Convincing her to roll around in the hole you&#039;d dug in the woods and leaving a fake trail had been tricky, but it had worked.
&gt; You look over to the contented lizard, she&#039;s laid out on the next sun lounger.
&gt; After everything she&#039;s been though you&#039;ve finally found her a place she can be safe.
&gt; She has a little stretch as you look on, the sun glittering off her scales.
&gt; &quot;Enjoying yourself?&quot; you ask.
&gt; She answers with a happy smile, her teeth had stopped freaking you out long ago.
&gt; Yup, everything was perfect.  The days were long and hot, the nights spent snuggling up with Nyssa, even though she didn&#039;t require your body heat here, she still insisted on staying in your bed.
&gt; With a sigh, you lay back and close your eyes.  Nyssa sneaks over and lays out next to you.
&gt; &quot;Mmmmm Aannoonnn...&quot;
&gt; Yup, perfect.</textarea>
