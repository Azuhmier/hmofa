What do we have to do?&quot; Akina asks as she looks out the window towards the now setting sun.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We wait until the peacekeepers message me back with a day and location, then from there try to get them to stop fighting&quot; you say as you close the laptop.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Akina looks at you happily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ok!

Anon!&quot; Why don&#039;t you help me tomorrow in harvesting some Termites! That is if you&#039;re free!

We should get to sleep! Long day ahead of us tomorrow!&quot;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stand up and stretch, feeling your back pop satisfyingly in a few places.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Akina smiles at you, showing off her tiny canine teeth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ooo!

Unless you wanna sleep on the floor outside the mosquito net you&#039;re gonna have to get into the bed with me&quot; She says with her tail swishing behind her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As appealing as the floor sounded (it didn&#039;t at all) the thought of Malaria was even more unappealing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Alright, fine. You win&quot; you say as you begin stripping.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Akina makes a happy squeaking bark before trying to help you out of your clothes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She might be able to help if she wasn’t to short.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When at last you’re in your preferred undergarments, she bounces on her foot paws happily then slides into her bed and holds the mosquito net open.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come on! Come on! Hurry up!&quot; she says as you get into the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh and lay on you back, looking at the metal circular frame as Akina pushes a button on a remote to turn the lights off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Night Anon&quot; you hear her say cheerfully.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uh goodnight Akina&quot; you say with a bit of unease.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ok...

Plus maybe even get to harvest some locusts too!&quot; she says excitedly, her tail swishing behind her .</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It occasionally whisks itself along you as she looks up at you with a happy, expectant smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod and sip your orange juice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Alright then&quot; you say calmly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You offered to help and what else were you going to do? Sit around all day? Go meet the locals?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Screw that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The rice cooker dings softly as you sit back in your chair and look out the window.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Akina, stands and walks over to it, and as you stand to help her, she waves a paw at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Sit! You&#039;re a guest I got it!&quot; she says as she reaches for some bowls.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s just now you take notice that... Well everything is shorter in the house.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The ceilings are normal height, but the cupboards are much lower than any other house you&#039;ve been to.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s a bit odd to see actually.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But then again she is short so it makes sense to have smaller things.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Akina? Why do you have a normal sized bed?&quot; you ask as she as mixes some of those ant eggs with her rice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Luckily she spares your bowl the treatment and brings over to you with an enthusiastic skip.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Just because it was easier to find” she says as she carries the rice “Plus if I had a small bed you couldn’t share it with me!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Annnnnd Voila! Rice!&quot; She says as she sets it in front of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Thanks Akina&quot; you say with a nod and begin mixing the hash browns into the bowl of rice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her ears flick happily and her tail swishes excitedly behind her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You&#039;re Welcome! Hurry hurry! We have a lot to do today!&quot; she says.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She begins eating her rice and Ant egg combo quickly, practically scarfing it down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You follow suit, eating quickly so you can start the day.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you finish you toss the MRE bags in the trash and she takes the bowls.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come on then Rambo! Load up!&quot; Akina says.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She strolls to her gun safe and opens it up, pulling out her pistol and holster.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look at her, confused.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We&#039;re going into town?&quot; you ask, strapping your shotgun to your back with its sling.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shakes her head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;NOPE! There are some very Nasty feral animals out there! We gotta defend ourselves&quot; she says matter-of-factly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fair enough.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You follow your tiny hostess outside and instantly hate the sun.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s like that feeling when you open the oven to check on food, just a wave of heat in your face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Except it’s EVERYWHERE.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s stifling to even breathe.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nevertheless you follow Akina, who seems perfectly fine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She leads you to a shed, well more like a small warehouse.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Inside it, there are boxes and various packaging things including several with a label that says &quot;Buggin&#039; Out&quot;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look at them and then to her with a raised eyebrow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What!? I ship bugs! Anyway you get this!&quot; She says slapping her paw down on a leaf blower looking thing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you inspect it closer, it resembles a backpack with a wand like the ghostbusters had.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not the new ghost busters, the old school ones.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You heft it onto your back, noting how light it was.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Akina bounces on her toes happily, causing her breasts to jiggle slightly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yay! It fits! I never get company to help me out with this!&quot; she says and she begins grabbing plastic containers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Right... this backpack thing must be made for her to use.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So what is this anyway?&quot; you ask as she leads you out of the warehouse to an ATV.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As she skips along to it as she answers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It’s a vacuum! You’re gonna help me suck them bugs outta their mounds!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gets onto the ATV then turns it on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Sit! Let’s go!&quot; she commands you, patting the seat behind her on the ATV. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You climb on gingerly and sit behind her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Grab onto me silly! Otherwise you&#039;re gonna fall off!&quot; she says revving the ATV a bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Gently you grab her hips, which are a bit low for you to get a good grip.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;No no no Get a GRIP!&quot; she says emphasizing the word Grip and she moves your hands to her chest and therefore breasts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re shocked for a moment, but are snapped out of it when Akina guns it towards the nearest mound.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Alright Anon! Get to sucking those termite out!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grab the wand and look at Akina then the mound.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sets the boxes she’s holding down then rushes over to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;OK! So first you turn it on!&quot; she says as she flicks a switch, causing the machine to roar to life.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Then you can use the wand to suck up the termites!&quot; She shows you how the tip of the wand has a long hose that snakes its way into the mound, sucking up thousands of the insects.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She cheers loudly as you work.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Its actually kinda fun, each hole you stick the hose into gets thousands of termites, then they swarm to another hole to try and escape.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;like a weird version of whack-a-mole.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Akina occasionally stops you and empties the backpack into one of the plastic boxes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Together you do this, going from mound to mound.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Akina...you do all this by yourself?&quot; you ask as you walk and Akina drives to a fresh mound.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It seemed odd to you that a ranch would only have one person running it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stares off into the distance for a bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uhmm... Just me! Not many people wanna harvest bugs and my parents are too old to help, and I don’t have any siblings&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gives you a smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you had seen that kind of smile before.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A smile to try to tell you it’s all alright but has pain behind it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well I&#039;m here for now Akina, so let’s make the most of it&quot; you say with a smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her tail flicks happily and she gives a toothy grin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yea! Come on Anon!&quot; she says revving the ATV, prompting you to jump on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pulls up to the next mound but her smile falls away from her face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look at the mound and see why.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Its half destroyed and torn up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What did this Akina?&quot; you ask looking around for the perpetrators.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sniffs the air quickly and frowns.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Feral Pigs! They keep tearing up my mounds! Come on Anon!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You set down the backpack and grasp your shotgun.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She guns it and takes off into the brush, following her nose.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Get that gun ready Anon! I HATE these piggies!&quot; she yells over the whipping wind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You check the tubes of you shotgun and opt for a solid slug shot.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The ATV slows to a halt and you both dismount then head into the brush.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Akina leads the way, sniffing quietly and holding her pistol.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Quiet oinking fills the air as you step quietly through the dense African foliage.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Akina points and you follow her paw pads.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A Small group of feral pigs eat at some plants as you nod and level your shotgun.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looks like male and female pig with a group of piglets.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll get the big adult male, you get the female&quot; you whisper.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;3...2...1...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The shots ring out and the adult pigs fall down dead leaving the piglets scattering.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile and Akina bounces happily next to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We got &#039;em! Without the parents those piglets won&#039;t be a problem anymore!&quot; She says, jumping into your arms in a hug, knocking your shotgun out of your hands.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Thank you thank you Anon! No more Pig problems!&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You actually have to smile at her excitedness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And the thought of Pork made your mouth water slightly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you and Akina approach the kills, you see they were eating some kind fruit but that doesn’t matter to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The male was about 40 lbs. and the female 30 lbs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hmmm must&#039;ve been juveniles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What do we do with these now?&quot; Akina says with a frown, kicking the female pigs body lightly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You bend over and grab the male’s hind legs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;How about I treat you to some American BBQ? You’re being such a good host after all&quot; you say with a smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Akina looks from you to the pig with a bit of concern.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uhh....ok! Let’s tie this piggy up&quot; She says, dashing over to the ATV.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thankfully she had a small length of rope, you assumed for tying down her termite containers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The pig took up too much space on the ATV to also get the containers of termites, so you both decided to make a few trips.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;OK so! You start getting the piggy ready for eating and I’ll get the termites we farmed up!&quot; Akina says happily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She revs ATV and in a flash you’re both heading back to the House.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her cheerful Squeaking barks make you smile as you trek back to her house.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you arrive you pull the pig off the ATV, then she speeds off with a &quot;Be right back!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She has a table set up beside her warehouse with a few chairs where you decide to work.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You head inside and grab one of the knives you packed for this excursion into Africa.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Twirling the blade between your fingers, you step back out into the sun and are surprised to see the sun hovering just above the horizon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;How long had you and Akina been getting termites? You had lost track of time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Either way, you get to butchering the pig as Akina drives back and begins putting the containers full of termites into her warehouse</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She finishes far before you do and circles you as you cut up the pig carefully.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What ya doing, how does that part work?!&quot; she asks like a small hyperactive child.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Its was actually quite cute to see someone so interested in something so mundane. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you explain what you’re doing as you pull out the innards and drain the blood.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Akina takes a big interest in the innards.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Gimme those! I can use them to farm up some maggots! I don’t eat them but people will pay big money for them!&quot; She say grabbing a large plastic bucket.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shudder at the thought of eating maggots but oblige, placing the gore into it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She then takes a piece of fine mesh and places it over the top of it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;The flies won’t be able to get to the meat so they will lay their eggs on the mesh! We can set this bucket out tomorrow&quot; she says happily, placing the bucket in her warehouse.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whatever makes her happy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With the pig butchered, you set about making a fire-pit. Luckily there is plenty of dry wood around from Akina&#039;s termites</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before long you have a small bonfire and you place a metal grate over the blaze, held up but a few pieces of metal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you place a few cutlets of the meat onto the grate, Akina is peeking around your back sniffing cautiously.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Mmmm it smells good Anon... Lemme get some sides!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your pint sized host runs into her house, leaving you to tend to the meat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After about 20 minutes she reappears carrying a plate of Locusts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I Made Cajun Locust fries! They should go good with this piggy!&quot; she say excitedly, shoving the plate into your face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;yep, those are Locusts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You carefully and delicately push the plate away from your face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well uh... Thanks, those look....&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look at her smiling face and see her eyes so excited that you can&#039;t bring yourself to really say what you think.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;They look good Akina&quot; you finally say.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your hostess bounces happily causing her breasts to jiggle then lets out a happy squeaking bark.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;YAY! I’m so excited!&quot; She says happily dancing around you and the fire.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile as you go inside and feel a bit of relief from the AC as you grab 2 plates for the food.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you step back out into the fading sunlight, Akina is waiting eagerly, her Green eyes watching your movements and reflecting the firelight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull off a piece of the meat onto a plate and give it to her earning a high pitched howl of excitement, then grab yourself a piece.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sit at the table and she scoots her chair next to yours then slides the plate of locusts to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come on Anon! Try them, I&#039;m trying your American BBQ&quot; She says before taking a bite out of the pork to emphasize the point.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She then gives you a happy smile and pokes the plate of locusts a little closer to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Tryyyyyy it&quot; She whispers at you with a big smile before biting into her cut of pig.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh, then pick one up and look at it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was covered in the Cajun spice from the US...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As well she was trying the food you made so might as well...Right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You bite into it and chew quickly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Honestly it only tastes like old bay seasoning and chicken, albeit more crunchy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You eat the rest of the locust and look at Akina, who beams at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It’s good eh!?&quot; she says wiggling in her seat happily and scooting closer to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It’s not bad&quot; you say with a smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That wasn’t even a lie, you had eaten worse during your military service.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The both of you eat and watch the sun set.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s actually one of the more peaceful and calming evenings you’ve had in a while.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fresh air, a light breeze, good company.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You finish eating and so does Akina, who rubs her stomach happily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;MMMM that was tasty Anon! Can you put the rest of the piggy in the fridge in the warehouse?&quot; she asks.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod and grab the remaining uncooked pieces of meat and carry them into the warehouse.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A quick look around and you see a fridge tucked away in the corner.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pulling it open reveals several types of bugs and what appears to be earthworms.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You aren&#039;t even surprised.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You carefully stash the meat in her fridge then go back out to Akina, who is bouncing on her footpaws waiting for you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As soon as you’re within reach, she grabs your hand in her paw and pulls you along.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come come come! We gotta get clean then go to bed! We have another long day tomorrow!&quot; she says dragging you into the house.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The cool air is almost a shock to your system as you step inside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you don’t have time to think about that as Akina pulls you into the bathroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Shower time!&quot; she says happily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you can even react, she begins tugging her shirt off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Whoa whoa whoa Akina Wait!&quot; you say shielding your eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hmm?

This isn’t a normal thing people do together&quot; you say, feeling your face turning red.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear impatient claws tapping her floor tiles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We need to save water AND it’s ok because we&#039;re friends!&quot; She says tugging on your arm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You let her pull your arm away and see her looking up at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We are friends right?&quot; she pleads, looking up at you with her green eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hope fills them as she looks at you with a small smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It should be illegal to be this cute.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You just can&#039;t say no to that smile and those big green eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yes...we&#039;re friends Akina&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She wraps her arms around you and poofs up her Mohawk.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I knew it!

What if he wanted to be a UFC fighter, or an author or a policeman?

Any bug you want me to try, or dig up a new termite mound, just trust me ok?&quot; you say, looking down at her as you flip the burgers calmly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her green eyes light up as she looks up at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anything?!&quot; she says with a bit more excitement than you anticipated, in fact it caused you a bit of concern with how she answered.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But she wouldn&#039;t ask the impossible right?

Is this what America is like?&quot; she says, preparing a smaller burger for herself; you had made different sized burgers, some for you, some for her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod as you prepare a burger for yourself, noting how Akina still sniffs the food with a bit of apprehension.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;America is uh... like anywhere else, despite the ravings otherwise, people just want to be happy&quot; you say with small smile</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks up at you, torn away from her burger to focus on you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Even you?

She’s got a quality gun there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And surprisingly, she also pulls out a sawed-off double barrel shotgun, which she affixes to her back happily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;a shotgun? Can you handle that much recoil?&quot; you scoff at her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gives you a sour glance as she pulls a few shells out of her gun safe and stuffs them into her khaki pockets.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It&#039;s a bit tough, but I figure we need firepower for this&quot; she says earnestly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;From the look of the shotgun, it&#039;s only been fired a few times.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Plus, she&#039;s right, you could be walking into a firefight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Makes sense Akina, let’s go&quot; you say with a calm smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Truthfully, you’re screaming inside, this was dangerous and you were ok going alone to put just yourself in harm’s way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bringing Akina meant A. keep track of her, B. Make sure she&#039;s safe. And C. Don’t let her accidentally spark a war.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Heading out, you feel the still rising sun already begin pounding heat against the arid landscape.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fuck this place is hot.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get into your land rover and watch as Akina literally climbs in, grumbling to herself about &quot;tall human vehicles&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For comfort, she pulls the shotgun off her back and leans it, barrel down, against her seat on the floor while she buckles in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Satisfied, you start the vehicle and head off, letting the BHA provided GPS guide you to the neutral location for these negotiations.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The lives of so many hang in the balance of these negotiations, so many anthros and so many humans.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All you want is for them to live in peace.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The ride goes by in silence, but you feel a slight tension from Akina, usually bubbly and happy, but now quiet and solemn while staring out a window.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The calm before the storm, heading someplace that was full of possible danger.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You place a hand on Akina&#039;s thigh and give a gently squeeze, earning a surprised &quot;YIP&quot; from her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It&#039;s ok Akina, I’ll keep you safe no matter what&quot; you say with a smile, staring at the &quot;road&quot; as you drive</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can feel her scowl </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I want us BOTH safe! Don&#039;t go playing Mr. Hero!

Or was it a cackle like wild hyenas?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Doesn&#039;t matter&quot; you mumble to yourself as you set up an HD camera to document the whole process.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The sounds of claws tick-tacking along the hardwood floor of the game lodge becomes audible.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A moment later a score of various Anthros, mostly consisting of hyenas, enter the room you&#039;re in and you feel Akina shrink down next to you in fear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stay upright, head held high as they pour in, eyeing you with general disinterest and giving Akina a someone perturbed look.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They wear black modern military gear, dark green berets on their heads.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Akina&#039;s hackles and Mohawk poof up in nervousness, she looks at the towering figures and gives a quiet whimper.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The whimper is drowned out by heavy thudding footsteps, slow and rhythmic, like the footstep of the T-rex from Jurassic park.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why does this day have to remind you of Jurassic park?

&gt;How on earth did you get wrangled into this is all you can think as you look out the window of your lifted Land rover.
&gt;The hot African sun bakes the ground and the whole place looks like a god forsaken hell hole.
&gt;It’s so hot that the air shimmers and mirages of water dance on the road.
&gt;You are Anon, Peace keeper and negotiator.
&gt;For some reason, you got picked to try and negotiate between 2 rival warlords in this fucking place.
&gt;And of course, it was a human warlord versus an Anthro warlord.
&gt;You were in some southern African country.
&gt;Which one you’re in, you don&#039;t know.
&gt;How could you? The lines change daily, the people can&#039;t give straight answers.
&gt;You had better luck trying to figure out perpetual motion.
&gt;But according to the people that sent you here, you were supposed to pick up and meet a guide.
&gt;An Aardwolf Anthro, whatever that is.
&gt;Get them and have them lead you to wherever you’re staying.
&gt;Hopefully the place has working AC and a shower.
&gt;Just looking at some of these people made you FEEL dirty.
&gt;Whatever.
&gt;You Pull up to a shitty gas Station and look around.
&gt;They were supposed to meet you here.
&gt;There is no way you&#039;re getting out of your SUV here.
&gt;That seems like a good way to get raped by a Hyena or something.
&gt;So you sat in the AC waiting.
&gt;You can see a few passerby’s, Humans and Anthros looking over your SUV, and hopefully not trying to size you up.
&gt;Your SRM 1216 shotgun sits fully loaded and ready to rock and roll if need be.
&gt;Africa has had its shares of trouble along the way.
&gt;And a thing that puts you on edge is how every other continent has reports of Anons appearing.
&gt;Africa...doesn&#039;t.
&gt;The BHA Suspects that they do appear here with the same frequency as anywhere else, but they get killed by the natives for witchcraft or whatever.
&gt;Slight knocking on your driver’s side window causes you to jump lightly.
&gt;You look out of it and see...A black Mohawk?
&gt;You roll down the window and peer out and down.
&gt;&quot;Heeelo! Are you Anon?&quot; The small...thing says with a toothy grin.
&gt;Before you is a...Hyena? No... Too thin and small...
&gt;Tan fur with black stripes along it, and on top of it’s....her head... is a tall Mohawk.
&gt;This is an Aardwolf?
&gt;She’s wearing khaki shorts and a black polo, a pistol sitting in a holster at her side.
&gt;&quot;Uh... yes I’m Anon, who are you?&quot; you answer, your right hand resting on your shotgun.
&gt;&quot;I am Akina! I am your guide here!&quot; She says in a happy voice with a slight Afrikaans accent.
&gt;You look at her for a moment almost dumbfounded.
&gt;&quot;A Child? Why wou-&quot;
&gt;&quot;I am NO Child! I am 26 Years old! My species is just... Small&quot;
&gt;Small was an understatement.
&gt;She was maybe 4 foot tall, with c cup breasts and hips that looked just a bit too wide for her small frame.
&gt;If she was taller she could have put super models to shame.
&gt;She looks left and right quickly then digs into the shorts pockets, then pulls out a piece of paper.
&gt;She hands it to you and you look it over.
&gt;They show her credentials, her name and her age, proving she was your guide.
&gt;&quot;Alright, Come on in, let’s get where ever while you fill me in on the details&quot;.
&gt;You notice Akina&#039;s Mohawk folds down into a sleek black mane.
&gt;Huh, neat.
&gt;She strolls around the land rover, partially out of view because of her height.
&gt;The Passenger door open, and she climbs in with a little trouble due to her height.
&gt;Honestly if she were any shorter, she would need a booster seat.
&gt;She might need one anyway.
&gt;You shift the SUV into drive and look over at the small girl.
&gt;&quot;Where to then Ms. Guide&quot; you say with a small smile.
&gt;It&#039;s honestly hard to believe this is a full grown woman.
&gt;She points east and directs you.
&gt;&quot;Follow that road, we can get to the ranch from there&quot; she says peeking over the dashboard.
&gt;You nod and start driving, the looks you&#039;ve started getting are cause for concern.
&gt;These people and Anthros do not look inviting.
&gt;&quot;So why did you choose to help us out here?&quot; Akina Asks, her Mohawk poofing up a bit as she looks at you.
&gt;She has so much hope in her eyes, you don&#039;t really want to just say you got forced to.
&gt;So you decide to dodge it.
&gt;&quot;I just want to help there be peace between humans and Anthros&quot; you say with a smile.
&gt;Well that wasn&#039;t a lie, you did want to see people get along.
&gt;She smiles at you showing her tiny canine teeth.
&gt;&quot;That’s good! Also Floor it! There aren’t speed limits here! No one would enforce them anyway!&quot; she says buckling herself into the seat.
&gt;You do as directed and floor it, sending your land rover speeding down the dirt roads.
&gt;Dust clouds billow behind you as the red hot sun bakes the Savannah.
&gt;Akina laughs happily whenever the SUV bounces a bit and cheers as the world zooms by.
&gt;She was a lively one that’s for sure.
&gt;As you drive you can&#039;t help but smile at her antics.
&gt;&quot;Ok Ok, turn left! There that dirt path&quot; she finally says.
&gt;You were a good 30 miles away from the &quot;city&quot; you had picked her up in.
&gt;Turning the car quickly, you follow the dirt trail.
&gt;If she hadn’t pointed it out, you would have driven right by it.
&gt;The trail winds through fields of dirt and dust, large bushes sprout occasionally.
&gt;You were pretty sure you had seen that one survival guy point those plants out.
&gt;What was his name? He was ironically named after an animal even though he wasn&#039;t an Anthro.
&gt;Whatever.
&gt;Those plants were known for huge thorns.
&gt;Large spires, looking like giant chimneys made of clay stick out of the low Savannah grass like dirty obelisks.
&gt;Didn&#039;t she say ranch? Where were the animals?
&gt;&quot;What kind of ranch is this Akina?&quot; you ask as you slow down a bit to look at one of the clay spires.
&gt;Where had you seen these before?
&gt;She smiles at you with her Mohawk popping up and her ears flicking.
&gt;&quot;It’s a Bug Ranch! I&#039;m an Insect farmer!&quot; she says happily as she points to one of the obelisks.
&gt;&quot;Those are termite mounds! I harvest those termites and ship them all over the world for insectivores like me!&quot; she says happily.
&gt;You turn to her in confusion, only to see her stick out a long tongue at you.
&gt;That tongue was ridiculously long for someone her size.
&gt;All of your what?
&gt;&quot;Aardwolves are insectivores Anon! Bugs are the main part of our diet, soooooo I’m a bug rancher&quot; she says happily as you pull up to her one story house.
&gt;The house isn’t much honestly.
&gt;A single story dwelling with solar panels on top. 
&gt;She opens the Car door and gets out more gracefully than you would have thought possible.
&gt;&quot;Home sweet home! You’re welcome to whatever here! I have running water from a well, electricity from the solar panels and even AC! Just be sure to use mosquito nets at night&quot; she says as she unlocks the front door.
&gt;As you walk in, you&#039;re actually surprised at how modern it looks.
&gt;No outdated technology, no mud floors.
&gt;If you didn&#039;t know any better this would look like a basic North American home.
&gt;This might be a decent Base of operations after all.
&gt;You sling your shotgun across your back as you look around the main room.
&gt;A basic house in every sense of the word, but with more modern amenities that you thought she would have.
&gt;A living room connected to a kitchen where a small table is, her couch sits in front of a TV.
&gt;There is a hallway to your left that leads to the rest of the house.
&gt;&quot;Always packing heat like that Anon?&quot; Akina says looking over your shotgun.
&gt;You turn to her in disbelief.
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re literally carrying a pistol Akina, I’m just trying to protect myself&quot; you say in disbelief.
&gt;She grips her pistol and draws it out, then walks to a safe where she stores it.
&gt;&quot;Fair enough, you are kind of a target out here&quot; she says as she closes the door to the safe and spins the lock.
&gt;&quot;Am I?&quot;
&gt;She nods quickly.
&gt;&quot;Random human here? You might as well have a target painted on you&quot; she says before going to her fridge &quot;You Hungry?&quot;.
&gt;Between the flight and the drive to her, you have to say you were.
&gt;But you don’t really trust food out here.
&gt;Maybe you could trust Akina&#039;s food though.
&gt;&quot;Sure, what do you have&quot; you say as you unstrap your shotgun and lean it against her safe, ready for you to grab if need be.
&gt;Not like you were going to let her take it from you and lock it away.
&gt;&quot;Uhm, I&#039;ve got Meal worms, Termites, Locusts and some beetles&quot; Akina says happily from the fridge.
&gt;Your stomach tightens up.
&gt;&quot;Uh any like...normal food?&quot; you ask, hoping against hope.
&gt;&quot;Hmmm? This ish normal food&quot; Akina answers, looking at you with a mouth full of some sort of insect.
&gt;NOPE!
&gt;You had at least planned ahead for food but you had hoped your host would have actual regular food.
&gt;&quot;Uh... I&#039;ll pass Akina, thanks, I have some food in the car&quot; you say as you open her front door.
&gt;This wasn&#039;t what you had wanted, this was a backup plan.
&gt;But bugs...those were not quite on your menu.
&gt;You pop open the trunk of the Land rover and Grab your luggage and a Box of MREs.
&gt;Yea MREs aren’t the best in terms of health but they are good enough to eat.
&gt;...And are better than bugs.
&gt;You pull your box of MREs into the house along with your luggage.
&gt;Akina is sitting at a table in her kitchen, munching happily on some Locusts.
&gt;&quot;Ooo Whatchu got there Anon?&quot; she says with an insect leg sticking out of her mouth.
&gt;You cringe a bit at the sight.
&gt;&quot;I have some MREs, I&#039;m not really a bug kinda guy&quot; you say as you set the box on the floor.
&gt;&quot;Where can I put my Luggage and gear?&quot;
&gt;You shake your luggage bag for emphasis.
&gt;The rest of your stuff was still in the Land Rover, so you would have to make another trip or 2.
&gt;Akina swallows quickly and hops to her feet with her Mohawk sticking up.
&gt;&quot;Right! You have stuff! This way!&quot; She says excitedly, leading you down a hallway.
&gt;&quot;You can put you stuff in here!&quot; she says leading you to a bedroom.
&gt;Looking around, one thing catches your attention.
&gt;There is only one bedroom...And only one bed.
&gt;&quot;Uhm... Akina....Why is there only one bedroom?&quot; you ask with a bit of confusion.
&gt;She shrugs.
&gt;&quot;Welllllll! I live here alone so I only need one bedroom, we&#039;re gonna have to share&quot; she says happily as she looks up at you.
&gt;You sigh and look around.
&gt;Anywhere else you could sleep? There is a couch in her front room but it’s too small for you to lay down on.
&gt;But then again, it&#039;s not too terrible, sharing a room with a small Anthro lady couldn&#039;t be that bad could it?
&gt;She looks at you with a happy smile
&gt;&quot;Alright then, beggars can&#039;t be choosers&quot; you say as you set your luggage on the floor.
&gt;A small desk with a computer sits in the corner of the bedroom.
&gt;&quot;You have internet out here Akina?&quot; you ask as she leads you out of the bedroom.
&gt;&quot;Mhm! Satellite Internet though, I have to get the bugs I harvest shipped&quot; she says as she skips along.
&gt;Well, that’s not bad at all .
&gt;You make one more trip from the land rover to the bedroom carrying your gear.
&gt;Ammo, your laptop, sunscreen, and other stuff for self defense.
&gt;Never can be too careful here.
&gt;After, you sit on Akina’s couch and take off your boots then pull open an MRE.
&gt;Beef brisket, not the best but not the worst either.
&gt;Akina sits next to you, sniffing the air.
&gt;&quot;Hmmmm is that any good?&quot; she says as she watches you eat.
&gt;&quot;Here try it&quot;.
&gt;You cut off a piece for her to try, but when you present it to her, she shies away.
&gt;&quot;Uhmmmmmm I dunno...Maybe I’ll try some later&quot; she says meekly.
&gt;You shrug and continue eating.
&gt;Akina&#039;s Mohawk stays poofed up as she watches you.
&gt;Not wanting awkwardness, you decide to strike up some conversation.
&gt;&quot;So Akina, Why would you want to help the Peacekeepers?&quot; you ask as you finish your food.
&gt;Her green eyes light up.
&gt;&quot;If the warring warlords stop fighting I can ship more bugs!&quot; she says excitedly.
&gt;But then her demeanor changes &quot;Plus...Then they might not have so many cub soldiers... Too many children and people have died for nothing&quot;
&gt;You frown.
&gt;Of course you had heard about child soldiers being use by both sides. 
&gt;You recall some guy a while ago trying to get rid of them with this huge donation thing, but that died as quickly as it started.
&gt;You nod and grab your laptop, and boot it up.
&gt;&quot;Well Akina, hopefully I can do something about it&quot; you say as you connect to the internet.
&gt;&quot;Whatcha doing Anon?&quot; Akina says as she scoots closer to you and looks at the screen.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m letting my higher ups know I&#039;m here and that I met up with you. They are going to get a day set up where I can meet with both of the warlords in a neutral area and try to negotiate&quot; you say as you type up the message. 
&gt;With a quick hit of the &quot;send&quot; button, you&#039;re all set and ready to go.
&gt;&quot;So what now Anon? What do we have to do?&quot; Akina asks as she looks out the window towards the now setting sun.
&gt;&quot;We wait until the peacekeepers message me back with a day and location, then from there try to get them to stop fighting&quot; you say as you close the laptop.
&gt;Akina looks at you happily.
&gt;&quot;Ok! This is exciting! I never have company!&quot; She says bouncing in her seat, her long bush tail swishing behind her.
&gt;Cute.
&gt;Suddenly she bounces herself closer to you, and looks up at you.
&gt;&quot;Oh OH! Anon!&quot; Why don&#039;t you help me tomorrow in harvesting some Termites! That is if you&#039;re free! I could always use the help of a big strong man!&quot; she says looking at you with a big smile and her Mohawk poofed up.
&gt;How can you say no to that smile and those bright green eyes, plus you might learn something.
&gt;&quot;Alright Akina, I&#039;ll help out but you owe me&quot; you say with a smile.
&gt;The two of you talk for a while, long into the night.
&gt;You learn about her.
&gt;She bought this land on the cheap because it wasn’t useable as farmland, but it was great for insect farming.
&gt;Her parents live in South Africa in Cape hope.
&gt;And in turn you told her about yourself.
&gt;How you are 2nd Generation Anonymous, and prior Military.
&gt;That you served for years in the American military but decided to leave because you didn&#039;t want to do that for a living.
&gt;Akina gives a long yawn as she talks about Aardwolves and how the name means earth wolf.
&gt;&quot;Mmmf Anon! We should get to sleep! Long day ahead of us tomorrow!&quot;.
&gt;You stand up and stretch, feeling your back pop satisfyingly in a few places.
&gt;Akina smiles at you, showing off her tiny canine teeth.
&gt;&quot;Ooo! This is exciting, come come come!&quot; she says grabbing your hand in her tiny paws and pulling you to the bedroom.
&gt;Hastily, she pulls off her Khaki shorts and her shirt, revealing simple white lace panties and a matching Bra.
&gt;You&#039;re actually at a loss for words as she starts trying to tug your shirt off.
&gt;But you need to say something!
&gt;&quot;Whoa whoa whoa Akina! This isn&#039;t the usual thing strangers do when they meet each other!&quot; you say as you gently push her away.
&gt;She stops and looks up at you, clearly confused.
&gt;&quot;Whatcha mean Anon?&quot; she says, cocking her head to the side.
&gt;&quot;I mean, we just met, this isn&#039;t the normal thing for people who just met to do!&quot; you say motioning to her scantily clad body.
&gt;She looks down at herself and then at you.
&gt;To your surprise she smiles.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s OK! Aardwolves usually don’t interact with other species and you seem nice enough. Besides! Unless you wanna sleep on the floor outside the mosquito net you&#039;re gonna have to get into the bed with me&quot; She says with her tail swishing behind her.
&gt;You sigh.
&gt;As appealing as the floor sounded (it didn&#039;t at all) the thought of Malaria was even more unappealing.
&gt;&quot;Alright, fine. You win&quot; you say as you begin stripping.
&gt;Akina makes a happy squeaking bark before trying to help you out of your clothes.
&gt;She might be able to help if she wasn’t to short.
&gt;When at last you’re in your preferred undergarments, she bounces on her foot paws happily then slides into her bed and holds the mosquito net open.
&gt;&quot;Come on! Come on! Hurry up!&quot; she says as you get into the bed.
&gt;You sigh and lay on you back, looking at the metal circular frame as Akina pushes a button on a remote to turn the lights off.
&gt;&quot;Night Anon&quot; you hear her say cheerfully.
&gt;&quot;Uh goodnight Akina&quot; you say with a bit of unease.
&gt;Ok... This was weirder than you thought.
&gt;You&#039;re in a bed with a small Anthro woman who has no concept of personal boundaries.
&gt;What could go wrong?
&gt;When you feel her snuggle up to you and put her head on your chest, you wish you hadn&#039;t asked. 
&gt;Before long you hear tiny snores from your chest.
&gt;Upon closer inspection you see Akina asleep, her tongue partly out as she snores quietly.
&gt;Well fuck. 
&gt;Could be worse.
&gt;Sure you can feel her breasts pressed against you.
&gt;Sure you barely know her.
&gt;But it could be a dude.
&gt;You sigh and resign yourself to your fate and close your eyes.
&gt;Tomorrow will be a whole new adventure.

Chapter 2: Where I Live

&gt;You wake up to sunlight in your eyes and a wet spot on your chest.
&gt;Akina lays with her head on your chest, snuggled up with her mouth partly agape and drooling on you.
&gt;It was actually pretty cute.
&gt;You don&#039;t want to wake her, but the sun does as it rises steadily.
&gt;She stirs slowly, and opens her eyes and blinks a few times.
&gt;&quot;Mooooooornin&quot; she yawns with a groggy smile.
&gt;&quot;Morning Akina, you drooled on me a bit&quot; you say as you motion to the drool spot on your chest.
&gt;She simply smiles and poofs her Mohawk up.
&gt;&quot;That’s cuz you’re comfy! I Love having company over!&quot; she says happily.
&gt;She slides out of bed and goes to her closet as you go to your luggage.
&gt;&quot;Wear something you don’t mind getting dirty!&quot; she says in a sing song voice.
&gt;You peek over at her and see she is fully naked, picking out underwear while her tail swishes behind her.
&gt;Blushing, you avert your eyes and stare into your bag.
&gt;A black t shirt and jeans? Simple yet effective.
&gt;Quickly you pull on your clothes as you head Akina getting hers on.
&gt;When you finally look back at Akina, she’s wearing a brown shirt and khaki shorts again.
&gt;&quot;Come on! Let’s eat and get out there!&quot; She says grabbing your hand as she rushes past you out the door.
&gt;How can something so tiny be so strong? She pulls you along like you weigh nothing.
&gt;Into her kitchen she goes, and by extension so do you.
&gt;Before you know it, she’s digging through her fridge spouting different bugs at you.
&gt;&quot;I got some Meal worms! Or are you feeling like maybe some kinda eggs and ants?&quot; she calls out from inside the fridge.
&gt;Eggs? 
&gt;&quot;You have Eggs Akina?&quot; you ask peeking over her shoulders.
&gt;She backs up a bit and rubs her tail and rear on you then stands quickly.
&gt;&quot;Ant Eggs! Want some?&quot; she says holding out a container full of what looks like weird rice.
&gt;You shake your head quickly and back up.
&gt;She pouts a bit at you.
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re no fun! But uhh... I have rice and OJ! Want some of that?&quot; she says as her ears fold down and she looks at you concerned.
&gt;&quot;I...I guess I’m not a very good host Am I?&quot; she says sadly.
&gt;You rub her ears quickly.
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re doing fine Akina, I&#039;m down for rice I guess, and Orange juice&quot; you say, reassuring her &quot;Where do you get Orange Juice and Rice anyway?&quot;
&gt;Her ears perk up as she pours you a glass of orange juice.
&gt;&quot;When the shipping company I use picks up my shipment, I have them bring me things I can&#039;t get here&quot; She says as she put some rice in a cooker.
&gt;Oh good, that means you can hopefully get some actual food here.
&gt;But for now MREs will have to do.
&gt;Calmly you fish around in your MRE box until you find a breakfast one, settling on &quot;Hash browns and bacon&quot;.
&gt;You carry it over to the table and sit down across from Akina at her circular table.
&gt;&quot;So Akina...&quot; you start, only to watch as she gets out of her chair, scoots it over to you and sits down right next to you.
&gt;She then grabs her cup of OJ and plops down into her chair next to you.
&gt;&quot;Yeeeeesssss Anon?&quot; she says with a smile before sipping her drink.
&gt;&quot;Uh...what are we doing today?&quot; you say as you wait for the rice to finish cooking.
&gt;Akina bounces in her seat happily and somehow scoots even closer to you.
&gt;&quot;WE are harvesting termites! I&#039;ll show you how and then we can get to it! Plus maybe even get to harvest some locusts too!&quot; she says excitedly, her tail swishing behind her .
&gt;It occasionally whisks itself along you as she looks up at you with a happy, expectant smile.
&gt;You nod and sip your orange juice.
&gt;&quot;Alright then&quot; you say calmly.
&gt;You offered to help and what else were you going to do? Sit around all day? Go meet the locals?
&gt;Screw that.
&gt;The rice cooker dings softly as you sit back in your chair and look out the window.
&gt;Akina, stands and walks over to it, and as you stand to help her, she waves a paw at you.
&gt;&quot;Sit! You&#039;re a guest I got it!&quot; she says as she reaches for some bowls.
&gt;It’s just now you take notice that... Well everything is shorter in the house.
&gt;The ceilings are normal height, but the cupboards are much lower than any other house you&#039;ve been to.
&gt;It’s a bit odd to see actually.
&gt;But then again she is short so it makes sense to have smaller things.
&gt;&quot;Akina? Why do you have a normal sized bed?&quot; you ask as she as mixes some of those ant eggs with her rice.
&gt;Luckily she spares your bowl the treatment and brings over to you with an enthusiastic skip.
&gt;”Just because it was easier to find” she says as she carries the rice “Plus if I had a small bed you couldn’t share it with me!”
&gt;&quot;Annnnnd Voila! Rice!&quot; She says as she sets it in front of you.
&gt;&quot;Thanks Akina&quot; you say with a nod and begin mixing the hash browns into the bowl of rice.
&gt;Her ears flick happily and her tail swishes excitedly behind her.
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re Welcome! Hurry hurry! We have a lot to do today!&quot; she says.
&gt;She begins eating her rice and Ant egg combo quickly, practically scarfing it down.
&gt;You follow suit, eating quickly so you can start the day.
&gt;When you finish you toss the MRE bags in the trash and she takes the bowls.
&gt;&quot;Come on then Rambo! Load up!&quot; Akina says.
&gt;She strolls to her gun safe and opens it up, pulling out her pistol and holster.
&gt;You look at her, confused.
&gt;&quot;We&#039;re going into town?&quot; you ask, strapping your shotgun to your back with its sling.
&gt;She shakes her head.
&gt;&quot;NOPE! There are some very Nasty feral animals out there! We gotta defend ourselves&quot; she says matter-of-factly.
&gt;Fair enough.
&gt;You follow your tiny hostess outside and instantly hate the sun.
&gt;It’s like that feeling when you open the oven to check on food, just a wave of heat in your face.
&gt;Except it’s EVERYWHERE.
&gt;It’s stifling to even breathe.
&gt;Nevertheless you follow Akina, who seems perfectly fine.
&gt;She leads you to a shed, well more like a small warehouse.
&gt;Inside it, there are boxes and various packaging things including several with a label that says &quot;Buggin&#039; Out&quot;.
&gt;You look at them and then to her with a raised eyebrow.
&gt;&quot;What!? I ship bugs! Anyway you get this!&quot; She says slapping her paw down on a leaf blower looking thing.
&gt;When you inspect it closer, it resembles a backpack with a wand like the ghostbusters had.
&gt;Not the new ghost busters, the old school ones.
&gt;You heft it onto your back, noting how light it was.
&gt;Akina bounces on her toes happily, causing her breasts to jiggle slightly.
&gt;&quot;Yay! It fits! I never get company to help me out with this!&quot; she says and she begins grabbing plastic containers.
&gt;Right... this backpack thing must be made for her to use.
&gt;&quot;So what is this anyway?&quot; you ask as she leads you out of the warehouse to an ATV.
&gt;As she skips along to it as she answers.
&gt;&quot;It’s a vacuum! You’re gonna help me suck them bugs outta their mounds!&quot;
&gt;She gets onto the ATV then turns it on.
&gt;&quot;Sit! Let’s go!&quot; she commands you, patting the seat behind her on the ATV. 
&gt;You climb on gingerly and sit behind her.
&gt;&quot;Grab onto me silly! Otherwise you&#039;re gonna fall off!&quot; she says revving the ATV a bit.
&gt;Gently you grab her hips, which are a bit low for you to get a good grip.
&gt;&quot;No no no Get a GRIP!&quot; she says emphasizing the word Grip and she moves your hands to her chest and therefore breasts.
&gt;You’re shocked for a moment, but are snapped out of it when Akina guns it towards the nearest mound.
&gt;&quot;Alright Anon! Get to sucking those termite out!&quot;
&gt;You grab the wand and look at Akina then the mound.
&gt;&quot;What?&quot;
&gt;She sets the boxes she’s holding down then rushes over to you.
&gt;&quot;OK! So first you turn it on!&quot; she says as she flicks a switch, causing the machine to roar to life.
&gt;&quot;Then you can use the wand to suck up the termites!&quot; She shows you how the tip of the wand has a long hose that snakes its way into the mound, sucking up thousands of the insects.
&gt;She cheers loudly as you work.
&gt;Its actually kinda fun, each hole you stick the hose into gets thousands of termites, then they swarm to another hole to try and escape.
&gt;like a weird version of whack-a-mole.
&gt;Akina occasionally stops you and empties the backpack into one of the plastic boxes.
&gt;Together you do this, going from mound to mound.
&gt;&quot;Akina...you do all this by yourself?&quot; you ask as you walk and Akina drives to a fresh mound.
&gt;It seemed odd to you that a ranch would only have one person running it.
&gt;She stares off into the distance for a bit.
&gt;&quot;Uhmm... Just me! Not many people wanna harvest bugs and my parents are too old to help, and I don’t have any siblings&quot;
&gt;She gives you a smile.
&gt;But you had seen that kind of smile before.
&gt;A smile to try to tell you it’s all alright but has pain behind it.
&gt;&quot;Well I&#039;m here for now Akina, so let’s make the most of it&quot; you say with a smile.
&gt;Her tail flicks happily and she gives a toothy grin.
&gt;&quot;Yea! Come on Anon!&quot; she says revving the ATV, prompting you to jump on.
&gt;She pulls up to the next mound but her smile falls away from her face.
&gt;You look at the mound and see why.
&gt;Its half destroyed and torn up.
&gt;&quot;What did this Akina?&quot; you ask looking around for the perpetrators.
&gt;She sniffs the air quickly and frowns.
&gt;&quot;Feral Pigs! They keep tearing up my mounds! Come on Anon!&quot;
&gt;You set down the backpack and grasp your shotgun.
&gt;She guns it and takes off into the brush, following her nose.
&gt;&quot;Get that gun ready Anon! I HATE these piggies!&quot; she yells over the whipping wind.
&gt;You check the tubes of you shotgun and opt for a solid slug shot.
&gt;The ATV slows to a halt and you both dismount then head into the brush.
&gt;Akina leads the way, sniffing quietly and holding her pistol.
&gt;Quiet oinking fills the air as you step quietly through the dense African foliage.
&gt;Akina points and you follow her paw pads.
&gt;A Small group of feral pigs eat at some plants as you nod and level your shotgun.
&gt;Looks like male and female pig with a group of piglets.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll get the big adult male, you get the female&quot; you whisper.
&gt;&quot;3...2...1...&quot;
&gt;The shots ring out and the adult pigs fall down dead leaving the piglets scattering.
&gt;You smile and Akina bounces happily next to you.
&gt;&quot;We got &#039;em! Without the parents those piglets won&#039;t be a problem anymore!&quot; She says, jumping into your arms in a hug, knocking your shotgun out of your hands.
&gt;&quot;Thank you thank you Anon! No more Pig problems!&quot; 
&gt;You actually have to smile at her excitedness.
&gt;And the thought of Pork made your mouth water slightly.
&gt;As you and Akina approach the kills, you see they were eating some kind fruit but that doesn’t matter to you.
&gt;The male was about 40 lbs. and the female 30 lbs.
&gt;Hmmm must&#039;ve been juveniles.
&gt;&quot;What do we do with these now?&quot; Akina says with a frown, kicking the female pigs body lightly.
&gt;You bend over and grab the male’s hind legs.
&gt;&quot;How about I treat you to some American BBQ? You’re being such a good host after all&quot; you say with a smile.
&gt;Akina looks from you to the pig with a bit of concern.
&gt;&quot;Uhh....ok! Let’s tie this piggy up&quot; She says, dashing over to the ATV.
&gt;Thankfully she had a small length of rope, you assumed for tying down her termite containers.
&gt;The pig took up too much space on the ATV to also get the containers of termites, so you both decided to make a few trips.
&gt;&quot;OK so! You start getting the piggy ready for eating and I’ll get the termites we farmed up!&quot; Akina says happily.
&gt;She revs ATV and in a flash you’re both heading back to the House.
&gt;Her cheerful Squeaking barks make you smile as you trek back to her house.
&gt;When you arrive you pull the pig off the ATV, then she speeds off with a &quot;Be right back!&quot;
&gt;She has a table set up beside her warehouse with a few chairs where you decide to work.
&gt;You head inside and grab one of the knives you packed for this excursion into Africa.
&gt;Twirling the blade between your fingers, you step back out into the sun and are surprised to see the sun hovering just above the horizon.
&gt;How long had you and Akina been getting termites? You had lost track of time.
&gt;Either way, you get to butchering the pig as Akina drives back and begins putting the containers full of termites into her warehouse
&gt;She finishes far before you do and circles you as you cut up the pig carefully.
&gt;&quot;What ya doing, how does that part work?!&quot; she asks like a small hyperactive child.
&gt;Its was actually quite cute to see someone so interested in something so mundane. 
&gt;So you explain what you’re doing as you pull out the innards and drain the blood.
&gt;Akina takes a big interest in the innards.
&gt;&quot;Gimme those! I can use them to farm up some maggots! I don’t eat them but people will pay big money for them!&quot; She say grabbing a large plastic bucket.
&gt;You shudder at the thought of eating maggots but oblige, placing the gore into it. 
&gt;She then takes a piece of fine mesh and places it over the top of it. 
&gt;&quot;The flies won’t be able to get to the meat so they will lay their eggs on the mesh! We can set this bucket out tomorrow&quot; she says happily, placing the bucket in her warehouse.
&gt;Whatever makes her happy.
&gt;With the pig butchered, you set about making a fire-pit. Luckily there is plenty of dry wood around from Akina&#039;s termites
&gt;Before long you have a small bonfire and you place a metal grate over the blaze, held up but a few pieces of metal.
&gt;As you place a few cutlets of the meat onto the grate, Akina is peeking around your back sniffing cautiously.
&gt;&quot;Mmmm it smells good Anon... Lemme get some sides!&quot;
&gt;Your pint sized host runs into her house, leaving you to tend to the meat.
&gt;After about 20 minutes she reappears carrying a plate of Locusts.
&gt;&quot;I Made Cajun Locust fries! They should go good with this piggy!&quot; she say excitedly, shoving the plate into your face.
&gt;yep, those are Locusts.
&gt;You carefully and delicately push the plate away from your face.
&gt;&quot;Well uh... Thanks, those look....&quot; 
&gt;You look at her smiling face and see her eyes so excited that you can&#039;t bring yourself to really say what you think.
&gt;&quot;They look good Akina&quot; you finally say.
&gt;Your hostess bounces happily causing her breasts to jiggle then lets out a happy squeaking bark.
&gt;&quot;YAY! I’m so excited!&quot; She says happily dancing around you and the fire.
&gt;You smile as you go inside and feel a bit of relief from the AC as you grab 2 plates for the food.
&gt;When you step back out into the fading sunlight, Akina is waiting eagerly, her Green eyes watching your movements and reflecting the firelight.
&gt;You pull off a piece of the meat onto a plate and give it to her earning a high pitched howl of excitement, then grab yourself a piece.
&gt;You sit at the table and she scoots her chair next to yours then slides the plate of locusts to you.
&gt;&quot;Come on Anon! Try them, I&#039;m trying your American BBQ&quot; She says before taking a bite out of the pork to emphasize the point.
&gt;She then gives you a happy smile and pokes the plate of locusts a little closer to you.
&gt;&quot;Tryyyyyy it&quot; She whispers at you with a big smile before biting into her cut of pig.
&gt;You sigh, then pick one up and look at it.
&gt;It was covered in the Cajun spice from the US...
&gt;As well she was trying the food you made so might as well...Right?
&gt;You bite into it and chew quickly.
&gt;Honestly it only tastes like old bay seasoning and chicken, albeit more crunchy.
&gt;You eat the rest of the locust and look at Akina, who beams at you.
&gt;&quot;It’s good eh!?&quot; she says wiggling in her seat happily and scooting closer to you.
&gt;&quot;It’s not bad&quot; you say with a smile.
&gt;That wasn’t even a lie, you had eaten worse during your military service.
&gt;The both of you eat and watch the sun set.
&gt;It&#039;s actually one of the more peaceful and calming evenings you’ve had in a while.
&gt;Fresh air, a light breeze, good company.
&gt;You finish eating and so does Akina, who rubs her stomach happily.
&gt;&quot;MMMM that was tasty Anon! Can you put the rest of the piggy in the fridge in the warehouse?&quot; she asks.
&gt;You nod and grab the remaining uncooked pieces of meat and carry them into the warehouse.
&gt;A quick look around and you see a fridge tucked away in the corner.
&gt;Pulling it open reveals several types of bugs and what appears to be earthworms.
&gt;You aren&#039;t even surprised.
&gt;You carefully stash the meat in her fridge then go back out to Akina, who is bouncing on her footpaws waiting for you.
&gt;As soon as you’re within reach, she grabs your hand in her paw and pulls you along.
&gt;&quot;Come come come! We gotta get clean then go to bed! We have another long day tomorrow!&quot; she says dragging you into the house.
&gt;The cool air is almost a shock to your system as you step inside.
&gt;But you don’t have time to think about that as Akina pulls you into the bathroom.
&gt;&quot;Shower time!&quot; she says happily.
&gt;Before you can even react, she begins tugging her shirt off.
&gt;&quot;Whoa whoa whoa Akina Wait!&quot; you say shielding your eyes.
&gt;&quot;Hmm? What’s wrong Anon&quot; you hear her say.
&gt;&quot;Shouldn&#039;t we shower separately? This isn’t a normal thing people do together&quot; you say, feeling your face turning red.
&gt;You hear impatient claws tapping her floor tiles.
&gt;&quot;We need to save water AND it’s ok because we&#039;re friends!&quot; She says tugging on your arm.
&gt;You let her pull your arm away and see her looking up at you.
&gt;&quot;We are friends right?&quot; she pleads, looking up at you with her green eyes.
&gt;Hope fills them as she looks at you with a small smile.
&gt;It should be illegal to be this cute.
&gt;You just can&#039;t say no to that smile and those big green eyes.
&gt;&quot;Yes...we&#039;re friends Akina&quot;
&gt;She wraps her arms around you and poofs up her Mohawk.
&gt;&quot;I knew it! It’s ok then! Besides I could use your help washing my back and tail!&quot; she says before she continues stripping.
&gt;You sigh and begin pulling your clothes off.
&gt;Occasionally you take a peek at Akina, admiring her body.
&gt;Well-toned Muscles under her fur wear easily visible and her wide hips were breathtaking.
&gt;She peeks over at you and smiles.
&gt;&quot;Good you&#039;re ready for a shower! Gimme your clothes I’ll put them in the washer while YOU get the shower ready!&quot; she says snatching up her own clothes.
&gt;You do as directed and give her your clothes then watch as she pushes open the bathroom door and disappears from view.
&gt;Well might as well get a shower started.
&gt;Turning on the water, you place under the bath faucet and test the warmth.
&gt;Carefully you adjust it so that it’s a temperature to your liking. 
&gt;Akina reappears in the bathroom and smiles.
&gt;&quot;Guests first!&quot; she says gesturing to the shower.
&gt;You try not to look at her body as you get in.
&gt;Try not look at those shapely breasts, try not to stare as her wide hips.
&gt;You step into the water and let it roll over your skin for a moment before you move aside for Akina.
&gt;She steps into the warm water and a lets her fur soak and the dirt from the day wash away.
&gt;With the water soaking her fur, you really can see that she is extremely fit.
&gt;Huh, guess running an insect ranch alone will do that.
&gt;&quot;Don’t just stand there Mister! Help with my tail and my back!&quot; Akina says, pressing a bottle of Mr.Worldwides Anthro shampoo into your hands.
&gt;Well alright then.
&gt;You add a liberal amount into your palms and start with back and scrub it gently, digging your fingers through her soft fur.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s so nice to have company! I hate being out here alone...&quot; Akina says as she lathers up her mane.
&gt;You nod, even though she can’t see it and continue helping her clean her back, you have to bend down a bit to fully get her tail though due to her height.
&gt;After a little bit she turns around and puts her hands on her wide hips.
&gt;&quot;Hmpf how rude of me! I should have cleaned you first! Turn around mister!”
&gt;You do immediately, noting her head was just the right height for...
&gt;NO! Don&#039;t think like that! She&#039;s your guide!
&gt;You feel her nipples against your lower back and tiny paws begin rubbing your back, spreading suds all over.
&gt;Quickly, you busy yourself with scrubbing your body and hair.
&gt;Sure its Anthro shampoo but whatever it&#039;ll get you clean.
&gt;&quot;This is fun Anon! Your skin is so smooth! I Like it&quot; Akina says rubbing a paw across your back.
&gt;You freeze for a moment and then relax.
&gt;Nothing sexual about that... just an Anthro who lives alone and probably hasn’t seen a human before.
&gt;Breathe deep, relax, She&#039;s just being friendly.
&gt;&quot;I’m all clean Akina, let’s get dry and head to bed&quot; you say, savoring the feeling of soaked fur against you.
&gt;You had grown up with Anthros, after all you were 2nd generation anonymous.
&gt;But you had never bothered getting to know them better.
&gt;Your mother had been transported to this world from the other one.
&gt;She found love with a local human.
&gt;And as such, you were used to having human parents but only dealing with humans.
&gt;Your mom even spent the extra money to send you to a human only private school.
&gt;Was she a speciest? You would never know because she died years ago.
&gt;But when you were young you never cared.
&gt;Human...Anthro... As long as you got along with them...who cared?
&gt;And right now did you care? 
&gt;Akina has her soaked fur pressed against you as you reach and turn off the water.
&gt;Calmly you grasp a towel and wrap the smol aardwolf up in it, helping her dry herself with a few pleasurable high pitched barks.
&gt;She snuggles against you as you help her dry off, your broad hand pressing the towel against her fur.
&gt;Better you handle her than she handles you.
&gt;Her cuteness is adorable.
&gt;Where all female Anthros this cute? 
&gt;You had never really been around them.
&gt;Sure a few Males during your military service but nothing like this.
&gt;Even when she lets outs few happy high pitched barks and her tail wags against you, you feel unease.
&gt;But when you feel her warm damp fur lean against you.
&gt;The pure trust of those bright green eyes and the snuggle she brings forwards as she wraps her damp arms around your waist.
&gt;&quot;Come on Anon, bed time&quot; She says, a happy smile crossing her muzzle.
&gt;In a way, you can&#039;t help but feel a bit happier as the eager aardwolf leads you to her bed and sets-up the mosquito-net up around you both.
&gt;It was like a shield to the outside world and all that matters inside was her.
&gt;But why would you feel this for her? You barely knew her.
&gt;Was it because she was different? A wildcard in the sea of random human woman? Or because she was the only one genuinely caring and friendly?
&gt;Wide green eyes, full of hope and promises of things to come.
&gt;&quot;Anon, I&#039;ve missed company, thank you&quot; she says with a yawn and snuggling against you.
&gt;She calmly nuzzles into your chest and begins breathing deep.
&gt;Is she snoring?
&gt;Did she really fall asleep that quick?
&gt;It felt odd to be snuggling a near total stranger while naked.
&gt;But it also felt warm and peaceful.
&gt;You close your eyes and listen to the wilderness outside and think about your job.
&gt;And curse when it was over and you would have to leave....
&gt;But that is a thought for another day.

Chapter 3: Heartburn

&gt;Days have gone by quickly as you helped Akina at her Ranch, checking on the termite mounds, seeing if they were ready for harvest or just leaving different types of woodchips around for flavoring.
&gt;Granted this isn&#039;t what you were here for, but it gave you something to do.
&gt;And the delivery day was today.
&gt;That is the day that the Shipping company would come and pick up Akina&#039;s bug shipments, as well as bring her food and drink from all over.
&gt;You had been surviving on MREs and the wild pig you killed, but GOD you needed a bit more.
&gt;Sure, you were occasionally eating the bugs Akina offered you, but there was a point where you had to draw a line.
&gt;Although, she was able to cook up locusts pretty good...
&gt;Right now though, you were in her little warehouse, helping her count up the boxes of termites, locusts and maggots.
&gt;Yea, the maggots were a bonus for her you guess.
&gt;The pig guts you weren&#039;t gonna eat attracted the flies she wanted, and she was able to harvest them.
&gt;Things don&#039;t gross you out easily, but the smell of rotting flesh was disgusting.
&gt;&quot;Anon! Help me move these boxes!&quot; Akina cries out to you, breaking your mental tangent.
&gt;You shake your head, brushing aside the random thoughts and rush over to her, finding her struggling under the weight of several boxes.
&gt;Quickly relieving her of several of the boxes, you shoot her a questioning look.
&gt;&quot;Why would you try to carry this much Akina?  I doubt you can carry it&quot; you say as you look at the labels.
&gt;She answers as you begin sorting out the boxes to their respective places.
&gt;&quot;Having you around is a blessing!  You&#039;re bigger than me, so I try to work harder to keep up&quot;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re gonna hurt yourself, don&#039;t push it Akina&quot; you say calmly, moving the boxes.
&gt;&quot;You might drop a box and release a bunch of these bugs&quot;
&gt;She smiles half hearted at you.
&gt;&quot;You promise it&#039;s ok that you&#039;re doing so much work?&quot; she says as she carries a box to the pallets for shipping.
&gt;You nod with a smile.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s the least I can do for you Akina, besides all if I didn&#039;t help, all I would do is sit around waiting for the peacekeepers&quot;
&gt;She gives you an uneasy smile and looks like shes about to say something, but is interrupted by the sound of high pitched beeping.
&gt;&quot;OH!  The trucks are here! Come on!&quot; She says, brushing aside your earlier conversation.
&gt;The roll-up door opens as Akina pulls it up with a chain, revealing a few 18 wheelers.
&gt;A few men, well, anthros, stand there waiting.
&gt;&quot;Hey Akina! What do you have for us today?&quot; An anteater anthro says happily, looking at her with a smile.
&gt;Figures.
&gt;&quot;Hi Jeff! I got Termites, Locusts and Maggots! You got stuff for me and my friend?&quot; She says happily, showing the boxes to the group of truckers.
&gt;&quot;Friend?&quot; one says, looking around.
&gt;They spot you and frown a bit.
&gt;Frown? Why?
&gt;The ant eater however is totally unfazed.
&gt;&quot;We got it for you!&quot; he says happily.
&gt;He disappears for a moment into the back of his truck and reappears with a pallet of various goods.
&gt;The pallet jack he has strains audibly as the pallet of various foods is presented to Akina.
&gt;&quot;Little bit strange seeing you order ground beef, but seeing as you have a helper now...well, I guess that&#039;s normal&quot;
&gt;Akina might not pick up on it but you do, there is a sense of disappointment in his words.
&gt;Even as you look at the other truckers, you see them disheartened.
&gt;...Why?
&gt;Happily, Akina bounces around the pallet looking at the foods and other things.
&gt;&quot;Perfect! Anon, help them load up all this stuff! I&#039;ll start getting all this stuff into the house!&quot; She says as she gets a pallet jack out of the corner of her warehouse.
&gt;You nod quickly and begin helping the truckers load up the bugs.
&gt;Honestly they probably could have managed just as well without you, but still they seemed to appreciate it.
&gt;But as you walk into the back of the truck with a few boxes, the anteater, Jeff you think his name was, attempts to corner you.
&gt;You push past him, eager to get to the food, but he calls out to you.
&gt;&quot;Hey now Human, I got a question for you&quot;
&gt;You sigh and turn back to him in annoyance.
&gt;&quot;What?&quot; you say with a slight frown.
&gt;&quot;Now why you here buddy? Best not be taking advantage of lil&#039; Akina!&quot; he says frowning, well you can&#039;t really tell if he has a frown or not &quot;She&#039;s our lil&#039; girl and we aim to keep her happy&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m here on business, that&#039;s all&quot; you say, turning and walking away.
&gt;&quot;Yea well, you best take good care of her while you&#039;re here!&quot; he calls after you.
&gt;You think of the Pistol Akina always has strapped to her ample hip.
&gt;Yea, she really needed you to take care of her.
&gt;But with that you leave the truckers to do their thing, not like this was your job anyway.
&gt;You head inside and find Akina happily storing food in her fridge.
&gt;&quot;Anon! I didn&#039;t think you would be done so quick! look at all these meats and stuff! Do you really need to eat this much?&quot; she says holding a package of bacon.
&gt;You nod and begin helping put the food away.
&gt;&quot;They didn&#039;t really need my help, and I like a variety of foods, tonight I&#039;ll make you a special meal for being so nice to me, and yes I eat this much&quot; you say as you store some beef jerky on the upper shelves of her cabinets.
&gt;Her ears perk and her Mohawk Poofs up adorably.
&gt;&quot;Awww I&#039;m just happy to have you around Anon! You don&#039;t need to make something special!&quot; she says happily before hugging you around the waist.
&gt;She&#039;s a hugger it turns out, every time you give her praise or well, do anything, you get a hug.
&gt;It was adorable, although it did get a bit awkward when you were showering with her.
&gt;Well, not awkward for her, more for you.
&gt;Feeling her furry breasts and nipples poking against your stomach was, invigorating, for lack of a better word.
&gt;You don&#039;t know if she was doing it on purpose, or if she was just so innocent and unaware that she just thought of you as a non-sexual object.
&gt;But something in you kept you smiling at her happy innocence.
&gt;You busy yourself with helping put the food away, as well as the extra goods.
&gt;Anthro shampoo, ant eggs, extra boxes for packaging and even some body wash for you.
&gt;Before long, one of the truckers pokes their head into the dwelling, looking for you and Akina.
&gt;He frowns when he sees you helping Akina.
&gt;A frown of disappointment? Like he expected you to be holding her down and raping her so he could come to her rescue.
&gt;You frown right back because fuck him.
&gt;Akina, of course is oblivious to him frowning at you, but that doesn&#039;t matter.
&gt;&quot;Hey Raffy! You guys all done?&quot; She says in her usual cheerful manner.
&gt;&quot;Raffy&quot; Frowns at you one last time, then looks at Akina with a warm smile.
&gt;&quot;Yep we&#039;re all done out here, and hey lil&#039; missy com&#039;ere a sec&quot; He says beckoning her to him.
&gt;She walks over to him in a cheerful bouncing step with a simple &quot;What&#039;s up?&quot;
&gt;He leans to her answer whispers something into her ear, which she recoils from.
&gt;&quot;What? Why WOULDN&#039;T I be safe with Anon? He&#039;s really cool and helpful! Who cares if he is a human?&quot;
&gt;The trucker looks at you, alarmed, like you would somehow pull out a machete and chop his head off.
&gt;Instead, you give a sigh and look at him in disbelief.
&gt;Akina continues berating the trucker.
&gt;&quot;Anon is helpful and good company and has helped me so much! Don&#039;t you be mean to him!&quot; she squeak barks at the trucker, who looks genuinely alarmed that Akina would yell at him.
&gt;He nods furiously with a &quot;Sorry sorry Ms. Akina!  We&#039;ll be going!&quot; then scrambles out the door, leaving you alone with Akina once more.
&gt;She has an angry scowl painted on her muzzle as she looks out the window at the Offending trucker.
&gt;When at last the trucks drive off down the dirt driveway of Akina&#039;s ranch, she turns to you and gives a sad smile.
&gt;&quot;Sorry Anon... He asked if I would be safe here alone with you...Humans and Anthros don&#039;t quite get along very well in these parts&quot; Akina says, looking up at you.
&gt;You nod slowly and give her a warm smile.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s fine Akina, the warlords here have been stressing the relationships between Humans and anthros anyway, but that&#039;s why I&#039;m here&quot; you say, beckoning Akina into the kitchen once more.
&gt;She follows you with a slight skip and then wraps her arms around your waist as you grab a few ingredients and begins making dinner for the two of you.
&gt;While it is a bit of a hinderance to work with the tiny aardwolf attached to your side, there was no way you could complain about it
&gt;Why would you anway?
&gt;&quot;What&#039;re making Anon? I&#039;ve never had this stuff before&quot; she says from your side, looking at the ground beef you&#039;re forming into patties.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m making us some burgers, an Old American tradition, and I suppose a bit of a stereotype too&quot; you say as you hold out one of the patties to her.
&gt;She gives it a quick sniff and frowns before looking up at you.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s not a bug though&quot; she says, narrowing her eyes at you and poofing up her mohawk a bit.
&gt;&quot;You don&#039;t have to eat bugs all the time Akina, come on, you know what a burger is, they are really good&quot; you say as you lead the small aardwolf to the fridge.
&gt;You open it up and peer inside, seeking a few alcoholic beverages to ease the grip Akina has on your side.
&gt;Truthfully, you aren&#039;t looking forward to leaving your guide behind.
&gt;Yes, you wanted to leave Africa behind, who wouldn&#039;t? AIDS, malaria, botflies, and just shitty people in general.
&gt;Seriously who would want to stay in a place where they thought white people were evil wizards?
&gt;Even if you weren&#039;t white, black or any mix of those, who couldn&#039;t see that this place was a mess.
&gt;but you didn&#039;t want to leave Akina to deal with any of those problems, she deserved better.
&gt;Well, Akina didn&#039;t see the problems, but you suspect that just because she was so engrossed in her bugs.
&gt;Honestly, she had close to no hobbies besides working on her ranch.
&gt;While you had to admire her dedication to her work, it was also quite sad.
&gt;all this land, all this friendliness, and it was wasted on bugs.
&gt;You almost frown as you grab 2 beers from her fridge and pop that caps off them.
&gt;&quot;Special treat Akina! Beer from Germany! The good stuff!&quot; you say with a smile, giving a bottle of dark beer to Akina.
&gt;She parts from you, letting you go from her tight grip and grab the beer with both paws, only to stare at it with uncertainty.
&gt;&quot;I just uh... drink it?&quot; she says, looking at you as you take a deep swig from your bottle.
&gt;You can&#039;t help but chuckle at that innocence.
&gt;&quot;Yes, you just drink it Akina, its good&quot; you say before taking a quick sip from her bottle to show its safe for her to drink.
&gt;Her eyes light up and she grabs the bottle and starts chugging it quickly, holding the bottle between her tiny paws.
&gt;After about 20 second, she sets the empty bottle down and gives a content sigh.
&gt;Dam she just put just about every college frat boy to shame.
&gt;&quot;Ooo that WAS good! Gimme!&quot; she says happily, before grabbing your bottle and beginning to drink deeply from it.
&gt;You don&#039;t even try to keep it from her as you click on some music with your phone. Sure, the internet was slow, but it still allowed for some music streaming.
&gt;She was cute, gripping to bottle that looked a little too big for her tiny paws, yet giving you some relief from the constant clinging from the tiny aardwolf.
&gt;You take the momentary release from her to grab a few slices of cheese and another beer for yourself.
&gt;&quot;Good huh?&quot; you say as Akina puts down the glass bottle that was formerly yours with a satisfied &quot;Ahhhh&quot;
&gt;She poofs up her mohawk and gives you a quick frantic nod.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s SO good! I&#039;ve never had beer or alcohol before!&quot;
&gt;You can&#039;t say you&#039;re totally surprised at that statement, after all she probably never went to college, never had that experience of freedom from her parents.
&gt;To you it looked like she left her parent&#039;s house, only to quickly start up this ranch.
&gt;You sip from your new beer, keeping it up on a shelf away from her tiny grabby paws, pondering it all.
&gt;Eventually your own curiosity takes hold.
&gt;&quot;Say Akina, you&#039;ve lived here and supplied bugs for the world, but have you seen anywhere else in the world?&quot; You ask as you turn on her stove, watching the electric coils start to glow red underneath a frying pan.
&gt;She grabs herself another bottle and drinks deep before answering; her mohawk fully poofed up as she answers you.
&gt;&quot;No... No...Just here, my parents said no one else would care about us insectivores, so...I just did this instead&quot;
&gt;You frown as she talks, feeling a bit of sadness for her.
&gt;What was it like to grow up not knowing your own dreams and desires? Or rather, simply ignoring them.
&gt;Sure, there was the freedom of wondering &quot;what am I going to do in life&quot; but at the same time, what if that&#039;s not what you wanted to do?
&gt;You recall a seeing a show of a man who was an 8th generation hotel owner in Japan.
&gt;What if he never wanted to own that hotel?  What if he wanted to be a UFC fighter, or an author or a policeman? Instead he had to be what his family asked.
&gt;The pity you felt for him and by proxy for Akina, was unreal .
&gt;At that point your life is not your own, at least that&#039;s what you thought.
&gt;Yet here was Akina, small and very clingy, but happy regardless, albeit lonely.
&gt;You could feel that loneliness in her when she snuggled against you at night, Clinging to you like you were going to disappear in a puff of smoke, and when she tried her hardest to always be in physical contact with you throughout the day.
&gt;Even worse was the thought of leaving her behind when this job was done; you had suspected that she joined the peacekeepers and offered up her home as a guide simply to have some company.
&gt;But for now, you push those thoughts out of your head as you cook a burger for the tiny, eagerly waiting aardworlf.
&gt;With one paw grabbing your waist and the other holding a beer bottle, she watches intently as you cook for you, occasionally sniffing the air.
&gt;&quot;It... It smells good Anon, but I&#039;m not sure I wanna try it&quot; she says, looking up at you with a concerned frown.
&gt;&quot;Tell you what Akina, you try this, and I&#039;ll do anything you ask ok? Any bug you want me to try, or dig up a new termite mound, just trust me ok?&quot; you say, looking down at her as you flip the burgers calmly.
&gt;Her green eyes light up as she looks up at you.
&gt;&quot;Anything?!&quot; she says with a bit more excitement than you anticipated, in fact it caused you a bit of concern with how she answered.
&gt;But she wouldn&#039;t ask the impossible right? She understood there were somethings you just couldn&#039;t do.
&gt;You hoped she understood that when you agreed.
&quot;Anything Akina, just eat up with me and let’s enjoy our time together&quot; you say as you tend to the food.
&gt;She nods happily and sips her beer, all while wrapped around you.
&gt;Her mohawk stays poofed up as she sips her drink and watches you cook.
&gt;Occasionally you see her nostrils flare up as she sniffs the air happily, interested in what you&#039;re doing and what you&#039;re making.
&gt;Before long, you finished the burgers for the both of you and the patties slide off the frying pan onto a plate in front of your tiny hostess.
&gt;Sure, you could have barbecued them for her, but this was a new enough thing for her to eat, so having just a basic burger was, in your mind, the best choice.
&gt;Plus, it was hot as fuck outside.
&gt;&quot;Alright Akina, dinner is served&quot; you say with a smile as she eyes the platter you have set out.
&gt;It&#039;s nothing special really, burgers, buns and some left-over bacon from those boars.
&gt;Akina doesn&#039;t eat vegetables, so it was no use trying to convince her to try some, but the spread you have set out in front of her has captured her interest and her tiny sniffing nose.
&gt;&quot;It....It smells good Anon! Is this what America is like?&quot; she says, preparing a smaller burger for herself; you had made different sized burgers, some for you, some for her.
&gt;You nod as you prepare a burger for yourself, noting how Akina still sniffs the food with a bit of apprehension.
&gt;&quot;America is uh... like anywhere else, despite the ravings otherwise, people just want to be happy&quot; you say with small smile
&gt;She looks up at you, torn away from her burger to focus on you.
&gt;&quot;Even you? What would make you happy Anon?&quot; she says as she separates from you to pick up her plate and go to her tiny kitchen table
&gt;This question gives you pause.
&gt;You always knew the &quot;normal&quot; lifestyle of your generation wouldn&#039;t make you happy.
&gt;Go to school, get a job you hate, get married and have some kids you don&#039;t even like.
&gt;Why? Because society said so?
&gt;Nah.
&gt;You joined the military to skip that, then the peacekeepers to avoid it even more.
&gt;Akina didn&#039;t need to know that though.
&gt;You nod slowly &quot;all I want, is to do what I like&quot; you say with a smile.
&gt;Sure, there was no real feeling to that smile, but she didn&#039;t need to know that.
&gt;&quot;Me too Anon&quot; she says before looking at the burger on her plate.
&gt;All of her previous enthusiasm fades away as she looks at the burger.
&gt;&quot;Are... are you sure it&#039;s ok to eat?&quot; she says as she pokes the buns with her eyes narrowed, like the burger would attack her.
&gt;You nod and look around, noting a bag of pretzel sticks she ordered for herself as a snack.
&gt;You pull open the bag despite Akina&#039;s little outburst of &quot;Hey!&quot;
&gt;Calmly, you grab a few pretzel sticks and shove them into her burger to make tiny pretzel legs, making the burger look like some strange insect.
&gt;&quot;Viola, it&#039;s a bug&quot; you say with an exaggrated flourish of your hand.
&gt;She scrunches her nose at you in a silent laugh as you roll up the pretzel bag and set it aside.
&gt;&quot;Fine! I&#039;ll munch it but! BUT! I&#039;m making Cajun locusts for a side&quot; She says letting go of you to get some food from her fridge.
&gt;Her tiny frame moves nimbly, going from her fridge to one of her cupboards as she cradles a tupperware container of locusts.
&gt;You watch as her hips sway and her body moves her along.
&gt;Sure, she&#039;s small, but her body was amazing, it would put Aphrodite to shame; despite her tiny frame, Akina&#039;s wide hips always leave you awestruck.
&gt;Any other guy would love her body.
&gt;But you aren&#039;t there for her, you had a job to do here in this sunburnt continent.
&gt;Although other thoughts about your tiny aardwolf guide sometimes distracted you from that.
&gt;You found yourself gazing at her tiny wondrous body as she dug through a termite mound to check on the queen.
&gt;And often in the mornings, she would be pressed against you, one of her short legs wrapped around yours, words didn&#039;t describe the feeling.
&gt;At first it was awkward, sleeping in the same bed as a tiny woman.
&gt;But now it was a welcome feeling, one of...something... but it was something good.
&gt;You watch as Akina happily prepares the Cajun locusts, humming along with the music playing while swishing her tail side to side with the beat, all while sipping her beer. 
&gt;Adorable to say the least.
&gt;She places a baking sheet of locusts covered in some spice blend you don&#039;t know in her oven before looking down at her clothes.
&gt;She was wearing her usual, a black shirt and khaki shorts, which were both a bit dirty from moving boxes and being out in the dusty savannah.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m gonna change into something more comfy!&quot; she says finally, looking up at you with a determined look.
&gt;Quickly, the small canine dashes out of the kitchen, leaving you to sit down and listen to the music playing while you slowly eat your burger and savor your beer.
&gt;&quot;Make sure the locusts don&#039;t burn&quot; you hear her call out.
&gt;How were you supposed to know when locusts burn? the smell?
&gt;You shake off that and eat slowly, thinking about Akina, the trucker and the job you had to do.
&gt;What would these warlords be like? How receptive would they be to your peace talks?
&gt;All things that made this job dangerous.
&gt;If they got into an all-out brawl while you were there, what would you do? Run? Fight?
&gt;Should you bring Akina? She was your guide, but what if there was fighting?
&gt;Sure, she carried that pistol and could use it...but it takes a certain mindset to use a gun against a person.
&gt;It takes thinking of them not as a person, but as something else.
&gt;A threat, an insurgent, a thing; doesn&#039;t matter what you think of them as you aim and pull the trigger.
&gt;Could she get into the headspace? Were you willing to put her in that situation?
&gt;Those thoughts about Akina are broken by the small Aardwolf herself as she pounces from around the corner into your lap.
&gt;&quot;YAY! Best Chair!&quot; she cries happily, snuggling against you.
&gt;You look down seeing the bright green eyes looking at you happily as she not-so-subtly grabs your bottle of beer in her tiny paws.
&gt;She&#039;s wearing one of your t-shirts, a few sizes too big for her, yet being ample coverage for her tiny body.
&gt;A smile crosses your face and she sips from the bottle, rocking side to side with the beat of the music while she waits for the locusts to finish their cooking.
&gt;Sure, she stole your beer (again), but you don&#039;t mind as you smile at her, feeling her soft tail swish against you.
&gt;In fact, now that you think about it all, you needed the company from her as well.
&gt;You joined the peacekeepers right out of the military, determined to no longer be a soldier but a man to bring peace, not war.
&gt;But in your determination to save the world from itself, you forgot about yourself.
&gt;Sure, you had been in relationships, but they feel by the wayside as you pursued your dreams.
&gt;In the end, you were a man who was filled with success in his dreams, but empty in terms of everything else.
&gt;No family, not any that counted anymore anyway, not wife or even girlfriend.
&gt;Just you going to remote locations to try to broker peace amongst people who didn&#039;t want it, but want nothing more than their own goals fulfilled and the &quot;enemy&quot; left with nothing.
&gt;To your chagrin, most of these peace talks ended in more war, as both side of whatever conflict thought their enemy would give infinity while they gave an inch.
&gt;The oven timer beeps suddenly, letting both you and Akina know her &quot;fries&quot; are done.
&gt;She slides out of your lap, which lifts your shirt up slightly revealing she has no panties on underneath it.
&gt;Out of instinct, you look away.
&gt;Sure, you had seen her naked but still, it&#039;s impolite to stare, and this was different.
&gt;Yet her tail keeps the shirt lifted a bit, letting you see her lightly furred slit and ass.
&gt;It was impossible not to look in that split second, and you can almost hear Akina&#039;s sly smile as she bends over to pull her fries out of the oven.
&gt;&quot;What’s wrong Anon? Something you saw?&quot; she says coyly.
&gt;Why the sudden shift in dynamics?
&gt;&quot;Nothing Akina&quot; you say still looking elsewhere.
&gt;Your burger! Focus on that! Not the tiny seductive woman in front of you.
&gt;&quot;Oh ok!&quot; she says as you hear a baking sheet hit her stove and a weight against your lap.
&gt;Akina has once more sat in your lap and it is looking up at you, her tail hiking up your shirt that was draped around her.
&gt;She grabs her burger from her plate and begins eating it.
&gt;Her tail brushes against you as she grinds side to side with the beat of the music.
&gt;Her tiny body snuggles against you as she eats, no longer complaining about how different the burger is from her usual food.
&gt;You sigh contently and attempt to get your beer back from her, only to have her grab it up in her paws and drink the rest of it before giving you a happy smile.
&gt;&quot;This food is SO good Anon! is this what all American food is like?&quot; she says, spinning around and straddling you.
&gt;You feel her lower lips spread slightly against your thigh and she shivers slightly.
&gt;blood rushes to your face and you try to avoid eye contact with her, and she leans forwards, pressing her breasts against you.
&gt;&quot;Uh Yea it’s all good&quot; you say looking away.
&gt;&quot;What’s Wrong Anon? you&#039;re blushing&quot; she says with a knowing smile.
&gt;This little Mohawk cheeto.
&gt;&quot;it’s just you&#039;re being awfully seductive tonight Akina, I&#039;m not used to you doing stuff like this” you says, favoring being direct over coy.
&gt;you look at her and she gives a smile, before burying her head in our neck.
&gt;&quot;Oohhhh Anon, you&#039;re so nice and such good company, can you leave me with a treat at least?&quot; She says nuzzling into your neck with her muzzle.
&gt;Her words are accompanied by slight grinding and wrapping her legs around you.
&gt;How do you react to this? Reject her advance? Accept it? Delay it?
&gt;Delay!
&gt;While sure Akina was a great host and sexy as hell, cold you bring yourself to do anything with her, knowing you had to leave?
&gt;No...
&gt;&quot;Akina, you just aren&#039;t thinking straight from the beer, let’s get you to bed&quot; you say calmly, scooping up the tiny aardwolf in your arms.
&gt;She gives a slight giggle as you carry her to her bed.
&gt;&quot;Oooh my hero! So virtuous!&quot; she says as you lower her into her bed.
&gt;With those words, she wraps her arms around your neck and her legs around your waist.
&gt;&quot;But ready for me to take him&quot; she says, locking her ankles behind your back.
&gt;You struggle in vain to get her off you, until you hear a soft whisper from her.
&gt;&quot;Please Anon, I need this, I just want to feel loved...&quot;
&gt;You feel your heart break a little from those words.
&gt;&quot;Akina, tomorrow if you still feel the same when you wake up, then its ok&quot; you say calmly, arguing against your rising erection.
&gt;Yes, she was sexy; Yes, she was fun; Yes, you wanted her; and even if she cried rape, here it wouldn&#039;t matter.
&gt;But you cared about this tiny woman too much to do this to her.
&gt;The walk to the bedroom is quick as you carry her.
&gt;You feel her nuzzle into you, her paws feeling your skin under your shirt and her tail swishing side to side.
&gt;&quot;Promise?&quot; she says worriedly.
&gt;&quot;Promise&quot; you say calmly.
&gt;&quot;Ok then&quot;
&gt;With that you lay next to her, causing her legs to slowly unwrap from around you and to just having one leg over your calf as she begins to snore softly.
&gt;&quot;Maybe she&#039;ll forget about this&quot; a part of your brain says softly.
&gt;&quot;Hopefully she won&#039;t&quot; says another part more loudly.
&gt;As you lay next to her, you see your laptop blaze to life on the bedside table.
&gt;&quot;In 2 days, you will meet the local warlords Nasa and Kub, at this location&quot;a message says, showing a map with a highlighted spot.
&gt;You frown as you look at it, then look to the small snoring aardwolf.
&gt;How long these negotiations went determined how long you got to stay with Akina.
&gt;Could you draw them out longer to stay with her? you&#039;re sure you could.
&gt;A sudden realization hits you as you lay in the bed looking at Akina.
&gt;You were willing to extend a war to stay here with her? why? 
&gt;Maybe it was because you were slightly buzzed from the beer.
&gt;You chalk it up to that and shut the laptop, then snuggle into Akina, pulling her body against yours and earning you a content sigh.
&gt;Do you want to leave? Yes. Leave this continent and this sunburnt world.
&gt;Do you want to leave her?
&gt;.... No.
&gt;Her soft snores and the feeling of her fur against you are the last things you feel.
&gt;Besides a small bit in you, that hurts in your heart.
&gt;A bit telling you not to leave
&gt;No... Just a bit telling you not to leave her.

Chapter 4: Stay with Me

&gt;Sunlight pours through the window, making you angrily squint your eyes as you wake up.
&gt;So much for waking up peacefully.
&gt;An odd weight is on your chest and pelvis as you blink your eyes slowly then rub the sleep away from your eyes.
&gt;Too hot!
&gt;Why are you so hot? 
&gt;Also, what is this uncomfortable weight on you?
&gt;Sure, Akina likes to sleep snuggled up but this was more than that.
&gt;You throw the covers to the side and see Akina.
&gt;Her face is buried in your crotch, her knees are on either side of your chest and her tail is raised, showing her glistening wet pussy and quivering asshole.
&gt;&quot;Ooo you’re finally awake! I was about to start without you&quot; she says happily, her tail swishing side to side furiously.
&gt;What.
&gt;Your mind flickers back to the night before.
&gt;She was serious? She really wanted you like that?
&gt;&quot;A-Akina?&quot; you call out only to have her tail stop wagging.
&gt;You feel tiny paws rubbing up and down your morning wood as she waves her ass side to side happily.
&gt;&quot;What do you meeeeea-&quot; 
&gt;Your words are cut off as you feel a warm tongue lick the head of your engorged cock.
&gt;&quot;Mmmm Just like I Imagined, I woke up and saw this monster and couldn’t let it go to waste&quot; she moans she her tiny paws pump up and down your shaft.
&gt;You can’t see her head past her warm wet pussy in your face, but you feel wetness envelope your manhood and a long wet tongue attempt to wrap around your shaft.
&gt;Do you fight this? Do you attempt to pry your hostess off? 
&gt;On one hand, she was there, and you would have to leave after all this, on the other hand you have a woman totally willing to do this to you.
&gt;Might as well join in.
&gt;Her glistening pussy is a bit too far from your head to lick, but the perfect distance for you to finger.
&gt;You wrap your arms around her thighs and carefully rub 2 fingers up and down her wet slit, taking careful pause at her clit, to run in small circles, earning muffled moans.
&gt;Her tongue wraps itself around your engorged cock and wiggles side to side, pressing her breasts against your pelvis and waving her pussy in your face, just out of your tongues reach.
&gt;Cheeky little aardwolf.
&gt;She gasps against your cock, her tiny paws tightening their hold of you as you push fingers into her.
&gt;&quot;N-No fair, I wanted to get just YOU off and taste you&quot; she moans softly.
&gt;You grasp the base of her tail with one hand and continue fingering her with the other.
&gt;&quot;You&#039;ve been teasing me since I got here Akina, this is not a chance I’m going to pass up&quot; you say as you rub your thumb against her clit.
&gt;&quot;Then try THIS out big boy&quot; she moans before you feel a warmness envelope your shaft, and tiny paws cupping at your balls.
&gt;Her long tongue, made for licking up ants, coils and writhes around your member making you gasp from the sensation.
&gt;You feel her muzzle press down, taking in your whole member, yet not able to push past a certain point as you feel her throat clamping down on the head of you cock.
&gt;She gags a few times, trying to push past her limit only to pull her head up and cough.
&gt;&quot;Mmmm Anon I can&#039;t get you all in my mouth&quot; she moans sadly before she takes your head back into her mouth and sucks earnestly.
&gt;You pull her tail gently and curl your fingers inside her, rubbing against her Small g-spot and earning more muffled moans around your shaft.
&gt;You feel our own limit approaching as her tongue slides up and down your shaft.
&gt;But you weren’t going to get off without making her cum first.
&gt;You feel her throat once again clamping down on the head of your cock and tighten a few times as she attempts to pull you in further.
&gt;Calmly, you release the base of her tail and place your hand on the back of her head and force it down earning a surprised &quot;MMMF!&quot;
&gt;She doesn’t struggle against it as you feel her mouth and throat clamps down and her tongue wiggle against you, eager to milk you for all you can give her.
&gt;Meanwhile, you keep your fingers pressed deep inside her wet pussy, rubbing her g-spot and her clit, earning a shuddering orgasm and stifled moans.
&gt;Her legs buckle, and her full weight hits your stomach and pelvis, yet you don’t relent, drawing small figure 8&#039;s with her clit.
&gt;Her moans reverberate through your cock as she moans from her orgasm, yet she holds you deep in her throat.
&gt;The shudders in her legs subside and she resumes moving her head up and down, licking and sucking your cock.
&gt;But now it’s your turn to climax.
&gt;You unload all the pent-up stress from her grinding on you in the shower and the naked snuggles, all of it into her throat as you press the back of her head down. 
&gt;Her long tongue laps at your member as you spurt.
&gt;You slump down into the bed in a content sigh as she continues to suck and lick at your member, trying hard to get every last drop.
&gt;So many sensations from her and her long sticky tongue.
&gt;&quot;H-h-oly fuck Akina. S-stop!&quot; you choke out as she continues sucking your sensitive member.
&gt;For a moment she stops, raising her head and releasing your cock with a small wet &quot;pop&quot;.
&gt;&quot;Nope, I’ve been DYING for this since you got here, no way am I letting you go!&quot; she moans before forcing your cock back into her mouth.
&gt;A few long licks and the feel of her tiny paws rubbing your shaft are too much and you do the only thing you can think to do.
&gt;You physically pick her up and spin her around, so she is facing you.
&gt;&quot;Aww&quot; she whines as you spin her.
&gt;You set her down on you, her breasts press against your bare chest and she looks at you with her dazzling green eyes.
&gt;&quot;What was that about Akina? I’m all for getting my dick sucked but really?&quot; you ask calmly, running your fingers through her flopped over Mohawk.
&gt;&quot;I saw the Message from the peacekeepers, I hoped I would have more time for this&quot; she says, nuzzling into your neck. 
&gt;&quot;More time for what?&quot; you ask as you run your fingers through her soft fur.
&gt;&quot;To convince you to stay with me&quot; she says guiltily, like a dog who has been caught eating its treats.
&gt;Honestly you had seen something like this coming, something to try to convince you to stay here with her.
&gt;It was tempting honestly.
&gt;A Smol woman who wanted you, land away from everyone, everything you wanted delivered so you never had to leave.
&gt;But it was in Africa! The &quot;Space of AIDS&quot; and Ebola!
&gt;Other than being with Akina there was no plus side.
&gt;You would rather a small space in the US Midwest, tending to a ranch there.
&gt;Here, you didn’t worry about the large animals.
&gt;You worried about the people; the Anthros who hated humans, that would find you here with an Anthro, torture you and rape her till she was dead.
&gt;Or the humans that hated Anthros who would kill her and rape YOU till you were dead.
&gt;Because AFRICA!
&gt;But here with her you were secluded and away from everything.
&gt;Maybe you could stay here with her.
&gt;In the meantime, you run your fingers through her Mohawk, earning happy small yips from her.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll think about it Akina, but understand it’s a big life choice&quot; you say with complete honesty.
&gt;Leaving behind your life in the US would be a huge choice, sure this country didn’t even regulate immigrants (because who would wanna move here) but also you would need to end the lease on your apartment, leave the peacekeepers, Etc.
&gt;A ton to do for someone who you’ve known less than a month.
&gt;But then again you do miss the rains down in Africa....
&gt;She lets out a sad little &quot;Hmpf&quot; but snuggles into your neck regardless.
&gt;&quot;You’re the only person who doesn’t see me as some child, and you&#039;re just so nice&quot; she says, her Mohawk poofing up and brushing your chin.
&gt;Heh you would never get used to that you guess.
&gt;&quot;And youre nice too Akina&quot; you say Absentmindedly as you continue you to pet her.
&gt;&quot;We have so much to do today, so many chores I don&#039;t wanna do&quot; She sighs unhappily.
&gt;&quot;Come on then you little Cheeto, let’s get ready for the day and knock those chores out, plus we have to meet the warlords tomorrow&quot; you say as you give her one last pet and slide out of her bed and the mosquito netting.
&gt;As you start getting ready to turn to see Akina still in bed, still naked and looking at you, and her ears folded against her head and a sad look on her face.
&gt;&quot;T-tomorrow? Already?&quot; she whimpers softly, looking at you.
&gt;You nod as you pull on a pair of pants.
&gt;&quot;Yea tomorrow, and this is just the first meeting, sometimes these negotiations can take months, so don’t worry, I’m not going anywhere for a while&quot; you say calmly.
&gt;She lets out a small sigh of relief &quot;More time to convince you to stay then! But for now! We have to tend to the Termites!&quot; 
&gt;She happily bounds out of her bed and like a small fuzzy whirlwind gets ready, throwing on her usual outfit.
&gt;&quot;Come on! let’s eat and get going!&quot; she says bounding out of the bedroom.
&gt;Her enthusiasm is amazing and a bit tiring. 
&gt;As you follow her, you notice her hips swaying a bit more than usual.
&gt;Was she shaking them more? Or were you just not noticing it? You also notice thin line of fabric running over her shapely hip bones.
&gt;Her underwear? What was it they called that? A whale tail? Was she seriously wearing a thong? And how did you not notice that?!
&gt;You tear your eyes away and busy yourself in the fridge, preparing breakfast.
&gt;No need for anything fancy, Rice and a few eggs with garlic powder.
&gt;You learned a few things abroad and it was a great meal that was easy to prepare.
&gt;2 eggs, 2 cups of rice and a bit of soy sauce and garlic powder; good for an on the go person like yourself and easy to make.
&gt;Akina has toast with Ant eggs mixed in the butter.
&gt;You eat together, with her basically latched onto your arm.
&gt;Through the day of giving different types of woodchips to the various termite mounds, she barely lets you go.
&gt;Every time you looked at her, you could basically see little hearts in her eyes and tiny happy yips constantly.
&gt;It was extremely cute although a bit distracting.
&gt;The day flew by, you and her, working, snuggling and her hugging you constantly.
&gt;Affection beyond anything you’ve ever had with any of your previous relationships, with humans or Anthros.
&gt;Akina&#039;s unbridled want of contact was both amazing and sad.
&gt;How lonely had she been through the years.
&gt;You had read up that wild Aardwolves have tiny packs they forage with, and yet here was Akina, the lone little forager for everyone else.
&gt;Because of that, you didn’t push her away; not that you would have anyway.
&gt;Instead you would wrap and arm around her earning quiet little &quot;A-hmm A-Hmm A-hmm a-ahmms&quot; of happiness.
&gt;The day begins drawing to an end as you help her finish up the daily list of things needed to be done.
&gt;Feed the termites, check the perimeter, scare off or shoot any while hogs.
&gt;Luckily (or unlucky?) there are no boars for you to shoot and then eat.
&gt;Time jumped quickly to you making dinner with Akina, her arms wrapped around you as you prepared an old favorite of pizza, half pepperoni and half termite and chrysalis of some butterfly you don’t recognize.
&gt;&quot;OOOO it smells good!&quot; Akina said excitedly as you pulled the concoction out of the oven.
&gt;Bugs on pizza... At least it was better than pineapple...
&gt;As you pull it out and check it, she’s wrapped around your waist in a happy hug.
&gt;&quot;I’ve never had pizza before! Is it good?!&quot; she says, sniffing the hot dough.
&gt;You have to put your hand between her nose and the hot pan to keep her from burning her nose on the hot metal.
&gt;&quot;It should be very good, although I’ve never made pizza with bug on it before&quot; you say calmly, checking the underside of the crust to see if it is done enough.
&gt;Satisfied with the crispiness of the crust you sit down, and immediately have Akina in your lap snuggled against you.
&gt;&quot;Anon, I know you have a life back in the US, but here... we could have enough other and a life of peace&quot; she says, leaning back against your chest.
&gt;&quot;I know Akina it’s just... I’m here got fix a WAR, a literal War between 2 factions, that doesn’t exactly say Peace&quot; you say calmly, putting your arms around her.
&gt;She wiggled slightly, loosening your grip before turning around to straddle you.
&gt;&quot;Once we fix that we have all the peace in the world, no bills, no lack of food, just...US&quot; she says with a sad smile.
&gt;She was right of course. If you solved this warlord problem, the only thing you would have to worry about is lack of demand for insects to eat.
&gt;And god dam, Asia never lowered that demand.
&gt;&quot;Let’s see how the warlords react Akina, I’m sure if they see a Human AND an Anthro as negotiators they would be more willing to listen, but they still might not want to listen&quot; You say, thinking about the other failed attempts at peace you had been on.
&gt;It was always like that one muse songs.
&gt;&quot;You always give an inch, while I am giving infinity&quot;
&gt;Neither side wanted to give, neither truly wanted peace; but both wanted to go back to their people and say &quot;I tried but they rejected it&quot; to rally their troops further.
&gt;You were sure that was what would happen this time.
&gt;But if you didn&#039;t succeed the peacekeepers would either just send you out again, or would put you at a desk job.
&gt;You smile and look down at Akina, whose tail wags happily between your knees.
&gt;&quot;Just think about it Anon, you’re fun to have around!&quot; she says finally, nuzzling into your chest.
&gt;You smile and rub her back gently feeling her soft fur beneath her shirt.
&gt;&quot;Mmmm! One sec! Lemme change outta this!&quot; She says suddenly, bolting out of your lap and out of the kitchen.
&gt;This again?
&gt;Well whatever, might as well cut up the pizza up into slices.
&gt;Akina doesn’t own a pizza slicer (go figure), so you opt for a regular knife, carefully cutting through the warm dough.
&gt;You don’t want to be eating Pepperoni only to have a nice big chunk of butterfly pupae.
&gt;&quot;Readyyyy!&quot; comes a happy voice and your hit by a small fuzzy missile.
&gt;It nearly knocks the wind out of you, but you look down to see Akina latched onto your side once more, wearing one of your t-shirts again.
&gt;One of your old band T-shirt with the words &quot;StexKnok&quot;, but it looks much cuter on her than it ever did you.
&gt;&quot;OK Anon! Let’s try this pizza!&quot; the small aardwolf says happily, looking over the pizza and sniffing it earnestly.
&gt;You grab 2 plates and hand her one, earning a small reprieve from the death grip.
&gt;She gets 2 slices of her pizza and waits for you to sit down before bouncing into your lap once more.
&gt;&quot;MMMMMM Smells goooood Anon!&quot; she praises happily, sniffing deep.
&gt;You feel her scooch slightly back more into your lap, pressing the fabric from her thong into you gently, letting you know it was still there under the loose-fitting t-shirt.
&gt;Ignoring it, you pick up a slice of pizza and are about to dig in when her voice stops you.
&gt;&quot;Oh uh.... Anon, one more thing&quot; you hear.
&gt;you turn back to look at her with an exacerbated look, but instead feel her muzzles meet your lips in a gentle kiss.
&gt;Her paw rubs the side of your face gently and she pulls away.
&gt;&quot;I feel I did everything in reverse, Kiss first then blowjob! Not the other way around! I goofed it up!&quot; she says sadly.
&gt;You hug her close.
&gt;&quot;Its ok Akina, I enjoyed it either way&quot; You say softly into her ear.
&gt;Small happy Yips are heard from her as she snuggles into you.
&gt;&quot;Let’s Eat and get to Bed Akina, we have a long day ahead of us tomorrow&quot; you say as you wrap one arm around her and use your free hand to grab some of your homemade pizza.
&gt;&quot;Mmm! It’s goopy and good!&quot; Akina says happily, poofing her Mohawk and wiggling in your lap.
&gt;You can see the cheese on her piece of pizza stretching as she bites into and tries to pull away.
&gt;Cute to say the least.
&gt;You bite into your own piece and think about the upcoming day.
&gt;Meet 2 dangerous African warlords, establish peace between them and leave.
&gt;Sounds simple right?
&gt;If only it was that simple.
&gt;You eat in silence, pondering tomorrow.
&gt;While yes, choosing to stay with Akina was a huge life choice; meeting the warlords might be life or death.
&gt;If either felt slighted, insulted or just outright didn&#039;t like you, you were dead; and by proxy Akina was as well.
&gt;You needed to play the Anthro warlord, saying you weren&#039;t strictly rooting for the humans, that’s why you had Akina there.
&gt;And Akina would need to play the humans as your opposite.
&gt;Somehow you needed to convince both sides that you were out for both of them and not biased.
&gt;The only way to really do that would be to not be either human or Anthro, but of course that was impossible.
&gt;As such you would need Akina there to help talk to the Anthro warlord.
&gt;&quot;ANON!&quot; you hear her yip, breaking you out of your thoughts.
&gt;&quot;I know you’re worried about tomorrow, we will handle it then, besides it’s like you said; &quot; it usually takes more than one day&quot;&quot; Akina says happily.
&gt;Was she happy that it would take more than one day? If that was the case it would mean more lives lost.
&gt;But something told you she wasn’t thinking of that, she was thinking of more days with you...And you were thinking about more days with her.
&gt;&quot;I am thinking about tomorrow, but still, we have work to do tomorrow Akina, they could kill us for not liking us, or kill me and rape you or any combination of those” You say frowning.
&gt;the Small canine snuggles deeper into your lap.
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry about that Anon, worry about snuggles and the night after&quot; She says with a happy smile, her Mohawk tickling your chin .
&gt;You nod calmly and stand, wrapping your arms around her so she won’t fall and her tiny footpaws won’t hit the ground.
&gt;&quot;Hey!&quot; she chimes as you carry her to the bedroom.
&gt;&quot;If I’m going to negotiate, I need sleep, and you get to be my snuggle bud&quot; you say calmly, laying in the bed slowly with one arm wrapped around her.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not a... wait, you wanna snuggle to go to sleep?&quot; She half protests before realizing what you are saying &quot;I want to be your snuggle bud&quot; she softly yips, turning around your arms to wrap her arms around you.
&gt;You carry her to the bedroom while her Mohawk tickles your chin, and she hugs you. 
&gt;It was honestly flattering how much she was enamored with you after such a short time being together.
&gt;But you couldn’t lie and say her company wasn’t appreciated.
&gt;Back in the US, you didn&#039;t have much in terms of a relationship.
&gt;The military left you broken, unable to serve anymore but with the odd aloofness that came with being deployed too many times and never really readjusting.
&gt;Because of that you were a person that spoke his mind clearly and honestly, without fear of repercussion or other people feelings.
&gt;Why care about that?
&gt;And because of your bluntness relationships didn’t last.
&gt;Girls would ask &quot;do I look bad in this?&quot; and you would answer honestly.
&gt;&quot;Yes, you look awful&quot; or &quot;you look like an overdue kangaroo&quot; were answers that stuck out to you.
&gt;As such, you were mostly left for a better, more caring guy who lied to them for the sake of vanity.
&gt;Akina hadn&#039;t cared much about your opinion when it came to stuff like that.
&gt;She usually just stated what she wanted and told you to do it.
&gt;Wearing your T-shirts wasn’t something she asked to do, she just...did it.
&gt;That independence was refreshing, her not needing the positive enforcement and simply doing what she wanted when she wanted to.
&gt;It was beautiful to you.
&gt;how could it not be?
&gt;There were so many women who couldn&#039;t cook, clean, or even use a washing machine nowadays.
&gt;You recall in the military barracks, a few girls who were so spoiled by their parents, they didn’t know how to use a washing machine; and as such, they had used dish soap to clean their clothing.
&gt;The result was a flood of bubbles and froth.
&gt;Akina wasn&#039;t like that though.
&gt;She was able to do so much on her own and still keep a smile on her face.
&gt;It was refreshing and she stood out so much out of everyone you had met, which was ironic considering her height.
&gt;But as she snuggles you and wraps her legs around your waist, you don’t care.
&gt;Under the mosquito nets and under the covers, you and her lay together.
&gt;Your hands rubbing her fur and finding each little spot that brings her comfort.
&gt;Her laying on top of you and nuzzling softly into your chest.
&gt;Paradise could be a word for it.
&gt;It’s not long before you and her fall asleep, forgetting about what is to come tomorrow.

Chapter 5: Some Things Fall Apart

&gt;You wake to the break of daylight, Akina sleeps nuzzled against your chest, with tiny humming snores.
&gt;With a bit of regret, you wish you could move without waking her, but you have places to be.
&gt;Time made fools of all men though, and you couldn&#039;t be late for this meeting.
&gt;It was the day to meet the warlords, Nasa and Kub, the anthro and human warlords respectively.
&gt;Getting there before them, setting up and greeting them before the set time was necessary. 
&gt;Gently, you rouse Akina from her sleep, although regretting having to do so.
&gt;&quot;Akina, come on little lady&quot; you say, gently shaking the tiny Aardwolf.
&gt;She barely opens her eyes, then wraps her arms around your neck, pulling you close and pressing her chest against yours.
&gt;&quot;Noooo, sleepy&quot; She whines sadly, still half asleep.
&gt;You sigh and hold her gently, petting and scratching the little place between her ears.
&gt;&quot;Come on, time to wake up&quot; you coo softly as her foot paws shake in uncontrollable happiness.
&gt;At last her eyes open and she looks to you with blurry half-asleep eyes.
&gt;&quot;Mornin &#039;non&quot; she says with a sleepy nuzzle, her Mohawk rubbing the bottom of your chin.
&gt;You scritch a bit more and hold her close.
&gt;&quot;Morning, ready for this today?&quot; you ask calmly.
&gt;&quot;If I say no, does it matter?&quot; she says indeterminately, scanning your face with her great beautiful eyes.
&gt;You sigh.
&gt;&quot;No, it doesn&#039;t Akina, but I feel better asking, I can always just leave you here th-&quot; 
&gt;A tiny balled fist of a paw hits your chest, barely hard enough to make you gasp, in fact it&#039;s more out of surprise than anything.
&gt;&quot;I will not be left behind Mister!&quot; she huffs angrily, a determined look on her face.
&gt;You smile and give more scritches, having recovered from the shock of the tiny punch.
&gt;&quot;I know, but I just want you safe&quot; you say dreamily, looking at the ceiling.
&gt;You feel Akina snuggle closer to you, her fur snuggling to your bare chest, the soft tips of her breasts rubbing you and sending waves of want through you.
&gt;But now was not the time for that, stay focused.
&gt;&quot;I’m gonna shower, wanna get breakfast ready for us? No bugs for me though, just eggs and cheese?&quot; you grunt, as you sit up, holding Akina gently and rubbing her soft fur.
&gt;She snuggles into you for a moment, then sighs and casts the mosquito net aside.
&gt;&quot;Right! Eggs and cheese! But you said nothing about ant eggs&quot;
&gt;Before you and try to redefine what you want, the tiny aardwolf has run off, naked and unafraid.
&gt;Goddammit, she would be a good lawyer.
&gt;Regardless, at this point food was food.
&gt;You step into the bathroom and step into a cold shower, not wanting to waste warm water that could be saved for Akina, but also trying to ward off any perverted thoughts about her.
&gt;The cool water is a contrast to the hot air of Africa.
&gt;No, the water is not cool; it&#039;s freezing, literally you have NO warm water turned on.
&gt;It saps the breath from you, and instantly gets rid of ANY arousal.
&gt;Fuck, it barely left you able to breathe, left alone to fantasize Akina&#039;s wonderful body.
&gt;Focus.
&gt;Cold showers were something you were used to; the military had gotten you used to them; FOBs rarely had warm water.
&gt;You clean yourself quickly, the cold water oppressive and stifling.
&gt;Cold showers might be a bastard, but they wake you up quick and set you on edge.
&gt;You get out and dry yourself quickly, then get dressed, the hot air helping minimize your shivers.
&gt;It only takes a minute or two for you to no longer feel the chills from the water.
&gt;Feeling the shivers subside, you walk out of the bedroom to find Akina in her tiny kitchen, wearing nothing more than an apron as she makes food for the two of you.
&gt;&quot;Hey Handsome! Your food is on the table! sans ant eggs&quot; she says as she notices you walk in.
&gt;A steaming plate of eggs and cheese lay on the table, lovingly prepared by Akina, who is humming to herself as she prepares food for herself.
&gt;You sit down and wait patiently for Akina to finish preparing her meal before you dig in yourself.
&gt;After all it&#039;s more polite to wait for the host.
&gt;Plus, you get a view of Akina&#039;s thicc body as she prepares her meal happily.
&gt;It was a view you weren&#039;t willing to pass up.
&gt;She smiles happily as she sets her plate of ant eggs, cheese and ant eggs next to you plate.
&gt;&quot;Such a gentleman and here I thought you were just going to look at my ass&quot; she says with a smile.
&gt;She gives you a mischievous smile as she says that.
&gt;&quot;I WAS looking at your ass Akina&quot; you say before shoveling some eggs into your mouth.
&gt;&quot;I Know&quot; She hums happily before digging in herself.
&gt;The two of you eat hungrily, knowing this might be the last meal you have for a while.
&gt;These peace talks usually take a while, and it&#039;s only until both groups agree to a food break that they actually stop for food.
&gt;It&#039;s an odd battle of wills usually, try to go longer than the other even though both groups are suffering.
&gt;You had even been in a moderation where one side soiled themselves trying not to be the first to ask for a break.
&gt;You shudder involuntarily thinking about it, it wasn&#039;t a pretty sight or smell.
&gt;Oddly enough, Akina finishes her meal first; you chalk it up to smaller portions.
&gt;&quot;Lemme get ready&quot; she says, all eagerness gone, replaced by a solemn even tone.
&gt;That told you she knew how dangerous this would be.
&gt;As you wait for her to get ready, you busy yourself for the upcoming meeting.
&gt;First off was firearms.
&gt;The SRM 1216 Shotgun has 4 barrels, and they rotate like an old school phone.
&gt;Fire, rotate, fire, rotate. 
&gt;Because of that they hold 16 shots and are very legal in every state. 
&gt;Even Commiefornia.
&gt;As such, you ready your gun and a large combat knife which you had used during your military service.
&gt;This would not be safe; it would not be pretty.
&gt;You wanted to leave Akina here, let her farm up her bugs for others while you dealt with the warlords.
&gt;It was better to leave the tiny insectivore in this place, this middle ground neither side wanted to claim.
&gt;After all most humans can&#039;t use land filled with termites, and at the same time, neither could most anthros.
&gt;Plus, they just don&#039;t want to deal it them.
&gt;Akina Catered to a VERY small group of anthros and an even smaller group of humans.
&gt;Most humans regarded insects as vermin and NOT food, even though they were better in terms of protein and land use than most forms of livestock.
&gt;But the tiny aardwolf had a ton of determination to stay with you throughout the peace talks.
&gt;You regard her getting her handgun ready, noting its model; a 1911? She’s got a quality gun there.
&gt;And surprisingly, she also pulls out a sawed-off double barrel shotgun, which she affixes to her back happily.
&gt;&quot;a shotgun? Can you handle that much recoil?&quot; you scoff at her.
&gt;She gives you a sour glance as she pulls a few shells out of her gun safe and stuffs them into her khaki pockets.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s a bit tough, but I figure we need firepower for this&quot; she says earnestly
&gt;From the look of the shotgun, it&#039;s only been fired a few times.
&gt;Plus, she&#039;s right, you could be walking into a firefight.
&gt;&quot;Makes sense Akina, let’s go&quot; you say with a calm smile.
&gt;Truthfully, you’re screaming inside, this was dangerous and you were ok going alone to put just yourself in harm’s way.
&gt;Bringing Akina meant A. keep track of her, B. Make sure she&#039;s safe. And C. Don’t let her accidentally spark a war.
&gt;Heading out, you feel the still rising sun already begin pounding heat against the arid landscape.
&gt;Fuck this place is hot.
&gt;You get into your land rover and watch as Akina literally climbs in, grumbling to herself about &quot;tall human vehicles&quot;
&gt;For comfort, she pulls the shotgun off her back and leans it, barrel down, against her seat on the floor while she buckles in.
&gt;Satisfied, you start the vehicle and head off, letting the BHA provided GPS guide you to the neutral location for these negotiations.
&gt;The lives of so many hang in the balance of these negotiations, so many anthros and so many humans.
&gt;All you want is for them to live in peace.
&gt;The ride goes by in silence, but you feel a slight tension from Akina, usually bubbly and happy, but now quiet and solemn while staring out a window.
&gt;The calm before the storm, heading someplace that was full of possible danger.
&gt;You place a hand on Akina&#039;s thigh and give a gently squeeze, earning a surprised &quot;YIP&quot; from her
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s ok Akina, I’ll keep you safe no matter what&quot; you say with a smile, staring at the &quot;road&quot; as you drive
&gt;You can feel her scowl 
&gt;&quot;I want us BOTH safe! Don&#039;t go playing Mr. Hero! I can take care of myself!&quot; She squeaked; her voice much higher than usual.
&gt;Nerves you suppose. 
&gt;There is a difference between living on the outskirt of proverbial lion’s den and climbing down into it.
&gt;You can see Akina&#039;s Mohawk poofed, and can see through her clothing the hackles on her back raised in some ancient defensive posture.
&gt;Sure, anthros were evolved and logical now, but getting the hairs on the back on one&#039;s neck raised was universal it seems.
&gt;Seeing Akina so visibly concerned sets you on edge, fearing the worst... but after an hour of driving you reach the location for the talks, A Protected international park full of endangered species, do you calm down. 
&gt;The security into the area only let you pass with your weapons because you were with the Peacekeepers and the negotiators.
&gt;They assured you that any other group would be stripped on any weapons, regardless if it was guns, bows, swords, or spears.
&gt;You felt confident you could deal with the kinds of threats unarmed people had against guns.
&gt;Your GPS leads you DEEP into the reserve, to a hidden building made of Ivy, Overgrowth and half rotting wood.
&gt;The building looks like an odd camp lodge, oval in shape, but made of strong swamp wood to avoid the mold.
&gt;No power sources beyond an old generator attached to the electrical system.
&gt;You get out of the Rover and Akina follows suit, jumping down and sniffing the air pensively.
&gt;&quot;Anything?&quot; you ask, keeping your eyes down the barrel of your gun, prepared to shoot anything that moved.
&gt;&quot;Nothing, Just trees&quot; Akina answers finally.
&gt;Satisfied with the answer, you sling your shotgun to your back and tend to the generator.
&gt;Full fuel, in good condition; someone must have dropped it here because of the occasion.
&gt;After a little tinkering, you get it started and see lights turn on inside the lodge.
&gt;Nodding to yourself, you go to the door and open it, then hold it open for Akina.
&gt;The sight that greets you looks like the 2nd Jurassic park movie, or was it the 3rd?
&gt;Whatever, the place is overgrown and vines creep into every place, even over some of the ceiling light fixtures, casting odd shadows.
&gt;But the place would suffice.
&gt;A long oval table sits in the center of a large conference room; Chairs line all along it.
&gt;They are in mostly good condition, well better condition than you would have thought for furniture that sits in an abandoned game lodge.
&gt;You get your laptop, and plug it in, opening a voice chat with the peacekeepers servers for recording the entire negotiation process, as a local recording for the sake of redundancy.
&gt;You can hear other vehicles begin pulling up to the lodge, and the chatter of voices speaking in a language you don&#039;t recognize or understand.
&gt;Sounds like barks and yelps mixed from various sized dogs; must be Nasa and her group, err pack? Or was it a cackle like wild hyenas?
&gt;&quot;Doesn&#039;t matter&quot; you mumble to yourself as you set up an HD camera to document the whole process.
&gt;The sounds of claws tick-tacking along the hardwood floor of the game lodge becomes audible.
&gt;A moment later a score of various Anthros, mostly consisting of hyenas, enter the room you&#039;re in and you feel Akina shrink down next to you in fear.
&gt;You stay upright, head held high as they pour in, eyeing you with general disinterest and giving Akina a someone perturbed look.
&gt;They wear black modern military gear, dark green berets on their heads.
&gt;Akina&#039;s hackles and Mohawk poof up in nervousness, she looks at the towering figures and gives a quiet whimper.
&gt;The whimper is drowned out by heavy thudding footsteps, slow and rhythmic, like the footstep of the T-rex from Jurassic park.
&gt;Why does this day have to remind you of Jurassic park? Next thing you know someone is going to be saying &quot;Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should&quot;.
&gt;The maker of the footstep lumbers in, a huge Rhino anthro, standing at least 10-foot-tall, ducking slightly to get through the doorway, the horn scraping the low wooden frame.
&gt;Is this Nasa? Your reports said she was a Hyena, but they have been wrong before.
&gt;The rhino stomps its way over to you slowly, a look of annoyance on its face.
&gt;You wait to speak to it until it’s right in front of you, leering down.
&gt;&quot;Nasa I assume?&quot; you say, trying to sound confident in the face of this behemoth.
&gt;The rhino grunts then turns around, showing that he was actually carrying a backpack like contraption, carrying a figure in it.
&gt;The hyena on the Rhinos back was faintly beautiful, well built in terms of muscles and colors; however, that beauty looked like it had been beaten down continuously.
&gt;The toll of years of bloodshed.
&gt;But that wasn&#039;t the only toll, everything below her waist was gone leaving only her torso and arms for a body.
&gt;She smiles at you pleasantly.
&gt;&quot;Mr. Anon I presume?&quot; she asks in English with a Belgian accent.
&gt;You extend a hand to her.
&gt;&quot;Nasa?&quot; you probe, looking confused as you study her.
&gt;&quot;Yes, that&#039;s me. Not what you were expecting?&quot; she responds with a jovial laugh and a handshake.
&gt;&quot;No not really, sorry&quot; you say politely, pulling your hand back and setting it on Akina’s shoulder.
&gt;&quot;Landmine in 98, I’m afraid, but it helped me lose weight quick&quot; She says with a chuckle.
&gt;You only smile in response to her words before you introduce Akina.
&gt;&quot;And this is Akina, my co-negotiator&quot; you say motioning to the still poofed up Aardwolf.
&gt;Nasa peers down and smile, &quot;Ah an Aardwolf? How rare but makes sense to have a human and Anthro Negotiator, now if you allow me to get situated.&quot;
&gt;She taps the hulking rhino on the shoulder and he slowly and carefully begin removing the carrying harness, swinging Nasa to the front so his stubby fingers can take her under the arms and set her into a seat.
&gt;&quot;Very good&quot; She says once she’s set down, pulling out a pen and a notebook. 
&gt;She looks like she is about to address you further but her ears swivel suddenly and her nostrils flare.
&gt;A frown crosses her pretty face and you see several of the anthro skirt behind their leader.
&gt;&quot;They&#039;re here&quot; comes a scowling voice from Nasa, who looks outraged at whatever she was sensing.
&gt;Before long the smell reaches your Human nose and you nearly gag.
&gt;A stench like the mix of ammonia, bleach, and other heavy industrial chemicals hits your lungs like a hammer.
&gt;You&#039;re nearly to the point of retching when Nasa hands you a small vial of ointment.
&gt;&quot;Rub it under your nose, the Cariotis tribe cover themselves in chemicals to fuck without noses&quot; Nasa says sharply, putting a generous amount of clearish gel under her nose and seemingly breathe easier.
&gt;You note the other anthros doing the same, with one of the taller hyenas helping the Rhino.
&gt;Following their example, you apply some to Akina’s tiny nose and then some to yours.
&gt;Instantly the smell goes away, and the faint smell of cinnamon and mint fill your senses.
&gt;You look to Nasa in surprise, who winks at you coyly.
&gt;&quot;I know a few chemist friends from my schooling in Belgium Mr. Anon, they help me out&quot; she says with a smile.
&gt;You&#039;re about to answer her when you hear footsteps, not footsteps like shoes hitting the hardwood, but bare feet.
&gt;A head peers into the room, a human head of a black man, which looks around and then frowns
&gt;Without a room it disappears, and you hear shouting in some language that again, you don&#039;t recognize.
&gt;Then about 30 Humans, pour into the room, slapping their bare feet against the floor purposefully.
&gt;They wear nothing but tattered loincloths and have their entire bodies covered in crusty white paste, which you assume is the &quot;chemicals&quot; they used to hurt the anthros smell.
&gt;You eye them calmly, feeling secure in the shotgun on your bad and the tiny armed aardwolf at your side.
&gt;Through the group a humans comes a white male, much to your surprise.
&gt;He wears jeans and a red polo shirt and a lanky overly tall man follows behind him.
&gt;The white man meets you first, thrusting out a hand.
&gt;&quot;Hi there, Henrik Eriksson, call me Henry, Nice to meet you, I&#039;m the translator&quot; he says as you accept the handshake.
&gt;You blink a few times, &quot;translator? My files said the leader could speak English&quot; you ask in confusion.
&gt;Henry scratches his head nervously. &quot;Yeah&quot; he says before leaning towards you with a low whisper.
&gt;&quot;He refuses to speak in a language the &quot;Dogs&quot; speak&quot; he says using air quotes, and you swear you see Nasa give a smug chuckle.
&gt;You give a silent nod to Henry in acknowledgement then turn to the tall lanky man.
&gt;&quot;Nice to meet you, I am Anon, the negotiator&quot; you saw extending a hand to the man.
&gt;He, in turn, spits on the floor and says some kinda gobbledygook to Henry.
&gt;&quot;He says he will not shake hands with someone who keeps anthros as company&quot; Henry translates sheepishly, motioning to Akina.
&gt;Wonderful, this is all going smoothly already.
&gt;You sigh and sit down at the head of the oval table, and motion for everyone else to sit if they want.
&gt;Akina scoots into your lap, giving Kub a frown, Kub looked back with eyes burning full of hate.
&gt;&quot;We are co negotiators and we only have one chair&quot; you say pointedly, drawing the ire from Akina to you.
&gt;The black man frowns but says nothing.
&gt;&quot;Alright, Let&#039;s get these negotiation underway&quot; you say calmly and forcefully, &quot;First off, no interruptions while another party is talking, secondly, any attempts to assassinate or cause harm to an opposite party will be met with extreme prejudice, or in simpler terms, I&#039;ll kill you&quot; you assert, resting your hand on your shotgun.
&gt;&quot;Third, this is all being recorded and broadcast Live to the peacekeepers headquarters, so any treachery will be known and while the Peacekeepers might be peaceful, they have many friends who are not&quot; you continue, looking around the room, making eye contact with everyone you can.
&gt;&quot;My name is Anon and this is Akina, Let&#039;s Start with opening demands, Nasa since you were here first we will Start with you&quot; you say calmly to Nasa with a curt nod, which she returns.
&gt;&quot;We demand the immediate stop to All hostilities towards anthros, the stop of Pillaging Anthro owned agricultural areas, and for the  Cariotis to cease the consumption of Anthros&quot; Nasa glowers towards Kub, who stares with an almost amused look on his face.
&gt;You keep your face neutral in light of what you just heard, all reasonable demands, but that last part hit you like a ton of bricks being thrown in your face one by one.
&gt;&quot;Consumption of Anthros&quot;?
&gt;You turn to Nasa and give only the slightest of frowns; which she returns with a slight nod, and with that Nod Akina tries her hardest to shrink into your chest.
&gt;She should have stayed behind...but no time for that now.
&gt;&quot;Alright, what are your demands Kub?&quot; you say without missing a beat, looking at the man.
&gt;He spits on the floor again and scowls, sliding a piece of paper to Henry.
&gt;The white man picks up the paper and begins reading it aloud.
&gt;&quot;The removal of all anthros from this region, reparations to the families of those killed by anthros, and uh... Nasa&#039;s head on a platter&quot; Henry says with a disgusted scowl.
&gt;This time you don&#039;t hide your annoyance.
&gt;&quot;What are your realistic demands, there is no way to remove every anthro from this region, no way to PROVE what families deserve reparations and we don&#039;t trade lives&quot; you say with an incredulous look on your face, to which Kub Simply crosses his arms.
&gt;You spend the next 6 hours, attempting to get reasonable demands from Kub; while Nasa attempts to give a little, pulling out maps and charts to show which land they were willing to give for peace.
&gt;Kub refused to talk at all, simply shaking his head to everything.
&gt;In the end, Nasa slammed her paws onto the table and barked at the Human &quot;THIS IS WHY I CAN BACK HERE FROM BELGIUM, BECAUSE OF IDIOTS LIKE YOU&quot;
&gt;Kub Looked fearful for a moment, then regained his smug stone face, while his men rustled around him, making chiding war chants.
&gt;The anthros, while unarmed, were still more than a match for the humans in the room and were beginning to bustle, hackles raising and teeth bared.
&gt;Akina jumps onto the table from your lap between the two sides.
&gt;&quot;Enough! Both go your separate ways, with will attempt these negotiations on a different day!&quot; She squeak barks at the groups.
&gt;You stand up and unsling your shotgun as the human group looks like they were about to Attack Akina, then chamber a round of 12 gauge buckshot.
&gt;The distinct CLICK-CLACK of a shell entering the chamber makes the humans do a double take.
&gt;&quot;I suggest, both parties leave.&quot; you say calmly, indicating to doors on opposite sides of the room.
&gt;Seeing a shotgun in your hand really discouraged them from fighting, as they were unarmed.
&gt;Reluctantly though, both sides filter out until, only Nasa, the rhino Akina and you were in the room.
&gt;You begin packing up as the rhino gets Nasa into her harness.
&gt;&quot;I am Sorry Mister Anon, I thought that by calling you peacekeepers, we could Show Kub that we were serious for peace, but it seems they are not&quot; she says, her accent making a few words hard to understand.
&gt;You nod, &quot;we might get somewhere next week, let tempers fade on both sides, Kub was paying attention to your offers, I saw him looking at each; he might just be holding out to see how far you&#039;ll give though&quot;
&gt;Nasa&#039;s turn to nod &quot;maybe, stay safe Mr. Anon and Ms. Akina&quot; she says before patting the Rhino, who stomps out of the building.
&gt;Akina looks at you as you rub your eyes.
&gt;&quot;Do all negotiations go like that?&quot; She asks, snuggling next to you as you put the equipment away.
&gt;&quot;Just about; one side wants peace or neither do, problem is both sides need to want peace.&quot; you answer ruefully.
&gt;With a sigh you grab your bags and carry them outside, no sign of either group besides tire marks and footprints.
&gt;&quot;Hey Akina, can you shut off the generator while I load up the truck?&quot; you call out as you go to the land rover.
&gt;&quot;Mhm! One sec!&quot; she says happily before hurrying off.
&gt;You load up the land rover and place your guns in their racks.
&gt;&quot;Anon Catch&quot; you hear over your shoulder; you have just enough time to turn around to catch a tiny hurtling fuzzy body.
&gt;Akina flung herself at you, and the impact knocked you back into the Land rover.
&gt;&quot;Good catch! Let&#039;s get out of here&quot; She says with a happy squirm in your arms.
&gt;You set her down and she scurries quickly to the passenger side door and climbs in.
&gt;Getting in and starting the land rover, you speed out of the reservation, trying to leave that day behind.
&gt;Akina hums happily to a song on the radio until she sees you frowning.
&gt;&quot;Anon what&#039;s wrong?&quot; she asked, cocking her head to one side.
&gt;&quot;That negotiation almost went south REAL quick, and the whole &quot;Consumption of Anthos&quot; thing is just sick&quot; you say with a frown, looking straight ahead.
&gt;Out of the corner of your eye, you see Akina&#039;s ears droop a bit, but then perk back up.
&gt;&quot;OK I know what to do!&quot; she says with unexpected cheer. 
&gt;You see her begin unbuttoning her shirt as she looks at you with lust and longing in her eyes.
&gt;&quot;I know you had a bad day Anon&quot; she says, pulling her bra off and tossing it aside.
&gt;&quot;But I bet I can make this night a whole. Lot. Better.&quot; she says, emphasizing the last few words and pressing her breasts together.
&gt;You need no more encouragement, you floor it.
&gt;No cops here to stop you.
&gt;And nothing was going to stop what you and Akina were about to do.

Chapter 6: Dopamine

&gt;You speed down the dirt road While Akina is doing her best to let you drive while simultaneously trying to be all over you.
&gt;Tiny paws run up and down your chest, nimble pads undoing your belt and sliding it off.
&gt;Kisses up and down your neck with tiny happy &quot;A-hm&quot; noises fill the cab.
&gt;Breasts press against your side and her long tongue gently grazes your neck before she whispers &quot;Faster&quot;.
&gt;You floor it as she presses her body against yours, her large breasts squishing against you.
&gt;Her paws find their way to your pants button and zipper; and with deft, yet jerky movements undoes them both.
&gt;She shores herself up to your face, and presses her breasts into the side of your face.
&gt;Oh, how you wanted to squeeze those generous fleshy orbs, but you have to focus on driving.
&gt;You attempt to distract yourself from the tiny woman by reciting multiplication tables and long division.
&gt;That attempt is quickly shattered as Akina licks one of her paws then pushing it into your boxers, grabbing a hold of your shaft.
&gt;Slowly, agonizingly slowly, she works her paw up and down your shaft.
&gt;&quot;Ohhhh sooo big&quot; Akina whispers to herself, biting her lower lip.
&gt;She looks at you and pouts slightly.
&gt;&quot;I can&#039;t get it out of your boxers without you moving your pants though&quot;
&gt;Perhaps a little too eagerly, you use one hand to slide your pants down around your thighs.
&gt;&quot;A-hmmmm, Perfect~&quot; Akina cooes, Rubbing your shaft with a little more vigor.
&gt;Slowly, she slides down your body, keeping her breasts pressed against you for as long as possible until she&#039;s laying on her stomach across the seats, her mouth very conveniently near your member.
&gt;&quot;A-hmmm~ what should I doooo with this I wonder&quot; she teases, eyeing you mischievously while, a padded finger teasing the tip.
&gt;Sensations shoot through your body like electricity.
&gt;You try your best to keep a straight face, but your legs tense involuntarily as you answer.
&gt;&quot;Whatever you w-want I g-guess&quot;.
&gt;A warm long wetness wraps itself around your shaft, then slides off; leaving you to tense up more.
&gt;&quot;Whatever I want?&quot; Akina teases as she pulls that long wonderful tongue back into her mouth.
&gt;You shrug, very halfheartedly.
&gt;&quot;Y-yea, but the road is gonna get pretty bumpy it looks like&quot; you say, sobering a bit at your need to focus on the road.
&gt;Akina&#039;s green eyes light up dangerously.
&gt;&quot;Bummmpy you say?&quot; she responds, turning onto her back, exposing her gorgeous chest and body.
&gt;You don&#039;t care that you&#039;ve seen it since you got here, you will never get tired of seeing it.
&gt;Her paws cup her breasts softly for a moment, then slide down her body, her green eyes looking up at you from your lap.
&gt;Tiny pads hook into her khaki shorts and she shimmies out of them quickly, then tosses them aside.
&gt;&quot;A-Hmmm Anon~ let me borrow a hand&quot; she requests, reaching up to take your hand from the steering wheel.
&gt;&quot;Feel how excited you make me&quot; she moans, guiding your hand between her curvaceous thighs.
&gt;Wetness and heat envelope your fingers as she glides them into her body, shuddering from the feel of your fingers.
&gt;She slides your fingers out them to her mouth where she licks the wetness off them.
&gt;&quot;A-Hmmmm~ can I feel you in me please?&quot; Akina moans, her tongue between your fingers.
&gt;You swallow and nod, looking at the road and sneaking glances at the tiny sexy Aardwolf.
&gt;Rolling over onto her stomach, she gently crawls to your lap.
&gt;With a little bit of squirming to get into position while you keep driving, she gets between yous arms and into your lap.
&gt;Good thing she&#039;s such a bitty thing, otherwise this would be impossible.
&gt;At last, she sits partially in your lap, your shaft between her thighs.
&gt;&quot;Ready Anon?&quot; she whispers, just above the roar of the engine.
&gt;You place a hand on her hip and nod, keeping your eyes on the road but focusing on her.
&gt;Gently, she lifts her hips and positions your member against her wetness.
&gt;The sheer love and want coming from Akina is almost dizzying and she slides the tip back and forth along her wet lips.
&gt;&quot;S-slowly&quot; she moans softly,lowering herself onto you at a maddeningly slow pace.
&gt;Fate it seems had other plans though; or was it your mind making things speed up a bit.
&gt;Regardless, the range rover hits a bigger than average bump, pushing Akina up slightly then all the way down onto you.
&gt;Akina makes a Loud yelp in surprise as a tight wetness suddenly clentches around your manhood, and threatens to knock the breath right out of you.
&gt;You Feel Akina&#039;s Legs spasm hard as her tiny claws grip your legs.
&gt;You snap your mind away from the wonderful sensation in your loins to focus on her.
&gt;&quot;Are you ok Akina?&quot; ask, putting a hand under her chin and forcing her head up to look at you.
&gt;Her eyes aren&#039;t totally focused, but a smile of pleasure covers her Muzzle.
&gt;&quot;SO big...So fast...So goooood&quot; she moans, bringing one of her paws to rub your cheek.
&gt;Her eyes focus on you and she pulls your mouth to hers in an awkward kiss.
&gt;Another bump in the road bounces the SUV, forcing another deep thrust into Akina and earning an excited gasp from her.
&gt;The kiss breaks as Akina begins grinding her hips on yours.
&gt;Each bump in the road causes Akina to bounce up and down on you, sending all kinds of pleasure through your body.
&gt;The heat, the smell, the Want that practically oozed from Akinas lips with each gasp of pleasure make you speed up more, making the bumps more violent.
&gt;Which makes Akina&#039;s moans more seductive and hard to ignore.
&gt;At long last, you make the turn down her long driveway, speeding down it towards her house.
&gt;Akina notices the familiar landscape and she slowly slides side to side gently in your lap.
&gt;&quot;A-Hmm~ that was fast Anon, you must be realllll eager&quot; she teases,her long tongue flicking out to lick your neck gently.
&gt;The sensation sends shivers down your spine as you pull in front of her house.
&gt;Akina&#039;s grinding gets harder as she begins to stand and make your shaft slip out of her.
&gt;You have a better idea.
&gt;With a quick grab of her shapely hips you thrust upwards into her earning a surprised squeak.
&gt;Deftly, you kick your pants off then open the SUV door.
&gt;&quot;A-anon? what are you do-&quot; Akina starts to ask, only for you to thrust up into again while pulling her hips down to yours.
&gt;&quot;No way am I pulling out now&quot; you remark, putting your arms under her legs and sliding carefully out of the SUV.
&gt;Akina gasps and moans as you carry her, your elbows under the back of her knees.
&gt;You can grab your guns and clothes tomorrow, now is the time to focus on Akina&#039;s needs.
&gt;Akina&#039;s panting whines tell you that you made the right choice as her tiny paws grip your arms as you carry her to her front door.
&gt;&quot;Open it&quot; you command as you reach the front door.
&gt;Luckily she doesn&#039;t lock it, a habit she learned living with her for the past week.
&gt;The door swings open and you step through the portal into her house.
&gt;It&#039;s an odd contrast, you and Her as sexy as sexy can be in her little living room made for one.
&gt;With a gentle kick you shut the door behind you and carry Akina to the bedroom, pushing apart the mosquito nets.
&gt;&quot;W-wait!&quot; Akina cries out as you set her on the bed, ready to go at her doggy style.
&gt;You let go of her,careful not to bend anything too far.
&gt;Akina adjusts herself on the bed, making you pull out; but allowing her to lay on her back at the edge of the bed
&gt;Her legs are spread wide and you see her shimmering wetness in the african moonlight; her perky breasts pressed together between her upper arms.
&gt;&quot;I wanna see you while we do it&quot; she moans, a paw rubbing her wetness.
&gt;&quot;P-please?&quot;
&gt;You nod and slowly reposition yourself against her wetness.
&gt;&quot;D-do it&quot; Akina moans, her tiny paws rubbing your chest.
&gt;You push into her, feeling the heat but something more now.
&gt;Her silken embrace, folds of warm smoothness, pulsating and rubbing against your most delicate parts.
&gt;You gasp as she does from the sheer sensation of togetherness and she wraps her short legs around your waist as best she can
&gt;Two together, from opposite ends of the world connected in the most intimate of ways.
&gt;Her eyes are open wide and looking at you as you begin moving, pushing in and out of her.
&gt;your hands hold her ample hips as you move but also move her, making the bed springs squeak in protest.
&gt;Akina, with her freakish anthro strength pulls you down to her into a deep kiss.
&gt;Or did you let her pull you?
&gt;It doesn&#039;t matter as her long tongue meets yours in a duel of fates; fighting for a fake dominance yet trying to coil around each other.
&gt;You spread the fingers of your right hand wide and she meets it with her paw, intertwining them gently as you kiss her.
&gt;One hand still holding her curvaceous body, you thrust into Akina&#039;s tiny but oh so welcoming body.
&gt;Each push makes her silently gasp into your mouth as your manhood is enveloped by and indescribable pleasure.
&gt;Her folds wrap around you like warmed silk, delicately weaving around you.
&gt;Each of her wanting pants cause her body to constrict around you gently.
&gt;&quot;A-hmmmmm A-nonnnnn&quot; she moans happily, gently bucking her hips up to meet yours.
&gt;Slowly, you thrust into her tiny body, one hand gripping a glorious breast, the other holding her hips.
&gt;Akina paws rub your stomach and the lower parts of her chest, her tiny claws gently scratching you.
&gt;&quot;S-so Goooood&quot; Akina moans, her Green eyes fluttering as you continue pushing in and out of her embrace.
&gt;&quot;Want m-me to g-go faster?&quot; you stammer out, knowing the answer already.
&gt;&quot;A-Hmmm~ Pleassssse&quot; Akina responds in her adorable yip moans.
&gt;Quickly, you oblige and begin slowly speeding up your thrusts, making Akina&#039;s body quiver and cause her large breasts to bounce with each thrust.
&gt;You feel Akina&#039;s legs tighten around you at the same time her wetness does, followed by her gasping loudly.
&gt;&quot;O-ohh fuck Anon Keep going I&#039;m so close&quot; She gasps as you almost reach the peak of your speed.
&gt;No need for her to tell you that because you continue pressing into her with more speed.
&gt;&quot;A-Anon! I-I&#039;m CUUUUU-&quot; She screams, Her legs locking around you like a vice grip and her wetness spasming to tighten around you.
&gt;You keep going. savoring the feeling of her tiny body responding to your efforts.
&gt;But all good things need to come to an end; you limit is quickly approaching itself
&gt;&quot;A-Akina, I-I&#039;m gonna cum&quot; you grunt out.
&gt;Her green eyes lock on you and she lips her lips seductivly as she smooshes her large breasts together
&gt;&quot;A-Hmmm~ give it to me&quot; She moans longingly.
&gt;You can&#039;t pull out because of her legs, and wouldn&#039;t anyway.
&gt;Encouraged her words and sexy display; you thrust deep into her and release everything as you slump over her to kiss her.
&gt;Her folds seem to milk you as you tongue meets hers once again.
&gt;The two of you remain in this position for a subjective hour, which was more likely a minute or so.
&gt;You finally break the kiss and pant softly, looking into Akina beautiful eyes.
&gt;Akina Smiles pleasantly with a happy light to her.
&gt;&quot;Told you it could make it better&quot; She teases, wiggling her hips against yours, your member still inside her.
&gt;&quot;You can make it even better&quot; you tease, pushing against her wiggling
&gt;&quot;Oh? How?&quot; she muses,pushing her breasts against you.
&gt;&quot;Round 2&quot;


Chapter 7: Run
&gt;You wake up to the feeling of soft fur pressed against you and smile carelessly as you look down lightly.
&gt;Akina breathes quietly, laying on your chest with a smile.
&gt;How many times had you two gone at it last night? all you know is you both thoroughly enjoyed each other.
&gt;As much as you want to reminisce about last night and the fun you had; Nature called.
&gt;Slowly and ever so gently as to not wake Akina, you slide Akina off your chest and into the spot next to you.
&gt;She quickly snuggles up a bundle of blankets and sighs contently, still with a small smile on her muzzle.
&gt;You silently slide out of the mosquito net and head towards the bedroom’s bathroom.
&gt;Light shines through the windows as you pass them, it must be about sunrise based on the color of the light.
&gt;You relieve yourself and think about Akina&#039;s lovely body; maybe after breakfast you can have some more fun.
&gt;Taking a peek out of the bathroom to admire Akina as you wash your hands makes you smile as you see her.
&gt;But something else you see sends cold through your veins.
&gt;The time.
&gt;Akina&#039;s little alarm clock says it&#039;s only 4 am, FAR before sunrise.
&gt;Whatever sleep you had left saps out of your body as you rush to the window and push the light curtains out of the way.
&gt;Fire.
&gt;The land around Akina&#039;s little house was on fire, with tall humanoid silhouettes in front of the blaze.
&gt;&quot;AKINA GET UP!&quot; You yell to her urgently as you dash to your suitcase and begin pulling on your clothes
&gt;Akina slowly sits up, rubbing her eyes with tiny fists.
&gt;&quot;Huh? &#039;non what’s going on?&quot; she asks blearily before yawning; letting her long tongue loll out of her mouth.
&gt;You pull on your shirt hurriedly as you answer simply.
&gt;&quot;Your fields are on fire&quot;
&gt;Her eyes Immediately focus on you.
&gt;&quot;What?&quot;
&gt;&quot;The fields are on fire&quot;
&gt;Akina, still nude, dashes to the window to look out at the blaze.
&gt;A high-pitched whine is all you hear from her as she breaks from the window and begins getting dressed.
&gt;&quot;Who? Why?&quot; She almost squeaks, getting a shirt on.
&gt;&quot;I don’t know, let&#039;s get the guns and...&quot;
&gt;The guns...
&gt;You left them in the range rover last night during your escapades.
&gt;Sure, Akina had her little handgun in the safe but what would that do?
&gt;Whatever, no time, just go!
&gt;&quot;Let’s just get out of here Akina!&quot; you say as you grab her paw and run to the door.
&gt;&quot;We can&#039;t leave my home though! I need my bugs and stuff!&quot; Akina protests, tugging back against you.
&gt;You pull Akina to you and scoop her up as you begin to hear gunfire in the distance.
&gt;At the sound of gunshots Akina jumps slightly and grabs onto your tighter
&gt;&quot;This isn&#039;t a normal fire is it Anon?&quot; Akina asks Sadly as you carry her out of her house.
&gt;The sounds of men whooping can be heard as you get to the range rover.
&gt;You set Akina down and frown sadly at her as you pull the door open.
&gt;As you&#039;re about to get in, you hear a very familiar sound.
&gt;The sound of an RPG.
&gt;Instinct takes over; you pull Akina to you and dive towards the closest patch of soft grass
&gt;The RPG hits the engine of the SUV and the explosion flings it 3 yards away in a blazing heap of twisted metal.
&gt;Your ears ring as you check on Akina&#039;s little body.
&gt;She in turn stares at you, shock and fear in her eyes.
&gt;&quot;Anon a-are you Ok? you&#039;re on fire!&quot; she gasps, looking at your right arm.
&gt;You look over and see a little blaze of fire on your shoulder, quickly you roll off her and smother the fire.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m fine! Let&#039;s go!&quot; you call as you roll to your feet.
&gt;Akina is already on her feet as a second RPG hits her home; blasting part of the roof off.
&gt;&quot;MY HOME!&quot; Akina whines, staring at the now burning building, golden firelight reflecting off the tears in her green eyes.
&gt;&quot;We gotta go!&quot; you yell at her, as you run to the burning wreckage of the range rover.
&gt;You peer through the windows for anything to help and find Akina&#039;s little sawed off double barrel shotgun, and a metal ammo box.
&gt;The fire begins licking at you as you fish the box out.
&gt;A third RPG hits Akina&#039;s warehouse, and you watch as Akina&#039;s little ears flatten against her skull.
&gt;She stands, watching her home and her business burn.
&gt;Now isn&#039;t the time for mourning though.
&gt;&quot;COME ON!&quot; you scream to her over the sounds of men Whooping, this tears Akina from the sight and she runs to your side.
&gt;You can&#039;t see anyone against the backdrop of fire, so you do the next best thing
&gt;Run.
&gt;Akina, for her short stature is faster than she looks; keeping pace with you as you run away from the blaze.
&gt;&quot;W-what&#039;s the p-plan Anon?&quot; She gasps as you and her run down her dirt driveway.
&gt;&quot;Run&quot; you respond simply.
&gt;&quot;I-I gathered that much&quot; she pants, you can tell she isn&#039;t used to this.
&gt;Aardwolves are not made to run long distances.
&gt;But you hadn&#039;t really thought, much further ahead beyond running.
&gt;&quot;I...Don’t know. Where&#039;s the closest village?&quot; you answer, slowing your pace a little.
&gt;Akina slows her pace and stops, looking at you sadly.
&gt;&quot;30-40 miles?&quot; she whimpers, her ears folded tight to her head.
&gt;The sounds of gunfire and whooping grows closer and you frown.
&gt;Dammit, it must be Kub and his army, if it could be called that.
&gt;You look down at Akina, who looks up at you with fear in her eyes.
&gt;In one quick action you toss the ammo box away, then pull Akina into a kiss.
&gt;&quot;let&#039;s go, it&#039;s our only chance&quot; you say as you pull away.
&gt;She studies your face, fearful, then she gives a slight nod and sets her jaw firmly.
&gt;&quot;Ok!&quot; she says quickly, then the two of you go at a slow jog towards the main road, following Akina&#039;s winding driveway.
&gt;The whooping gets louder and louder and occasionally you hear a bullet ping the ground near you.
&gt;You could run faster than this, but that would mean leaving Akina behind to a fate you wouldn&#039;t wish on anyone.
&gt;The double barrel shotgun is loaded...If it came to it you know what fate you would rather have.
&gt;But still you head to the road.
&gt;The sounds of engines can now be heard, echoing off the dirt and making it hard to tell where it&#039;s coming from.
&gt;Arrows occasionally hit the ground near you and Akina as you run, letting you know they are closing on you.
&gt;Engines, whooping, gunshots and the hiss of arrows surround you And Akina, who is panting hard to keep up.
&gt;You see headlights streaking around, weaving patterns through Akina’s ranch.
&gt;The sounds of Vehicles crashing through Akina&#039;s termite mounds adds to the Din
&gt;More and more arrows rain around you, Akina&#039;s whimpering pants slowly start falling behind you.
&gt;Your luck runs out as Akina lets out a pained shriek behind you, causing you to skid on the dust.
&gt;Akina lays in the dirt, holding her left thigh, which has an arrow through it.
&gt;You rush to her as you hear a victory whoop from somewhere in the distance.
&gt;Tears are in Akina’s eyes as she looks from her leg, to you then to the fire.
&gt;&quot;G-give me the gun and go&quot; She squeaks out, trying to put on a brave face.
&gt;You shake your head at her &quot;Never, I won&#039;t leave you&quot; you reply somberly.
&gt;&quot;I can’t run! Save yourself!&quot; she cries out to you.
&gt;Instead, you grab the arrow and snap the tip off, then haul Akina onto your shoulders.
&gt;She hisses in pain but doesn&#039;t fight you as you settle her on your back in a fireman&#039;s carry, your right hand still holding the shotgun.
&gt;Adrenaline is one of nature&#039;s gifts to humanity, and right now your body is being pumped full of it.
&gt;You run, Akina&#039;s blood dripping down your side and her pained whimpers fueling you.
&gt;Flashbacks of the war fill you as your heels slam against the hardened dirt.
&gt;The sounds of whooping starts to grow further as you sprint.
&gt;You were not going to be prey that is hunted and killed, you are more than that.
&gt;If you had to you would fight then with the logs and rocks around you.
&gt;How many could you kill before they killed you?
&gt;They need to catch you first.
&gt;Your heart pumps battery acid and Akina&#039;s breathing is getting shallower as you run.
&gt;Turning your head, you see Akina&#039;s eyes closed in pain.
&gt;The sudden flash of light in front of you catches you completely off guard and blinding you. 
&gt;You Stagger to a halt and raise the shotgun at the offending headlights.
&gt;&quot;Oh thank god they&#039;re ok&quot; you hear Nasa sigh out in relief, the headlights die down and you see a Deuce and a-half truck in front of you.
&gt;The Rhino anthro that carried Nasa during your first meeting is holding the legless hyena in front of him this time.
&gt;&quot;Get IN! Get in! HURRY!&quot; Nasa hisses at you.
&gt;You gather yourself from the shock of meeting her here and rush to get into the bed of the truck
&gt;&quot;Help them! Get the aardwolf down from him!&quot; she barks commands to her underlings, who promptly remove Akina from your shoulders.
&gt;&quot;Set me down I need to look at her&quot;
&gt;The rhino gently sets Nasa down next to Akina as you pant hard on the bed of the truck.
&gt;You hear the engine roar and the sound of sand being thrown by tires.
&gt;Faintly you hear Akina get tended to by Nasa and her crew.
&gt;When at last, you catch your breath and your heart no longer feels like it&#039;s going to burst from your chest, you sit up and focus.
&gt;About half a dozen different Anthros surround you, armed with M16s.
&gt;None act aggressively towards you, but a few have their paw pads on the triggers of their guns.
&gt;Finally, you look and see Nasa gently wrapping Akina&#039;s thigh.
&gt;&quot;Is she ok?&quot; you croak, realizing how dry your throat is.
&gt;Nasa does an odd head bob to one of the anthros, who promptly gives you a canteen.
&gt;You drink greedily as Nasa smiles at you.
&gt;&quot;She will be fine, the arrow missed her arteries and bone; a painful wound, but not life threatening, we gave her a painkiller so she&#039;ll be out of it for a while.&quot;
&gt;You sigh in relief as the truck bounces on the same road you drove earlier. 
&gt;&quot;I assume it was Kub and his gang of lunatics? how did you know to come to us?&quot; you ask
&gt;Nasa gives a sad smile and nods.
&gt;&quot;They sent a message to us earlier, well they killed their translator and had his head on a spike near one of our borders&quot; She affirms with a bit of lamentation.
&gt;&quot;We just want peace here...&quot;
&gt;You nod and slide yourself so you&#039;re at Akina&#039;s side.
&gt;&quot;The peacekeepers will not take this transgression lightly, the Cariotis tribe gave their word they would not harm us or any other third parties during negotiations.&quot; you grunt as you gently rub Akina&#039;s muzzle.
&gt;&quot;What will they do? they are a peacekeeping organization&quot; Nasa asks, studying your face.
&gt;&quot;We are, but we also Employ certain groups in case a negotiation goes bad.&quot; you reply as Akina&#039;s eyes open, then swivel around panicked.
&gt;&quot;Easy Akina, Easy, we&#039;re safe&quot; you console her, smiling gently.
&gt;Her green eyes focus on you and small tears form.
&gt;&quot;We&#039;re ok?&quot; she asks as her paw reaches for your hand.
&gt;You take it and nod at her.
&gt;&quot;We&#039;re Ok&quot;. 
&gt;You look back at Nasa, and frown.
&gt;&quot;Do you have a satellite phone, I need to contact the peacekeepers and one of those groups I was talking about.&quot; you ask, contempt in your voice.
&gt;Nasa Smile slyly &quot;Oh, we thought you might need one&quot; she responds as the Rhino hands her a phone. &quot;Who will you call?&quot;
&gt;You dial the number as you answer.
&gt;&quot;Heard of the Lonely-hearts club?&quot;
&gt;Nasa&#039;s reaction is quick, but you caught it; Her ears folded and her eyes widened for a moment.
&gt;&quot;They are not a group to cross lightly, the peacekeepers hire them?&quot;
&gt;You nod as you hit the call button.
&gt;&quot;Keeps idiots in line&quot; you grunt.
&gt;The phone rings once, before a gruff voice answers.
&gt;&quot;Peacekeepers problem solving division&quot;
&gt;&quot;This is Alpha November oscar November, the situation has gone under here&quot; you reply
&gt;You hear typing and slight mumbling
&gt;&quot;Passcode&quot;
&gt;&quot;Rakes and Rake accessories&quot;
&gt;A faint grunt of approval.
&gt;&quot;level of retaliation?&quot;
&gt;You glance at Akina, wounded with her house and business gone and anger fills you
&gt;&quot;Tuskin&quot;
&gt;The grunt of approval would send shivers down your spine if you weren&#039;t so pissed at what they did to Akina.
&gt;&quot;Very well, extraction will meet you at the local airport&quot;
&gt;&quot;There needs room for 2&quot;
&gt;The voice pauses for a moment.
&gt;&quot;Two?&quot;
&gt;&quot;My guide got shot, they burned her house down, I&#039;m taking her back with me.
&gt;No pause this time.
&gt;&quot;Understood&quot;
&gt;The phone hangs up leaving you listening to static.
&gt;&quot;Can you take us to the local airport? we have an extraction&quot; you calmly, handing the Phone back to Nasa.
&gt;She nods and yells something to the driver in a language you don&#039;t recognize.
&gt;&quot;What was all that? Rakes? Tuskin?&quot; Nasa asks, tucking the sat phone away.
&gt;&quot;I can only tell you one thing about that&quot; you answer as you gently guide Akina to sit next to you.
&gt;She nuzzles against you, and you wrap an arm around her.
&gt;Nasa cocks her head in a very canine kind of way.
&gt;&quot;What is that?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Tuskin, the Cariotis tribe tribe is going the way of the Tuskin raiders&quot;
&gt;Nasa looks confused for a moment then it dawns on her and a mix of terror and shock covers her face.
&gt;&quot;You would have them go that far?!&quot;
&gt;You meet her eyes and smile.
&gt;&quot;Can&#039;t be Peacekeepers if your clients think they can just take what they want&quot; 
&gt;Akina nuzzles closer and sleepily gives you a kiss.
&gt;Nasa looks at you and Akina for a moment, then simply nods. 
&gt;&quot;We will be at the airport in 2 hours, get some rest&quot;
&gt;You nod to her, then close your eyes.
&gt;Sleep takes you before you even know it came.

Epilogue
&gt;&quot;Just a Little deeper! Come on do it!&quot; Akina Squeaks happily.
&gt;You stomp the head of your shovel into the ground and pull out another mound of dirt, then another, and another.
&gt;&quot;Perfect!&quot; 
&gt;Akina jumps off the covered ATV with a small plastic terrarium in her paws.
&gt;Inside is a bunch of torn up cardboard and a few hundred creepy crawlies.
&gt;She opens it up and gently pours the contents into the hole you just dug.
&gt;&quot;The queen should like the terrain here! within a few years we&#039;ll have a thriving mound!&quot; Akina explains; half barking, smiling at you.
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s great Akina. How many holes do I have to dig now?&quot; you pant as you wipe sweat from your brow.
&gt;&quot;No more! let&#039;s go home!&quot;
&gt;You jump on the ATV and set the shovel on the tool rack as Akina gets in the ATV, pushing herself in front of you.
&gt;&quot;I Drive Mister!&quot; she Squeak barks, then revs the engine.
&gt;The ATV shoots off towards your new home.
&gt;It&#039;s been 6 months since you and Akina left Africa.
&gt;Together you both decided it was time to leave the peacekeepers and settle down.
&gt;You bought up a large plot of land in the Mojave and had a nice house built for the two of you.
&gt;Akina started up her bug business again, hence the start of new termite mounds.
&gt;The last you heard of the Cariotis tribe was that their numbers were shattered, the Lonely-hearts club doing what it did best.
&gt;But that doesn&#039;t matter now as you hold Akina&#039;s waist firmly.
&gt;She still likes to squeak bark when she drives the ATV and you still love it.
&gt;The ATV pulls in front of your house and you jump off 
&gt;Akina follows suit and you pull her into a hug.
&gt;&quot;H-Hey! Lemme go!&quot; she squeaks in surprise, trying to wiggle out of your grasp.
&gt;Instead, you pick her up and kiss her.
&gt;She stops struggling and reciprocates the kiss and pushes away from you and wiggles out of your arms.
&gt;&quot;What was that for mister?&quot; she asks, looking you over.
&gt;&quot;Nothing, I just love you&quot;
&gt;Akina’s ears perk up and her tail gently wags.
&gt;&quot;I Love you too!&quot; she barks as she launches herself back into your arms.
&gt;This is your lovely life now.
&gt;And to think only a few short months ago you were more worried about getting a Sunburn.
