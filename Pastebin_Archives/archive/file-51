Biology student extraordinaire, on a mission to capture a certain number of a freshwater stingrays</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the stingray in question has a venom that is known to help with a few nerve diseases.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This expedition was one that was expedited and was &quot;High priority&quot; because some politicians&#039; cousins started to suffer from one of the nerve diseases that the rays might help with.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As such, you are swimming in one of the deepest parts of the amazon, linked to the modern world by nothing other than a Satellite phone that is solar powered.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few more &quot;wild&quot; anthros swim past you, eyeing you with innocent curiosity.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It always did fascinate you how some Anthros could evolve similar to their more civilized cousins.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In fact, the whole anthro-Animal evolution path was amazing!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Somehow every species of animal diverged to have humanlike counterparts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe evolution saw what humanity was doing and evolved a shortcut?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But even then, seeing &quot;feral&quot; Anthros that choose to live wild and free was amazing!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like humans on that one island...What&#039;s its name?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shake your head and focus back on the clear water around you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A huge Arapaima Anthro lazily swims past you as you stop to tap on the screen of a waterproof tablet attached to your arm, then you show it to a few of the surrounding anthros.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;These anthros might be &quot;feral&quot; but if you show them a picture of what you&#039;re looking for, most happily point a direction out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The arapaima ignores you completely, however more than a few piranha anthros, a catfish anthro and even a VERY angry bull shark anthro point you in one direction.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile under your rebreathers mask, nod and wave a few times to the local populace and swim in the direction they indicated.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Things are going well, if you do say so yourself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It has been 3 months on the river and you&#039;ve captured 25 males and 23 females.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To have a full diverse population of animals you need 25 of both male and female.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Of course, you could just quit and head back, phoning in your success in capturing &quot;enough&quot; stingrays.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But no one got famous and funded with just &quot;enough&quot;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you swim slowly towards your final goal, hoping to find the last 2 female specimens you hear a loud shout that makes your heart drop.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;CANNONBALL BITCHESSS!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you can react, an explosion of air bubbles and sound hits the surface of the water.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every anthro and aquatic creature scatters like a roach exposed to light, leaving you alone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Alone except you and your project partner.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Chelsea Driftwood.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s been following you since her freshman year, always tagging along with you no matter WHAT you do.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s a Harbor seal anthro with little to no interest in anything you were doing here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bubbles clear around her body,  curled up in a cannonball to reveal a toned, sleek body; covered in shallow rippling muscles from swimming her whole life.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And of course she&#039;s topless, letting go of any sense of civilization, as per usual.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As if totally unaware of her sudden cannonball she spins around quickly left and right, looking for anthros or any other creature to speak with.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She has some kinda way to talk to aquatic anthros that makes you annoyed; because IF she used it to help you out, you would be totally set and back in civilization.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Instead, she used all of her 4&#039;8 self to annoy you; To throw wet towels and seaweed at you, scare off anthros, and eat all the food.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As she spins around she spots you and smiles, revealing a predator&#039;s teeth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;HEYA ANON!&quot; she yells into her communicator, waving enthusiastically in the clear water.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You both have communicators to coordinate underwater, it was supposed to be to coordinate to catch the rays faster; instead she used it to bother you while you swam, oftentimes talking nonstop about a show she had been watching.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Seriously, she talked you through an entire show called... ozark? osmith?...bismuth?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You just wanted to catch these rays so you could continue researching them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Research is your best skill, but you NEED field hours for your degree.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Incidentally, so did Chelsea; that&#039;s why she was stuck with you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The deal was you catch them, she keeps them alive, then you both get research grants.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But she seemed more interested in sunbathing, swimming around topless, and smacking you with wet towels.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;None of the captured rays had died though;

You&#039;ve been down here all day!&quot; she happily chirps through the comms, a large smile on her muzzle, showing her large canines.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I &quot;was&quot; getting directions to the next stingray&quot; you grumble through the mic in your facemask, pointing in a certain direction.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Chelsea swirls around as graceful as a ballet dancer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Directions from who? It&#039;s just me and you here&quot; she asks, swirling around with her arms outstretched.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Multi colored ribbons of fabric drift in the water behind her forearms, making her look like a cyclone of color.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She says the ribbons help her with currents and movements of things in the water.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;They totally help me sense sharks&quot; she said once while drunk.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You think she wears them to make herself look cool.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You scared everyone off with your cannonball Chelsea&quot; you respond with an exasperated sigh &quot;Again&quot;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Of course, She just laughs and swims around you; making you feel like a toddler learning to walk next to Usain Bolt.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her skill and grace in the water would have made her such a useful partner, if she just took it seriously.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a sigh, you surface and grab a railing on your boat, ignoring the dark shadow that is Chelsea.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With Chelsea in the water, it would be tough to find one of your coveted stingrays.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was too loud, too noisy and too hyper.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But... there was something to be said about her enthusiasm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not once had she doubted that the goal would be reached.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She hadn&#039;t let a captured ray die.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And she didn&#039;t complain when partnered with you; unlike the others in your class.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It turns out in a world of anthros, marine biology is a small field.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They can just swim around.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull yourself onto the boat that has been your home for the past few months, thinking about Chelsea as your wet fins slap against the boat deck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The amazonian air hits you as you pull off your rebreather, inhaling the fresh air deep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nothing of civilization fills your lungs, just the purest air you&#039;ve ever experienced in your life.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You aren&#039;t surprised as you breathe deep and feel your boats slow engine chug along.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;On this kind of expedition, having a fast boat was not needed; so your boat has a slow engine that you could speed up as needed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you take off your diving gear, a &quot;reverse splash&quot; of water plumes out of the river, followed by Chelsea flipping onto the deck of the boat with 2 large fish.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon!

she yells at you motioning to the olinguito&#039;s who keep mimicking &quot;MINE&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In response, you walk up to her and bend down to kiss her gently, a hand gently gliding down to slide her wetsuit pants off of her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She breaks the kiss with a slight pant and a moan of &quot;W-wha are you doing?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your right hand snakes down her body, feeling every curve.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Fixing it&quot;

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;The current pushes you gently as you swim upstream in the amazon.
&gt;Piranhas and piranha anthros swim past you in thick schools, looking for an easy meal as you wave to them.
&gt;Your rebreather bubbles softly as you swim quietly downstream, looking around and getting the occasional playful nip from a few of the local anthro gals who want attention.
&gt;But you have other things to do here.
&gt;You are Anon; Biology student extraordinaire, on a mission to capture a certain number of a freshwater stingrays
&gt;the stingray in question has a venom that is known to help with a few nerve diseases.
&gt;This expedition was one that was expedited and was &quot;High priority&quot; because some politicians&#039; cousins started to suffer from one of the nerve diseases that the rays might help with.
&gt;As such, you are swimming in one of the deepest parts of the amazon, linked to the modern world by nothing other than a Satellite phone that is solar powered.
&gt;A few more &quot;wild&quot; anthros swim past you, eyeing you with innocent curiosity.
&gt;It always did fascinate you how some Anthros could evolve similar to their more civilized cousins.
&gt;In fact, the whole anthro-Animal evolution path was amazing!
&gt;Somehow every species of animal diverged to have humanlike counterparts.
&gt;Maybe evolution saw what humanity was doing and evolved a shortcut?
&gt;But even then, seeing &quot;feral&quot; Anthros that choose to live wild and free was amazing!
&gt;Like humans on that one island...What&#039;s its name?
&gt;You shake your head and focus back on the clear water around you.
&gt;A huge Arapaima Anthro lazily swims past you as you stop to tap on the screen of a waterproof tablet attached to your arm, then you show it to a few of the surrounding anthros.
&gt;These anthros might be &quot;feral&quot; but if you show them a picture of what you&#039;re looking for, most happily point a direction out.
&gt;The arapaima ignores you completely, however more than a few piranha anthros, a catfish anthro and even a VERY angry bull shark anthro point you in one direction.
&gt;You smile under your rebreathers mask, nod and wave a few times to the local populace and swim in the direction they indicated.
&gt;Things are going well, if you do say so yourself.
&gt;It has been 3 months on the river and you&#039;ve captured 25 males and 23 females.
&gt;To have a full diverse population of animals you need 25 of both male and female.
&gt;Of course, you could just quit and head back, phoning in your success in capturing &quot;enough&quot; stingrays.
&gt;But no one got famous and funded with just &quot;enough&quot;.
&gt;As you swim slowly towards your final goal, hoping to find the last 2 female specimens you hear a loud shout that makes your heart drop.
&gt;&quot;CANNONBALL BITCHESSS!&quot;
&gt;Before you can react, an explosion of air bubbles and sound hits the surface of the water.
&gt;Every anthro and aquatic creature scatters like a roach exposed to light, leaving you alone.
&gt;Alone except you and your project partner.
&gt;Chelsea Driftwood.
&gt;She&#039;s been following you since her freshman year, always tagging along with you no matter WHAT you do.
&gt;She&#039;s a Harbor seal anthro with little to no interest in anything you were doing here.
&gt;Bubbles clear around her body,  curled up in a cannonball to reveal a toned, sleek body; covered in shallow rippling muscles from swimming her whole life.
&gt;And of course she&#039;s topless, letting go of any sense of civilization, as per usual.
&gt;As if totally unaware of her sudden cannonball she spins around quickly left and right, looking for anthros or any other creature to speak with.
&gt;She has some kinda way to talk to aquatic anthros that makes you annoyed; because IF she used it to help you out, you would be totally set and back in civilization.
&gt;Instead, she used all of her 4&#039;8 self to annoy you; To throw wet towels and seaweed at you, scare off anthros, and eat all the food.
&gt;As she spins around she spots you and smiles, revealing a predator&#039;s teeth.
&gt;&quot;HEYA ANON!&quot; she yells into her communicator, waving enthusiastically in the clear water.
&gt;You both have communicators to coordinate underwater, it was supposed to be to coordinate to catch the rays faster; instead she used it to bother you while you swam, oftentimes talking nonstop about a show she had been watching.
&gt;Seriously, she talked you through an entire show called... ozark? osmith?...bismuth?
&gt;You just wanted to catch these rays so you could continue researching them.
&gt;Research is your best skill, but you NEED field hours for your degree.
&gt;Incidentally, so did Chelsea; that&#039;s why she was stuck with you.
&gt;The deal was you catch them, she keeps them alive, then you both get research grants.
&gt;But she seemed more interested in sunbathing, swimming around topless, and smacking you with wet towels.
&gt;None of the captured rays had died though; in fact most were getting bigger...
&gt;Almost as soon as she spots you, she swims right into your face, a big grin on her muzzle.
&gt;&quot;Whatcha doin swimming around alone? You&#039;ve been down here all day!&quot; she happily chirps through the comms, a large smile on her muzzle, showing her large canines.
&gt;&quot;I &quot;was&quot; getting directions to the next stingray&quot; you grumble through the mic in your facemask, pointing in a certain direction.
&gt;Chelsea swirls around as graceful as a ballet dancer.
&gt;&quot;Directions from who? It&#039;s just me and you here&quot; she asks, swirling around with her arms outstretched.
&gt;Multi colored ribbons of fabric drift in the water behind her forearms, making her look like a cyclone of color.
&gt;She says the ribbons help her with currents and movements of things in the water.
&gt;&quot;They totally help me sense sharks&quot; she said once while drunk.
&gt;You think she wears them to make herself look cool.
&gt;&quot;You scared everyone off with your cannonball Chelsea&quot; you respond with an exasperated sigh &quot;Again&quot;.
&gt;Of course, She just laughs and swims around you; making you feel like a toddler learning to walk next to Usain Bolt.
&gt;Her skill and grace in the water would have made her such a useful partner, if she just took it seriously.
&gt;With a sigh, you surface and grab a railing on your boat, ignoring the dark shadow that is Chelsea.
&gt;With Chelsea in the water, it would be tough to find one of your coveted stingrays.
&gt;She was too loud, too noisy and too hyper.
&gt;But... there was something to be said about her enthusiasm.
&gt;Not once had she doubted that the goal would be reached.
&gt;She hadn&#039;t let a captured ray die.
&gt;And she didn&#039;t complain when partnered with you; unlike the others in your class.
&gt;It turns out in a world of anthros, marine biology is a small field.
&gt;They can just swim around.
&gt;You pull yourself onto the boat that has been your home for the past few months, thinking about Chelsea as your wet fins slap against the boat deck.
&gt;The amazonian air hits you as you pull off your rebreather, inhaling the fresh air deep.
&gt;Nothing of civilization fills your lungs, just the purest air you&#039;ve ever experienced in your life.
&gt;You aren&#039;t surprised as you breathe deep and feel your boats slow engine chug along.
&gt;On this kind of expedition, having a fast boat was not needed; so your boat has a slow engine that you could speed up as needed.
&gt;As you take off your diving gear, a &quot;reverse splash&quot; of water plumes out of the river, followed by Chelsea flipping onto the deck of the boat with 2 large fish.
&gt;&quot;Anon! I caught dinner!&quot; she yells boastfully as she pulls the two fish along behind her.
&gt;&quot;Yea you caught dinner&quot; you respond looking at the red bellied fish she dragged up from the river, &quot;but are they poisonous?&quot;
&gt;Chelsea&#039;s face goes from one of absolute triumph to one of unsure confusion as she looks at the still flopping fish on the deck of the boat.
&gt;She looks at you and gives a very half hearted smile.
&gt;&quot;Yes mayyyyybeee?&quot; she responds, grabbing the still flopping fish with a small paw.
&gt;You walk across the deck of the boat, sure of your footing after months of wet slipperiness.
&gt;&quot;Yes you dork&quot; you finally respond as you gently hold Chelsea&#039;s chin &quot;These aren&#039;t poisonous&quot;
&gt;A large smile break&#039;s across Chelsea&#039;s muzzle as she smiles, looking up at you.
&gt;After years of studying together in the states; and finally alone on the amazon, you and Chelsea had formed an unlikely relationship.
&gt;YOU; the introverted, book smart guy.
&gt;And HER; the social butterfly who just wanted to have fun.
&gt;Doesn&#039;t matter now after months alone together in the jungle.
&gt;She darts away as you grab the still wriggling fish to gut them and cook them.
&gt;Fresh fish everyday beats rations, although sometimes you trade with the locals.
&gt;&quot;Looky! I learned!&quot; Chelsea boasts and she dances along the deck of the boat.
&gt;As you look up, a wet towel slaps onto your face with enough force to not be painful; but to be annoying.
&gt;&quot;Chelsea, if you want a good dinner, I can&#039;t have you pranking me now&quot; you grumble as she dives back into the river with that same serene grace.
&gt;Chelsea&#039;s head bobs above the waterline for a moment, looking at you with a guilty grin.
&gt;&quot;I got you&quot; she states triumphantly.
&gt;&quot;You hit me with a towel while I started making dinner&quot; you correct, holding up a half filleted fish &quot;Guess you don&#039;t want me to finish cooking&quot; you say, faking dropping the fish into the river.
&gt;Chelsea darts forwards in the water to catch the fish, only to bonk her snout on the hull.
&gt;For a moment, she spins in the water, holding her snout in her paws.
&gt;&quot;Owie! You Meanie! I donked my snoot&quot; She whines as you continue gutting the fish, tossing the innards into the river.
&gt;&quot;You did it to yourself&quot; you chastise as you put the fish onto a firewood grill.
&gt;Yea, you might be on an expedition, but you aren&#039;t NOT going to cook the natural way.
&gt;You had even traded for spices and herbs from locals along the river.
&gt;The flesh of the fish hisses as it hits the grill, while you carefully monitor it.
&gt;Out of the corner of your eye, you see Chelsea trying to be sneaky, quietly sneaking onto the deck of the boat
&gt;One of her little habits is to try and spook you.
&gt;It usually doesn&#039;t work, you swear!
&gt;She just startled you...
&gt;But this time you see her just out of the corner of your eyes.
&gt;The wet ribbons drag behind her as she tries to tip-toe up behind you, her paws walking on the slick deck of the boat like it was dry concrete.
&gt;Just as she pounces, you whip around and catch the tiny seal anthro in your arms pulling her close as she protests.
&gt;She struggles weakly as you kiss her snout.
&gt;&quot;No! Ack Lemme Go! No More kisses&quot; she protests weakly; trying to push you away from her.
&gt;Her snout is her weak point you learned by accident.
&gt;&quot;Gonna sneak up but can&#039;t deal with the punishment for being caught&quot; you chastise, holding the soaking wet seal as she squirms against you.
&gt;&quot;You...Weren&#039;t...Supposed to catch me&quot; Chelsea grunts as she squirms against your grip.
&gt;&quot;Grab us both some towels, I can&#039;t make a good dinner all wet&quot; you respond letting the little seal anthro go.
&gt;&quot;HAHA FREE&quot; She yells as she darts out of sight below deck, water dripping behind her.
&gt;As you flip the fish on the boat&#039;s grill,Chelsea emerges from below deck carrying several towels.
&gt;&quot;Got em!&quot; Chelsea states triumphantly, lobbing a dry towel at you.
&gt;You catch it with ease, and begin drying yourself around your wetsuit.
&gt;Of course, you need to dry everywhere, even under the wetsuit.
&gt;Do you dare leave Chelsea in charge of the cooking fish?
&gt;A glance at her reminds you of something as she strips to dry her fur.
&gt;You&#039;re in the middle of nowhere,surrounded by hundreds of miles of uninhabited jungles.
&gt;The only ones who would see you are Chelsea; who had seen you naked dozens , and a few &quot;feral&quot; anthros.
&gt;&quot;When in Rome&quot; you mumble, unzipping and sliding out of your wetsuit and draping it on the railing of the boat.
&gt;You take a moment to relax, naked and let the golden sunlight rain upon your body.
&gt;As you do, you hear a loud whistle from somewhere.
&gt;You jump slightly and search for the culprit, only to spot a group of olinguito Anthro females hanging in a tree.
&gt;Olinguito&#039;s are small, raccoon-like tree dwellers.
&gt;At this point though, you don&#039;t care; Who are they gonna tell?
&gt;Unfortunately though, Chelsea has also noticed the attention you&#039;re receiving.
&gt;&quot;HEY HEY MINE&quot; She shouts to the female anthros, waving a towel frantically at them; only for them to move back slightly.
&gt;&quot;MINE!&quot; they all mimic as she gets angrier at the crowd.
&gt;You can see her visibly trembling in anger as she turns to you.
&gt;&quot;Fix this!&quot; she yells at you motioning to the olinguito&#039;s who keep mimicking &quot;MINE&quot;
&gt;In response, you walk up to her and bend down to kiss her gently, a hand gently gliding down to slide her wetsuit pants off of her.
&gt;She breaks the kiss with a slight pant and a moan of &quot;W-wha are you doing?&quot;
&gt;Your right hand snakes down her body, feeling every curve.
&gt;&quot;Fixing it&quot; you respond as you kiss her once more.
&gt;Chelsea&#039;s tongue darts into your mouth as you fight it with your own, her paws grabbing the side of your face.
&gt;Your own hands slide up and down her naked body, cupping her grapefruit sized breasts and squeezing her thicc ass.
&gt;Who would have thought that years of swimming would tone her body to look like one of the best models out there; although a bit shorter.
&gt;All 4&#039;8 of her body presses against you, melting into your arms as you kiss her.
&gt;She breaks away from the kiss with her tongue partly out, panting &quot;n-not fair&quot;
&gt;You hands grip her firm ass and you lift her up, letting her strong legs and tail wrap around you, settling against your growing member.
&gt;&quot;Totally fair&quot; you respond, squeezing her ass and thighs gently, situating your shaft between her exposed folds.
&gt;Chelsea wraps her arms around your neck, leaning forwards and pressing her breasts against your chest
&gt;You smile, holding Chelsea close. 
&gt;Once more you kiss her as she slides herself against you and uses one hand to position your now rock hard erection into her.
&gt;She gasps into your ear, wrapping her arm around you once more as your thick member slides into her wetness.
&gt;Her wet fur sticks to you as you kiss her and hold her up, gently thrusting into her.
&gt;The two of you had never done it like this.
&gt;Out in the open letting anyone who dared to see it, see it.
&gt;&quot;Sooooo big&quot; Chelsea moans, as she pulls you into a kiss.
&gt;You grip her thick ass and guide it as you thrust deep into her.
&gt;Once more, she kisses you as you hear a &quot;oooooh from outside the boat that you ignore, focusing on your love.
&gt;Your hands hold her toned ass and guide it like she was just a thing to get you off.
&gt;But She is so much more than that.
&gt;You feel her heat, her want to get off, and her desire to satisfy you as your rock hard member buries itself deep into her silken folds.
&gt;As you hold her up and kiss her, you feel her soft tongue in contrast to her teeth that can crush bone.
&gt;Her deep moans into you, her desire to just BE with you.
&gt;you continue supporting her body, thrusting hard into her as she wiggles a bit to free her chest.
&gt;&quot;S-suck on one &quot; She half demands half begs; lifting herself slightly so her generous chest is pressed to your face
&gt;You oblige, working your face to the nearest nipple and biting it gently between your teeth and you shove your member into her.
&gt;Chelsea gasps hard as you do, pulling you closer to her as you gently bite and suck on her breasts.
&gt;Her wetness envelops you, tightening with each thrust as you set her ass on the railing of the boat.
&gt;Free from having to hold herself up, Chelsea&#039;s legs instead wrap around your midsection.
&gt;Chelsea&#039;s paws wrap around the back of your head as you focus on one of her breasts, sucking and teasing her nipple.
&gt;You hold her thick body against yours, thrusting into her heat as she moans happily into your ear.
&gt;A sudden spasm of tightness from her makes you gasp in want, feeling her tightness around your member suddenly double.
&gt;&quot;A-anon I- i&#039;m gonna c-c-cum&quot; Chelsea moans as you continue nibbling her soft nipple and thrusting into her sopping wetness.
&gt;&quot;N-No slow down! I&#039;M g-gonna&quot; she pleads as you speed up, forcing yourself deeper into her.
&gt;&quot;A-Anon I&#039;m CUUUUU-&quot; Chelsea cries as a gush of fluid spray against you, drenching your thighs and running down your legs.
&gt;You don&#039;t stop or slow down, feeling spurred on by her spontaneous climax
&gt;Her legs lock around your back as you keep thrusting into her.
&gt;&quot;Chelsea i&#039;m c-close&quot; you grunt through clenched teeth.
&gt;&quot;Y-yes Love, fill me p-please&quot; She begs as you thrust your rock hard member into her, her arms wrapped around your head.
&gt;With a sharp thrust into her, and her tightening her legs around you, you fill your beloved with your love,
&gt;You release her nipple with a slight pant, feeling a bit out of breath from thrusting and sucking.
&gt;Chelsea leans back on the boat railing, her leg spread wide.
&gt;&quot;G-geez anon if I wasn&#039;t on the pill you would’ve knocked me up&quot; she gasps.
&gt;As you go to give her another kiss, a loud cheering is heard.
&gt;You look around to see several tribe of feral anthro cheering on your love making
&gt;&quot;NO! no no no no!&quot; Chelsea yells before disappearing below deck, trying to cover herself, leaving you with the still cheering crowd.
&gt;Why feel embarrassed?
&gt;You instead bow to your audience, earning a louder out cry.
&gt;You don&#039;t know why they are cheering.
&gt;All you know is after all that, this river is wild.
