Never thought I’d see this stuff in real life!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You struggle to carry her smallest bag as she hefts the rest onto one shoulder and under her other arm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You know snow, and you already felt its bite on your way to the airport</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But when Furaha walks outside she almost drops all her luggage</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”S-s-shit,” she says, trying to laugh it off, “I d-didn’t expect it to be THIS c-c-cold…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hail a cab and you two pack the trunk with her belongings</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask the driver to crank the heat up, but it’s not enough to keep Furaha from shivering</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hold her for warmth, and she seems to shrink as she buries her head into your chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fortunately your place isn’t far away, and soon the cab drops you off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It would be easier to get inside if Furaha wasn’t trying to burrow into your coat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once inside, you do all you can to make the place comfortable</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re making a pot of coffee as she pulls the cushions off the couch and makes a fort out of them to trap the heat inside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It makes you a little sad to see her suffering, but it’s also hard not to find it adorable</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You prepare the bed at night for the two of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had to buy an extra large mattress for Furaha, but it was worth it for her sake</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s actually charging by you before leaping under the covers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nothing left but a shaking mound of sheets</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You approach the bed, and a furry arm wraps around your waist</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have sudden flashbacks to your younger days, afraid of the monster under the bed that might drag you underneath</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now, it’s trying to drag you INTO the bed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Furaha jerks you under the covers with her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The air is stifling, even more so when she completely envelopes you with her body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She still smells like the Serengeti, and her fur is just as soft as the first time you held her paws in your hands</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stroke her reassuringly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually, her shaking subsides</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You better not think less of me,” she says.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In spite of her misery, she keeps her attitude chipper</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you’ll do everything you can to make her comfortable here</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She just chuckles herself to sleep</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When Furaha takes a shower, steam is billowing from the bathroom</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She raids your closet for your clothes; most are a little too small for her, especially when she layers them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She always has a piping hot cup of coffee or tea in hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel bad leaving her, but you have to clear some snow outside that the city hasn’t gotten around to plowing yet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re shoveling as much as possible when you catch a glimpse into your window</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A mountain of blankets is looking back at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It has a black-nosed muzzle sticking out of it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And it’s fogging up the glass as it waits for your return</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It should have been ample warning for you as you head back inside, because you’re devoured by the mass of blankets as soon as you walk through the door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Completely inside, you are shuffled back to the couch fort where the beast’s lair is set up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She has a tiny space heater facing the opening, and even more sheets packed inside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”D-don’t you dare go out there again like that,” she whispers to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You know she’s just joking</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I get c-colder just looking at you out there, all hairless and unp-protected.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her she’ll get used to it over time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Y-yeah? When’s that?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, it IS the Midwest, so she could always pack on a little winter weight…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’d probably smack you if her arms were free, so she resorts to just constricting you with those toned arms of hers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t think you can even make it to the bed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Guess you’re camping out in the pillow fort tonight</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Over time, it seems like Furaha is adjusting to the cold</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not much, but enough to bundle up and take brief, wary trips outside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have to admit, being cuddled by a hyena girl night after night makes you feel almost guilty</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The only problem is the hit your heating bill is taking</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you said you’d do everything you can to make her comfortable, and you meant it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s a good sport about it, and she even lets you talk her into making a snow-yeen in the yard</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The landscape looks like heaven, with your angel in the middle of it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Heaven” being appropriate, because the snowball is already in mid-flight when you realize the mistake you’ve made</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s going to kill you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The snowball splats against her neck, soaking into her mane</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She glares at you with a bloodthirsty look</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can’t even wade more than a few steps before you’re hoisted into the air and carried back inside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The door flies open and then slams shut</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Everything’s rushing by as she tears though your place</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Heading to your bedroom?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you know it, she’s ripping your clothes off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And even her own</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She whips a blanket around her shoulders

        <textarea class="textarea">Snow, Spots, and Snuggles [Hyena; Body Warmth, Lewd]: Anon helps his girl get through the frigid, unfamiliar Midwestern winter.

&gt;Anon on safari
&gt;You had taken a trip to Africa for the sights, the food, the wildlife…
&gt;And frankly, the smoking hot tour guides
&gt;There were several raunchy pinups of females urging you to take a tour across the Serengeti
&gt;All of them anthros of various species
&gt;You knew the trip itself was going to be breathtaking, but you’d be lying if you said the women weren’t a big factor for your excursion
&gt;And it was a dream come true when you booked a tour led by a spunky hyena girl
&gt;Furaha
&gt;She was witty, boisterous, and quite the tease
&gt;Visually, she had an amazing coat with an incredible sheen, a muscular frame that towered over you, and a devilishly playful smile
&gt;So of course when you got to talking after the tour and invited her to get a drink or two, you didn’t expect her to actually say “yes”
&gt;The rest of your African itinerary was chucked into the garbage
&gt;You wanted to spend the rest of your vacation with her

&gt;Fast forward several months later
&gt;You’re eagerly waiting at the airport for Furaha’s plane to arrive
&gt;As much as she had loved her job, you had changed her life enough for her to love YOU even more
&gt;So she called it quits in Africa and vowed to come to the States to live with you
&gt;Unfortunately, her eagerness blocked your warnings about arriving in the middle of winter
&gt;A Midwestern winter
&gt;The plane was temperate, as was the terminal itself
&gt;But when you see her in her khaki shorts and shirt you got shivers yourself
&gt;She definitely isn’t prepared, so you encourage her to pick up some warmer clothes
&gt;”I’ve seen cool evenings,” she says, slapping you on the back. “How bad could it be?”
&gt;Still, she humors you and at least buys a nice jacket
&gt;You’re at baggage claim when she sees the white powder coming down outside
&gt;”Ha! Never thought I’d see this stuff in real life!”
&gt;You struggle to carry her smallest bag as she hefts the rest onto one shoulder and under her other arm
&gt;You know snow, and you already felt its bite on your way to the airport
&gt;But when Furaha walks outside she almost drops all her luggage
&gt;”S-s-shit,” she says, trying to laugh it off, “I d-didn’t expect it to be THIS c-c-cold…”
&gt;You hail a cab and you two pack the trunk with her belongings
&gt;You ask the driver to crank the heat up, but it’s not enough to keep Furaha from shivering
&gt;You hold her for warmth, and she seems to shrink as she buries her head into your chest
&gt;Fortunately your place isn’t far away, and soon the cab drops you off
&gt;It would be easier to get inside if Furaha wasn’t trying to burrow into your coat
&gt;Once inside, you do all you can to make the place comfortable
&gt;You’re making a pot of coffee as she pulls the cushions off the couch and makes a fort out of them to trap the heat inside
&gt;It makes you a little sad to see her suffering, but it’s also hard not to find it adorable
&gt;You prepare the bed at night for the two of you
&gt;You had to buy an extra large mattress for Furaha, but it was worth it for her sake
&gt;She’s actually charging by you before leaping under the covers
&gt;Nothing left but a shaking mound of sheets
&gt;You approach the bed, and a furry arm wraps around your waist
&gt;You have sudden flashbacks to your younger days, afraid of the monster under the bed that might drag you underneath
&gt;Now, it’s trying to drag you INTO the bed
&gt;Furaha jerks you under the covers with her
&gt;The air is stifling, even more so when she completely envelopes you with her body
&gt;She still smells like the Serengeti, and her fur is just as soft as the first time you held her paws in your hands
&gt;You stroke her reassuringly
&gt;Eventually, her shaking subsides
&gt;”You better not think less of me,” she says.
&gt;In spite of her misery, she keeps her attitude chipper
&gt;You tell her you’ll do everything you can to make her comfortable here
&gt;She just chuckles herself to sleep

&gt;When Furaha takes a shower, steam is billowing from the bathroom
&gt;She raids your closet for your clothes; most are a little too small for her, especially when she layers them
&gt;She always has a piping hot cup of coffee or tea in hand
&gt;You feel bad leaving her, but you have to clear some snow outside that the city hasn’t gotten around to plowing yet
&gt;You’re shoveling as much as possible when you catch a glimpse into your window
&gt;A mountain of blankets is looking back at you
&gt;It has a black-nosed muzzle sticking out of it
&gt;And it’s fogging up the glass as it waits for your return
&gt;It should have been ample warning for you as you head back inside, because you’re devoured by the mass of blankets as soon as you walk through the door
&gt;Completely inside, you are shuffled back to the couch fort where the beast’s lair is set up
&gt;She has a tiny space heater facing the opening, and even more sheets packed inside
&gt;”D-don’t you dare go out there again like that,” she whispers to you
&gt;You know she’s just joking
&gt;Maybe
&gt;”I get c-colder just looking at you out there, all hairless and unp-protected.”
&gt;You tell her she’ll get used to it over time
&gt;”Y-yeah? When’s that?”
&gt;Well, it IS the Midwest, so she could always pack on a little winter weight…
&gt;She’d probably smack you if her arms were free, so she resorts to just constricting you with those toned arms of hers
&gt;You don’t think you can even make it to the bed
&gt;Guess you’re camping out in the pillow fort tonight

&gt;Over time, it seems like Furaha is adjusting to the cold
&gt;Not much, but enough to bundle up and take brief, wary trips outside
&gt;You have to admit, being cuddled by a hyena girl night after night makes you feel almost guilty
&gt;The only problem is the hit your heating bill is taking
&gt;But you said you’d do everything you can to make her comfortable, and you meant it
&gt;She’s a good sport about it, and she even lets you talk her into making a snow-yeen in the yard
&gt;The landscape looks like heaven, with your angel in the middle of it
&gt;”Heaven” being appropriate, because the snowball is already in mid-flight when you realize the mistake you’ve made
&gt;She’s going to kill you
&gt;The snowball splats against her neck, soaking into her mane
&gt;She glares at you with a bloodthirsty look
&gt;You can’t even wade more than a few steps before you’re hoisted into the air and carried back inside
&gt;The door flies open and then slams shut
&gt;Everything’s rushing by as she tears though your place
&gt;Heading to your bedroom?
&gt;Before you know it, she’s ripping your clothes off
&gt;And even her own
&gt;She whips a blanket around her shoulders and ties it off around her neck, like a cape
&gt;You are thrown onto the nest of bedsheets, and Furaha straddles you
&gt;Her rage-induced body temperature is radiating off of her
&gt;”You think you’re funny, huh?” she says
&gt;She laughs forcefully
&gt;And it never ends
&gt;She reaches behind her neck, where some of the slosh from your prank is sticking on her fur
&gt;It melts into her paw, dampening it
&gt;Her laugh turns maniacal
&gt;And kind of turns you on as well
&gt;That is, until you see just where her paw is reaching:
&gt;Your exposed groin
&gt;She grabs your member and starts pumping it
&gt;Fuck, it’s cold!
&gt;But the chill subsides as your arousal keeps the blood going
&gt;Soon you’re fully erect, and Furaha lifts herself directly over you
&gt;”There’s more than one way to get all hot and heavy,” she manages to say somewhere between her cackling
&gt;Her thighs drop, and your whole length is engulfed
&gt;She’s in complete control, bucking and huffing
&gt;She rubs her paws over your chest, half to punish you some more with her frigid pads and half to warm them up
&gt;Not like you’re not enjoying yourself, though…
&gt;You’ll have to tell her she looks like a superhero with that sheet-cape flowing behind her
&gt;When she’s in a better mood, that is
&gt;Her rhythm picks up, and you can feel yourself reaching climax yourself
&gt;She lets out a cry of pleasure as you spray liquid heat inside her body
&gt;You’d think the afterglow that follows such fiery lovemaking would stretch out a LITTLE longer than it does
&gt;Her laughing dies down, but doesn’t die out completely
&gt;She undoes her cape and wraps it around herself fully
&gt;The two of you are once again snuggled into the mess of blankets and under the covers
&gt;Her laughing turns to gentle whining as she gives a single shiver, but with you by her side she calms down
&gt;”A-anon,” Furaha moans, “you really do make it all worth it.”
&gt;You stroke her fur as she encases you once more with her entire physique
&gt;Your head against her neck
&gt;Her legs intertwined with yours
&gt;Even her tail wants to get into the middle
&gt;”I think I can tough it out until spring,” she says, “but…”
&gt;She takes your chin in her paw and tilts your head gaze into your eyes
&gt;Just as lively and spirited as the day you first saw her
&gt;”I hope you’ll consider moving someplace a little warmer, at least for the winter.”
&gt;Your mouth connects with her muzzle, and you share a deep, passionate kiss
