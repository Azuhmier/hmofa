You can watch any movie for free but please stop blocking the projector. The customers are complaining about that. Do you understand ?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The moth girls fiddles with a hole in her sweater and nods</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Yes Mister. I am sorry but, but...I wanted to see mom smiling again. And when she was hit I felt bad and looked away and then the light and….I am sorry”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At this moment the ant man spots you, waving you inside with two of his four arms</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You, yes you come on in. If you are here to complain about the blocking of the movie then I could, of course, offer you a free ticket and….Akari ? is everything alright ?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The moth girl has shrunken in her seat after seeing you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you enter the room the moth girl is shrinking into her chair, trying to hide from view</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Is everything alright Akari ? You look like you...please tell me you did not steal food again”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The ant turns to you, probably to ask if she did but you ignore him</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;instead you march straight through his office with the signed movie posters on the wall and embrace the moth girl in a hug</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She squeaks as you do so, her fluff parting under your fingers and her wings are flapping a bit through the holes in her sweatshirt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Whaaa ??” She sounds shocked like she did not expect that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Oh, how wonderful that you found a friend Akari. You did not tell me about him before. I am sure now you will soon be able to stand on your own feet again”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The ant ushers both of you out of his office and onto the street before the cinema</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Go now, you should not dwell. The night is still young so have fun”. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He hands you a few free tickets for the cinema (only valuable in combination with a paid one) and is gone again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Together the two of you stand in front of the cinema, a few paper lanterns out of plastic are illuminating the San Fransokyo street here</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A soft rain is falling down while steam rises from a manhole cover</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”What...what was that ?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The fluffy girl is still shocked</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The moth girl is shocked by your invitation to grab a bite to eat but quickly agrees to that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Oh, yes that sounds great. I know a place down the street that makes great noodles with old jeans”. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then she grabs your arm and walks off, dragging you with her into a dark alleyway</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;On your way she says that she is really sorry about the whole projector thing and the popcorn thing as well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I was just so hungry, you know ?

Oh, Neon !”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her body is moving past a shop window but her head is turning like that of an owl as you walk past an electronics shop</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A single Neon light is still working, flickering and illuminating the street and she is momentarily completely taken by it before it turns off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Ahhh…..”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After what feels like half an hour of walking deeper and deeper into the slums the two of you finally tumble out of the darkness again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A large cube hotel “The Hive” is standing at the corner of the street, right next to a noodle shop that seems to have specialized on insect guests</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your fleshy skin is rare around here, most others wear a healthy sheet of chitin to protect them from the acidic rain</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Here we are, two large cups of noodles” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She managed to order that stuff in seconds and is now placing the cup in front of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fried noodles with blue jeans fabric poking out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Can I have the clothes ?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Akari is looking at you, the chopsticks raised halfway to your cup</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”They are with teriyaki sauce, my favorite.

Years ago”. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe this is the time to finally grow some balls and try to reenact that scene from the old cartoon you once saw</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The noodles are a bit strange to handle but you somehow manage it to lift one of the pieces of jeans fabric coated in the spicy sauce to her mouth and she opens it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The mandibles part and reveal a rather soft mouth with a cute purple tongue that seems to be covered in soft barbs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Makes sense, they have to grind up wool and yarn after all</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You place the chopsticks between the mandibles and they shut close, dragging the fabric in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The noodles are slurped and you grab the end of them to suck as well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Slowly you close in against each other but before your lips can touch she stops, biting through the noodles</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”What are you doing ?

Eahh...I mean...No, that does not exist, not at all”. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She has a terrible poker face and now your interest is rising</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”No, listen, there is no way..if that comes out….well. Well, what would happen anyway ? Tell you what, you order me more noodles and I will show you the video, deal ?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask her if you can touch her breasts and she nods</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Sure, go ahead. But only the fluff, not the nipples. And only after you buy me a new sweatshirt”. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You swallow the noodles and stand up to follow her as she leaves the shop</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;On the way out you purchase a gift card for her to get more noodles soon, the centipede owner waving you goodbye as you leave</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Akari steps out of the shop and then straight into the coffin hotel</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Inside the small cubes are stacked tight, a hundred people living on maybe 5 square meters the way this thing is stacked</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Loud music is blasting from speakers, people cook on camping gas canisters in the hallways and there is a constant trading all around</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mostly drugs and small slips of paper money</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try not to look</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The hexagon shapes remind you of the interior of a beehive and that is also what it looks like</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A bee woman is sitting in front of her cubicle, begging for money while her kid is squirming as a larvae in a hones glass pot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Akari knows her way through the maze and soon stops in front of a cube that looks exactly like all the others</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Here we are. Hey mom, I brought a friend !”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shouts and knocks, then just opens the door and lets you in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The interior is messy, stuffed with old clothes, paper bags with documents, books and everything a small family needs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just condensated on maybe 4 square meters with a second bed in 2 meters height</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A older moth is sitting in the corner, flicking through an old photo book and occasionally shines a bright light into her eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The flashlight seems to have been built from an old photography lamp, many times stronger than any normal light</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The hum of heavy batteries being drained to power the capacitor is filling the air</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She completely ignores you, lost in her memories, but you recognize her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mothra, or better, the woman that played her so long ago</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Akari climbs down from the bed and hands you a videotape with a red marking</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Here, wanna watch it here ?

Then she did not get a second hit and, well...we ended up here. She takes it the worst and is always on a trip down memory lane”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Akari stops for a moment as her mother shines the light again, her mandibles drop a bit and it looks like she might start to drool any moment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are reminded again of the old health note in class, something about how light pollution is harmful to certain insects the way passive smoking is to humans</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe that is why she...no that is not nice to think</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Well, you held your promise so I hold mine. Mom always said that I could use any method available to make money unless it involves me selling my body. Should have been more specific about hers then”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She opens up a small recorder and slots the tape, starting the movie on a grainy screen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The resolution is terrible but you can see that this version is almost exactly the same as all others</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then the fight scene comes, Godzilla draws the claw and...snaps the bra</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For a moment sheer inertia keeps the tits where they are, then the fluffy breasts spill forward, pushing the remains of the costume away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Red, yellow and white fur is displayed, tipped with black nipples that harden on the cool studio air</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A loud “CUT” is audible but the video continues, showing how Mothra yelps and hides her breasts before suddenly laughing loud and freeing them again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Well, if we do this then I am sure Godzilla would not be able to resist my pheromones anymore” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shy laughter from someone offscreen and then the video stops</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You comment on the frozen picture of Mothra, her hands on her hips and breasts swinging freely how similar her daughter is to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Thanks. Always wanted to be an actress you know. There are not that many moth actors, the bright spotlights can be….you know.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stops, her eyes traveling over her mother in the corner and suddenly looks up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Are you saying you like my breasts ?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There you are, in a light drug den</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Right next to the woman you dreamed off, her daughter sitting in front of you with a video of the tits you hunted for years</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Behind the girl is her bed, the walls covered in cosplay drawings and half-eaten jeans</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She is leaning closer now, a naughty grin on her face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get the feeling that you have to protect your clothes now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In more than one sense….</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your fears were soon proven right as she charged you, the small cube room offering next to no space to retreat from the attack</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For a moment she seemed to nibble on your shirt but then she let go again, pinning you to the ground</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your head is nearly shoved into a small bag of plastic bags</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Well, there we are my cutie, looks like you are now in the hands of your sworn enemy”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She makes the pose that Mothra did in the movie trailer, just not standing and instead sitting on your chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That moth girl is so light you could lift her with one hand but her insect reflexes could make it difficult</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Well, say my name villian, and I my be willing to show mercy to you”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her face is smug as she looks down on you, her sweatshirt already halfway gone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”The play was wonderful I have to admit. Fainting interest in my mother to get to me and then that compliment, well done indeed. Now say my name”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to ponder your ways out of here for now, indulging in her fantasy could lead to some moth sex but do you really want that ?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her sweatshirt comes off and the fluffy breasts appear, soft flesh that hardens to chitin on her midriff, all covered in a thin layer of white fluff</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yes, you want that sweet moth pussy, your dick and your brain have reached a decision</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Slowly you nod your head at the sight of her tits and swallow hard, your mouth is still dry from the cheap noodles</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You call her mothra and she smiles</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Well done villain, now louder”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She allows you to move away a bit while she removes her jeans, the space in this cube is not allowing her to do a dignified stripping session</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You call her mothra again, louder this time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then something warm and fluffy engulfs your head from behind</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her mother, the original mothra, has arisen from her light fueled dream and is now resting her own, considerably bigger breasts, on your shoulders</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You gulp again, louder this time, while she blinks a few times</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Huh ?

            RAW Paste Data        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;You are Anon and so far everything is perfectly fine
&gt;You got a large bag of popcorn, a soda and the movie is about to start
&gt;Classical week in the run up to Halloween, all the old stuff that came from long forgotten studios or were imported by the Japanese
&gt;You change your attention from the people that sit beside you to the screen as the first words appear
&gt;Something Japanese, you can not read it but you don&#039;t have to
&gt;Everyone knows what who Godzilla is, the Japanese scaly actor, famous for his portrayal of the legendary monster
&gt;Modern recreations like to design the town at the computer but you have taken a liking to the old style, cardboard boxes flying everywhere as he makes the first step on to the mainland
&gt;You’re not gay, but damn, those abs could grate cheese
&gt;No wonder he had those high ratings with the girls over there
&gt;Hand after hand of the salty white snacks disappear in your mouth while the human scientists drone on and on about how this is a lesson from nature before another school shoe box is send flying
&gt;Then, the part you waited for
&gt;A thunder strike, a scream and from the sky (metal cords nearly invisible) comes she
&gt;Mothra, defender of humanity and the dream of your sleepless nights
&gt;While the audience laughs about the way she casually crushes a government building with her wings you are already taken by the sight of her antenna
&gt;So fluffy….you would do anything to touch them once
&gt;Just a second before the two giants crash against each other however a large shadow covers the entire screen
&gt;Screams and complains echo through the room as someone has jumped up to stare directly into the projection beam
&gt;You can hear a soft muttered “So shiny..” before the girl makes a step forward, completely ignoring the seats in front of her
&gt;There is a squeak, a flailing of wings and then she is gone, having fallen over the edge of the seat
&gt;But hey, the view is back


&gt;You grunt for a moment and think about how air-headed some people have to be to walk into a direct projector beam
&gt;This light addiction is pretty bad for some of the bugs, you should not blame her for that but this is a fucking cinema, so what was she thinking ? 
&gt;Maybe this is the only way she can get a fix ? 
&gt;Cinema tickets are relatively cheap…
&gt;You turn your attention back to the screen and soon the girl is forgotten
&gt;Godzilla and Mothra clash against each other, muscles are bulging under scales and the chitin is glistering
&gt;There is the moment a long claw crashes down on her frame and nearly rips her top apart
&gt;Like every time you sit on the edge of your seat, hoping that just once you managed to get the legendary copy where they accidentally ripped it for real
&gt;There are rumors that is exists
&gt;The claw is brushing through her fluff, to her top and then...
&gt;It brushes past, just like the last dozen times
&gt;Disappointed you fall back into your chair and grab a fresh hand of popcorn
&gt;Your fingers reach for the salty snack and then brush over something hard and cool
&gt;The bug girl, a moth is next to you, reaching for the snacks
&gt;As she notices that you noticed her she quickly retreats the hand and tries to focus on the screen again
&gt;A few crumbs of popcorn are still around her mandibles
&gt;Now that you look at her a bit closer you can see her clothes, ripped and a bit dirty, clearly second hand
&gt;She tries her best to evade your gaze


&gt;Well, that is just a dirty move and you were about to feel sorry for her
&gt;Not wanting to ruin the rest of the movie you place the popcorn on the other side of your seat and continue watching
&gt;Soon the end credits roll and no antenna covered head has moved in front of the projector again so you can concentrate on silently whispering the last line of the movie
&gt;”Until they may return”
&gt;And you so hope that Mothra might return but the movie is nearly 20 years old by now and so far no sequel has come
&gt;As the lights turn on again you look around but the moth girl has gone
&gt;Outside you throw the empty can and the bucket away and stretch your arms and legs
&gt;It is night now, close to 10 PM and tomorrow is the weekend so there is nothing you have to worry about
&gt;After a healthy yawn you walk around the area a bit, maybe a nice snack for the way home will be a good idea in this winter weather
&gt;You are about to spend some money at the snack bar (human food, anthro food and even a few spiced cloth strips for moths due to the owners) when you hear whispers from the open manager&#039;s office
&gt;There is no one at the stand so you slowly sneak over there to listen
&gt;The moth girl from before is arguing with the owner of the Cinema
&gt;Both are insects, a moth, and an ant
&gt;”Listen Akari, I told you again and again. You can watch any movie for free but please stop blocking the projector. The customers are complaining about that. Do you understand ?”
&gt;The moth girls fiddles with a hole in her sweater and nods
&gt;”Yes Mister. I am sorry but, but...I wanted to see mom smiling again. And when she was hit I felt bad and looked away and then the light and….I am sorry”
&gt;At this moment the ant man spots you, waving you inside with two of his four arms
&gt;”You, yes you come on in. If you are here to complain about the blocking of the movie then I could, of course, offer you a free ticket and….Akari ? is everything alright ?”
&gt;The moth girl has shrunken in her seat after seeing you


&gt;As you enter the room the moth girl is shrinking into her chair, trying to hide from view
&gt;”Is everything alright Akari ? You look like you...please tell me you did not steal food again”
&gt;The ant turns to you, probably to ask if she did but you ignore him
&gt;instead you march straight through his office with the signed movie posters on the wall and embrace the moth girl in a hug
&gt;She squeaks as you do so, her fluff parting under your fingers and her wings are flapping a bit through the holes in her sweatshirt
&gt;”Whaaa ??” She sounds shocked like she did not expect that
&gt;”Oh, how wonderful that you found a friend Akari. You did not tell me about him before. I am sure now you will soon be able to stand on your own feet again”
&gt;The ant ushers both of you out of his office and onto the street before the cinema
&gt;”Go now, you should not dwell. The night is still young so have fun”. 
&gt;He hands you a few free tickets for the cinema (only valuable in combination with a paid one) and is gone again
&gt;Together the two of you stand in front of the cinema, a few paper lanterns out of plastic are illuminating the San Fransokyo street here
&gt;A soft rain is falling down while steam rises from a manhole cover
&gt;”What...what was that ?”
&gt;The fluffy girl is still shocked


&gt;The moth girl is shocked by your invitation to grab a bite to eat but quickly agrees to that.
&gt;”Oh, yes that sounds great. I know a place down the street that makes great noodles with old jeans”. 
&gt;Then she grabs your arm and walks off, dragging you with her into a dark alleyway
&gt;On your way she says that she is really sorry about the whole projector thing and the popcorn thing as well
&gt;”I was just so hungry, you know ? And you had so much of the stuff”. 
&gt;You had indeed, a lot more than you actually ate
&gt;And now that you think about it you start to feel a bit bad again
&gt;”Anyway, Nice to meet you Anon, I am Akari. My mom said that means light and I think it is fitting. Oh, Neon !”
&gt;Her body is moving past a shop window but her head is turning like that of an owl as you walk past an electronics shop
&gt;A single Neon light is still working, flickering and illuminating the street and she is momentarily completely taken by it before it turns off
&gt;”Ahhh…..”

&gt;After what feels like half an hour of walking deeper and deeper into the slums the two of you finally tumble out of the darkness again
&gt;A large cube hotel “The Hive” is standing at the corner of the street, right next to a noodle shop that seems to have specialized on insect guests
&gt;Your fleshy skin is rare around here, most others wear a healthy sheet of chitin to protect them from the acidic rain
&gt;”Here we are, two large cups of noodles” 
&gt;She managed to order that stuff in seconds and is now placing the cup in front of you
&gt;Fried noodles with blue jeans fabric poking out
&gt;”Can I have the clothes ?” 
&gt;Akari is looking at you, the chopsticks raised halfway to your cup
&gt;”They are with teriyaki sauce, my favorite. And yes, my mom is Mothra. Or at least the was Mothra. Years ago”. 


&gt;Maybe this is the time to finally grow some balls and try to reenact that scene from the old cartoon you once saw
&gt;The noodles are a bit strange to handle but you somehow manage it to lift one of the pieces of jeans fabric coated in the spicy sauce to her mouth and she opens it
&gt;The mandibles part and reveal a rather soft mouth with a cute purple tongue that seems to be covered in soft barbs
&gt;Makes sense, they have to grind up wool and yarn after all
&gt;You place the chopsticks between the mandibles and they shut close, dragging the fabric in
&gt;The noodles are slurped and you grab the end of them to suck as well
&gt;Slowly you close in against each other but before your lips can touch she stops, biting through the noodles
&gt;”What are you doing ? But thanks for the fabric, It is my favorite”
&gt;She smiles and the chitin of her mandibles shines
&gt;”You look troubled, something on your mind ?”
&gt;Before you can really think about it you simply talk about the tit version of the movie you just saw
&gt;Akari nearly chokes on her noodles at that and coughs for a bit
&gt;”You know of that ? Eahh...I mean...No, that does not exist, not at all”. 
&gt;She has a terrible poker face and now your interest is rising
&gt;”No, listen, there is no way..if that comes out….well. Well, what would happen anyway ? Tell you what, you order me more noodles and I will show you the video, deal ?” 
&gt;You ask her if you can touch her breasts and she nods
&gt;”Sure, go ahead. But only the fluff, not the nipples. And only after you buy me a new sweatshirt”. 


&gt;You swallow the noodles and stand up to follow her as she leaves the shop
&gt;On the way out you purchase a gift card for her to get more noodles soon, the centipede owner waving you goodbye as you leave
&gt;Akari steps out of the shop and then straight into the coffin hotel
&gt;Inside the small cubes are stacked tight, a hundred people living on maybe 5 square meters the way this thing is stacked
&gt;Loud music is blasting from speakers, people cook on camping gas canisters in the hallways and there is a constant trading all around
&gt;Mostly drugs and small slips of paper money
&gt;You try not to look
&gt;The hexagon shapes remind you of the interior of a beehive and that is also what it looks like
&gt;A bee woman is sitting in front of her cubicle, begging for money while her kid is squirming as a larvae in a hones glass pot
&gt;Akari knows her way through the maze and soon stops in front of a cube that looks exactly like all the others
&gt;”Here we are. Hey mom, I brought a friend !”
&gt;She shouts and knocks, then just opens the door and lets you in
&gt;The interior is messy, stuffed with old clothes, paper bags with documents, books and everything a small family needs
&gt;Just condensated on maybe 4 square meters with a second bed in 2 meters height
&gt;A older moth is sitting in the corner, flicking through an old photo book and occasionally shines a bright light into her eyes
&gt;The flashlight seems to have been built from an old photography lamp, many times stronger than any normal light
&gt;The hum of heavy batteries being drained to power the capacitor is filling the air
&gt;She completely ignores you, lost in her memories, but you recognize her
&gt;Mothra, or better, the woman that played her so long ago
&gt;Akari climbs down from the bed and hands you a videotape with a red marking
&gt;”Here, wanna watch it here ? Just never let it reach the outside”. 



&gt;”Well, Mom had this really big hit and then she moved here. Then she did not get a second hit and, well...we ended up here. She takes it the worst and is always on a trip down memory lane”
&gt;Akari stops for a moment as her mother shines the light again, her mandibles drop a bit and it looks like she might start to drool any moment
&gt;You are reminded again of the old health note in class, something about how light pollution is harmful to certain insects the way passive smoking is to humans
&gt;Maybe that is why she...no that is not nice to think
&gt;”Well, you held your promise so I hold mine. Mom always said that I could use any method available to make money unless it involves me selling my body. Should have been more specific about hers then”
&gt;She opens up a small recorder and slots the tape, starting the movie on a grainy screen
&gt;The resolution is terrible but you can see that this version is almost exactly the same as all others
&gt;Then the fight scene comes, Godzilla draws the claw and...snaps the bra
&gt;For a moment sheer inertia keeps the tits where they are, then the fluffy breasts spill forward, pushing the remains of the costume away
&gt;Red, yellow and white fur is displayed, tipped with black nipples that harden on the cool studio air
&gt;A loud “CUT” is audible but the video continues, showing how Mothra yelps and hides her breasts before suddenly laughing loud and freeing them again
&gt;”Well, if we do this then I am sure Godzilla would not be able to resist my pheromones anymore” 
&gt;Shy laughter from someone offscreen and then the video stops
&gt;You comment on the frozen picture of Mothra, her hands on her hips and breasts swinging freely how similar her daughter is to her
&gt;”Thanks. Always wanted to be an actress you know. There are not that many moth actors, the bright spotlights can be….you know.”
&gt;She stops, her eyes traveling over her mother in the corner and suddenly looks up
&gt;”Are you saying you like my breasts ?” 

&gt;There you are, in a light drug den
&gt;Right next to the woman you dreamed off, her daughter sitting in front of you with a video of the tits you hunted for years
&gt;Behind the girl is her bed, the walls covered in cosplay drawings and half-eaten jeans
&gt;She is leaning closer now, a naughty grin on her face
&gt;You get the feeling that you have to protect your clothes now
&gt;In more than one sense….

&gt;Your fears were soon proven right as she charged you, the small cube room offering next to no space to retreat from the attack
&gt;For a moment she seemed to nibble on your shirt but then she let go again, pinning you to the ground
&gt;Your head is nearly shoved into a small bag of plastic bags
&gt;”Well, there we are my cutie, looks like you are now in the hands of your sworn enemy”
&gt;She makes the pose that Mothra did in the movie trailer, just not standing and instead sitting on your chest
&gt;That moth girl is so light you could lift her with one hand but her insect reflexes could make it difficult
&gt;”Well, say my name villian, and I my be willing to show mercy to you”
&gt;Her face is smug as she looks down on you, her sweatshirt already halfway gone
&gt;”The play was wonderful I have to admit. Fainting interest in my mother to get to me and then that compliment, well done indeed. Now say my name”
&gt;You try to ponder your ways out of here for now, indulging in her fantasy could lead to some moth sex but do you really want that ?
&gt;Her sweatshirt comes off and the fluffy breasts appear, soft flesh that hardens to chitin on her midriff, all covered in a thin layer of white fluff
&gt;Yes, you want that sweet moth pussy, your dick and your brain have reached a decision
&gt;Slowly you nod your head at the sight of her tits and swallow hard, your mouth is still dry from the cheap noodles
&gt;You call her mothra and she smiles
&gt;”Well done villain, now louder”
&gt;She allows you to move away a bit while she removes her jeans, the space in this cube is not allowing her to do a dignified stripping session
&gt;You call her mothra again, louder this time
&gt;Then something warm and fluffy engulfs your head from behind
&gt;Her mother, the original mothra, has arisen from her light fueled dream and is now resting her own, considerably bigger breasts, on your shoulders
&gt;You gulp again, louder this time, while she blinks a few times
&gt;”Huh ? What is..I heard my name and then ….” 
&gt;Her eyes scan the room, from her daughter to the tv that is still showing her topless and happy past
&gt;”Oh, so that is going on……”
&gt;She sounds embarrassed about the whole thing, clearly trying to make you forget that you just saw her drugged out of her mind
&gt;”Listen boy, I have no idea who you are but if my daughter”, she points to the girl that is still fighting with her pants “trusts you then I do the same”
&gt;There is silence for a moment, her japanese accent heavy and thick in the air, before Akari celebrates her nudity with a cheer
&gt;”Moooom, let him go, he is my boyfriend !”
&gt;Wait what ?
&gt;The older woman just smirks
&gt;”Yes, and he can stay it if you guys can follow two simple rules”
&gt;She points at her daughter
&gt;”First, get a condom girl. We have absolutely no money for a larvae and they come free after all”
&gt;Then she points at you
&gt;”Second, can you keep a secret boy ? Promise to not talk about anything in here. I have an audition in a few days and I want nobody to learn about this”
&gt;There were rumors about a return of some Godzilla thing but you did not pay that much attention to it
&gt;The same rumor also talked about the tit tape though, so maybe there is something going on there
&gt;You nod, your eyes drawn to Akaris backside as she searches through the boxes for a condom, her small slit wiggling enticingly in tune with her wings

&gt;”Yes, just like this Aki, ride him nice and slow”
&gt;You groan into the white fluff of Mothras breasts, both woman naked now and working together to show you what they can do
&gt;Akari is riding your dick, her soft and tight moth pussy with the incredibly silky pubic fluff is clamping down hard
&gt;Her mother meanwhile is holding you up, her naked body like a bed to you, two massive breasts as pillows
&gt;One of your hands is holding Akaris hand, finger interwindes while the second is squeezing her left breasts
&gt;Mothras own hand guides your fingers from one C cup to the other, then down to the small clit that makes the small girl moan in pleasure if you touch it
&gt;There is something incredibly warm and wet pressing against your ass, which is laying on Mothras hips
&gt;Their soft and brushlike antenna are dancing through the air
&gt;Akari is grabbing one to preen it, the motion seems to entice her even more
&gt;You decide to take charge for now and grab two of the fluffy things that dance between the two woman
&gt;As your fingers dig into them heavy moans are your reward
&gt;”Oh my, Aki you got yourself a keeper”
&gt;Your new girlfriend is just moaning before she suddenly squeaks and cums, the spasms milking your dick with incredible force
&gt;In the corner of your mind you remember a long forgotten biology lecture about how insects mate for days and then use the stored semen for years
&gt;You can no longer remember if that was only true for ants or if moths have the same approach
&gt;Looks like you will soon find out
&gt;The industry strength lamp in the corner is forgotten for now
&gt;Maybe forever, if you can help them out
&gt;Mothras new project is a real porn parody of Godzilla and she will need some study buddy to rehearse the plot
