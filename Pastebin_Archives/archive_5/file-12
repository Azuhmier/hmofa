        <textarea class="textarea">First Blood [Hellhound; Halloween, Blood Sucking, Lewd]: In your typical horror fashion, Anon becomes the latest victim of a hellhound&#039;s vices as the Halloween night comes to a close.

Link to the spiritual successor, &quot;Hellhound of the Morning&quot;: https://pastebin.com/8X1aSSvX

&gt;It’s a little after three in the morning
&gt;The night of Halloween
&gt;Your place was the last stop on the gauntlet of party-hopping debauchery
&gt;Luckily, half the crew you started out with had ditched the group as the night progressed
&gt;Meaning you had your night of fun and didn’t have to clean up too much afterwards
&gt;Everyone who came to your place was able to leave; nobody to crash at your place overnight
&gt;In fact, some of them were pretty sober by the end of it
&gt;Including a girl in a typical “sexy devil” costume who wouldn’t take her eyes off you
&gt;Your friends elbowed you in the ribs and tried to get you to hook up with her
&gt;But the moment you decided to make a move she had already left
&gt;Bummer
&gt;So it’s another lonely night for Anon once the last guest left
&gt;You can barely sleep after all that, and after a night of drinking you’re feeling alcohol-induced peckishness
&gt;You could hold out until morning, or grab a quick snack
&gt;Hunger wins out, so you hop out of bed almost immediately after getting into it and head over to your refrigerator to scavenge what you can
&gt;Seems like someone already beat you to it
&gt;The door is open and a dark shape is rooting around inside
&gt;You see something glistening in the shadows, and moaning coming from where the light radiates
&gt;You throw the lights on, but the darkness standing before the fridge remains
&gt;It’s a voluptuous female shape, but with the legs, arms, and head of a black-furred canine
&gt;She’s already unlike any dog you’ve ever seen just by being two-legged, but the sharp horns, bat wings, crimson eyes, and spaded tail also make her unlike any two-legged dog you could have ever imagined
&gt;Completely nude; the glistening you saw was her slick, aroused, rosy lips squeezed between a heavy rump
&gt;She turns to look at you with a thick roll of salami punctured between her teeth
&gt;She grins around the meat and snaps it in half, hanging on to the two parts with a long, curling, forked tongue so that she can swallow them whole one at a time
&gt;You watch the chunks travel down her throat in huge bulges
&gt;”Looks like we both had the same idea,” she says with a sultry tone. “A little bite in the witching hour.”
&gt;Just then it hits you
&gt;This was the girl from the parties
&gt;Or, at least she has the same devilish accessories as her
&gt;But this is some kind of unbelievable canine-devil hybrid
&gt;Like a succubus mixed with a hellhound
&gt;As she struts over to you on the tips of her paw pads you are smacked with her aroma
&gt;It’s not perfume, but lust and pure pheromones
&gt;And yet there is also a seed of dread inside you
&gt;”You must know how I’ve been watching you all night, Anon.”
&gt;She reaches up and runs her black nails across your cheek
&gt;Hell is not fire and brimstone, but a chilling temptation like the one running down your spine
&gt;”Not every man is lucky to be my prey. You haven’t been very lucky in your love life, but it’s all going to change before the sun rises.”
&gt;Her muzzle pulls back into a wicked smile
&gt;You need to run, the voice in your head says
&gt;But where? You’re already in the safest place you can think of, and it’s not like you can come back with this hellhound still hanging around
&gt;Although, she DID mention the sun
&gt;Maybe you just have to stall her until morning?
&gt;You say a quick goodbye and run to your door
&gt;When you open it up, you wish you hadn’t
&gt;The maw of some cosmic horror is on the other side, teeth lining its throat like a hideous blender
&gt;You hear the muffled screams of victims deep within its gullet, and it doesn’t intend on passing up yet another meal
&gt;A thin rope wraps around your waist and pulls you back into the room
&gt;It’s not just a rope; it’s the hellhound’s whippy tail
&gt;And you’re no longer back home, but in a succubus’ lair
&gt;Red and black satin everywhere
&gt;Bondage gear adorning the walls like ornaments or art
&gt;Bottles and wine glasses filled with something you know isn’t wine
&gt;You’re on the floor with the hellhound looming over you
&gt;A fleck of her feminine juices drips down onto your forehead
&gt;It burns hotter than any boiling water could
&gt;But you can’t scream
&gt;Her tail had worked its way up to your head and gagged your mouth as you lay on the needle-like carpet
&gt;”You are a bad, bad boy, Anon,” she scolds. “Running away from a lady? You should stop and get to know me. After all, we’re going to be together for an eternity.”
&gt;You’re pulled to your feet by your neck, and then the tail becomes lax
&gt;Only to reposition itself back to your waist
&gt;With your arms pinned to your sides
&gt;”I was going to give you unsurpassable pleasure, the typical “mortal” way…”
&gt;Her front paws, her “hands”, rest on your shoulders
&gt;”But now I see you’ll need something with a little more discipline involved.”
&gt;Her once petite bat wings grow into a massive pair
&gt;They curl around your ensnared form like a cage
&gt;”Now then. When was the last time you had your blood drawn?”
&gt;Every beat of your heart lets her tail tighten its constriction
&gt;It’s like a tourniquet for your whole body
&gt;The blood rushes to your head, and sweat pours out of your skin to cool the sudden heat
&gt;”You know what they say: it’s the initial prick that hurts the most.”
&gt;Her muzzle opens to reveal two long, thin fangs
&gt;You barely have enough time to let out a gasp before she clamps her mouth around the base of your neck
&gt;The sensation is deep, but it’s not enough to send you into shock
&gt;In fact, the longer she holds the position the duller the pain gets
&gt;She gives a powerful suck
&gt;It feels as though your very soul is draining into her
&gt;But with the quick pause for air she injects a new feeling into you
&gt;It’s pure adrenaline mixed with an aphrodisiac
&gt;Every inhale pumps a little more blood into your shaft, until you’re painfully erect
&gt;Every surge feels as though you’re completely drained of your blood, then filled back up with her exhale
&gt;And every draw seems to pull a little more of your essence with it
&gt;You’re close to blacking out whenever she draws you into her throat, and when she pauses for even the shortest time you’re dragged back to her feverish reality
&gt;The only thing stable is your throbbing length, which is so cripplingly sensitive you’re afraid to regain any sensation in your body
&gt;While the fluids syphoned out of you flow quickly, something thicker slowly creeps forward from your groin
&gt;Your gasping becomes a countdown for the climax, each one getting higher and higher
&gt;Her tail unravels around you, and it’s like taking the knot out of a garden hose
&gt;Until the rush is stopped by a valve
&gt;Your release is denied by a single finger of the hellhound’s paw
&gt;Whatever fiendish trick she’s using, it’s more than effective
&gt;You’re grunting and whining, holding in the deluge as she chuckles at you mockingly
&gt;Even the jack-o-lanterns sneer at you with fiery eyes
&gt;She’s saying something, but you’re under too much duress to hear her
&gt;But what she’s saying could be your salvation
&gt;Or not
&gt;”It’s all but written in blood already, but…I want to hear it from your own lips.”
&gt;A black, razor claw from her other paw points to your heart
&gt;”Your soul. Will you give it to me?”
&gt;Anything
&gt;You’ll say anything to get your sexual liberation
&gt;You can’t even actually say anything, you just feebly nod your head
&gt;”Mmmm, good. Then let’s get it in ink…”
&gt;When you finally release, it’s a torrent
&gt;There’s no way you could consider this pleasurable
&gt;But somehow you do
&gt;The afterglow of your orgasm is sweeter than the actual thing
&gt;Time freezes, and you reach out with your freed arms for anything to hold for stability
&gt;Your vision returns slowly
&gt;Now you’re lucid enough you see your handiwork
&gt;You coated the hellhound’s stomach with your semen
&gt;The white strands sizzle on her scorching abdomen
&gt;She scoops as much as she can with a finger and licks it off
&gt;It’s then you realize it’s her breasts you were holding on to for stability
&gt;The flesh of her nipples burns your palms like soldering irons
&gt;You can’t let go
&gt;It’s as though the heat fused your hands to her chest
&gt;”Taking the initiative? I like that. We can’t have you all soft and submissive when we start the REAL fun. No no, that’s for afterwards, when I decide to break you.”
&gt;She leans in close to your ear, whispering sinisterly
&gt;”And we haven’t even…’scratched the surface’ yet.”
&gt;Her fangs hover over the opposite side of your neck
&gt;You relive every excruciating moment in a fraction of a second before her pearly daggers even touch your skin
&gt;When they do, the whole process starts all over again
&gt;Rapture mixes with suffering
&gt;Tears pour over shaky smiles
&gt;You’re suffocated by both her enthralling scent and the hearty musk in the room
&gt;Unconsciousness takes you mercifully, though the fleeting laughter of the hellhound follows you into the darkness

&gt;You break out of sleep paralysis
&gt;It’s never been this bad before, but at least it’s all over
&gt;You feel gross, to put it lightly
&gt;Lying in a literal pool of sweat
&gt;You enjoy the sounds of the morning, and the light peeking through the window
&gt;You’re panting heavily long after you rub the sleep from your eyes
&gt;No other dream has been as vivid for you, ever
&gt;Maybe it was some bad food?
&gt;You wonder to yourself what you could have eaten to cause such a nightmare
&gt;But was it really a “nightmare”?
&gt;Now that you’re awake, you can laugh at how afraid you were
&gt;It really wasn’t so bad, right?
&gt;Like analyzing the ridiculousness of a nighttime illusion
&gt;You can pick out the most pleasurable moments and keep them for later
&gt;A little bit of fright was worth that sexual fantasy, wasn’t it?
&gt;”Mmm, I sure think so.”
&gt;Your eyes go wide
&gt;The midnight fur of the hellhound’s arm passes over your eyes as she pulls you into a binding squeeze
&gt;”Just a little bit of fright…and your eternal soul. Wasn’t such a bad tradeoff, hmm?”
&gt;The light outside your window is snuffed out, leaving only a supernatural void
&gt;Your room glows with a hellish red tint, and you can make out the shadows of damned souls looming over your bed
&gt;”Whenever you’re ready, we’ll head back to MY place, little morsel.”
&gt;She grins, then cackles
&gt;And so do the shadows around you</textarea>
