As such, making out direct speech is tiring. However, that also means that the entire structure of the language is now garbage, making it quite the extensive rewrite as greentext mannerisms like TFW, YFW or meme.jpg as communicative tools are also no longer working. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Ideally, we would get greentext syntax highlighting native on pastebin, but I don&#039;t see them supporting that anytime soon unless /k/s /ak/-thread starts asking them for it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1"> &gt;be out with humie gf</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s wearing a plaited skirt because we went out dancing, now on our way to her place</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;we walk through some dark spots because the long way round is at least 20 minutes more and we&#039;re tired</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;when suddenly, you get pulled aside by big furry paws as a panther girl pulls you deeper in to one of the dark spots</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your girlfriend screams angrily and pulls on your arm but she is the twiggy wallflower type, not that she is ugly, but both of you stay slim by eating less and not by lifting. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the panther girl is clearly not interested in her at all, as she ignores her at first and then gives her a backhand that makes you worry she might be dead</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She&#039;s fine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;says panther girl as she pushes you against a wall, then moves your arms to one of her paws and uses the other to drag your pants down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her paw moves to your throat as she starts to choke you while pushing her huge tiddies againts you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;this woman is an amazon if there ever was one</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she lets go of your arms and ignores your attempts to push her off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your dick, despite your fear, hardens and she smiles a toothy smile</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;jesus fuck those incisors are big</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">good boy. You&#039;ll like this.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;and she pulls you to the ground, so she can sit on your lap</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she pulls her sport pants aside, having pulled up her runner&#039;s bra earlier, enough to slide you inside of her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">haaa...aaaa...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;even a girl like her gets a little shaken when the D goes in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s super wet and tighter than you&#039;d think, given the fact that she is at least 6 feet tall</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she slowly slides forwards and backwards, beginning to grind your dick and out of her and your scrawny ass across the pavement</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;behind her, something moves and your scrawny gf gets back up, blinks and then starts to bawl while screaming and attacking</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; panther girl looks annoyed until your gf grabs pnather&#039;s ponytail and pulls on it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your combined efforts of pusshing and pulling still haven&#039;t gotten her off, but her rhythm has slowed and become unsteady as she focuses on dealing with you two</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she lets out a roar of frustrated anger as your gf tries to drag her off of you </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;if your dick wasn&#039;t balls deep in tight pussy, the face she was making and that roar would have definitely shrunk you to peanut size</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your gf, like any woman, doesn&#039;t seem to have a concept of when its time to stop fucking with someone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;panther girl lifts her hips just far enough for you to not pop out entirely and grabs your gf&#039;s head with one of her paws, using the other to pry her hand open so her hair is once more free. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she whips your gf around and pins her against the wall that you&#039;re crumpled against, then backhands her, leading to just choking her as your gf digs her nails in to the fur on her arm to get her to stop. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;panther girl sits down on your dick again and resumes her rhythm, easily counteracting your attempts of pushing her around. As your gf sobs next to you, intermittently screeching with anger, panther girl speeds up significantly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a moment ago, you thought this was going to end, but now you&#039;re both locked down and panther girl can do whatever she wants, which seems to be making you cum, balls deep. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her hips apporach lighting speed as she pummels you and you can feel the orgasm coming on, a strong one. She chokes you pretty hard, your arms start feeling like noodles as you feel yourself going over the edge. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; it feels like pushing fabric through a hole too tiny for the garment. Your body convulses like your gf&#039;s when you eat her out and you buck enough to actually push her up a little. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;panther girl smiles a goofy smile at you, then pecks you on your lips. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">thanks for that, hero. I needed that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;hero? wtf</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sighs, then gets up and takes a few steps back while adjusting her attire to sit normally. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You won&#039;t get away with this.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your girlfriend hasn&#039;t got the strength to get up yet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but apparently already able to make empty threats through a horse throat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;while she does so, she gets up and tends to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;m calling the police.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; panther girl chuckles</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;more tears roll down your gfs face and she tries to pull up your pants to hide your dick</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Do it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I will!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you put your arm out on your gfs arm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">don&#039;t bother</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you croak, as panther girl nods to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He know&#039;s whats up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she chuckles, then walks out in to the street, quickly jogging again as if nothing had happened at all</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your gf yells after her, attempting to stop her but unwilling to leave her side</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she turns back to you, sorrow in her eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">i&#039;m so sorry...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;then she starts bawling again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you mechanically button up your pants and tuck your sloppy messy dick away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;slowly, she follows you up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as you exit the dark alley and come back in to the yellow light of the street lamps, she swallows her tears</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We.. we&#039;ve got to get to the police</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You follow her on autopilot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s holding you while you walk, directing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the next police station isn&#039;t far away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the desk seargent looks bored</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;his look changes somewhat, as you two walk in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; your girlfriend wants to do the talking, but there are a couple of guys in here, lounging around so you put your hand on your arm to stop her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; you approach the desk sargeant</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Good Evening. How may I help you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I... can I talk to someone somewhere more private?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The desk sargeant gives you a weird look.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Uh. Yeah, sure. It would help if I knew what this was about though.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;d rather not tell in public.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;his eyes flicker between you and your gf, who stands behind you with her arms crossed. She&#039;s mildly annoyed that you wouldn&#039;t let her do this for you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You&#039;re going to have to give me something so I can get you the right colleague to talk to.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you swallow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I was... assaulted.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;he raises an eyebrow. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">and you can&#039;t talk to me about this here because...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you want to go home so badly. Nothing feels more emasculating than telling someone that you got raped.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you turn to your gf, who gibes you a &#039;go on&#039; look. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I can&#039;t. Please?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He frowns, than slides his chair backwards in to the corridor on the other side of the protective glass. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;ll be right back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you turn to your gf, who closes the distance. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You should have told him about the -</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stop her mid sentence. Not in a room full of guys, that would be absolutely humiliating. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;ll talk to them. Okay?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she seems to disapprove and quietly whispers to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">All of these people here, they probably are here because, like, their bike got stolen or they lost their pet or dumb shit like that but you&#039;re here because you were fucking raped and -</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the door leading in to the station opens and blond woman looks through the door, accompanied by the desk sargeant who waves you over. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You cut your gf off, having internally cringed as she said the r-word. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hi. I&#039;m detective Christensen. You had something you want to talk about?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you nod and walk through the door she holds open. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You good?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles and responds to the desk sargeant. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Thanks, Harry. We&#039;ll be at my desk. And who might you be?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your gf stops, seemingly pissy that this isn&#039;t immediatly obvious. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;m his Girlfriend.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alright.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Instant animosity. Great. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the two of you follow her through the small station in to a room with just one desk in it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You&#039;re lucky i&#039;m working late today. Anyway. Coffee, tea?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your gf softly prods you and quietly repeats the question. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">tea?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you nod. Tea seems nice. Internally, you&#039;re quite happy that you&#039;re not talking to a dude.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Both of you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; your gf nods as well. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alright, i&#039;ll get the water boiling. Both of you can sit down in front of my desk and we&#039;ll start in a minute.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Detective Christensen starts boiling water, fixes herself another cup of coffee and sets out mugs with teabags in them, then sits down in her chair, produces a notepad and a pen and clicks it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">why don&#039;t we start with who you are.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you answer her questions as she methodically asks for your info.&gt;she also takes down your gf&#039;s info</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Why don&#039;t you tell me what you were doing before the assault.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">it wasn&#039;t assault, it was rape.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your gf immediatly jumps the gun</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Detective christensen comes a lot more lively almost immediately. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You were raped?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No, he was.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;that gets you a raised eye brow, as you try to disappear in to the chair you&#039;re on. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You were raped? What did he look like?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You just let your gf do the talking at this point and focus on the pens in a cup on Christensen&#039;s desk. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It was a woman. A black panther chimera.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Christensen&#039;s eyebrow is raised significantly, as she looks at you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you mumble a confirmation, as christensen starts writing while your gf tells the whole story. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;slowly but steadily, christensens enthusiasm wanes until all that is left is a frown. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So you two were fighting her off, but she still managed to do what she wanted?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yes!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your gf seemingly has become quite irritated and impatient. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Christensen looks at you, while you cling on to the mug of tea that she got you earlier. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Jenna, right? Would you mind leaving me alone with anon for a second?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Wha-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Just a minute or two. You can sit outside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your girlfriend snaps her mouth shut. She seems severily irritated now and leaves in a huff. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;christensen shuts the door behind her and then turns to you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Can you recount the entire thing for me, with your own words, please?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you do, and you notice that the detective is making no notes whatsoever, instead piercing you with her gaze. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the ask a few clarifying questions, but not many, culminating in the final one</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Did you cum?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you mumble something. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I ask again. Did you have an orgasm?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">well... yes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;something seems to close in the detectives eyes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She exhales, then inhales loudly. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alright, here is what I think happened: You know that girl. This was supposed to be some fetish thing after you dropped your girl outside off. Maybe this is the new way to end relationships among you kids. Whatever. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I don&#039;t care. I don&#039;t believe this was rape for one second. Know how I do? I have rape cases in here every month. The guy just overpowered the girl and yhe slumps there just like you do, telling me the story of how she got taken. Overpowered. You know how many stories to the contrary i hear, a girl overpowering a guy? very fucking few.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Know how many stories I hear of a guy and a girl getting overpowered by a single woman? zilch. Never happens. Wanna know why? Because it&#039;s impossible.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Which means you&#039;re full of shit. I&#039;m one hundred percent certain that you could have fought your way out if you&#039;d wanted to.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So i&#039;m not going to do anything.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What I am going to do is I am going to set your girl straight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She punched the intercom. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Harry, one of my two is done, can you escort him out?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the intercom responded</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Lenny will be with you in a sec.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Thanks.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she turned to you again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Send your girl back in on your way out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wondering how this could have gotten any worse, you leave the room and an officer waits for you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You motion Jenna back inside with your eyes as the officer escorts you through the station and back out, to the desk sargeant.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It doesn&#039;t take much longer for your furious girlfriend to storm out of the station. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She grabs you and pulls you out of the building, responding to a </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">good evening!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;by a guy next to the door with </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Fuck you too!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s absolutely brimming with rage. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">They don&#039;t fucking believe us. Can you imagine that? I told her all about this and she doesn&#039;t fucking believe its real. She tried to tell me that you were cheating on me. What the fuck is wrong with these people?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A ball of fiery rage dripping tears of pure anger drags you along to her place, so easily visible that even the half naked retards usually hollering at girls try and disappear in to the streets. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it lasts until you arrive at her place. There, she collapses and weeps like a waterfountain, clinging on to you, sobbing how sorry she was over and over again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you feel dirty</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;there is crusty stuff all over your dick. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have this overwhelming need to go clean yourself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Jenna,</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as you say her name, she immediatly looks up at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I need a shower</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she comes around a little, smiling through her tears</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">o-of course.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pushes you in to the direction of the shower, still weeping. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stumble your way in and slowly take your clothes off, then get hot watwr going and start slowly washing your body, then more aggressively scrubbing yourself down until jenna interrupts you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">How are you doing?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The shower has gone cold and you&#039;ve frozen with your dick in hand, red as a lobster, using one of her scrubbers on it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see her behind the shower curtain, peeking in through the slightly ajar bathroom door. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are struck by the sudden fear that she might see this as odd</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Jenna, do you believe me?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She walks in to the bathroom, then pulls the shower curtain aside. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your eyes meet and she searches yours</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I do. I was there, honey.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her tears are flowing again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shuts off the water, then stands on her toes to hug you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a long time, she lets go, pushing back against your embrace of her and takes the scrubber and shampoo out of your hands, then leads you out and wraps you in a towel. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re feeling better, now that you&#039;re squeaky clean. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;gradually, you take Jenna in to your arms and you hold each other again for a while, during which you finally crack and tear up, not even entirely sure what about. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after a while, you both just go to bed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You curl up and for the first time ever, you can feel Jenna holding you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Next day, you spend a few hours sulking until you realize that it won&#039;t help. Jenna asks you to see a psychiatrist, but you&#039;re not feeling like discussing the matter further, instead opting to bury it deeper. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After breakfast, you decide to go home. &gt;Jenna had an appointment with friends of hers and you don&#039;t see the point of being in an appartment that isn&#039;t filled with your stuff. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;On your way home, you pass a gun store and decide there and then that this was the last time that anyone got to fuck with you physically without repercussions. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You walk in... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;... and leave without a pistol.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you do have an order for a CCP pistol for your noodly arms and signed up for a CCW course, and also brought an AR with you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You walk home, feeling a lot better, as if you finally have control again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Control is back. Your mancard got reissued. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it wasn&#039;t cheap, but it was worth it. &gt;Nothing says fuck off like a military style assault weapon. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At night, Jenna stops by your place. While she isn&#039;t happy about your purchase, she is understanding and having her around is comforting. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Over the next few days, your CCW course starts, you spend evenings at your local community college, making sure that you walk in groups or in brightly lit areas if you have to and you went back to work without missing a day. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;everything seems to be getting back to normal and fiddling with your guns has made you a lot more self confident. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the next chimera to try something will get some. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you have a random afternoon after you got off work, before you go down to your local college for your CCW class as your doorbell unexpectedly rings. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re not expecting anyone tonight. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You go to answer the intercom, but there is no answer as you cautiosly say </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">hello?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;instead, there is a light knock on the door. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you open the spy glass and peer through. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you see the empty corridor and reach for your AR, quitly racking one in to the chamber. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a black furry paw comes in to view.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you tense up, but the paw is holding something for you to see. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its a stick with a double oval outline, off white, with a pink tip on one side and a tiny window - shwoing two lines.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can hear her talk through the door. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We need to talk!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t feel like talking at all. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Go away!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she shows her face in the door spy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We can talk through the door and keep your neighbours entertained, or you can let me in!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;no fucking chance. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Fuck off!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alright, I&#039;m suing for alimony!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;oh fuck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;alimony? In this state? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;ohjeezohfuck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;d be turbofucked</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait, wouldn&#039;t she be admitting she raped you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">How are you going to argue in court that I have to pay for kids I did not willingly conceive?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her hand moves away form the door spy and you can see her face for the first time. It&#039;s not even nearly as frightening as you remember it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Can you just open your door and we can talk about this somewhat in private? Otherwise I&#039;m just gonna drop this in your girlfriend&#039;s letter box.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;ohshitohfuggohjeez</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You really don&#039;t want to open the door, despite feeling secure with your new aqcuisitions from a few days ago. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But maybe you can talk about this with one of them trained on her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you quickly think through your options. If you open the door, you can&#039;t have both of your hands on the rifle and you could be overwhelmed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you have to open the door and step away quickly, out of arm&#039;s reach. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but then, what if someone passes by? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They&#039;d surely do something about a chimera in a doorway with a dude in the flat aiming a rifle at them. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you have to be out of sight. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your apartment is somehwat shaped like a hotel room, the the left of the front door is the bathroom, beyond which the room opens up in to the kitchenette on the right and your living room where the bed in a hotel would normally be. Your bedroom is to the far left. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The smart move would be to unlatch the door, immediately retreat out of the hall in to the living room and move left, hiding behind the wall there, out of arms reach. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but wait. what if she snatches one of them out of your hands and turns it against you? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;dread of loss of power flows through you again and you quickly look around for your pistol and it&#039;s holster, but they&#039;re in the living room. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Wait, please!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You check the spyglass on more time and expect to see a frown and folded arms, instead she&#039;s looking down the corridor, seemingly at a state of total ease.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You run back in to the living room, slide the holster in to your jeans, then the gun in to the holster. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;oh wait, load one. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quietly chamber a round</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;then slide the gun in to the holster. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;sufficiently prepared, you return to the door and execute your plan. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;handle push, pull and jump backwards a few paces, beyoned the corner of the bathroom and a few paces more, then a quick 180 and guns up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Helloooo?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear the door being pushed open. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Just come in and walk in to the living room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;steps are moving through the hallway as you remember rule #1 of firearms just before they reach the corner: Never point a gun at something you don&#039;t immediately intend to shoot. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you don&#039;t relax your deathgrip one bit as you pull the muzzle from headheight down to 45 degrees, just as she walks in to the living room, looking in the direction of the kitchen. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;m here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she turns around and freezes, eyes wide. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Is that a real...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as she trails off, you nod. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">ooo...kay.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;well, this is going a lot better than you expected. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Did you shut the door?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she shakes her head very carefully. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You point to the couch, facing away from the hallway. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Sit down, if you want to talk.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you keep your eyes on her as she moves over to the couch, allowing you to move in to the hallway walking backwards while keeping out of reach. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as you reach the door, she sits down on the couch, hands out of sight. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her posture is straight as a rod, looking in your direction. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the door shuts with a click. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I guess i got lucky that night, eh?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She seems to be trying to break the ice. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You walk back in to the living room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What do you mean?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I mean, wouldn&#039;t you have shot me?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You think about it. Yeah. Absolutely. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Given the choice, just straight up shooting her to save you all the trouble would have been better. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I guess.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You continue moving, carefully staying out of reach until you can sit down at one end of the other couch in your living room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she gestures to the rifle you&#039;re still pointing in front of her feet. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Could you put that away?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yeah, no. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Absolutely not.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She raises an eyebrow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You know, lots of people die to their own guns.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You click the safety off. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Is that a threat?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she starts to respond, but your phone ringing cuts her off as you answer immediately. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;keeping your eyes on her, you pulled it out of your pants and saw out of the corner of your eyes that it was jenna. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you don&#039;t even wait for jenna to answer and cut her off midsentence</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She&#039;s here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;jenna takes a second to understand what you&#039;re saying. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She? who- WHAT?! WHERE?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, here. duh. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Here. My place.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You should have seen the explosion that followed coming, but the intensity still surprised you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">YOU LET HER IN? WHAT IN THE FUCK?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;that was uncalled for. you&#039;ve got the situation somewhat under control. For now. You have all the guns. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I have her at gunpoint.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look at the woman in front of you. For a rapist, she makes a surprisingly sympathetic face as Jenna exploded on the phone. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;m coming over. DON&#039;T. MOVE.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you put the phone down beside you as Jenna hung up the phone without even saying goodbye. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you put the phone down next to you, gripping the handguard of your rifle again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sit in silence a few seconds until she seems to have become seriously uncomfortable with it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Does she always scream at you like that?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you look your former assailant in the eye, you instantly deflect. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;then something occurs to you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">How do you know where I live?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shrugs apologetically. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We live in the same building...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait, she was stalking you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">... I saw you coming home yesterday.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;well, that doesn&#039;t mean she isn&#039;t a stalker. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Are you stalking me as well?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she looks you directly in the eyes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she still seems uncomfortable with the subject. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait, she lives in the same building? Above or below? How the fuck are you supposed to get out of the building from now on?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;what if you stand in an elevator and she comes in? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your CCL is still a few days off, you can&#039;t carry your CCP yet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could just walk the stairs instead</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but no one uses the stairs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And if she were to find out you were using the stairs, behind those heavy fire proof doors, no one would hear what goes on in there</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She could literally just wait for you there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, you could always... abseil form the balcony? Climb down the fire escape? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What&#039;s your name?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her question drags you out of your reverie. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You... don&#039;t know my name?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she folds her hands, playing with her thumbs, giving the impression of needing to occupy her fingers somehow. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No, I mean, I know your last name because of the plate at the door, but what&#039;s your first name? I mean, you&#039;re gonna be a dad one way or another and I&#039;d like to be able to give the kids your name, you know?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That&#039;s an awfully long explanation. Which you would have noticed, if it weren&#039;t for the fact that she just brought another issue back to the forefront of your mind:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re gonna be a babydaddy. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;jeez,rick.morty</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What&#039;s her name, anyway? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;m anon. What&#039;s your name?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">My name is Megan. Megan Riley. Nice to meet you...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She extends her hand over the coffee table, but you just raise your eyebrow, stalling her efforts to cheer up the mood immediatly with no chance for recovery. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Uh. Yeah. So, have you talked to anyone about anything and ...what&#039;s with the guns?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her hand falls back in to her lap and she seems a tad nervous. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You figure you can let her suffer a little. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah, i&#039;ve talked to a detective.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she starts fiddling with her hands again, then furrows her eyebrows and leans back in to the couch. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Bu-u-u-ut they didn&#039;t actually care. I mean, I&#039;m sitting here, free.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It doesn&#039;t feel like you should stop pressing the advantage here. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Until now, I didn&#039;t know where you lived, nor your name.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s still leaning back in to the couch, but her eyes open as if she realized she had just dun goofed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then they narrow again as she comes to another conclusion. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">But you aren&#039;t even calling the police about me being here. You know, to get me arrested.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fuck. That didn&#039;t last long. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you fumble some answer about pregnancy, but she doesn&#039;t even believe you for a second, hell, in retrospect, you wouldn&#039;t have either. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So did they not believe you or did they just not care?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel like an offensive player on a defense play. Absolutely not comfortable and wanting to be anywhere but here. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What does it matter to you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She attempts to push herself out of the couch. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So if i were to do it again...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your raise your rifle at lightning speed, clicking off the safety, pointing it directly between her eyes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You&#039;d die.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel like a fucking action star as she freezes mid motion, absolutely still, eyes widening. The rifle slid in to your should like it was made to be there, pointing unwavering, solid like a rock staright in to her face. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She swallows.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;apparently it came across as sincere as it was meant. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That&#039;s what the guns are for, by the way. Sit back down, please.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With that, you feel secure again. You have control over this situation. Your mancard was resissued, remember? What the fuck do you need cops for right now? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This actually feels really fucking good. You should have listened to your crazy guntoting uncle with those machine guns much earlier. The weirdo with the &quot;kommando&quot; patch. Can&#039;t even write properly, but he is a good guy. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now then, as the host of this meeting, you feel your hospitality lacking. Something somewhere deep within you tells you that this is overdoing it, but you&#039;ve got the upper hand back and you don&#039;t feel like giving it back. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I could do with a cup of tea. How about you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods as she slowly sinks back in to the couch. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That would be nice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lower your rifle and click it back to safe. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Kitchen is over there, tea is in the left upper cupboard, mugs are in the one next to that one. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan gets up, gingerly, taking the long way around the couch to stay as far away from you as possible as you watch her with hawk eyes until she get sot the kitchenette. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she opens the cupoards, sets water to heat up and takes two mugs out of the cupboard. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You remember that Jenna is about to show up and think that it would probably be a good idea to have another cup ready. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Make that three, one for Jenna.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She takes another one out of the cupboard. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Jenna - is that the girl you were with?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You fold your legs in front of you, sitting in the lotus position on the couch, still rifle butt in the shoulder, pointing it at the floor. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Girlfriend.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She turns around, leaning against the work surfaces behind her, arms on the edge. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">How long have you two been an item?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What is it with this probing?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Why do you care?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She leans back in to the counter a little more and folds her arms under her decidedly not exactly small bosom. Arms of taught steel wire, as big as Pop Eye&#039;s. Somewhat similar proprtions too, her lower arms definitely seem a lot bigger from where you&#039;re sitting. Her wrists are the size of your biceps. Natural panther and the obvious fitness training that her clearly visible abs with their defined six muscle bundles and lack of any gut whatsoever clearly show below the hemline of her spaghetti halter top. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No wonder you had no chance whatsoever against her, even the two of you. That woman could probably lift both you and your gf with one arm repeatedly. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her current stance seems to be a reflection of your hostility, not a show of force. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Just curious, is all. If you don&#039;t want to alk about it, that&#039;s alright.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the water boils for a bit as you both mind your own business. You check the time on your phone, guesstimating it will take a few more minutes for Jenna to arrive while Megan unfurls her arms again and stares absentmindedly at the kettle or out the window, before she tries to strike up a conversation again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Did you always have guns?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look up from your phone. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No. Got them recently.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That answer doesn&#039;t seem to be what she wanted to hear. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Oh.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the water continues to boil, until she tries again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That&#039;s a pretty big computer set up. Do you play games a lot?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Seriously? While being in control here has considerably lengthened your fuse, that still seems like a weird as question. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but before you can tell her to shut up and get to the point of why she is here, she continues</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;m sorry, that must have sounded really dumb. I play a lot and I was just wondering what you have in your rig.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bullshit. She looks like she spends exactly 20 minutes a day with computers - 5 for photos and 15 getting them placed on instagram with captions like &quot;Working those glutes biceps-curl-emoji x3&quot;. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;no, maybe she is scoping out your place, to add insult to injury? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she can&#039;t be that retarded. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She tentatively tries to smile at you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s not very effective</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but it makes you take stock of the entire situation and you can&#039;t help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You, i mean YOU, are standing here, in my kitchen, and you&#039;re seriously asking me about what videogames I play after blackmailing your way in?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She averts her eyes and looks at the floor for a second, then back at you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">When you put it like that, it sounds pretty bad.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she stops, then starts again, a little more spirited this time. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I just feel really uncomfortable in the silence.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You snort in disbelief. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You feel uncomfortable.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;then you have to chuckle. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You think you&#039;re the one who is entitled to feel uncomfortable here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She searches for a place to hide on the floor with her eyes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Just, new place, new people and all that, awkward silence and so on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she mumbles, looking anywhere but in your direction.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the kettle announces it&#039;s done. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan picks up the kettle, pours three of the cups full of water and puts a teabag in each. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What tea did you pick?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She reaches up and checks the box. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Roo-ib-os?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Rooibos was the only tea mom would never sweeten, instead, she always added milk. You&#039;ve had it often enough where it doesn&#039;t instantly give you a flashback of sitting at the dinner table at home with a glass of tea in front of you, but it isn&#039;t difficult to conjure up a false memory of a generic evening of dinner with your family when you were about ten. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Pour some milk in mine. Fridge is to your right. Oh, and in Jenna&#039;s too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan opens the fridge and pulls a jug of milk out after a short search, then drips a little in to your mug, same for jenna&#039;s, then turns to you, jug at the ready. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Mind if I take some too?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Why would you mind? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Go ahead.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pours milk in to her mug as well, which results in all mugs being full nearly to the brim. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan returns the milk to the fridge and takes both of your mugs and carefully balances the liquid inside of them as she carries them over. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she sets down both of them on her side of the couch table, then pushes yours across carefully as you tense up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;m gonna go get another mug for the tea bags once they are done.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gets back up, fetches another mug and comes back. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You watch her look curious at the tea, but then she leans back in to the couch. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">How long until it&#039;s done?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Technically speaking, Rooibos isn&#039;t a tea and doesn&#039;t have a due time. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">About 6 minutes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There are, however, diminishing returns. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods, then takes a deep breath. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I... Well. I tested positive. It&#039;s only been a couple of days but these tests don&#039;t really go wrong that often.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it seems that she is finally getting to it, then. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I wasn&#039;t really expecting this. I mean, sure, season and everything, but one go? Without preparing? I... What are the odds, you know?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Preparation? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Do Chimera&#039;s need preparation to get pregnant? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she cringes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Please don&#039;t call us that. You wouldn&#039;t call a black guy a nigger, would you? Just call us anthros.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shrug. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So do anthro need to prepare?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She doesn&#039;t seem too willing to talk about it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Some, like me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You motion with your hand to keep going. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Want to explain why what happened is so unlikely?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she sighs. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I have... I don&#039;t get periods. No ovaries either. My kind... we have to scratch ourselves for a chance to get pregnant. Internally. Hard. It&#039;s not very comfortable.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You furrow your eyebrows. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Then how did I get you pregnant?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shrugs. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I don&#039;t know. I&#039;ve never heard of it happening before.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That still doesn&#039;t explain why she&#039;s here. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Where are you going with this?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She swallows. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but before she can go on, the doorbell rings and this time, you unfold your legs and get up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You circle around her, rifle now much more at ease after Megan has proven that while she is clearly not always normal as far as social rules and norms are concerned, she doesn&#039;t appear to be a crazed rape fiend.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You still check to see where she is and meet her gaze as she turns on the couch, followign you with her eyes as far as she can without getting up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then you answer the intercom. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna&#039;s voice. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Guess who.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You push the door opener and the appratus buzzes, and after you&#039;ve heard the door click open through the intercom, you hang up the phone, then crack the door to the appartment open. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You turn around, but wait by the door. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It doesn&#039;t take jenna too long to reach your floor, she must have gotten lucky with the elevators, but before she gets to the door, Megan drops her last bombshell. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I want to keep them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take a moment to digest that statement and her sincerity makes you not even for a second consider that this is some kind of joke. You hadn&#039;t taken the alimony thing fully serious, but that sounded different. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But before you can muster up an answer, the door opens and a ball of rage practically flies in to your flat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna blows right past you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">WHERE IS SHE?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She doesn&#039;t walk in to the living room, she pushes through your hallway like a military formation. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">YOU.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you shut the door behind her, then follow as Jenna unleashes her emotions. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">HOW DARE YOU EVEN COME HERE.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As Megan turns to check what you&#039;re doing, Jenna takes the few remaining steps and slaps her across the face. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I AM TALKING TO YOU, BITCH.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megans head flings around, then Jenna turns to you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Why are you just standing there? Where are the cops? Hmm?! She&#039;s sitting right here?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have dealt with this before. If things don&#039;t go the way Jenna wants them to, this happens. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her head shifts from you to Megan a couple of times, then she freezes and her expression shifts to an &quot;I can&#039;t believe what the fuck i&#039;m seeing&quot;. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Anon...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh no. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She points at the tea mugs on your couch table. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What the fuck are those?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she turns to you again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Is that godfucking damn tea? Did you really make her a FUCKING CUP OF TEA?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is probably a bad time to mention that her mug is still in the kitchen. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Change of situation.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna stems her arms in to her sides. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And what the fuck could change the situation so much, that she deserves even the slightest bit of hospitality?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you can answer, Megan interrupts. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;m pregnant. And I&#039;m keeping them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She holds the pregnacy test out for Jenna to see, who slaps it out of her hand. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You notice that Megan, who seemed fairly relaxed around you if not afraid of the guns you were carrying, definitely seems angry now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I can get on of those for five bucks on ebay.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She turns to you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You weren&#039;t seriously retarded enough to believe her, were you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shrug, but as Jenna is about to snarl something in your direction, Megan takes the intiative. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It&#039;s not like I can&#039;t make more of these.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna turns her head around. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Bitch, I don&#039;t give a fucking shit. You&#039;re gonna abort them, you&#039;re not doing this to me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Doing this to her? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Anon, she confessed to us. Call 911. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you dial 911 and start talking to the operator while watching jenna and megan. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan stands up, her arms folded. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I confessed nothing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna turns around. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah, you fucking did. You said you were pregnant, from him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna points at you, but Megan still isn&#039;t having it. She waves a hand through the air, as if this is some minor detail that doesn&#039;t really matter. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah, we fucked downtown in a club on the toilet. But I&#039;m actually here because Anon bumped in to my car.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That&#039;s... really... what?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you can ask her what she means by this, Megan explains</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I saw him the other day from my balcony, scraping my bumper. Very lightly, but you know. So I asked the landlord where Anon lives so we could settle this amicably and that&#039;s why I&#039;m here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna fumes.

Then they open their mouthes right in front of her and fixate her head so she has to look at the open maw. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel the need to do something. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Megans growl at the Jennas. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">STOP, or I&#039;ll -</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You push yourself up with your elbows, distantly registering more cutting and pricking sensations to them. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Jenna&#039;s struggle and get another knee in as the Megans turn and look at you with an expression you can&#039;t make out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Megans cringe for a second, allowing the Jennas to land another punch.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as a wave of pain and sickness hits you, you clothe your eyes so you won&#039;t have to puke and hear a dull thud. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The struggling sounds end and a moment later, a furry hand pulls you out of the remains of your couch table. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your open your eyes and two fuzzy megans become one. She looks very concerned for someone who was willing to drag you into an alley and pin you against a wall. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Are you okay?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No, definitely not. You feel really, really sick. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But what happened to Jenna? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">How&#039;s Jenna?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your mouth isn&#039;t really doing what it should be doing and Megan&#039;s concern is growing. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She&#039;s okay, you&#039;re not.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As if on cue, Jenna starts to moan behind you, just as one Megan becomes two. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You close your eyes again, fighting against the need to throw up as it becomes overbearing. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to sit down, and Megan makes you move a few steps and then gingerly lowers you down until you&#039;re sitting on the floor, back against a couch. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You throw up in your mouth as you hear Jenna behind you get up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You swallow the acidic concotion in your mouth back down and open your eyes as you feel something touching the back of your head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Two megans look past you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You&#039;re bleeding.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Broken glass rustles as Jenna walks through it and the Megans look in her direction, but before something stupid can happen, the doorbell rings. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The other two freeze, but you can&#039;t hold it back anymore and puke your guts out. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The pain in your head is insane. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;glass gets crushed again, then quick unsteady taps across the floor and you open your eyes two see two, no, one Megan looking down her puke soaked shirt, then reaching out to gently steady your head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your hearing is fine, but it&#039;s hard to concentrate as another wave of nausea hits you and you heave again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Thank god you&#039;ve arrived.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan&#039;s hand leaves your side shortly thereafter as she gets up to face the new arrivals. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That&#039;s her. You need to arrest her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Another, unfamiliar male voice cuts in, talking to Megan amd Jenna in the back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as they get down to talking, a female voice talks to you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Sir, I&#039;m calling an ambulance for you, alright?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Good.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the voice turns away, and you open your eyes two see a black LocalPD uniform</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Car 243 to base, over?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her eyes dart from her radio to you while she waits for reply. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Car 243, go ahead.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her eyes flick back in the general direction of her radio. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">This is Car243, I need an Ambulance at West Sourdough 2444, male with a bleeding headwound and multiple cuts, over?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;base takes another second during which you dry heave again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the officer quickly scoots out of the way, but you manage to force it back down. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Car 243, ambulance dispatched, over.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the officer leaves the microphone on her shoulder and focuses on you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Sir, can you talk?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod, forcing down the last bit of bile. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;m Officer Norton, my colleague over there is Officer Barbrady.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;really. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Can you tell me your name?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try, but just at that moment, another mouthful comes up your esophagus. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it is followed by a little more and you have to spill. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You throw your head to the side and let it all out. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Officer Norton makes a concerned face and you close your eyes, then lean your head back. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Norton seems to scribble that down and during that brief silence, you her something about rapist from the others. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then Norton demands your full concentration again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alright, and how old are you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you tell her, she scribbles, another tidbit from the others. Glass table. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Is this your place of residence?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This time, she is too quick to note it down for you to hear what the others are talking about. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Can you tell me what happened?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You heave again, then start. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I was at home. Then Megan showed up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Norton interrupts you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The anthro?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shut your eyes again. Its much easier to keep the sickness at bay like this. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah. Then my girlfriend showed up. They got in a fight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You swallow, but the disgusting taste in your mouth won&#039;t leave. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I tried to stop them. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">But then I fell through my couch table.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Norton scribbles a bit and the pulsating pain in your head warbles what you can hear from the conversation the others are having. You can make out that it&#039;s fairly heated. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alright. Tell me, whose rifle is that on the floor?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you open your eyes to look at officer norton. Is that gun going to be trouble? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Mine. Why?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nausea and pain flare back up, this wasn&#039;t the best of ideas. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Are there any other firearms here?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, there is the rifle and... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">In my pants.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The scribbling stops. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Okay. Would you mind if I secured that?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anything, if she makes the pain go away. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;m going to have to touch you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anything. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your shirt gets lifted and Norton unholsters your firearm, then a few mechanical noises are heard and she puts the gun in to a plastic bag, by the sound of it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You can get it back at our station as soon as you&#039;re better, alright?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Better, yes please. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Okay.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Norton softly touches your leg. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Tell me if you&#039;re feeling worse, alright?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You muble approval, then the conversation between the others can be heard, but the officer is being so quiet its hard to hear what he&#039;s saying. Only Jenna is clear and easy to hear, as she still hasn&#039;t really quietened down. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">But She&#039;s-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the quiet voice of the officer cuts her off and continues. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No, this is bullshit. She&#039;s-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;another interruption by the officer. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No, fuck that, you need to arrest her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the officer asks a question. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I already told you. She raped him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This time, Norton interrupts. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Ma&#039;am, my colleague has already explained why this doesn&#039;t work.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Barbrady falls in, quietly talking to Jenna again, but your head tunes out until the noise level picks up again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Norton taps you slightly. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Are you still with me?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She seems to shift elsewhere. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Okay, I&#039;m going to have to go over there, make some noise if you&#039;re feeling funky, alright?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gets up, then calls out to Megan. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Miss? Could you come over here, please? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A common misconception about cats is that they move quietly everywhere. Truth is, they don&#039;t - they actually have fairly heavy foortfalls for their weight on solid surfaces. Megan was no exception here. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hi. I&#039;m Officer Norton. Got any ID on you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan&#039;s voice is calm, unlike Jenna&#039;s was earlier. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No. I live here, though, two floors up. My name is Megan Riley.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Scribbling again, then a stop. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alright. And what exactly happened here?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan starts off with a direct accuation. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Well, I only had to knock her out because she had pushed him in to his couch table.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Norton stops her with a bit more of an edge in her tone. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Look. From beginning to end.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan takes a deep breath, then begins. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Well, me and him, had, you know, a bit of a thing. Once. Nothing major. But she caught us and I wanted to talk to him about it. Well, she barges in, tells him to call the police for some reason and then attacks me. I defend myself and then he tries to get her off me, but she just pushes him in to this glass table and charges me. I had to knock her out so I could render first aid and before I got to that, you arrived.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Norton scribbles for a bit, then stops. Apparently, Megan decided to ignore her cover story she&#039;d given the two of you earlier. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Where is the blood on your fingers from?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The back of his head. He&#039;s bleeding there. How&#039;s he doing right now?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Norton sounds like she is concentrating on her scribbling. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You can ask him yourself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear Megan moving a bit closer to you, then she tocuhes your arm very gently. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey. You still okay?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Nauseus.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sympathy and warmth is practically dripping from her voice. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That su-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna&#039;s voice interrupts her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">HEY! WHAT THE FUCK IS SHE DOING?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Norton immediately fires back. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Ma&#039;am! Please stay where you are!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Clearly, Jenna ignores this, as Norton has to repeat it again, a lot more steel in her voice. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Meanwhile, Jenna keeps talking. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I TOLD YOU PEOPLE TO GET HER AWAY FROM HIM.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">MA&#039;AM, STOP! </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan lets go of you and you hear plasticky noises. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">MA&#039;AM, STOP RIGHT NOW!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna continues to ignore this and comes yet closer. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;FUCK YOU CHIM - </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There is a weird bang sound. Not like a gun, more like a cracker, and then clackering, followed by a heavy thud. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Barbrady immediatly goes for the radio, loud and clear this time. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Car 243, taser taser taser.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then they both move and you hear handcuffs being ratcheted shut. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">woah.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan exclaims quietly. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Norton seems to have a weird sense of humor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Barbrady reads Jenna her rights, then shuffles around. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That was a good shot, Judy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Norton accepts the praise happily. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Thanks. Want me to bring her down to the car?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Babrady sounds surprisingly relaxed for a cop that just went through a tense situation. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Nah, I think the taser will have calmed her enough so that we can have her sit here for a little while longer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He turns to Megan. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Miss, I think it would be a good idea if you could accompany us down to the station too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan sounds slightly more shaky than earlier. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Sure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan&#039;s hand returns to your arm, but Norton almost immediatly stops her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Miss, If you could, please stay away from Anon for a bit. I don&#039;t want to taze her again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her hand vanishes from your arm once more and she steps away from you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Okay.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At that moment, there is a knock at the door and two more voices enter the room. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hi, we&#039;re here for a couple of nasty cuts?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Barbrady answers them and you can hear the sound of heavy synthetic fabric rubbing against itself as they come in. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hi guys. That&#039;s your guy over there. Fell through the glass couch table, hurt his head pretty bad.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As Barbrady finsihes, Norton picks up where he left. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Bleeding at the back of the head, puked at least twice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The EMT&#039;s remain jovial. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Oh boy, you got really unlucky, didn&#039;t you. Alright, we&#039;ve got him from here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One of them sits down next to you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hello there, son. How are you doing?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Awesome. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Shitty. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Do you think he&#039;s gonna be okay?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Another male voice you haven&#039;t heard before attempts to answer Megan, but gets cut off. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna apparently still has some fight in her, even after she got knocked out and tazed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Why do you care?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Barbrady immediately intervenes and multiple voices babble in the background as the EMT asks you to open your eyes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You comply, and he immediately holds two of his left hands out with a few fingers on them. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">How many fingers?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;maybe... 5? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Tweleven.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The other EMT behind him chuckles. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Okay, for real now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I can&#039;t tell.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The first EMT pulls out a black tube the size of a pen. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;m gonna ask you a few questions while my colleague here will shine alight in to your eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In the background, multiple pens are scribbling, then Barbrady announces to Norton that he&#039;ll take Jenna down to their car. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Shoot.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The tech shines a light in to one of your eyes, then takes it away, looking straight at it, but not really looking in to your eyes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel yourself relaxing, despite copious amounts of pain. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What&#039;s your name?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That&#039;s easy. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The guy nods, then his colleague examines the other eye and you feel your nausea rising again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And what day is it?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait. What day is it? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Uh. Monday?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan interrupts you conversation from the background. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Is that bad?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The second EMT puts the tube light away, then gives his colleague some medical mumbo jumbo before he adresses Megan. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Just relax, madam, we do our best when we can concentrate on our work. He&#039;ll be fine, just stick with the officer over there, alright?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It is monday, isn&#039;t it? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alright, now my colleague is going to measure your blood pressure and that little clip on your finger will measure you r blood oxygen, okay?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The guy has a voice that is so buttery and smooth and reassuring that it feels like you&#039;re back at your mom&#039;s house after you got roadrash from falling off your bicycle. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The clip on your finger feels cool.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The loud sound of the blood pressure monitor ripped open as the velcro comes apart drives another spike of nausea in to you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You close your eyes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey, bud, eyes open, look at me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You really don&#039;t want to puke all over these guys. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Can&#039;t.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What&#039;s wrong?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;d like to avoid painting their gear a new color. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;ll puke.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The EMT loses it&#039;s mom quality and sounds more like a dad now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That&#039;s okay, just keep looking at us. Count my fingers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as you open your eyes you heave again, but there doesn&#039;t seem to be a whole lot left down there. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That&#039;s okay, Harry, go get the stretcher.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Officer Norton interrupts him. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Need help?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He looks at her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah, help Harry get the stretcher up here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then he looks at you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Come on bud, fingers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to count them, and they phase in to one hand. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Three.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;then they phase out again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No, five.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It doesn&#039;t take very long for Harry and Norton to return with the stretcher, and they carefully load you on to it, pulling glass out of you as they go after fitting a weird plastic stretcher around your neck, immobilising your head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every movement makes your head feel worse. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It&#039;ll be alright once we get to the hospital, okay? Hang in there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel a furry hand touch your arm as two concerned Megan faces briefly show up in your vision, but then both disappear as the stretcher moves out of your flat. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;THe ride to the hospital is absolutely the worst thing you have ever gone through in your life. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ve seen videos of Trophy Trucks and you&#039;re sure that the ambulance is following a part of the Baja 1000. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re feeling strangely.. sleepy. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey, bud, you&#039;re still with us?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The EMT gives your arm a few gentle prods. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Bud? Count to ten, alright?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Suuure. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">One, Two... Three... ... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;white. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;coarse fabric all over you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a feeling of being encased. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You close your eyes again. It&#039;s really bright here. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, maybe you should see where you are. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You squint and see ceiling tiles. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s also a bit warmer than you&#039;d like it to be. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Except your head, your head is wet and luke warm. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try and move your head but can&#039;t. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So almost automatically, you reach for your head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel something wet and cool on it, grab it and hold it up for you to see - it&#039;s a soggy icepack. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You drop it somewhere aside and hear it drop to the ground with a loud thwack. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Then you feel the pressure on your jaw and your brain finishes booting.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why do you feel encased? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A quick look at an arm stretched above you and you see that your arm is wrapped in bandages, from shoulder to finger tips. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whats with not being able to move your head? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel around for something on your neck and immediatly find a plastic thing that encases your neck. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Could you take that off? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait, where are you? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You... You fell. right. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh, EMTs - so this is probably a hospital. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You search for latches on that thing on your neck but can&#039;t find any, when it occurs to you that maybe, just maybe, it&#039;s there for a good reason. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hello?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No one answers you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hello?!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;More silence. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Are you just supposed to sit around and do noting until someone comes - no, hospital beds always have that call a nurse button. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;right, you feel around on the bed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nada. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hmm. Maybe it&#039;s hanging off the side? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait, there is a wire here and - oh. It was right on top of you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You press and wait. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nothing happens for a bit, then the door opens. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;ll be right with you, just a moment!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s actually a bit longer, but now the feeling of being in a dead room is dead as you can hear the hustle and bustle of a hospital station outside. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;eh, they must be busy then. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It doesn&#039;t take too long until a nurse shows her face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s human and judging by how close she is to your face, she&#039;s 5&#039; none and her long braid makes her look like a disney princess. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Righ tafter that, a blond male shows his face, looking a little more clinically at you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hi, my name Is Dr. Dubian and this is nurse Sharon. Good to see you&#039;ve woken up. How are you feeling?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Uh. actually, pretty good, albeit you feel like you haven&#039;t moved in a while. And itchy. Oh god, itchy as fuck, all over your body. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Itchy. All over.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The doc nods. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You were pretty cut up. We&#039;ll see about getting something done about that after dinner.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He looks at his wristwatch, then stares off in to space as sharon waits for input from him, clearly far more happy to rest her eyes on him than on you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Sharon, if you could, change Mr. Anon&#039;s bandages, I&#039;m thinking Betaisodona? Mr. Anon, I&#039;ll get back to you after you&#039;ve had dinner, if you feel alright with eating.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He leaves, so you look at sharon instead. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Can I take this off?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You motion to the thing keeping yoyur neck encased. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sharon, who had started to unwrap your arms, stops. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;ll be right back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She vanishes again from sight and your headache returns, albeit a fairly normal one, not the blinding nausea kind. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Moments later, Sharon returns, smiling. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Doc gives his okay.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You return her smile. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Great.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She leans over you and rips open some velcro. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s loud, but you&#039;re not really getting a spike of pain that lances through your skull. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Okay, now lift your head off the pillow for me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you do, she unwraps something around your neck. As she pulls it away, you turn your neck and see a large yellow polycarbonate .. cast, for lack of a better word. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She puts it aside, then starts unwrapping your bandages again, quickly moving down your arms. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So for dinner, I&#039;m afraid you&#039;ll have to be okay with some bread, cheese and jell-o. We couldn&#039;t exactly ask you for what you&#039;d like, you know?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bread is fine with you, as is cheese. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That&#039;s alright.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods, then keeps going</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Would you like some soda with that or tea?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tea. Tea sounds absolutely excellent right now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Definitely tea, please.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods again, having unwrapped both of your arms.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your bed begins to move as she gets your upper body moved upright. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alright, lean a bit forward, would you, i need to get this off of your back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Unlike your arms, your torso isn&#039;t bandaged up, it has a huge piece of dressing taped to your back. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sharon quickly rips it off, then starts applying a cool brown ointment to your back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She does the same to your arms, then applies new dressings wherever she slathered on ointment and wraps your arms in bandages again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alright! I&#039;ll go and get you your dinner.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now that you have had your body upright, circulation has begun and while the headache has inreased a bit, it still isn&#039;t terrible.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But, you&#039;re also a lot quicker in the head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey, how long was I under?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She opens a folder on a table next to your bed and looks through it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Uhhh... 3 days. But Dr. Dubian is your guy for questions like that, i&#039;ll go get him once you&#039;ve had dinner, alright?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod while your stomach audibly sings you the song of it&#039;s people. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It doesn&#039;t take her long to come back at all, which isn&#039;t very surprising considering the dinner tray holds a few slices of stale untoasted bread and a small bowl of cloeslaw. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">All I can do at the moment. Don&#039;t expect it to get much better, though. Tea is on it&#039;s way, i&#039;ll get it to you when it&#039;s done.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pulls a small dresser on wheels to your bed, then unfolds a table big enough to hold your tray. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Thanks.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles, then gestures to a small cup with pills in it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">In case you have headaches.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take the pills, throw them down, then dig in to the bread and cheese. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Do you need anything else?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, yeah, can you get up? But then again, she said that the Doc is the guy to ask those questions, so you leave it be. Instead, you shake your head and give her a thumbs up as you wolf down the admittedly stale food.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;By the time she comes back with a cup of tea, you&#039;re halfway done and between slices of bread, so you ask her for a glass or two of water, which she gets to you as you start with the coleslaw as a stand in for dessert. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask for a refill, but she returns to you with a large bottle of water instead, placing it on your dresser and filling one of your glasses. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After that it doesn&#039;t take much longer for Dr. Dubian to reappear. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now somewhat sated and slightly woozy from the meds, you watch as Sharon shuffles around in the room for a while, cleaning up somewhat, fetching another ice pack for your head after confirming with the doctor and taking her time to leave the two of you alone. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In the meantime, you get all the boring things out of the way. What you&#039;re doing, how you&#039;re doing (okay), you&#039;re allowed to get out of bed, but take it careful, and so on and so forth. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">...So what you have is a skull dome fracture. No breach of skin, which is good, but not a simple clean fracture either, as part of your skull broke lose and got pushed in, here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He shows you a section of your skull on an X-Ray. Without him pointing it out, you would have missed it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Compounded with that, your brain experienced significant trauma, which is why we kept you under for the last three days. Significant, and i mean significant swelling. But you should be okay for now, but we&#039;re gonna keep you here for a few more days so we can monitor how things develop, although I&#039;m optimistic that you&#039;ll recover without any permanent damage. Do keep an eye on those headaches though, some are prefectly normal, but if they get worse, tell us. Take it slow, no stress, no sports.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So now that you know what&#039;s going on with your head, why don&#039;t you tell me a bit about how this happened?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As he explained that you have a fracture at the back of your skull, you&#039;re suddenly worried about putting pressure on it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He seems to read your thoughts. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Go on, lean back, it&#039;s been immobilized. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lean back and start to talk.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;or at least you try to, but you stop as soon as you realize that everything is very fuzzy and ther are only some individual sounds and pictures available. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It starts with.. what&#039;s her name again? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the panther girl. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">uuhh...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan! </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan was at your place because... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Alimony?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No, that can&#039;t be. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So she was at your place. She definitely was. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see her in your kitchen, making tea. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And then you can see her defending herself against Jenna. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have memory of a vague feeling of losing balance. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And then there was police. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And EMT&#039;s, as well as an ambulance ride. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I.. think I fell. I must have fallen on something. I think... My girlfriend was there and someone else.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t feel particularly well with saying my rapist. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And they were fighting? I think.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Dubian watches you closely. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That&#039;s all I remember.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He nods. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A bit of amnesia is normal in these cases. Those memories probably will not come back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You swallow. Somehow the feeling of losing some of your lifetime, something that was probably important as Jenna attacked someone so much bigger than her, doesn&#039;t sit well with you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Come to think of it, why was Megan there? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get somewhat more uncomfortable. She didn&#039;t take you again, right? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;right? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You absentmindedly nod as the doc explains a few more things about your injuries to you, mentions that the police, a neurological specialist and a few others would visit you tomorrow over the course of the day, then finishes up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before he leaves, you have on final question: </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Do you happen to know where my phone is?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Does your boss know where you are? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Probably not. Maybe check in there as well, it occurs to you as Dubian promises to send someone with your personal belongings so you can call your girlfriend. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It doesn&#039;t take much longer for the door to open again and for Sharon to come in with a plastic bag. In it are keys, a dead phone and your wallet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Nurse Sharon, right? Do you happen to have a phone charger I could borrow?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She scratches her head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;m not sure, I can see whether someone left one, but don&#039;t count on it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She disappears and you&#039;re left with a dead phone in your hand, waiting. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It doesn&#039;t take too long for her to come back, but the charger is for a pear phone, while you&#039;re on the robot side of the force. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">THanks, though.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles apologetically. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Were you trying to call someone? You can use our hospital phone line if you want to.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That occured to you as well, but it still wouldn&#039;t work. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I don&#039;t know her number by heart.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her smile changes to a smirk. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Ah, I think I have the solution to that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She turns to walk away, but she is still in the door as you hear her again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Mr. Anon, I think your problem just solved itself. I&#039;ll leave you two alone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You turn, expecting Jenna... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...but to your horror, it&#039;s actually Megan. She&#039;s standing in the door, trying to smile at you, but she casts her eyes down fairly quickly as she sees your reaction, or at least your momentary loss of control of your facial features. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No stress your ass. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Can I come in? I&#039;ll leave the door open.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That second sentence seems like something meant to comfort you, and it does, until you realize that Dubian is a lanky twig and Sharon probably weighs 95 lbs soaking wet. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I brought you dinner, I&#039;ve spent enough time in hospitals to know how horrible the food is.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pulls something large wrapped in paper out of the bag she is carrying. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That does look enticing, but you&#039;re still not sure whether you want her in here. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then she pulls out two phone chargers. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;m not sure what phone you&#039;re using, but I figured the battery would be empty by now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The ability to call Jenna wins out. Plus, afte rthe inital shock, you really do want to know why on earth she wa sin your kitchen. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her entire stance also seems deferential, head bowed, as if to say &#039;I am no threat to you&#039;. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Robot charger?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods, the fumbles for a bit until she holds the right one up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Come on in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan walks in, leaving the door open as she had promised and hands you the charger.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You immediatly plug your phone in, then, after giving her another long look, carefully unwrap whatever food she brought you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Thanks, I guess.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re not particularly comfortable with eating while she is here, as it would only drag this out longer. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So why are you here?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She fidgets, then catches herself after a deep breath. Her gaze steadies, she looks you in the eyes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I wanted to see ho wyou were doing and figured you could need a few things.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She takes a few more things out of her bag. A book, some chocolate, a toothbrush, a clear bag with toothpaste, deodorant and shampoo as well as a razor and shaving cream. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As I said, I&#039;ve been in hospitals often enough to have a pretty good idea of what they usually won&#039;t have and i figured you could use these.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That&#039;s it? That can&#039;t be it. There has to be something else. But why bring this stuff? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I... Uhh. Thank you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You do feel unwashed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But why is she here? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So you&#039;re here because...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You trail off, but she gets the hint and ends the sentence. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I wanted to see how you&#039;re doing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Simple questions get simple answers. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Better, I guess.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That&#039;s good to hear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You raise your eyebrows. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gets the hint again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And... I wanted to continue our conversation where we left off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;ah, there it is. So you two had a chat. Why on earth would you have chatted with her? Alimony? For her? Why? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but before you can ask her any questions, your phone vibrates as it turns on. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take it form the dresser and watch it cycle through boot, but Megan seems to be getting increasingly nervous the longer you hold it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Are you going to call someone?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">My girlfriend.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Maybe you shouldn&#039;t, not right now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She quickly follows up with an explanation, while she waves her arms as if trying to say &#039;YOu&#039;re getting the wrong idea.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I don&#039;t want another fight and I&#039;m pretty sure she&#039;ll start another one.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait, so Jenna had started the fight? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She could be lying. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after a second of trying to judge her intentions, you slowly put the phone down. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Thanks. I know you probably don&#039;t want me here right now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You silently nod, and she casts her eyes down. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I ... Mind if I sit down?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were expecting her to gesture towards the bed, but she actually gestures at the wall on the floor as there are no chairs in this room, despite there being a table that seems to be part of a set. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She slides down on the wall, knees bent in front of her as she settles. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan&#039;s eyes search your&#039;s and she makes a pause to emphasize what she has to say. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I never figured you&#039;d take this so heavily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Was that what you&#039;d been talking about? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I mean, that night wasn&#039;t the first time I&#039;d done that, you know?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Apparently not. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">All the others... They enjoyed it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She snorts. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I mean, I met most of these guys more than once, you know. That was just the first time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks at you again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">But I never figured you&#039;d take it that hard. I mean, no one ever pointed a gun at me, you know?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her voice is not exactly a whisper, but it&#039;s definitely to quiet to hear outside of this room. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Gun, right, you had bought a gun. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">At least until you did.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ah. Well. That&#039;s what you&#039;d bought them for. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I didn&#039;t really take you seriously, I thought you were acting, drawing this entire thing out a bit because you liked it, which really confused me, but then you said you&#039;d kill me if I tried anything after I figured maybe I should play along.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That&#039;s... wait. No. huh? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And I mean, I was so confused already, I mean, what were the odds of you getting me pregnant like that in the first place?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh nooooo. No no no no no. The word pregnant is a red flag so big that it tilts your brain and you spring in to action. Which is stupid. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You&#039;re pregnant?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And the moment you say that, you realize that you&#039;re now at her mercy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her inredulous look, the raised eyebrow after that - she realized that you don&#039;t know. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You don&#039;t remember?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She can tell you whatever she wants now, and as long as it fits those key frames in your head, you can&#039;t know whether she is lying or telling you the truth. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Who knows? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She could tell you that you had tea during your chat or after she&#039;d taken you again... no. She said you pointed a gun at her. How would she have overpowered you when you were armed without getting a scratch? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">How much do you remember?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ah. Not a question you&#039;d want to answer. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Enough.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shakes her head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fuck. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You fought with Jenna.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">But why were... Why...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You shut your mouth. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Why did I come to your place?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your turn to nod. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I wanted to tell you that I was pregnant. And that you&#039;re the father.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">For real?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You fall back in to the pillow. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Fuck. That&#039;s why you and Jenna fought, isn&#039;t it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You turn your head to see her face. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Kind of. I said I&#039;d keep them and then it escalated.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait, what? She was going to keep them? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Stop. You&#039;re going to keep them?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">why?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She seems fairly desperate now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Not like I have a whole lot of choice, you know?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t know. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you raise an eyebrow. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan drops her head almost to between her knees and explains. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I... I&#039;ve got the choice between having them or getting an abortion. And getting an abortion...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks you dead in the eyes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">They&#039;re not that good. That...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks somewhere else. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I probably will never have the chance of having babies ever again if I...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her voice cracks, but she swallows and keeps going. Her arms are now tightly wrapped around her knees. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">... If I get them taken out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This tower of a woman that seemed so menacing not that long ago, now sits in your hospital room, small as a mouse, tail and arms wrapped around herself, holding herself as tears flow from her eyes and she tries to fight them. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I know I fucked up. I fucked up so badly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nothing is as uncomfortable as sitting in a room with someone else crying for reasons you understand all too well - but you&#039;re unwilling to reach out to them for reasons rooted in principle. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s difficult to feel afraid of her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan wipes the tears from her eyes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sniffs, then looks aside and snorts through her tears. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You know, my dad left when I was 6 and my mom brought home a new guy every two years or so and I just hated it. And I promised myself I&#039;d wait with kids until I found the right guy, you know?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stops looking anywhere else but at you and focuses on you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I made fun of all the girls that got pregnant at 16 and the baby mama thing and all of that because I knew how horrible it was for the kids and...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;sniff</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">... here I am, with a choice of never having kids or kids with a guy that never wanted them and who hates my guts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; her voice cracks and she hits octaves a man couldn&#039;t even hit if he dreamt to as her voice fails her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Fuck...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stops bothering with her tears and just lets everything out, her shoulders heaving, face buried in her knees. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel the conflicting forces of social pressure demanding that you comfort the crying woman and the unwillingness to comfort a being that caused you so much misery. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why is she even telling you this? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But she is hitting a nerve. You saw your dad maybe once a year for a week or so during the holidays. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Visiting him and his new family was always like being superfluous. Interrupting. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you promised yourself - you would never leave your kids behind. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Never ever.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Which puts you between a rock and a hard place. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But ultimately - what do you want? You&#039;d like to stay with Jenna, but you also don&#039;t feel comfortable with forcing Megan to get rid of her chance to ever conceive again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then, maybe, you should take the kids - but they also wouldn&#039;t be Jenna&#039;s kids and she would always stay a stepmom. Moms love uniquely. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then again, if you were to live close enough that the kids could always go from one parent to the other on their own... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But that still wouldn&#039;t allow you to see them take their first steps or speak their first words if they were with Megan at the time. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her assessment of &#039;everything is clusterfuck&#039; seems more and more accurate. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;single parents suck. But this constellation also sucks. Everything about this is garbage. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why the fuck did she have to pick you when she decided to go for a random guy on the street? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If only... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, if only won&#039;t really get you anywhere here, you realize. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No, it&#039;s probably time for you to finally make some decisions. Take back agency. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For better or worse. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you turn to Megan and say</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Megan, I want you to keep them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan lifts her head and you get to see a puffy face from the teras she had spilled. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">huh?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sniff</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I want you to keep them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Why? Why would you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Because you don&#039;t see them at fault for her actions. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It&#039;s not exactly their fault for being here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She wipes her wet cheeks with her paws, despite a continuing flow of tears. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I.. You...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She struggles for words, her flow of tears increasing. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I have to go.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Abruptly, she jumps to her feet, then runs from the room. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You call after her, but she is already gone. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why do women have to be like this. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now for the difficult part - selling this to Jenna.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have no idea how she is going to react. Well, maybe you did before. But you can&#039;t remember. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your phone is up and you unlock it, then navigate to your phone app. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna is in your recent calls lists and you take a deep breath...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...then you hit the call icon. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the phone rings a few times.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hello, you&#039;ve reached Jenna McMahon&#039;s mailbox. Leave a message after the beep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Right. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey honey, I&#039;m awake. Call me back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hang up, then decide to try sending her a message too. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;I&#039;m up, call me.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wait until lights out, but Jenna doesn&#039;t call you back that night until you go to sleep. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The next morning starts early. The nurse, kicks yout out of bed at 7:00, as punctual as WWI german artillery fire. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, &#039;kicking&#039; is a bit of an overstatement, but it isn&#039;t exactly being woken up by mom as a kid on your birthday either. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you work through your morning routine, Jenna calls. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But the bathroom door is fairly soundproof and you see 3 missed calls as you return to your bed for breakfast. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But Jenna also sent you a message: </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;Couldn&#039;t reach you, I&#039;m coming over tonight. Work now, I&#039;ll call you.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The nurse comes in and delivers your tablet with breakfast to you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Would you like some tea?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tea for breakfast? You like tea, but you&#039;re not british. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No, but thank you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks confused. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Oh, I thought that... nevermind. Would you like some soda?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Uhm, yeah, soda sounds good. Thank you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods, then returns promptly with a bottle of soda. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to talk to her about the tea thing, but before you can bring it up, your phone rings. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It isn&#039;t Jenna, it&#039;s an unknown number. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pick up the phone. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hello?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A male voice answers. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">This is Detective Ron Mully with the Anoncity PD. Am I speaking to Anon?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Where the hell is he coming from? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I ... yeah, that&#039;s me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;THe voice suddenly becomes surprisingly warm for a cop. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">How are you doing? I heard you got knocked around pretty badly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take stock of the situation. Headaches, a crusty feeling head, lots of itching scabs. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Okay, I guess.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The cop keeps going. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You got pretty lucky there, If I may say so. Listen, we&#039;ve got a couple more questions and I&#039;d like to come around to the hospital , I think that&#039;s where you are, right? I&#039;d like to come over and we can talk for a bit. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While talking to cops about issues that aren&#039;t brought up by you personally is not ever going to do any good for you, in this case he might just be interested in the exact cause of injury. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Sure. I don&#039;t exactly have anything to do.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nothing to do... Hmm. Nothing to do? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It dawns on you that maybe, you should have called your work place by now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I could be there in ... half an hour?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sure, whatever, just hang up so you can call your boss. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That&#039;s fine, see you then.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hang up, then dial your workplace. How come your boss hasn&#039;t called yet? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Vince here, speak.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He doesn&#039;t exactly sound happy. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey, it&#039;s Anon, I just wanted to call in and tell you where I&#039;ve been the last couple of days...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But to your surprise, he immediatly lightens up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Anon! Great to hear from ya. How are you doing?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Huh. You suspected him to furious as to the lack of any notice to him from your side, but he is surprisingly happy. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I... not that great. Two weeks of headaches ahead of me. I had a pretty bad accident, you know.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can practically hear him distractedly nodding. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah yeah, listen, happy to hear that you&#039;re okay. You think there is gonna be any lasting damage?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, the doc said probably not. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Doesn&#039;t seem like it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait. How does he know about possible lasting effects? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alright kid, up for a visit from Tilly? I have to get going, got a meeting. I&#039;ll see you once you get better, make sure to keep that brain of yours intact. Bye!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He hangs up and you&#039;re a bit confused. But It doesn&#039;t saound like you just got fired so that&#039;s... good? Then again, a visit from Tilly is something to look forward to. She only has eyes for her boss, but everyone else likes to keep an eye on her for obvious reasons. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She is an almost 6 feet tall blonde in her mid thirties that seems convinced that her way to her boss&#039; heart or at least affection is through her body, which she vigourously keeps in check through exercise, surgery, anything to keep her body an 11/10.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wonder whether you should call your mom - she&#039;d probably make a fuss about it. Do you want to stress her out? hmm. There is not really a point in calling your dad, he&#039;d pretend to care, talk to you a little bit about how you&#039;re doing in general, but wouldn&#039;t be interested in details and then next time you&#039;d hear from him would be a christmas card. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Call your sister? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Might as well call your mother if you do that. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh. It&#039;s too early to deal with your fussy mother, but the longer you wait, the more pouting there will be. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You bite the bullet. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It dials, then she picks up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey Anon, its so nice of you to call, but I&#039;m really in a rush right now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decide to carefully hint at your injuries, playing what happened down as far as you can. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Just calling to let you know I&#039;m alright. Gonna be alright too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What happens next is best described as &#039;the music stops.jpg and everything freezes.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What do you mean, you&#039;re going to be alright?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s not nice to do this kind of thing to your mother, but it&#039;s nice to hear that someone is so concerned. You feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I got knocked around the head a little bit, I fell on that glass couch table and broke it. Hurt my head a little bit. But the doc says i&#039;m going to be alright.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear her breathe in in shock. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Oh my god, there must have been glass everywhere! Are you sure you&#039;re alright? Honey, falling in to glass shards isn&#039;t funny!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For the rest of the call, you try and let on as little as possible as to why you fell through the glass, waiting for mother to calm down. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It doesn&#039;t take much longer for your sister to message you, but before you can get a got read at it, there is a knock at the door. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Come in!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The door opens and a surprinsingly slackish guy steps in. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hi!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He shakes your hand. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;m Ron Mully.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He shows you a wallet with a badge in it from your local PD. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">How are you doing?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;d previously been fairly tense, expecting a gruff, authoritative guy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But this guy is super relaxed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;His smile is infectious. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Well, headaches, but that&#039;s expected, I believe.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He nods sympathetically, then looks over your stuff on the dresser. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Aw man, last time I was in a hospital, I must have picked the wrong one.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He nods to the as of yet untouched novel, the chocolate and the other assorted things Megan left with you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Oh, those were dropped off by -</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a friend? Well.. not really. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">- a neighbor of mine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He gives you a knowing look. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Food&#039;s still terrible then?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Food&#039;s still terrible.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He chuckles. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That neighbor, does that happen to have been... Megan?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He looks around, searching for something. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Mind if I sit - hmm. Mind if I get a chair from somewhere nearby?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shrug. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No, go ahead.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mully disappears, then comes back with that wide smile again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alright, so I don&#039;t want to bother you too long. Would you mind telling me a little about how you got here?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Unlike anything you expected, there is no tape recorder and no pencil scratching on paper while you give a short run down on what you remember. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mully looks at you the entire time, asks a few questions, but there really isn&#039;t too much to talk about as your memory is practically a few flashes and mostly guesswork, which he doesn&#039;t really want to know too much about. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He asks you about the reasons why Megan would have been there, but you just say you really have no idea. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;finally, with his smile having been replaced by a contemplative frown, he shuts up for a few seconds. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">hrmm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He stares at the ground for a few seconds. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">hrmm?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to prompt him, but he just keeps his eyes on a spot somewhere below your bed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">hrmm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And before you know it, you&#039;ve asked a very dumb question. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Detective, what&#039;s the usual punishment for rape? Purely hypothetically.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That gets him out of his mind. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You wanna be a bit more precise there?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There is a certain edge in his voice. Not a lot, but a noticeable hint to come clean.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Well, hypothetically. I&#039;ve just been curious, I saw something on the internet earlier.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He looks at you, judging you it seems, as if he hadn&#039;t really seen you before. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Depends, really. I&#039;m no lawyer, but usually the guy ends up doing time, and prison for rapists is hell.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh, so that&#039;s why he seemed so hostile all of a sudden. He was suspecting you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No, I mean if a woman were to rape someone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now you&#039;ve actually got him puzzled. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What, like a kid? Like, taking advantage of a minor?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He looks up to his right, trying to remember something.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I think that&#039;s ten years average.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not really what you were looking for. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No, I mean, what if a woman were to force herself on a man, both of legal age?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He seems absolutely without a clue and scratches the back of his head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Uhhh... phew. Those aren&#039;t really covered by law in this state. Rape is defined as forced penetration without consent from the penetrated. So unless hypothetically she stuck something up his butt, it&#039;s not really rape.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Oh.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh shit, you have to keep this hypothetically thing up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I feel really sorry for that dude now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mully raises a questioning eyebrow. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Which dude?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shake your head dismissively while you tell a quick story.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I saw this post by a guy on seddit who was asking for advice on how to handle his marriage. He talked about being gay but his wife and her family was devoutly christian, as were his parents and it was all just going downhill, really and she had started choke him so he could do his marital duties and it was all just a really really sad story.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mully nods emphatically. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That sounds really, really rough. Did he say anything about getting out?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shake your head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No, he wanted to stay for the kids, althoguh they only had one on the way. He liked her just fine, but as a friend, you know?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mully looks you dead in the eye. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Life is hard like that sometimes, but you can always get help. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And, if he were to press charges here, he&#039;d get the kids, I&#039;d wager. She&#039;d look at a battery charge, The way that story sounds, multiple times, which makes a suspended term impossible. If she&#039;s blackmailing him, it&#039;s coercion. Either way, I know these things are hard to admit, but ultimately, living like that for the rest of your life sounds miserable. The sooner he gets out, the more life he will ahve left to live, you know?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I told him I wish him all the best, as he was adamant about somehow keeping everything going.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It doesn&#039;t feel like Mully is buying your made up sob story. He looks you dead in the eyes, until you flinch from his gaze, then keeps them on you for a little while longer. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alright. I&#039;ve talked to a few guys with issues like these, you know? Sons visited by either parent at night, guys in dorms getting visitors, I&#039;ve had big strong bodybuilders getting beaten up by 5 foot 90 pound girls. everything stays inside my head. No notes, nothing, just my head, so if you have something to tell me...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could talk about Megan right now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Battery and assault. No way she&#039;s getting out of that if Jenna backs you up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But then he makes you reconsider. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We all deserve someone who brings us chocolate when we&#039;re down, eh?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And that&#039;s when you remember that call with your mum. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;How worried she was. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;How she&#039;d wake you up not just on birthdays, but on every day. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;How she kept axing guys that turned out to not really accept you and your sister as part of the family. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All the love and compassion a mother could give your kids. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He was right, Megan had turned up with chocolate and books and food and everything last night. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He interrupts you train of thought. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Anon, I&#039;m guessing you want to think about some of this on your own, yeah?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod, slowly, lost in your thoughts. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">If you want to talk to me about something, I&#039;ll leave you my card, alright?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He pulls a card out of his shirt and drops it on your dresser.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You just nod, overcome by sentimentality. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If you cry now, your ruse is so definitely up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mully puts a hand on your bed, making sure you look in his direction. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This man spreads empathy like a lamp spreads light, and he is a 3000W search light, but then he pretends to be a bit more gruff. Gunnery Sargeant-gruff. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Get well soon, ya hear?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod, then mock salute with two fingers. It immediately takes the edge off your emotions.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yes, sir!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You both chuckle as he leaves. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As soon as you hear the door behind him click, you google battery charges. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The amount of time Megan would spend in jail for double battery would make her miss almost all of primary school, never mind kindergarten. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You think back on your childhood and realize how much you would have missed your mother if she had been in prison all that time. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesus fuck. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Could you do that to your own kids? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Out of all the things you could do, singlehandedly robbing them of their mother for something that, if you&#039;re really being honest with yourself, didn&#039;t really physically hurt? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A mom that seems to perfectly down with bring them chocolate and books? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Things really are a clusterfuck. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe you should have some chocolate. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You should definitely have some chocolate. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it&#039;s not exactly a hershey&#039;s bar, this is expensive stuff. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;and it tastes really sweet. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could think things through, but your head is buzzing and you&#039;ve never made a single good decision in the past when you&#039;ve been emotionally charged. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you have a look at the book instead. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Helium Sonata. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;hmm. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A welcome distraction. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But it&#039;s not exactly a long lasting distraction, as it doesn&#039;t take particularly long until your phone buzzes you out of the first few pages. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s your sister. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;HEY, I&#039;M TALKING TO YOU, DINKLEBUTT!&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You open your phone. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s a series of increasingly pissy messages asking you how you are. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;Sorry, talked to an officer just now. Doing okay. Head kinda hurts.&#039; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;Oh look, his majesty graces this peasant with his presence.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What is up with her? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;Alright, fuck off then.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;What?! first, you let mom tell me that you&#039;re in hospital for days, then you won&#039;t even tell your only sister who&#039;s worried about her little bro what&#039;s going on and now you&#039;re angry at me? You fuck off. &#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She follows up with an emoji stretching her tongue out and that&#039;s when you realize that she is just pulling your leg. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;You little brat.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;I&#039;m not a brat, I&#039;m horrible.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;You&#039;re a horrible little sister. Fine?&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;Thank you.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;Mind telling me what the difference is?&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;No one likes a brat, but everyone loves a horrible little sister, and both get away with almost anything.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You chuckle. As you type your reply, it escalates in to a laugh, mostly fueled by relief that some parts of this world are still in order. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;That&#039;s really fucking dumb.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;Fuck you too.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wait for a second too long and she has sent you another message. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;So how are you doing, little big bro?&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;Since when am I little and big at the same time? Last time I checked, I was older and taller than you.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;Ever since I turned horrible.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You start typing &#039;You always were horrible&#039;, but that would be playing right in to her game. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;You brat.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sends you series of crying emoji. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;Why do you hate me so much?What did I do to deserve this?&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;ah, fuck it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;You turned in to a horrible little brat of a sister.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a not really impressed emoji returns, followed by another message from her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;meh. so what&#039;s happening to your noggin. Did you get all of your little sister love knocked out or what.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;Fractured skull, had a part of it pressed in to my brain and apparently that was really swollen? Induced coma for three days, and lots of cuts all over the place. Headaches, but nothing permanent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;Holy shit bro, don&#039;t just kill yourself out of nowhere, alright? That&#039;s uncool.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;It wasn&#039;t me. I think. I don&#039;t know.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;wdym&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;Can&#039;t remember.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;jeez dude.

But nothing permanently damaged.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;except your memories.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;Yeah.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;You know I&#039;m gonna hurt whoever did that to you, right?&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;Kinda illegal. Just looked up battery, you&#039;d probably be in jail for like 5 years.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;Oh yeah? Maybe i&#039;d just have to kill &#039;em and bury the body then. No one hurts my brother.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re at a bit of a loss for words. Is she serious? She can&#039;t be. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;except for me, when he thinks its perfectly fine to not talk to me for like a month.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ah. She absolutely isn&#039;t. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;Hey, I was out for like three days, okay?&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;and 3 days = 1 month?!&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;well, it wouldn&#039;t have been a month if i called you two days ago.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;semantics.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;true.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;how&#039;s jenna?&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;okay, i guess.&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&#039;You guess?&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You start typing up an answer, but before you can finish, your phone rings. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your sister calls and you pick up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;there is a lot of noise on her end, but she is easy to make out. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Lecture is over. Might as well talk. SInce you barely ever talk to me anyway, what&#039;s up with that? I&#039;m your cute little sister and you&#039;re all like.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s silent for a second. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You know bro, that&#039;s just not cool.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you forgot what&#039;s she&#039;s like sometimes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I know, I should call you more often. But I don&#039;t want to interrupt your lectures.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she snorts. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Weak, bro, weak. You know lectures aren&#039;t in the evening.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, she didn&#039;t get all the wit your dad&#039;s genes had to give. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah, but you might be kissing a guy or something. And then I&#039;d pop in to your head because I called. Imagine you&#039;d have to think of my face while you were doing the horizontal tango -</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hear a loud snort, then coughing on the other end, followed by laughter. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No fair!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The horizontal tango? How old are you, 56?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;more laughter. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You dick, you made me spill all my coffee!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hah, you deserve it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear someone trying to pout on the other end while laughing. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You&#039;re horrible.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;well, she deserves this for cheering you up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sounds really heartwarmed now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Awww.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The noise in the background dies down to almost nothing as you hear a car door shut. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alright bro. Go on, tell me about Jenna.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you sigh. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We&#039;re having some trouble right now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can guess what&#039;s going to come next. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Look bro, I know I made some bad calls on your relationships before -</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yeah. Like her bff Raquel back in High School. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">- but I honeslty think you should dump her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well... You&#039;re not really at a point in time where you know what will happen next. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you haven&#039;t thought about it at all yet. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your sister immediatly senses your hesitation. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You&#039;re thinking about it already, aren&#039;t you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;well, no, but you also can&#039;t really see a way of having kids with Megan while Jenna is around. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I... look, things are complicated right now. Like really really complicated.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sounds a little dejected. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You know you can talk with me about stuff like that, right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wonder how much of this will end up with your mother. Your sister has a habit of leaking to your mother things that you might not necessarily tell her on your own, albeit she isn&#039;t that much of a blabbermouth really. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I know, it&#039;s just... I don&#039;t really know.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take a deep breath. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I bought a gun recently. Two, actually.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her reply is angry and a lot dejected. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That&#039;s the big deal? You know I hate those.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s a tiny spill. But it&#039;s enough to break the dam. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No, it&#039;s... Someone&#039;s pregnant. And it&#039;s not Jenna.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The answer comes back after a second. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You&#039;re kidding, right? This is a joke.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wish. You think. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear her breathe in. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">OH MY FUCKING GOD AND YOU HAVEN&#039;T TOLD MOM YET?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well no, of course you haven&#039;t. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It&#039;s really fucking complicated, okay?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; and you launch in to the story. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Holy shit, bro, you weren&#039;t kidding.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The missing part from Megan being in your appartment is still nagging at you, and you told her everything as you remember it and then Megan&#039;s version. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah. I mean, I don&#039;t wanna be like dad, you know? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she seems to be walking now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah. Look, I&#039;d leave, honestly. I can&#039;t see myself living with a rapist. But if you&#039;re gonna pick one, I&#039;d stay with Megan and the babies.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan&#039;s remarks from yesterday seemed... different. Not exaclty like she was a stone cold rapist. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I honestly think she meant that in a way of she just kinda does this forcible thing for the first time, and then she always met the other guys again, you know. Like, a hardcore version of &quot;lets have sex on the first date&quot;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She snorts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That doesn&#039;t make her any less sane, dude. That&#039;s fuckin&#039; cray cray.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can hear her giggle at the other end. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I mean... I can&#039;t even imagine. That&#039;s just wild. I don&#039;t even want to know how many STD&#039;s that girl has. You better get checked yourself too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shit. That never even occured to you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeha, that&#039;s... I really should do that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She snorts. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Bro, you&#039;re so out of whack, it went from not being funny at all to being funny again. I&#039;m coming down. You&#039;re gonna need me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait what? No, you really don&#039;t need your sister taking matters in her hands as well. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;m fine. Trust me.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;that has her laughing. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Dude, I trusted you to be able to do live on your own and you find the most horrible woman on the planet to get along with, call her your girlfriend and then manage to get another girl pregnant without anyone being able to blame you for it within reason and then knock yourself out on a table so hard that it and you break. That is the definition of not fine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;feeble excuses? Of course you have one. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I don&#039;t want to you to miss any courses.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, there is this issue of you being a bit out of the loop on dates. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Dude, it&#039;s friday and monday is a holiday.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One last try. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Jenna is going to come over tonight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That doesn&#039;t really work at all. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Good. Can I tell the cunt the good news that she can fuck off and die?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;YOu don&#039;t really want her to fuck off and die. You want her to stay with you, but you have to face the facts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Please don&#039;t. I would have never ended your relationships and I wouldn&#039;t want you to end mine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;d still rather tell her what&#039;s going to happen and see how she takes it instead of just giving her the boot. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your sister&#039;s answer is hard to hear, her phone seems to slide over something. You seem to make out &#039;maybe you should have&#039;? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What was that?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her voice clarity suddenly picks up a lot, as if she had picked up her phone. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Nothing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Screw that, you&#039;ve just told her some really in depth things about your life. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey, no fair.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sighs. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Can we talk about this later?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;oh well. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alright. got an idea of when you&#039;ll be here?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she taps on her phone. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">i----n six hours. Ish. Traffic looks horrifying.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eugh. six hours? That&#039;s... that&#039;s a lot of fuel, actually. Fuel she shouldn&#039;t be paying for. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You know I&#039;m paying for your gas, right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And the warmth is back in her voice. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Thanks, bro.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you answer in kind. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Thanks for making the trip.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a car door slams shut on her end. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">anything for you bro, see you soon. Bye!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sometimes you wonder whether she calls you bro because you told her that it&#039;s just dumb and silly to spite you or whether she forgot and just does it because she&#039;s an idiot. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Bye.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with that, you hang up and only then do you notice how much your stress level has decreased. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it will be nice to see your sister again. It&#039;s been a while, and while she does get on your nerves, she&#039;s someone you trust implicitly. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Which is something you really could do with about now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her perspective on these issues should help a lot with finding a way out of this mess. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hang on to your thoughts for a while, then take another bite of chocolate. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;lunch comes around. Nurse sharon brings in mediocre food, you eat it, take another cup of pills agains the headaches, then go back to reading your book. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s afternoon when someone else interrupts the Helium Sonata, which is a surprisingly well written Sci-fi-book. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey, is Anon here?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Stage, right: goddess.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tilly pokes her head in to the room. Well, her gray ears first, and then the rest of her bunny head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hi Miss Hopps.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile, and she smiles back. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We&#039;re out of office, you can call me Tilly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Uh... alright.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Sure. I&#039;m Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This feels weird. What exactly is she doing? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">How are you doing today?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, pretty nice actually. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Got a nice buzz going with these pills, someone is making my food, could be worse.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She laughs. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Except for that hole in your head, right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you pretend to remember that just now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Oh, yeah, that. That still hurts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you shrug. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Can&#039;t have it all, eh?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She seems fairly conspiratorily. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Guess you can&#039;t.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She takes the seat next to your bed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I have a little something from us at the office.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Its a lot of clear wrapping around a gift basket with some small sweets and a few assorted fruits.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nothing fancy, but there is a gift card on it with your name and you definitely weren&#039;t expecting it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Thank you!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">oh, it&#039;s not much.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You examine it, then open the tie. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The carrot sticks out like a sore thumb. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull it out and give it a try. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s a carrot. A really good one, but still just a carrot. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It&#039;s nice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I know, they are really great aren&#039;t they? I found a farmer that grows them on a rooftop near my home. You can really tast ethe sun on them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;okay, this is getting really weird. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey, you know, I gotta ask. Is Vince okay with me being out? I expected him to be a bit more... displeased.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She leans back in to the chair and folds her legs over each other. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Oh yeah, I mean, I had to do a little digging to find you. He was pretty angry the day before yesterday, but then insurance called us about an ambulance ride. We didn&#039;t know a thing about what was going on and from there on out it was just a question of driving to the hospital and asking for your name. Dr. Dubian was kind enough to let me know that you were in a coma and Vince does take health seriously.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That... actually explains everything.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Ah. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Thanks for that, I really didn&#039;t want to get fired. Can I interest you in some chocolate?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tilly looks at the chocolate you offer her and then waves her hand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No, thank you. I don&#039;t really have a sweet tooth, you know.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You break the carrot you&#039;ve nibbled on in half, then hand her the part that&#039;s untouched. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She wants to decline, but you insist. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Oh well, then don&#039;t mind if I do.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She happily munches away on it, while you complain a little about hospital food and finally, she looks at her wristwatch and declares its time to go for her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You say your goodbyes and she leaves. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lie back and let your head sink in to the fluffy pillow. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Midday has long passed and the light outside is turning late afternoon golden as your phone awakens you from dozing. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hi Jen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear clacking shoes in the background. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hello hon, how are you doing?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, the pain meds are working pretty well by now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Pretty good. Still cut to shit and high as a kite, but pretty good.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sounds a little distracted, as a car door falls shut. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That sounds great. Listen, I&#039;m sorry I couldn&#039;t call earlier, I&#039;m going to be there tonight, alright?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Uh... sure. She sounds awfully... disinterested. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah, thats fine. How are you doing?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She then goes in to a short tirade about her office rivalries, but stops pretty quickly as she still has another meeting coming up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Okay, alright. I&#039;ll see you tonight then.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quickly wonder whether you should ask her to bring a nice dinner, but then decide against it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If she doesn&#039;t bring it up herself, she either has that planned already or too much on her plate. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah, see ya tonight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you put your phone down, wondering how badly she&#039;ll take the entire Megan is keeping the babies thing. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It takes another hour before the door to your room gets knocked on. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Come in!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It opens, and your sister rushes in. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Heybro,gottapee!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With that, the door to your bathroom gets flung open, then equally quickly gets flung shut and you raise your torso with the aid of the powered bed to a more upright position, expecting to spend some time talking to Sarah. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It takes her a while on the loo while you shake your head awake a little bit, anticipating a lighthearted verbal machine gun firefight. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But when she returns from the loo, a warm comfortable feeling washes over you and you smile. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey Sarah.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles back. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey accident.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You snort. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Wow, you&#039;re especally horrible today.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She chuckles. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Special treatment for big dumb bros. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">How are you doing?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;not a lot has changed since you called Jenna. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">High as a kite on meds, Pain&#039;s gone, everything is fluffy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah is interested. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What are you getting?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have no idea. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">White pills.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She makes her Duh! face. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And what would those be?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shake your head slowly. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I have no-o-o-o idea. How was the drive down?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah still doesn&#039;t seem happy about the question of your medication, but switches topics. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Bo-ring. It&#039;s better when I get to bring someone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re about to suggest audiobooks, but Sarah has always disliked them. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">If only you&#039;d like audiobooks...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shakes her head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You know I always fall asleep when I listen to them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She moves to the right in her chair to look past you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Is that chocolate?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Mind if I have some?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Seeing as she has already gotten up and is making her way to the chocolate right now, you nod again as declining seems fairly pointless. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Thanks, bro.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she takes one of the couple of bars and looks around the other things on your bed side table. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That a lot of stuff. I&#039;m starting to dislike Jenna a bit less.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you divert your eyes slightly embarassed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That&#039;s actually not Jenna&#039;s.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her mouth full of chocolate, she immediatly replies. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No&#039;? Wha&#039; iff?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She has to do this on purpose. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I don&#039;t think any of it is. She&#039;s kinda busy. Also, You know I love you, but could you please stop chewing with your mouth wide open? That&#039;s fucking disgusting. I refuse to believe grandma didn&#039;t drill this in to your head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She swallows. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah, but the difference is that Grandma isn&#039;t here right now and with you, i can be a pig. It&#039;s very relaxing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So let me get this straight, Jenna didn&#039;t even bring you chocolate?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You actually prefer less sweet treats. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Well, no, but its alright, she&#039;s kinda busy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She squints her eyes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hold up, has she even been here since you woke up?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">We spoke on the phone, she&#039;s coming around tonight. Don&#039;t give her too much shit, she&#039;s busy at work, you know? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah does not seem to agree with your view of the subject. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">tsssk. I live six hours away and managed to be here before her?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;well, yeah, but jenna works and... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You don&#039;t have to work today?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She raises an eyebrow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So? If my boyfriend-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You know for a fact she doesn&#039;t have a boyfriend. You think. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Wait, you have a boyfriend now?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She did not like that question. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Stop rubbing it in. I was saying I would have been here a-zap.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;ASAP is not a-zap. This woman. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah, but you&#039;re a lazy commie college student and she is a hard workin&#039; red blooded &#039;murican gal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles and you return it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey, you were a college student not that long ago.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You just poke your tongue at her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She returns the favor and you both chuckle. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So who got you that chocolate?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Uhhh.. do you want to talk about Megan again? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The basket is from work.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But your sister keeps on hitting the uncomfortable spots. Not missing a beat, she asks:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And the other stuff?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wince inwardly. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Megan.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your sister looks at the chocolate bar in your hand, at the book, phone charger and toiletries. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She brought you chocolate, a book and a phone charger?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you nod. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You know, she might be the nicest rapist I have ever heard off. Still fucking wrong, but overall pretty good, 3/10.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks in to your eyes and takes another bite out of the chocolate. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She seemed like she wasn&#039;t that horrible of a person.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your sister raises an eyebrow. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You know she dragged you in to a back alley and had her way with you, right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah, i know, I just ... I mean, we talked a little when she brought me this stuff and I think she genuinely regrets it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your sister slowly shakes her head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Broski, you&#039;re so out of whack.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She has to be taking the piss with that bro thing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah chuckles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Bro, you&#039;re so fucked. I mean, come on. A rapist?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wince.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I think she&#039;s just misguided, you know.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see Sarah is about to say something, but then the door opens and a slightly breathless Jenna walks in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey, honey!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She walks up to you, pecks you on the cheek, then turns to Sarah and greets her with a significantly colder tone. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hello Sarah.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah smiles her fuck you smile. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hello Jenna.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh, but smile at your girlfriend as you greet her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey Jen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She somewhat warms to you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">How&#039;s your head?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;slightly worse than before. the tension in the room stresses you, and it made your head ache worse. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Could be better.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She quickly strokes your forehead. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It&#039;ll get better.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She then takes in the amount of stuff that&#039;s already on your desk and the cell phone charger. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You should really thank your sister for this, you know?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it takes a second for you to realize that she assumed that book, chocolate and toiletries were from sarah. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Uh, yeah.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah tries her best impression of blinking guy meme behind Jenna&#039;s back. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;jenna takes some chocolate out of your basket form work, then grabs the book and gives the cover a cursory read before carelessly putting it back down. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">meh.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah appears to start to say something, but you try to stop her by waving your finger in her direction as Jenna sits down on the side of your bed, her back to your other hand. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All you get from Sarah is a shit eating grin and she interrupts Jenna as she is about to say something. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Say, Jenna, what makes you think I brought him those things?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She turns around. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You didn&#039;t?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah shakes her head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Nope.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna turns around, scrutinizing you, then the gifts. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But before she can ask you about chocolate and books, Sarah draws quicker once more. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You know, I&#039;m not usually this blunt, but how come you&#039;ve only shown up today?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;WIth the atmosphere turning increasingly hostile, you&#039;re feeling seriously uncomfortable about now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna goes in to full on verbal catfight mode and does not let you deescalate, shushing you as you try to get Sarah to dial it back down. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Because unlike you, I have a job.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah doesn&#039;t even flinch at that. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Same. And yet i was here before you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna seems to get somewhat more pissed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Flipping burgers is hardly a job that you will be missed at. No wonder you could just take time off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah gets equally bitchy. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Because your work as a glorified secretary is so much more important.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your stress level is rising, you can feel the pressure in your head past the pain meds. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna turns to you with a smile that says &#039;do what I say or else&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Why is she here again and could you get her to shut up? I had a hard enough day already.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As if on cue, there is a knock on the open door and Sarah&#039;s eyes go wide as saucers as she does a double take. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks at you, then at the door, then at you and mouthes wow. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna follows Sarah&#039;s gaze, and that stops Megan dead in her tracks - but it&#039;s too late. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">YOU.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan seems to rotate through a few emotions, trying to decide whether to run or to fight. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah jumps in. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You&#039;re Megan.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah gets out of her chair. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hi. I&#039;m Sarah, Anon&#039;s sister.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan discombobulatedly waves back as Sarah gives her an introductory wave. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I... Hi.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;and then Jenna explodes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">YOU! YOU WILL LEAVE RIGHT FUCKING NOW!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah then looks at you before slipping past Megan, shutting the door and firing back at Jenna. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I don&#039;t think she will.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Which redirects Jenna&#039;s anger right at her, but before she can act on it, you interrupt her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Jenna, please calm -</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">DON&#039;T YOU FUCKING TELL ME TO CALM DOWN. I will NOT be talked to like this right now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna turns back to Megan. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">YOU. LEAVE.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah stays perfectly calm and casual, probably very aware how infuriating her stubborness is to Jenna. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan seems to draw confidence from her seemingly new ally. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No, I&#039;ll stay here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her stance changes, from nervous flight to nervously defensive. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna then turns to you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Anon, her being here isn&#039;t good for you, you need to get her out of here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But Sarah answers for you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No, Anon will not. Because unlike you, Megan here actually managed to show up already yesterday. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna&#039;s anger rises from pissed to nuclear. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Jenna, calm dow-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your feeble attempt at pacifying her at least slightly are comparable to pissing in to a fire tornado. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">NO! I WILL NOT CALM DOWN!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She breathes in and becomes queitly angry after realizing that yelling in a hospital is probably not the best of ideas. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At least she&#039;s still that lucid, which is better than having her devolve in to a wild harpy - at least that&#039;s the word Megan used, which does fit her in her anger quite well. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I will not calm down. You</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She points at Megan</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Need to leave.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah folds her arms. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She won&#039;t.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna doesn&#039;t take that too well. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And YOU need to shut the fuck up. Why are you even here?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your head doesn&#039;t feel too good. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Guys...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah and Jenna ignore you as Sarah pours more oil in to the fire. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Oh, so I&#039;m not allowed to show interest in the wellbeing of my bro? It&#039;s not like you seem to give too much of a shit, arriving here a week after he was admitted.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s like waving a red flag in front of a bull. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I was busy. With work. I can&#039;t just leave at the drop of a hat like a certain burger flipping yokel.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your head isn&#039;t getting better. Being in the middle of this fight is a lot of stress. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Guys please...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But the only one who seems to react and catch your eye is Megan, who looks curious, then concerned as Sarah launches in to her counter attack. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Oh, thank you for your kindness. Bless your sweet hateful heart for putting your career before the guy you supposedly love. What did you have to do? Copy empty paper? Move some folders around? Shine someone&#039;s shoes? Water fake plants?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That seems to be enough for Jenna as she walks over to Sarah and physically starts to push her out of the room. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Hey!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah&#039;s protests are interrupted by the door opening, with a nurse barging in with fury in her eyes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">What the hell are you doing here? This patient needs rest, not a WWE show!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna freezes, her hands still on Sarah.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Out, all of you!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan raises her hands like a cowboy with a gun pointed at her back. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah quickly shoves Jenna&#039;s hands off of her, then begins to walk out as she straightens her clothing. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But Jenna is having none of it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;m his girlfriend, I can&#039;t leave him now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The nurse is absolutely not having any of her shit. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Do you need me to call security?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna doesn&#039;t seem to be finished arguing. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah, if you can just get those two out of here everything will be fine. I&#039;m his girlfriend and he really needs me right now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear Sarah snort, a very cynical sound. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The expression on the nurse&#039;s face tells you that this was EXACTLY the wrong thing to say. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You get one more chance. Out. Now. Next call is to security to drag you out of here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Meanwhile, Megan and Sarah have already made their way out of the room. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Look, the other two are gone now, there -</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The nurse reaches for the phone on the wall and dials a short number. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks at Jenna as she talks. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah, hi, I need security in L wing room 245. ... yeah. Thanks.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna looks incredulous. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Wha--- no, everything is okay here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The nurse silently points out of the room. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna seems nervous, looks at you, then at the nurse. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">LEAVE.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jenna seems unwilling to go. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">But he needs-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the nurse cuts her off. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">REST.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With one last look at you, Jenna finally takes off. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take a deep breath and sink in to your pillow. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your head still feels weirdly painful, but it isn&#039;t getting worse anymore. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;YOu hear the nurse apporaching the bed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you open your eyes, she has softened significantly. She&#039;s still not warm, more like a strict teacher, but it seems to be more of a tired expression than an angry one. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Are you okay?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her expression gradually softens even more until she actually becomes somewhat warm. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;ve got a headache despite the pain meds.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shakes her head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Did you not tell them that stress would be bad for you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You offer half of a cynical smile. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I didn&#039;t get the chance to. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sighs. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">How&#039;s the pain?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take a moment to assess and quantify the pain. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">3/10, but its really weird.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods, the takes a pen and writes something in to a file thats at the end of your bed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;ll have to check in with the doc, we&#039;ll see about doing something about this, okay?

Clearly fit as hell and taller than any woman and most guys, she looks menacing even in jeans and a spaghetti strap top. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Which somewhat takes the fight out of you, but not by a whole lot. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You know that just because I had your back with Jenna doesn&#039;t mean we&#039;re cool, right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan squints at you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I have no idea who you are, but thank you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You point towards the room that a security guy is currently entering. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">His sister.

Now if you could, please, explain to me what you thinking process was on dragging him in to that side alley...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan fidgets. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I... I think we should go somewhere more private if you want to talk about that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I don&#039;t think I&#039;d feel too safe with someone like you somewhere in private.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan looks around at all the staff working on the station. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Just... like, maybe outside? In view of the smoking area? I don&#039;t care, just not here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s not that you feel particularly in danger around her, it&#039;s more of a wary feeling after knowing what she had previously done that you feel the need to be on the safe side. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But still, in view of others while giving her some privacy seems reasonable enoughy so you nod. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Lead the way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan turns and starts walking, following the way Jenna went with her Tail forming a relaxed reverse J behind her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t particularly feel like talking to her and she seems unwilling to discuss much with hospital staff in earshot. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It doesn&#039;t take long for you to leave the building and you find a nice spot on a bench in the park that surrounds a part of the hospital. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can clearly see the smokers corner and they can clearly see you, as well as the lady at the reception desk. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;perfect. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan sits down next to you, noticeably a bit up the bench. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So? Why did you do it?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She swallows, audibly. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She takes a deep breath. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;ve done this a few times.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She seems to search for something to look at that isn&#039;t your very judgy gaze. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;d grab guys and pin them and have my way with them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile in a very fake manner. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That&#039;s insane. I don&#039;t think I want you near my brother, my nieces and nephews or my mum.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She raises her hands in a stopping gesture.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No no, I didn&#039;t just do it out of nowhere. I... I had a friend who asked me to do it. To him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your facial expression doesn&#039;t change one iota as you wait for a better explanation. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He was... He wanted it that way. He wasn&#039;t a pred, you know. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You interrupt as the term pred hasn&#039;t come up in your day to day interactions before. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Pred? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods, seemingly far more comfortable with explaining anthro subcultures. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah, pred, predator, you know. You&#039;re either a pred like me or prey like he was. Some guys get off on their DNA being part apex, but it&#039;s usually guys that have nothing else to be proud of. And some actually get aroused by being prey and being made to feel like it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Okay. I can understand that. But that still doesn&#039;t really explain why you would move to non consentual acts. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She noticeably droops. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Well, he liked it, and so did the next guy, and then I had a really annoying night and one guy just wouldn&#039;t take any hints and he&#039;d been a little dense but cute dense so I kind of just ... you know, took the first step and that really turned him on. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks at you, searching for judgement, but not stopping in her explanation. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And it slowly went more and more that way. I mean, I started to really like playing in to the predator thing and these guys really liked playing in to the prey thing on the first time and we&#039;d have a couple of lighthearted flings after. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her tone and demeanor are still very apologetic, as if she&#039;s trying to come up with an excuse. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So I just ... I mean, they all really liked it, you know? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She swallows. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And I... I assumed all guys would be in to it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shake your head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Well, that&#039;s where you assumed wrong. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods and stares ahead in to the distance. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yeah, I see that now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decide to prod her a little, verablly, as the silence drags on. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So why him? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She fiddles with her fingers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">One thing led to another, really. I&#039;d seen him before and he always looked miserable, especially with her around. And then that night I really needed it, like, you don&#039;t understand how it gets. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s looking at you now, in to your eyes, trying to explain a feeling. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I... I wasn&#039;t always like this, you know? I used to be nor- human, I mean. But when you really need IT, once you&#039;re like this, it&#039;s really unlike anything you&#039;ve ever felt before. It gets so intense that you absolutely HAVE to do something about it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ve got your finger up, face scrunched up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Wait, you were human? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Megan nods. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re still incredulous. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;ve never even heard of that. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She seems far more comfortable talking about this and shrugs. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It happens. Some people really lose their shit and it was weird in the beginning but always great for me. Got me out of my wheelchair. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While this is interesting and you make a sidenote to get back to it later, you&#039;re still not done with your line of questioning from earlier. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Back to where we were. Why him? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That little dip in to her personal history seems to have given her a little more self confidence, but not a whole lot as she noticeably seems to shrink not quite as far again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I just... smelled him and got the heebie jeebies and then... I kinda get... tunnel vision. I mean I didn&#039;t even see Jenna until she was trying to drag me off of him, you know? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your eyebrow is raised as far as you can get it as you give her a very disapproving glare. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And that happens with every guy you&#039;ve been with. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shakes her head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">No, well, yes, but never like this, I mean, tunnel vision, yeah, but I&#039;ts never been like this where I just... I mean, he could have been with a cop in uniform and I wouldn&#039;t have noticed the cop. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li></ol>        </div>

Foreword: This will eventually have to be rewritten, as the greentext format doesn&#039;t work in a pastebin that well as syntax highlighting for greens is not an option on pastebin. As such, making out direct speech is tiring. However, that also means that the entire structure of the language is now garbage, making it quite the extensive rewrite as greentext mannerisms like TFW, YFW or meme.jpg as communicative tools are also no longer working. 
Ideally, we would get greentext syntax highlighting native on pastebin, but I don&#039;t see them supporting that anytime soon unless /k/s /ak/-thread starts asking them for it. 

 &gt;be out with humie gf
&gt;she&#039;s wearing a plaited skirt because we went out dancing, now on our way to her place
&gt;we walk through some dark spots because the long way round is at least 20 minutes more and we&#039;re tired
&gt;when suddenly, you get pulled aside by big furry paws as a panther girl pulls you deeper in to one of the dark spots
&gt;your girlfriend screams angrily and pulls on your arm but she is the twiggy wallflower type, not that she is ugly, but both of you stay slim by eating less and not by lifting. 
&gt;the panther girl is clearly not interested in her at all, as she ignores her at first and then gives her a backhand that makes you worry she might be dead
She&#039;s fine.
&gt;says panther girl as she pushes you against a wall, then moves your arms to one of her paws and uses the other to drag your pants down
&gt;her paw moves to your throat as she starts to choke you while pushing her huge tiddies againts you
&gt;this woman is an amazon if there ever was one
&gt;she lets go of your arms and ignores your attempts to push her off
&gt;your dick, despite your fear, hardens and she smiles a toothy smile
&gt;jesus fuck those incisors are big
good boy. You&#039;ll like this.
&gt;and she pulls you to the ground, so she can sit on your lap
&gt;she pulls her sport pants aside, having pulled up her runner&#039;s bra earlier, enough to slide you inside of her
haaa...aaaa...
&gt;even a girl like her gets a little shaken when the D goes in
&gt;she&#039;s super wet and tighter than you&#039;d think, given the fact that she is at least 6 feet tall
&gt;she slowly slides forwards and backwards, beginning to grind your dick and out of her and your scrawny ass across the pavement
&gt;behind her, something moves and your scrawny gf gets back up, blinks and then starts to bawl while screaming and attacking
&gt; panther girl looks annoyed until your gf grabs pnather&#039;s ponytail and pulls on it. 
&gt;your combined efforts of pusshing and pulling still haven&#039;t gotten her off, but her rhythm has slowed and become unsteady as she focuses on dealing with you two
&gt;she lets out a roar of frustrated anger as your gf tries to drag her off of you 
&gt;if your dick wasn&#039;t balls deep in tight pussy, the face she was making and that roar would have definitely shrunk you to peanut size
&gt;your gf, like any woman, doesn&#039;t seem to have a concept of when its time to stop fucking with someone
&gt;panther girl lifts her hips just far enough for you to not pop out entirely and grabs your gf&#039;s head with one of her paws, using the other to pry her hand open so her hair is once more free. 
&gt;she whips your gf around and pins her against the wall that you&#039;re crumpled against, then backhands her, leading to just choking her as your gf digs her nails in to the fur on her arm to get her to stop. 
&gt;panther girl sits down on your dick again and resumes her rhythm, easily counteracting your attempts of pushing her around. As your gf sobs next to you, intermittently screeching with anger, panther girl speeds up significantly.
&gt;a moment ago, you thought this was going to end, but now you&#039;re both locked down and panther girl can do whatever she wants, which seems to be making you cum, balls deep. 
&gt;her hips apporach lighting speed as she pummels you and you can feel the orgasm coming on, a strong one. She chokes you pretty hard, your arms start feeling like noodles as you feel yourself going over the edge. 
&gt; it feels like pushing fabric through a hole too tiny for the garment. Your body convulses like your gf&#039;s when you eat her out and you buck enough to actually push her up a little. 
&gt;panther girl smiles a goofy smile at you, then pecks you on your lips. 
thanks for that, hero. I needed that.
&gt;hero? wtf
&gt;She sighs, then gets up and takes a few steps back while adjusting her attire to sit normally. 
You won&#039;t get away with this.
&gt;Your girlfriend hasn&#039;t got the strength to get up yet
&gt;but apparently already able to make empty threats through a horse throat
&gt;while she does so, she gets up and tends to you
I&#039;m calling the police.
&gt; panther girl chuckles
&gt;more tears roll down your gfs face and she tries to pull up your pants to hide your dick
Do it.
I will!
&gt;you put your arm out on your gfs arm
don&#039;t bother
&gt;you croak, as panther girl nods to you
He know&#039;s whats up
&gt;she chuckles, then walks out in to the street, quickly jogging again as if nothing had happened at all
Hey!
&gt;Your gf yells after her, attempting to stop her but unwilling to leave her side
&gt;she turns back to you, sorrow in her eyes
i&#039;m so sorry...
&gt;then she starts bawling again
&gt;you mechanically button up your pants and tuck your sloppy messy dick away
&gt;slowly, she follows you up
&gt;as you exit the dark alley and come back in to the yellow light of the street lamps, she swallows her tears
We.. we&#039;ve got to get to the police
&gt;You follow her on autopilot
&gt;she&#039;s holding you while you walk, directing
&gt;the next police station isn&#039;t far away

&gt;the desk seargent looks bored
&gt;his look changes somewhat, as you two walk in
&gt; your girlfriend wants to do the talking, but there are a couple of guys in here, lounging around so you put your hand on your arm to stop her. 
&gt; you approach the desk sargeant
Good Evening. How may I help you?
I... can I talk to someone somewhere more private?
&gt; The desk sargeant gives you a weird look.
Uh. Yeah, sure. It would help if I knew what this was about though.
I&#039;d rather not tell in public.
&gt;his eyes flicker between you and your gf, who stands behind you with her arms crossed. She&#039;s mildly annoyed that you wouldn&#039;t let her do this for you. 
You&#039;re going to have to give me something so I can get you the right colleague to talk to.
&gt;you swallow
I was... assaulted.
&gt;he raises an eyebrow. 
and you can&#039;t talk to me about this here because...
&gt;you want to go home so badly. Nothing feels more emasculating than telling someone that you got raped.
&gt;you turn to your gf, who gibes you a &#039;go on&#039; look. 
I can&#039;t. Please?
&gt;He frowns, than slides his chair backwards in to the corridor on the other side of the protective glass. 
I&#039;ll be right back.
&gt;you turn to your gf, who closes the distance. 
You should have told him about the -
&gt;You stop her mid sentence. Not in a room full of guys, that would be absolutely humiliating. 
I&#039;ll talk to them. Okay?
&gt;she seems to disapprove and quietly whispers to you
All of these people here, they probably are here because, like, their bike got stolen or they lost their pet or dumb shit like that but you&#039;re here because you were fucking raped and -
&gt;the door leading in to the station opens and blond woman looks through the door, accompanied by the desk sargeant who waves you over. 
&gt;You cut your gf off, having internally cringed as she said the r-word. 
Hi. I&#039;m detective Christensen. You had something you want to talk about?
&gt;you nod and walk through the door she holds open. 
You good?
&gt;She smiles and responds to the desk sargeant. 
Thanks, Harry. We&#039;ll be at my desk. And who might you be?
&gt;Your gf stops, seemingly pissy that this isn&#039;t immediatly obvious. 
I&#039;m his Girlfriend.
Alright.
&gt;Instant animosity. Great. 
&gt;the two of you follow her through the small station in to a room with just one desk in it. 
You&#039;re lucky i&#039;m working late today. Anyway. Coffee, tea?
&gt;your gf softly prods you and quietly repeats the question. 
tea?
&gt;you nod. Tea seems nice. Internally, you&#039;re quite happy that you&#039;re not talking to a dude.
Both of you?
&gt; your gf nods as well. 
Alright, i&#039;ll get the water boiling. Both of you can sit down in front of my desk and we&#039;ll start in a minute.
&gt;Detective Christensen starts boiling water, fixes herself another cup of coffee and sets out mugs with teabags in them, then sits down in her chair, produces a notepad and a pen and clicks it. 
why don&#039;t we start with who you are.
&gt;you answer her questions as she methodically asks for your info.&gt;she also takes down your gf&#039;s info
Why don&#039;t you tell me what you were doing before the assault.
it wasn&#039;t assault, it was rape.
&gt;your gf immediatly jumps the gun
&gt;Detective christensen comes a lot more lively almost immediately. 
You were raped?
No, he was.
&gt;that gets you a raised eye brow, as you try to disappear in to the chair you&#039;re on. 
You were raped? What did he look like?
&gt;You just let your gf do the talking at this point and focus on the pens in a cup on Christensen&#039;s desk. 
It was a woman. A black panther chimera.
&gt;Christensen&#039;s eyebrow is raised significantly, as she looks at you. 
&gt;you mumble a confirmation, as christensen starts writing while your gf tells the whole story. 
&gt;slowly but steadily, christensens enthusiasm wanes until all that is left is a frown. 
So you two were fighting her off, but she still managed to do what she wanted?
Yes!
&gt;your gf seemingly has become quite irritated and impatient. 
&gt;Christensen looks at you, while you cling on to the mug of tea that she got you earlier. 
Jenna, right? Would you mind leaving me alone with anon for a second?
Wha-
Just a minute or two. You can sit outside.
&gt;your girlfriend snaps her mouth shut. She seems severily irritated now and leaves in a huff. 
&gt;christensen shuts the door behind her and then turns to you. 
Can you recount the entire thing for me, with your own words, please?
&gt;you do, and you notice that the detective is making no notes whatsoever, instead piercing you with her gaze. 
&gt;the ask a few clarifying questions, but not many, culminating in the final one
Did you cum?
&gt;you mumble something. 
I ask again. Did you have an orgasm?
well... yes
&gt;something seems to close in the detectives eyes. 
&gt;She exhales, then inhales loudly. 
Alright, here is what I think happened: You know that girl. This was supposed to be some fetish thing after you dropped your girl outside off. Maybe this is the new way to end relationships among you kids. Whatever. 
I don&#039;t care. I don&#039;t believe this was rape for one second. Know how I do? I have rape cases in here every month. The guy just overpowered the girl and yhe slumps there just like you do, telling me the story of how she got taken. Overpowered. You know how many stories to the contrary i hear, a girl overpowering a guy? very fucking few.
Know how many stories I hear of a guy and a girl getting overpowered by a single woman? zilch. Never happens. Wanna know why? Because it&#039;s impossible.
Which means you&#039;re full of shit. I&#039;m one hundred percent certain that you could have fought your way out if you&#039;d wanted to.
So i&#039;m not going to do anything.
What I am going to do is I am going to set your girl straight.
&gt;She punched the intercom. 
Harry, one of my two is done, can you escort him out?
&gt;the intercom responded
Lenny will be with you in a sec.
Thanks.
&gt;she turned to you again. 
Send your girl back in on your way out.
&gt;Wondering how this could have gotten any worse, you leave the room and an officer waits for you. 
&gt;You motion Jenna back inside with your eyes as the officer escorts you through the station and back out, to the desk sargeant.
&gt;It doesn&#039;t take much longer for your furious girlfriend to storm out of the station. 
&gt;She grabs you and pulls you out of the building, responding to a 
good evening!
&gt;by a guy next to the door with 
Fuck you too!
&gt;She&#039;s absolutely brimming with rage. 
They don&#039;t fucking believe us. Can you imagine that? I told her all about this and she doesn&#039;t fucking believe its real. She tried to tell me that you were cheating on me. What the fuck is wrong with these people?
&gt;A ball of fiery rage dripping tears of pure anger drags you along to her place, so easily visible that even the half naked retards usually hollering at girls try and disappear in to the streets. 
&gt;it lasts until you arrive at her place. There, she collapses and weeps like a waterfountain, clinging on to you, sobbing how sorry she was over and over again.
&gt;you feel dirty
&gt;there is crusty stuff all over your dick. 
&gt;You have this overwhelming need to go clean yourself
Jenna,
&gt;as you say her name, she immediatly looks up at you
I need a shower
&gt;she comes around a little, smiling through her tears
o-of course.
&gt;She pushes you in to the direction of the shower, still weeping. 
&gt;You stumble your way in and slowly take your clothes off, then get hot watwr going and start slowly washing your body, then more aggressively scrubbing yourself down until jenna interrupts you. 
How are you doing?
&gt;The shower has gone cold and you&#039;ve frozen with your dick in hand, red as a lobster, using one of her scrubbers on it. 
&gt;You can see her behind the shower curtain, peeking in through the slightly ajar bathroom door. 
&gt;You are struck by the sudden fear that she might see this as odd
Jenna, do you believe me?
&gt;She walks in to the bathroom, then pulls the shower curtain aside. 
&gt;Your eyes meet and she searches yours
I do. I was there, honey.
&gt;Her tears are flowing again. 
&gt;She shuts off the water, then stands on her toes to hug you. 
&gt;After a long time, she lets go, pushing back against your embrace of her and takes the scrubber and shampoo out of your hands, then leads you out and wraps you in a towel. 
&gt;You&#039;re feeling better, now that you&#039;re squeaky clean. 
&gt;gradually, you take Jenna in to your arms and you hold each other again for a while, during which you finally crack and tear up, not even entirely sure what about. 
&gt;after a while, you both just go to bed. 
&gt;You curl up and for the first time ever, you can feel Jenna holding you.
&gt;Next day, you spend a few hours sulking until you realize that it won&#039;t help. Jenna asks you to see a psychiatrist, but you&#039;re not feeling like discussing the matter further, instead opting to bury it deeper. 
&gt;After breakfast, you decide to go home. &gt;Jenna had an appointment with friends of hers and you don&#039;t see the point of being in an appartment that isn&#039;t filled with your stuff. 
&gt;On your way home, you pass a gun store and decide there and then that this was the last time that anyone got to fuck with you physically without repercussions. 
&gt;You walk in... 
&gt;... and leave without a pistol.
&gt;But you do have an order for a CCP pistol for your noodly arms and signed up for a CCW course, and also brought an AR with you. 
&gt;You walk home, feeling a lot better, as if you finally have control again. 
&gt;Control is back. Your mancard got reissued. 
&gt;it wasn&#039;t cheap, but it was worth it. &gt;Nothing says fuck off like a military style assault weapon. 
&gt;At night, Jenna stops by your place. While she isn&#039;t happy about your purchase, she is understanding and having her around is comforting. 
&gt;Over the next few days, your CCW course starts, you spend evenings at your local community college, making sure that you walk in groups or in brightly lit areas if you have to and you went back to work without missing a day. 
&gt;everything seems to be getting back to normal and fiddling with your guns has made you a lot more self confident. 
&gt;the next chimera to try something will get some. 

&gt;you have a random afternoon after you got off work, before you go down to your local college for your CCW class as your doorbell unexpectedly rings. 
&gt;You&#039;re not expecting anyone tonight. 
&gt;You go to answer the intercom, but there is no answer as you cautiosly say 
hello?
&gt;instead, there is a light knock on the door. 
&gt;you open the spy glass and peer through. 
&gt;you see the empty corridor and reach for your AR, quitly racking one in to the chamber. 
&gt;a black furry paw comes in to view.
&gt;you tense up, but the paw is holding something for you to see. 
&gt;its a stick with a double oval outline, off white, with a pink tip on one side and a tiny window - shwoing two lines.
&gt;You can hear her talk through the door. 
We need to talk!
&gt;You don&#039;t feel like talking at all. 
Go away!
&gt;she shows her face in the door spy
We can talk through the door and keep your neighbours entertained, or you can let me in!
&gt;no fucking chance. 
Fuck off!
Alright, I&#039;m suing for alimony!
&gt;oh fuck.
&gt;alimony? In this state? 
&gt;ohjeezohfuck
&gt;you&#039;d be turbofucked
&gt;Wait, wouldn&#039;t she be admitting she raped you?
How are you going to argue in court that I have to pay for kids I did not willingly conceive?
&gt;her hand moves away form the door spy and you can see her face for the first time. It&#039;s not even nearly as frightening as you remember it. 
Can you just open your door and we can talk about this somewhat in private? Otherwise I&#039;m just gonna drop this in your girlfriend&#039;s letter box.
&gt;ohshitohfuggohjeez
&gt;You really don&#039;t want to open the door, despite feeling secure with your new aqcuisitions from a few days ago. 
&gt;But maybe you can talk about this with one of them trained on her. 
&gt;you quickly think through your options. If you open the door, you can&#039;t have both of your hands on the rifle and you could be overwhelmed. 
&gt;So you have to open the door and step away quickly, out of arm&#039;s reach. 
&gt;but then, what if someone passes by? 
&gt;They&#039;d surely do something about a chimera in a doorway with a dude in the flat aiming a rifle at them. 
&gt;So you have to be out of sight. 
&gt;your apartment is somehwat shaped like a hotel room, the the left of the front door is the bathroom, beyond which the room opens up in to the kitchenette on the right and your living room where the bed in a hotel would normally be. Your bedroom is to the far left. 
&gt;The smart move would be to unlatch the door, immediately retreat out of the hall in to the living room and move left, hiding behind the wall there, out of arms reach. 
&gt;but wait. what if she snatches one of them out of your hands and turns it against you? 
&gt;dread of loss of power flows through you again and you quickly look around for your pistol and it&#039;s holster, but they&#039;re in the living room. 
Wait, please!
&gt;You check the spyglass on more time and expect to see a frown and folded arms, instead she&#039;s looking down the corridor, seemingly at a state of total ease.
&gt;You run back in to the living room, slide the holster in to your jeans, then the gun in to the holster. 
&gt;oh wait, load one. 
&gt;You quietly chamber a round
&gt;then slide the gun in to the holster. 
&gt;sufficiently prepared, you return to the door and execute your plan. 
&gt;handle push, pull and jump backwards a few paces, beyoned the corner of the bathroom and a few paces more, then a quick 180 and guns up. 
Helloooo?
&gt;You hear the door being pushed open. 
Just come in and walk in to the living room.
&gt;steps are moving through the hallway as you remember rule #1 of firearms just before they reach the corner: Never point a gun at something you don&#039;t immediately intend to shoot. 
&gt;you don&#039;t relax your deathgrip one bit as you pull the muzzle from headheight down to 45 degrees, just as she walks in to the living room, looking in the direction of the kitchen. 
I&#039;m here.
&gt;she turns around and freezes, eyes wide. 
Is that a real...
&gt;as she trails off, you nod. 
ooo...kay.
&gt;well, this is going a lot better than you expected. 
Did you shut the door?
&gt;she shakes her head very carefully. 
No.
&gt;You point to the couch, facing away from the hallway. 
Sit down, if you want to talk.
&gt;you keep your eyes on her as she moves over to the couch, allowing you to move in to the hallway walking backwards while keeping out of reach. 
&gt;as you reach the door, she sits down on the couch, hands out of sight. 
&gt;Her posture is straight as a rod, looking in your direction. 
&gt;the door shuts with a click. 
I guess i got lucky that night, eh?
&gt;She seems to be trying to break the ice. 
&gt;You walk back in to the living room
What do you mean?
I mean, wouldn&#039;t you have shot me?
&gt;You think about it. Yeah. Absolutely. 
&gt;Given the choice, just straight up shooting her to save you all the trouble would have been better. 
I guess.
&gt;You continue moving, carefully staying out of reach until you can sit down at one end of the other couch in your living room.
&gt;she gestures to the rifle you&#039;re still pointing in front of her feet. 
Could you put that away?
&gt;Yeah, no. 
Absolutely not.
&gt;She raises an eyebrow
You know, lots of people die to their own guns.
&gt;You click the safety off. 
Is that a threat?
&gt;she starts to respond, but your phone ringing cuts her off as you answer immediately. 
&gt;keeping your eyes on her, you pulled it out of your pants and saw out of the corner of your eyes that it was jenna. 
Hey.
&gt;you don&#039;t even wait for jenna to answer and cut her off midsentence
She&#039;s here.
&gt;jenna takes a second to understand what you&#039;re saying. 
She? who- WHAT?! WHERE?
&gt;Well, here. duh. 
Here. My place.
&gt;You should have seen the explosion that followed coming, but the intensity still surprised you. 
YOU LET HER IN? WHAT IN THE FUCK?
&gt;that was uncalled for. you&#039;ve got the situation somewhat under control. For now. You have all the guns. 
I have her at gunpoint.
&gt;You look at the woman in front of you. For a rapist, she makes a surprisingly sympathetic face as Jenna exploded on the phone. 
I&#039;m coming over. DON&#039;T. MOVE.
&gt;you put the phone down beside you as Jenna hung up the phone without even saying goodbye. 
&gt;you put the phone down next to you, gripping the handguard of your rifle again.
&gt;You sit in silence a few seconds until she seems to have become seriously uncomfortable with it. 
Does she always scream at you like that?
&gt;As you look your former assailant in the eye, you instantly deflect. 
No.
&gt;then something occurs to you. 
How do you know where I live?
&gt;She shrugs apologetically. 
We live in the same building...
&gt;Wait, she was stalking you?
... I saw you coming home yesterday.
&gt;well, that doesn&#039;t mean she isn&#039;t a stalker. 
Are you stalking me as well?
&gt;she looks you directly in the eyes. 
No.
&gt;she still seems uncomfortable with the subject. 
&gt;Wait, she lives in the same building? Above or below? How the fuck are you supposed to get out of the building from now on?
&gt;what if you stand in an elevator and she comes in? 
&gt;Your CCL is still a few days off, you can&#039;t carry your CCP yet
&gt;You could just walk the stairs instead
&gt;but no one uses the stairs
&gt;And if she were to find out you were using the stairs, behind those heavy fire proof doors, no one would hear what goes on in there
&gt;She could literally just wait for you there.
&gt;Well, you could always... abseil form the balcony? Climb down the fire escape? 
What&#039;s your name?
&gt;Her question drags you out of your reverie. 
You... don&#039;t know my name?
&gt;she folds her hands, playing with her thumbs, giving the impression of needing to occupy her fingers somehow. 
No, I mean, I know your last name because of the plate at the door, but what&#039;s your first name? I mean, you&#039;re gonna be a dad one way or another and I&#039;d like to be able to give the kids your name, you know?
&gt;That&#039;s an awfully long explanation. Which you would have noticed, if it weren&#039;t for the fact that she just brought another issue back to the forefront of your mind:
&gt;You&#039;re gonna be a babydaddy. 
&gt;jeez,rick.morty
&gt;What&#039;s her name, anyway? 
I&#039;m anon. What&#039;s your name?
My name is Megan. Megan Riley. Nice to meet you...
&gt;She extends her hand over the coffee table, but you just raise your eyebrow, stalling her efforts to cheer up the mood immediatly with no chance for recovery. 
Uh. Yeah. So, have you talked to anyone about anything and ...what&#039;s with the guns?
&gt;Her hand falls back in to her lap and she seems a tad nervous. 
&gt;You figure you can let her suffer a little. 
Yeah, i&#039;ve talked to a detective.
&gt;she starts fiddling with her hands again, then furrows her eyebrows and leans back in to the couch. 
Bu-u-u-ut they didn&#039;t actually care. I mean, I&#039;m sitting here, free.
&gt;It doesn&#039;t feel like you should stop pressing the advantage here. 
Until now, I didn&#039;t know where you lived, nor your name.
&gt;She&#039;s still leaning back in to the couch, but her eyes open as if she realized she had just dun goofed.
&gt;Then they narrow again as she comes to another conclusion. 
But you aren&#039;t even calling the police about me being here. You know, to get me arrested.
&gt;Fuck. That didn&#039;t last long. 
&gt;you fumble some answer about pregnancy, but she doesn&#039;t even believe you for a second, hell, in retrospect, you wouldn&#039;t have either. 
So did they not believe you or did they just not care?
&gt;You feel like an offensive player on a defense play. Absolutely not comfortable and wanting to be anywhere but here. 
What does it matter to you?
&gt;She attempts to push herself out of the couch. 
So if i were to do it again...
&gt;Your raise your rifle at lightning speed, clicking off the safety, pointing it directly between her eyes. 
You&#039;d die.
&gt;You feel like a fucking action star as she freezes mid motion, absolutely still, eyes widening. The rifle slid in to your should like it was made to be there, pointing unwavering, solid like a rock staright in to her face. 
&gt;She swallows.
&gt;apparently it came across as sincere as it was meant. 
That&#039;s what the guns are for, by the way. Sit back down, please.
&gt;With that, you feel secure again. You have control over this situation. Your mancard was resissued, remember? What the fuck do you need cops for right now? 
&gt;This actually feels really fucking good. You should have listened to your crazy guntoting uncle with those machine guns much earlier. The weirdo with the &quot;kommando&quot; patch. Can&#039;t even write properly, but he is a good guy. 
&gt;Now then, as the host of this meeting, you feel your hospitality lacking. Something somewhere deep within you tells you that this is overdoing it, but you&#039;ve got the upper hand back and you don&#039;t feel like giving it back. 
I could do with a cup of tea. How about you.
&gt;She nods as she slowly sinks back in to the couch. 
That would be nice.
&gt;You lower your rifle and click it back to safe. 
Kitchen is over there, tea is in the left upper cupboard, mugs are in the one next to that one. 
&gt;Megan gets up, gingerly, taking the long way around the couch to stay as far away from you as possible as you watch her with hawk eyes until she get sot the kitchenette. 
&gt;she opens the cupoards, sets water to heat up and takes two mugs out of the cupboard. 
&gt;You remember that Jenna is about to show up and think that it would probably be a good idea to have another cup ready. 
Make that three, one for Jenna.
&gt;She takes another one out of the cupboard. 
Jenna - is that the girl you were with?
&gt;You fold your legs in front of you, sitting in the lotus position on the couch, still rifle butt in the shoulder, pointing it at the floor. 
Girlfriend.
&gt;She turns around, leaning against the work surfaces behind her, arms on the edge. 
How long have you two been an item?
&gt;What is it with this probing?
Why do you care?
&gt;She leans back in to the counter a little more and folds her arms under her decidedly not exactly small bosom. Arms of taught steel wire, as big as Pop Eye&#039;s. Somewhat similar proprtions too, her lower arms definitely seem a lot bigger from where you&#039;re sitting. Her wrists are the size of your biceps. Natural panther and the obvious fitness training that her clearly visible abs with their defined six muscle bundles and lack of any gut whatsoever clearly show below the hemline of her spaghetti halter top. 
&gt;No wonder you had no chance whatsoever against her, even the two of you. That woman could probably lift both you and your gf with one arm repeatedly. 
&gt;Her current stance seems to be a reflection of your hostility, not a show of force. 
Just curious, is all. If you don&#039;t want to alk about it, that&#039;s alright.

&gt;the water boils for a bit as you both mind your own business. You check the time on your phone, guesstimating it will take a few more minutes for Jenna to arrive while Megan unfurls her arms again and stares absentmindedly at the kettle or out the window, before she tries to strike up a conversation again. 
Did you always have guns?
&gt;You look up from your phone. 
No. Got them recently.
&gt;That answer doesn&#039;t seem to be what she wanted to hear. 
Oh.
&gt;the water continues to boil, until she tries again. 
That&#039;s a pretty big computer set up. Do you play games a lot?
&gt;Seriously? While being in control here has considerably lengthened your fuse, that still seems like a weird as question. 
&gt;but before you can tell her to shut up and get to the point of why she is here, she continues
I&#039;m sorry, that must have sounded really dumb. I play a lot and I was just wondering what you have in your rig.
&gt;Bullshit. She looks like she spends exactly 20 minutes a day with computers - 5 for photos and 15 getting them placed on instagram with captions like &quot;Working those glutes biceps-curl-emoji x3&quot;. 
&gt;no, maybe she is scoping out your place, to add insult to injury? 
&gt;she can&#039;t be that retarded. 
&gt;She tentatively tries to smile at you. 
&gt;It&#039;s not very effective
&gt;but it makes you take stock of the entire situation and you can&#039;t help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation. 
You, i mean YOU, are standing here, in my kitchen, and you&#039;re seriously asking me about what videogames I play after blackmailing your way in?
&gt;She averts her eyes and looks at the floor for a second, then back at you. 
When you put it like that, it sounds pretty bad.
&gt;she stops, then starts again, a little more spirited this time. 
I just feel really uncomfortable in the silence.
&gt;You snort in disbelief. 
You feel uncomfortable.
&gt;then you have to chuckle. 
You think you&#039;re the one who is entitled to feel uncomfortable here.
&gt;She searches for a place to hide on the floor with her eyes. 
Just, new place, new people and all that, awkward silence and so on
&gt;she mumbles, looking anywhere but in your direction.
&gt;the kettle announces it&#039;s done. 
&gt;Megan picks up the kettle, pours three of the cups full of water and puts a teabag in each. 
What tea did you pick?
&gt;She reaches up and checks the box. 
Roo-ib-os?
&gt;Rooibos was the only tea mom would never sweeten, instead, she always added milk. You&#039;ve had it often enough where it doesn&#039;t instantly give you a flashback of sitting at the dinner table at home with a glass of tea in front of you, but it isn&#039;t difficult to conjure up a false memory of a generic evening of dinner with your family when you were about ten. 
Pour some milk in mine. Fridge is to your right. Oh, and in Jenna&#039;s too.
&gt;Megan opens the fridge and pulls a jug of milk out after a short search, then drips a little in to your mug, same for jenna&#039;s, then turns to you, jug at the ready. 
Mind if I take some too?
&gt; Why would you mind? 
Go ahead.
&gt;She pours milk in to her mug as well, which results in all mugs being full nearly to the brim. 
&gt;Megan returns the milk to the fridge and takes both of your mugs and carefully balances the liquid inside of them as she carries them over. 
&gt;she sets down both of them on her side of the couch table, then pushes yours across carefully as you tense up. 
I&#039;m gonna go get another mug for the tea bags once they are done.
&gt;She gets back up, fetches another mug and comes back. 
&gt;You watch her look curious at the tea, but then she leans back in to the couch. 
How long until it&#039;s done?
&gt;Technically speaking, Rooibos isn&#039;t a tea and doesn&#039;t have a due time. 
About 6 minutes.
&gt;There are, however, diminishing returns. 
&gt;She nods, then takes a deep breath. 
I... Well. I tested positive. It&#039;s only been a couple of days but these tests don&#039;t really go wrong that often.
&gt;it seems that she is finally getting to it, then. 
I wasn&#039;t really expecting this. I mean, sure, season and everything, but one go? Without preparing? I... What are the odds, you know?
&gt;Preparation? 
Do Chimera&#039;s need preparation to get pregnant? 
&gt;she cringes.
Please don&#039;t call us that. You wouldn&#039;t call a black guy a nigger, would you? Just call us anthros.
&gt;You shrug. 
So do anthro need to prepare?
&gt;She doesn&#039;t seem too willing to talk about it. 
Some, like me.
&gt;You motion with your hand to keep going. 
Want to explain why what happened is so unlikely?
&gt;she sighs. 
I have... I don&#039;t get periods. No ovaries either. My kind... we have to scratch ourselves for a chance to get pregnant. Internally. Hard. It&#039;s not very comfortable.
&gt;You furrow your eyebrows. 
Then how did I get you pregnant?
&gt;She shrugs. 
I don&#039;t know. I&#039;ve never heard of it happening before.
&gt;That still doesn&#039;t explain why she&#039;s here. 
Where are you going with this?
&gt;She swallows. 
I...
&gt;but before she can go on, the doorbell rings and this time, you unfold your legs and get up. 
You circle around her, rifle now much more at ease after Megan has proven that while she is clearly not always normal as far as social rules and norms are concerned, she doesn&#039;t appear to be a crazed rape fiend.
&gt;You still check to see where she is and meet her gaze as she turns on the couch, followign you with her eyes as far as she can without getting up. 
&gt;Then you answer the intercom. 
Yeah?
&gt;Jenna&#039;s voice. 
Guess who.
&gt;You push the door opener and the appratus buzzes, and after you&#039;ve heard the door click open through the intercom, you hang up the phone, then crack the door to the appartment open. 
&gt;You turn around, but wait by the door. 
&gt;It doesn&#039;t take jenna too long to reach your floor, she must have gotten lucky with the elevators, but before she gets to the door, Megan drops her last bombshell. 
I want to keep them.
&gt;You take a moment to digest that statement and her sincerity makes you not even for a second consider that this is some kind of joke. You hadn&#039;t taken the alimony thing fully serious, but that sounded different. 
&gt;But before you can muster up an answer, the door opens and a ball of rage practically flies in to your flat.
&gt;Jenna blows right past you. 
WHERE IS SHE?
&gt;She doesn&#039;t walk in to the living room, she pushes through your hallway like a military formation. 
YOU.
&gt;you shut the door behind her, then follow as Jenna unleashes her emotions. 
HOW DARE YOU EVEN COME HERE.
&gt;As Megan turns to check what you&#039;re doing, Jenna takes the few remaining steps and slaps her across the face. 
I AM TALKING TO YOU, BITCH.
&gt;Megans head flings around, then Jenna turns to you. 
Why are you just standing there? Where are the cops? Hmm?! She&#039;s sitting right here?
&gt;You have dealt with this before. If things don&#039;t go the way Jenna wants them to, this happens. 
&gt;Her head shifts from you to Megan a couple of times, then she freezes and her expression shifts to an &quot;I can&#039;t believe what the fuck i&#039;m seeing&quot;. 
Anon...
&gt;Oh no. 
&gt;She points at the tea mugs on your couch table. 
What the fuck are those?
&gt;she turns to you again. 
Is that godfucking damn tea? Did you really make her a FUCKING CUP OF TEA?
&gt;This is probably a bad time to mention that her mug is still in the kitchen. 
Change of situation.
&gt;Jenna stems her arms in to her sides. 
And what the fuck could change the situation so much, that she deserves even the slightest bit of hospitality?
&gt;Before you can answer, Megan interrupts. 
I&#039;m pregnant. And I&#039;m keeping them.
&gt;She holds the pregnacy test out for Jenna to see, who slaps it out of her hand. 
&gt;You notice that Megan, who seemed fairly relaxed around you if not afraid of the guns you were carrying, definitely seems angry now. 
I can get on of those for five bucks on ebay.
&gt;She turns to you. 
You weren&#039;t seriously retarded enough to believe her, were you?
&gt;You shrug, but as Jenna is about to snarl something in your direction, Megan takes the intiative. 
It&#039;s not like I can&#039;t make more of these.
&gt;Jenna turns her head around. 
Bitch, I don&#039;t give a fucking shit. You&#039;re gonna abort them, you&#039;re not doing this to me.
&gt;Doing this to her? 
Anon, she confessed to us. Call 911. 
&gt;you dial 911 and start talking to the operator while watching jenna and megan. 
&gt;Megan stands up, her arms folded. 
I confessed nothing.
&gt;Jenna turns around. 
Yeah, you fucking did. You said you were pregnant, from him.
&gt;Jenna points at you, but Megan still isn&#039;t having it. She waves a hand through the air, as if this is some minor detail that doesn&#039;t really matter. 
Yeah, we fucked downtown in a club on the toilet. But I&#039;m actually here because Anon bumped in to my car.
&gt;That&#039;s... really... what?
&gt;Before you can ask her what she means by this, Megan explains
I saw him the other day from my balcony, scraping my bumper. Very lightly, but you know. So I asked the landlord where Anon lives so we could settle this amicably and that&#039;s why I&#039;m here.
&gt;Jenna fumes. If this was a cartoon, her head would be the size of a weatherbaloon and steam would be billowing out of her ears. 
&gt;You tell the operator that it would be nice if they could hurry up, the situation here seems to be escalating. 
&gt;In that classic 911 dispatcher voice, she asks who and why and you tell her that your gf is here too. 
&gt;The dispatcher answers friendly and tells you to stay on the phone. 
&gt;You reach out and try to deescalate by squeezing Jenna&#039;s shoulder, but she just brushes you off and practically lunges at Megan. 
&gt;Jenna attacks the taller and stronger woman like a banshee, screaming bitch over and over again. 
&gt;You put the phone on the kitchen counter top and drop your rifle as you follow to try and keep her off Meggan, but Jenna is going full ham. 
&gt;Punching, slapping, biting, pulling Megan&#039;s hair when she gets the chance to, she doesn&#039;t pull any punches whatsoever. 
&gt;while megan was seemingly fine with fending off a few slaps, Jenna&#039;s teeth in her arm are something she seems to be unwilling to ignore. 
&gt;Megan does her best to throw Jenna away from her, but Jenna is surprisinly clingy and amid increasing growls of pain everytime jenna chomps down somewhere new
&gt;you try to seperate the two of them. Your rifle is somwhere behind you on the floor as you start to pull Jenna away from Megan, which nets you a couple of new bruises as elbows or knees intended for the other land on you. 
&gt;You manage to pull Jenna away from Megan by inserting yourself between the two and pushing their chest away from each other. 
STOP!
&gt;Both women actually stop fighting each other, but Megan immediatly pours oil in to the fire. 
She started it.
&gt;And Jenna immediatly goes for the bait. 
I started it?! Look at you, you whore!
&gt;Megan opens her mouth and you get a glimpse of those long, long incosprs in a face that isn&#039;t being civil at all right now but looks very willing to prove that those teeth aren&#039;t for show. 
Big words from an ugly flat lanky bitch.
&gt;Jenna loses coherence again and after fumbling for a reply tries to duck under and around your palm, reaching for Megan, but you let go of megan and focus on keeping Jenna from digging her own grave. 
&gt;Only that Jenna doesn&#039;t seem to see it that way. 
&gt;after a few quick tries to get around you, her anger shifts focus. 
Stop getting in my fucking way!
&gt;You try and calm her down. 
I&#039;m not letting you get yourself killed or jailed.
&gt;Jenna continues struggling against you after looking past you for a second. 
COME HERE; YOU SLUT!
&gt;Megan behind you seems to be perfectly willing to take her up on round two. 
Make me, bitch.
&gt;Jenna gives you a mighty push as you&#039;re trying to get Megan to deescalate - catching you unaware. Your balacning step comes naturally as a reflex - but your leg is stopped halfway by the coffe table. 
&gt;Uh oh...
&gt;Your brain immediatly knows that you had to take that evasive step. ANd that this isn&#039;t enough. It does this, while you&#039;r consciousness is still not entirely sure what is happening, but gravtiy relentlessly pulls you toward that coffetable, facing backwards. 
&gt;If you had bought tempered glass - you&#039;d have fallen on to it and that would have been it. 
&gt;But no.
&gt;This wasn&#039;t a glass table you had bought. 
&gt;This had been a gift. 
&gt;Sadly, the giver hadn&#039;t known too muvh about durability of glass, and the result is you falling on to the table, the glass shattering under the impact and you falling through the glass. 
&gt;While Jenna goes for another attack, catching unaware Megan off balance. 
&gt;You in turn hit your head on the metal frame of the table, and while you land on your back amid the shower of glass, dull throbbing pain explodes in the back of your head. 
&gt;it did make a nice and audible thwack noise. 
&gt;you her a loud growl which is muffled by the pain, because holy shit, your head hurts like a motherfucker already. 
instinctively, your hands reach for the spot you hit your head on on the way down, pulling your shoulders through a field of broken glass bits and still warm tea.
&gt;Pinpricks and more pain all over your arms and shoulders, your hear something else hitting something quite hard. 
You open your eyes to see two fuzzy panther faces framed by long hair hovering not quite above you, looking concerned.
You okay?
&gt;Your head feels like it&#039;s about to split open
naawrgh...
&gt;A high pitched sound of rage comes from outside your vision from the direction of the panthers&#039; heads, sounding like jenna&#039;s voice. 
&gt;The two Megans move with a speed and elegance that belies their bulk. 
&gt;They grab hold of two Jennas and pull them up, then smack them back down on top of a couch, pinning them with their body weight. Then they open their mouthes right in front of her and fixate her head so she has to look at the open maw. 
&gt;You feel the need to do something. 
&gt;The Megans growl at the Jennas. 
STOP, or I&#039;ll -
&gt;You push yourself up with your elbows, distantly registering more cutting and pricking sensations to them. 
&gt;The Jenna&#039;s struggle and get another knee in as the Megans turn and look at you with an expression you can&#039;t make out.
&gt;The Megans cringe for a second, allowing the Jennas to land another punch.
&gt;as a wave of pain and sickness hits you, you clothe your eyes so you won&#039;t have to puke and hear a dull thud. 
&gt;The struggling sounds end and a moment later, a furry hand pulls you out of the remains of your couch table. 
&gt;Your open your eyes and two fuzzy megans become one. She looks very concerned for someone who was willing to drag you into an alley and pin you against a wall. 
Are you okay?
&gt;No, definitely not. You feel really, really sick. 
&gt;But what happened to Jenna? 
How&#039;s Jenna?
&gt;Your mouth isn&#039;t really doing what it should be doing and Megan&#039;s concern is growing. 
She&#039;s okay, you&#039;re not.
&gt;As if on cue, Jenna starts to moan behind you, just as one Megan becomes two. 
&gt;You close your eyes again, fighting against the need to throw up as it becomes overbearing. 
&gt;You try to sit down, and Megan makes you move a few steps and then gingerly lowers you down until you&#039;re sitting on the floor, back against a couch. 
&gt;You throw up in your mouth as you hear Jenna behind you get up. 
&gt;You swallow the acidic concotion in your mouth back down and open your eyes as you feel something touching the back of your head. 
&gt;Two megans look past you. 
You&#039;re bleeding.
&gt;Broken glass rustles as Jenna walks through it and the Megans look in her direction, but before something stupid can happen, the doorbell rings. 
&gt;The other two freeze, but you can&#039;t hold it back anymore and puke your guts out. 
&gt;The pain in your head is insane. 
&gt;glass gets crushed again, then quick unsteady taps across the floor and you open your eyes two see two, no, one Megan looking down her puke soaked shirt, then reaching out to gently steady your head.
&gt;Your hearing is fine, but it&#039;s hard to concentrate as another wave of nausea hits you and you heave again. 
Thank god you&#039;ve arrived.
&gt;Megan&#039;s hand leaves your side shortly thereafter as she gets up to face the new arrivals. 
That&#039;s her. You need to arrest her.
&gt;Another, unfamiliar male voice cuts in, talking to Megan amd Jenna in the back.
&gt;as they get down to talking, a female voice talks to you. 
Sir, I&#039;m calling an ambulance for you, alright?
&gt;You nod. 
Good.
&gt;the voice turns away, and you open your eyes two see a black LocalPD uniform
Car 243 to base, over?
&gt;Her eyes dart from her radio to you while she waits for reply. 
Car 243, go ahead.
&gt;Her eyes flick back in the general direction of her radio. 
This is Car243, I need an Ambulance at West Sourdough 2444, male with a bleeding headwound and multiple cuts, over?
&gt;base takes another second during which you dry heave again. 
&gt;the officer quickly scoots out of the way, but you manage to force it back down. 
Car 243, ambulance dispatched, over.
&gt;the officer leaves the microphone on her shoulder and focuses on you. 
Sir, can you talk?
&gt;You nod, forcing down the last bit of bile. 
I&#039;m Officer Norton, my colleague over there is Officer Barbrady.
&gt;really. 
Can you tell me your name?
&gt;You try, but just at that moment, another mouthful comes up your esophagus. 
&gt;it is followed by a little more and you have to spill. 
&gt;You throw your head to the side and let it all out. 
&gt;Officer Norton makes a concerned face and you close your eyes, then lean your head back. 
Anon.
&gt;Norton seems to scribble that down and during that brief silence, you her something about rapist from the others. 
&gt;Then Norton demands your full concentration again. 
Alright, and how old are you?
&gt;you tell her, she scribbles, another tidbit from the others. Glass table. 
Is this your place of residence?
Yes.
&gt;This time, she is too quick to note it down for you to hear what the others are talking about. 
Can you tell me what happened?
&gt;You heave again, then start. 
I was at home. Then Megan showed up.
&gt;Norton interrupts you. 
The anthro?
&gt;You shut your eyes again. Its much easier to keep the sickness at bay like this. 
Yeah. Then my girlfriend showed up. They got in a fight.
&gt;You swallow, but the disgusting taste in your mouth won&#039;t leave. 
I tried to stop them. 
But then I fell through my couch table.
&gt;Norton scribbles a bit and the pulsating pain in your head warbles what you can hear from the conversation the others are having. You can make out that it&#039;s fairly heated. 
Alright. Tell me, whose rifle is that on the floor?
&gt;you open your eyes to look at officer norton. Is that gun going to be trouble? 
Mine. Why?
&gt;Nausea and pain flare back up, this wasn&#039;t the best of ideas. 
Are there any other firearms here?
&gt;Well, there is the rifle and... 
In my pants.
&gt;The scribbling stops. 
Okay. Would you mind if I secured that?
&gt;Anything, if she makes the pain go away. 
No.
I&#039;m going to have to touch you.
&gt;Anything. 
Yeah.
&gt;your shirt gets lifted and Norton unholsters your firearm, then a few mechanical noises are heard and she puts the gun in to a plastic bag, by the sound of it. 
You can get it back at our station as soon as you&#039;re better, alright?
&gt;Better, yes please. 
Okay.
&gt;Norton softly touches your leg. 
Tell me if you&#039;re feeling worse, alright?
&gt;You muble approval, then the conversation between the others can be heard, but the officer is being so quiet its hard to hear what he&#039;s saying. Only Jenna is clear and easy to hear, as she still hasn&#039;t really quietened down. 
But She&#039;s-
&gt;the quiet voice of the officer cuts her off and continues. 
No, this is bullshit. She&#039;s-
&gt;another interruption by the officer. 
No, fuck that, you need to arrest her.
&gt;the officer asks a question. 
I already told you. She raped him.
&gt;This time, Norton interrupts. 
Ma&#039;am, my colleague has already explained why this doesn&#039;t work.
&gt;Barbrady falls in, quietly talking to Jenna again, but your head tunes out until the noise level picks up again. 
&gt;Norton taps you slightly. 
Are you still with me?
Yeah.
&gt;She seems to shift elsewhere. 
Okay, I&#039;m going to have to go over there, make some noise if you&#039;re feeling funky, alright?
&gt;She gets up, then calls out to Megan. 
Miss? Could you come over here, please? 
&gt;A common misconception about cats is that they move quietly everywhere. Truth is, they don&#039;t - they actually have fairly heavy foortfalls for their weight on solid surfaces. Megan was no exception here. 
Hi. I&#039;m Officer Norton. Got any ID on you?
&gt;Megan&#039;s voice is calm, unlike Jenna&#039;s was earlier. 
No. I live here, though, two floors up. My name is Megan Riley.
&gt;Scribbling again, then a stop. 
Alright. And what exactly happened here?
&gt;Megan starts off with a direct accuation. 
Well, I only had to knock her out because she had pushed him in to his couch table.
&gt;Norton stops her with a bit more of an edge in her tone. 
Look. From beginning to end.
&gt;Megan takes a deep breath, then begins. 
Well, me and him, had, you know, a bit of a thing. Once. Nothing major. But she caught us and I wanted to talk to him about it. Well, she barges in, tells him to call the police for some reason and then attacks me. I defend myself and then he tries to get her off me, but she just pushes him in to this glass table and charges me. I had to knock her out so I could render first aid and before I got to that, you arrived.
&gt;Norton scribbles for a bit, then stops. Apparently, Megan decided to ignore her cover story she&#039;d given the two of you earlier. 
Where is the blood on your fingers from?
The back of his head. He&#039;s bleeding there. How&#039;s he doing right now?
&gt;Norton sounds like she is concentrating on her scribbling. 
You can ask him yourself.
&gt;You hear Megan moving a bit closer to you, then she tocuhes your arm very gently. 
Hey. You still okay?
&gt;No. 
Nauseus.
&gt;Sympathy and warmth is practically dripping from her voice. 
That su-
&gt;Jenna&#039;s voice interrupts her. 
HEY! WHAT THE FUCK IS SHE DOING?
&gt;Norton immediately fires back. 
Ma&#039;am! Please stay where you are!
&gt;Clearly, Jenna ignores this, as Norton has to repeat it again, a lot more steel in her voice. 
&gt;Meanwhile, Jenna keeps talking. 
I TOLD YOU PEOPLE TO GET HER AWAY FROM HIM.
MA&#039;AM, STOP! 
&gt;Megan lets go of you and you hear plasticky noises. 
MA&#039;AM, STOP RIGHT NOW!
&gt;Jenna continues to ignore this and comes yet closer. 
&gt;FUCK YOU CHIM - 
&gt;There is a weird bang sound. Not like a gun, more like a cracker, and then clackering, followed by a heavy thud. 
&gt;Barbrady immediatly goes for the radio, loud and clear this time. 
Car 243, taser taser taser.
&gt;Then they both move and you hear handcuffs being ratcheted shut. 
woah.
&gt;Megan exclaims quietly. 
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
&gt;Norton seems to have a weird sense of humor.
&gt;Barbrady reads Jenna her rights, then shuffles around. 
That was a good shot, Judy.
&gt;Norton accepts the praise happily. 
Thanks. Want me to bring her down to the car?
&gt;Babrady sounds surprisingly relaxed for a cop that just went through a tense situation. 
Nah, I think the taser will have calmed her enough so that we can have her sit here for a little while longer.
&gt;He turns to Megan. 
Miss, I think it would be a good idea if you could accompany us down to the station too.
&gt;Megan sounds slightly more shaky than earlier. 
Sure.
&gt;Megan&#039;s hand returns to your arm, but Norton almost immediatly stops her. 
Miss, If you could, please stay away from Anon for a bit. I don&#039;t want to taze her again.
&gt;Her hand vanishes from your arm once more and she steps away from you. 
Okay.
&gt;At that moment, there is a knock at the door and two more voices enter the room. 
Hi, we&#039;re here for a couple of nasty cuts?
&gt;Barbrady answers them and you can hear the sound of heavy synthetic fabric rubbing against itself as they come in. 
Hi guys. That&#039;s your guy over there. Fell through the glass couch table, hurt his head pretty bad.
&gt;As Barbrady finsihes, Norton picks up where he left. 
Bleeding at the back of the head, puked at least twice.
&gt;The EMT&#039;s remain jovial. 
Oh boy, you got really unlucky, didn&#039;t you. Alright, we&#039;ve got him from here.
&gt;One of them sits down next to you. 
Hello there, son. How are you doing?
&gt;Awesome. 
Shitty. 
Do you think he&#039;s gonna be okay?
&gt;Another male voice you haven&#039;t heard before attempts to answer Megan, but gets cut off. 
&gt;Jenna apparently still has some fight in her, even after she got knocked out and tazed. 
Why do you care?
&gt;Barbrady immediately intervenes and multiple voices babble in the background as the EMT asks you to open your eyes. 
&gt;You comply, and he immediately holds two of his left hands out with a few fingers on them. 
How many fingers?
&gt;maybe... 5? 
Tweleven.
&gt;The other EMT behind him chuckles. 
Okay, for real now.
I can&#039;t tell.
&gt;The first EMT pulls out a black tube the size of a pen. 
I&#039;m gonna ask you a few questions while my colleague here will shine alight in to your eyes.
&gt;In the background, multiple pens are scribbling, then Barbrady announces to Norton that he&#039;ll take Jenna down to their car. 
Shoot.
&gt;The tech shines a light in to one of your eyes, then takes it away, looking straight at it, but not really looking in to your eyes. 
&gt;You feel yourself relaxing, despite copious amounts of pain. 
What&#039;s your name?
&gt;That&#039;s easy. 
Anon.
&gt;The guy nods, then his colleague examines the other eye and you feel your nausea rising again. 
And what day is it?
&gt;It&#039;s... 
&gt;Wait. What day is it? 
Uh. Monday?
&gt;Megan interrupts you conversation from the background. 
Is that bad?
&gt;The second EMT puts the tube light away, then gives his colleague some medical mumbo jumbo before he adresses Megan. 
Just relax, madam, we do our best when we can concentrate on our work. He&#039;ll be fine, just stick with the officer over there, alright?
&gt;It is monday, isn&#039;t it? 
Alright, now my colleague is going to measure your blood pressure and that little clip on your finger will measure you r blood oxygen, okay?
&gt;The guy has a voice that is so buttery and smooth and reassuring that it feels like you&#039;re back at your mom&#039;s house after you got roadrash from falling off your bicycle. 
&gt;The clip on your finger feels cool.
&gt;The loud sound of the blood pressure monitor ripped open as the velcro comes apart drives another spike of nausea in to you. 
&gt;You close your eyes. 
Hey, bud, eyes open, look at me.
&gt;You really don&#039;t want to puke all over these guys. 
Can&#039;t.
What&#039;s wrong?
&gt;You&#039;d like to avoid painting their gear a new color. 
I&#039;ll puke.
&gt;The EMT loses it&#039;s mom quality and sounds more like a dad now. 
That&#039;s okay, just keep looking at us. Count my fingers.
&gt;as you open your eyes you heave again, but there doesn&#039;t seem to be a whole lot left down there. 
That&#039;s okay, Harry, go get the stretcher.
&gt;Officer Norton interrupts him. 
Need help?
&gt;He looks at her
Yeah, help Harry get the stretcher up here.
&gt;Then he looks at you. 
Come on bud, fingers.
&gt;You try to count them, and they phase in to one hand. 
Three.
&gt;then they phase out again. 
No, five.
&gt;It doesn&#039;t take very long for Harry and Norton to return with the stretcher, and they carefully load you on to it, pulling glass out of you as they go after fitting a weird plastic stretcher around your neck, immobilising your head. 
&gt;Every movement makes your head feel worse. 
It&#039;ll be alright once we get to the hospital, okay? Hang in there.
&gt;You feel a furry hand touch your arm as two concerned Megan faces briefly show up in your vision, but then both disappear as the stretcher moves out of your flat. 

&gt;THe ride to the hospital is absolutely the worst thing you have ever gone through in your life. 
&gt;You&#039;ve seen videos of Trophy Trucks and you&#039;re sure that the ambulance is following a part of the Baja 1000. 
&gt;You&#039;re... 
&gt;You&#039;re feeling strangely.. sleepy. 
Hey, bud, you&#039;re still with us?
Yeah...
&gt;The EMT gives your arm a few gentle prods. 
Bud? Count to ten, alright?
&gt;Suuure. 
One, Two... Three... ... 


&gt;white. 
&gt;coarse fabric all over you. 
&gt;a feeling of being encased. 
&gt;You close your eyes again. It&#039;s really bright here. 
&gt;Well, maybe you should see where you are. 
&gt;You squint and see ceiling tiles. 
&gt;It&#039;s also a bit warmer than you&#039;d like it to be. 
&gt;Except your head, your head is wet and luke warm. 
&gt;You try and move your head but can&#039;t. 
&gt;So almost automatically, you reach for your head. 
&gt;You feel something wet and cool on it, grab it and hold it up for you to see - it&#039;s a soggy icepack. 
&gt;You drop it somewhere aside and hear it drop to the ground with a loud thwack. 
&gt; Then you feel the pressure on your jaw and your brain finishes booting.
&gt;Why do you feel encased? 
&gt;A quick look at an arm stretched above you and you see that your arm is wrapped in bandages, from shoulder to finger tips. 
&gt;Whats with not being able to move your head? 
&gt;You feel around for something on your neck and immediatly find a plastic thing that encases your neck. 
&gt;Could you take that off? 
&gt;Wait, where are you? 
&gt;You... You fell. right. 
&gt;Oh, EMTs - so this is probably a hospital. 
&gt;You search for latches on that thing on your neck but can&#039;t find any, when it occurs to you that maybe, just maybe, it&#039;s there for a good reason. 
Hello?
&gt;No one answers you. 
Hello?!
&gt;More silence. 
&gt;Are you just supposed to sit around and do noting until someone comes - no, hospital beds always have that call a nurse button. 
&gt;right, you feel around on the bed. 
&gt;Nada. 
&gt;Hmm. Maybe it&#039;s hanging off the side? 
&gt;Wait, there is a wire here and - oh. It was right on top of you. 
&gt;You press and wait. 
&gt;Nothing happens for a bit, then the door opens. 
I&#039;ll be right with you, just a moment!
&gt;It&#039;s actually a bit longer, but now the feeling of being in a dead room is dead as you can hear the hustle and bustle of a hospital station outside. 
&gt;eh, they must be busy then. 
&gt;It doesn&#039;t take too long until a nurse shows her face.
&gt;She&#039;s human and judging by how close she is to your face, she&#039;s 5&#039; none and her long braid makes her look like a disney princess. 
&gt;Righ tafter that, a blond male shows his face, looking a little more clinically at you. 
Hi, my name Is Dr. Dubian and this is nurse Sharon. Good to see you&#039;ve woken up. How are you feeling?
&gt;Uh. actually, pretty good, albeit you feel like you haven&#039;t moved in a while. And itchy. Oh god, itchy as fuck, all over your body. 
Itchy. All over.
&gt;The doc nods. 
You were pretty cut up. We&#039;ll see about getting something done about that after dinner.
&gt;He looks at his wristwatch, then stares off in to space as sharon waits for input from him, clearly far more happy to rest her eyes on him than on you. 
Sharon, if you could, change Mr. Anon&#039;s bandages, I&#039;m thinking Betaisodona? Mr. Anon, I&#039;ll get back to you after you&#039;ve had dinner, if you feel alright with eating.
&gt;He leaves, so you look at sharon instead. 
Can I take this off?
&gt; You motion to the thing keeping yoyur neck encased. 
&gt;Sharon, who had started to unwrap your arms, stops. 
I&#039;ll be right back.
&gt;She vanishes again from sight and your headache returns, albeit a fairly normal one, not the blinding nausea kind. 
&gt;Moments later, Sharon returns, smiling. 
Doc gives his okay.
&gt;You return her smile. 
Great.
&gt;She leans over you and rips open some velcro. 
&gt;It&#039;s loud, but you&#039;re not really getting a spike of pain that lances through your skull. 
Okay, now lift your head off the pillow for me.
&gt;As you do, she unwraps something around your neck. As she pulls it away, you turn your neck and see a large yellow polycarbonate .. cast, for lack of a better word. 
&gt;She puts it aside, then starts unwrapping your bandages again, quickly moving down your arms. 
So for dinner, I&#039;m afraid you&#039;ll have to be okay with some bread, cheese and jell-o. We couldn&#039;t exactly ask you for what you&#039;d like, you know?
&gt;Bread is fine with you, as is cheese. 
That&#039;s alright.
&gt;She nods, then keeps going
Would you like some soda with that or tea?
&gt;Tea. Tea sounds absolutely excellent right now. 
Definitely tea, please.
&gt;She nods again, having unwrapped both of your arms.
&gt;Your bed begins to move as she gets your upper body moved upright. 
Alright, lean a bit forward, would you, i need to get this off of your back.
&gt;Unlike your arms, your torso isn&#039;t bandaged up, it has a huge piece of dressing taped to your back. 
&gt;Sharon quickly rips it off, then starts applying a cool brown ointment to your back.
&gt;She does the same to your arms, then applies new dressings wherever she slathered on ointment and wraps your arms in bandages again. 
Alright! I&#039;ll go and get you your dinner.
&gt;Now that you have had your body upright, circulation has begun and while the headache has inreased a bit, it still isn&#039;t terrible.
&gt;But, you&#039;re also a lot quicker in the head. 
Hey, how long was I under?
&gt;She opens a folder on a table next to your bed and looks through it. 
Uhhh... 3 days. But Dr. Dubian is your guy for questions like that, i&#039;ll go get him once you&#039;ve had dinner, alright?
&gt;You nod while your stomach audibly sings you the song of it&#039;s people. 
&gt;It doesn&#039;t take her long to come back at all, which isn&#039;t very surprising considering the dinner tray holds a few slices of stale untoasted bread and a small bowl of cloeslaw. 
All I can do at the moment. Don&#039;t expect it to get much better, though. Tea is on it&#039;s way, i&#039;ll get it to you when it&#039;s done.
&gt;She pulls a small dresser on wheels to your bed, then unfolds a table big enough to hold your tray. 
Thanks.
&gt;She smiles, then gestures to a small cup with pills in it. 
In case you have headaches.
&gt;You take the pills, throw them down, then dig in to the bread and cheese. 
Do you need anything else?
&gt;Well, yeah, can you get up? But then again, she said that the Doc is the guy to ask those questions, so you leave it be. Instead, you shake your head and give her a thumbs up as you wolf down the admittedly stale food.
&gt;By the time she comes back with a cup of tea, you&#039;re halfway done and between slices of bread, so you ask her for a glass or two of water, which she gets to you as you start with the coleslaw as a stand in for dessert. 
&gt;You ask for a refill, but she returns to you with a large bottle of water instead, placing it on your dresser and filling one of your glasses. 
&gt;After that it doesn&#039;t take much longer for Dr. Dubian to reappear. 
&gt;Now somewhat sated and slightly woozy from the meds, you watch as Sharon shuffles around in the room for a while, cleaning up somewhat, fetching another ice pack for your head after confirming with the doctor and taking her time to leave the two of you alone. 
&gt;In the meantime, you get all the boring things out of the way. What you&#039;re doing, how you&#039;re doing (okay), you&#039;re allowed to get out of bed, but take it careful, and so on and so forth. 
...So what you have is a skull dome fracture. No breach of skin, which is good, but not a simple clean fracture either, as part of your skull broke lose and got pushed in, here.
&gt;He shows you a section of your skull on an X-Ray. Without him pointing it out, you would have missed it. 
Compounded with that, your brain experienced significant trauma, which is why we kept you under for the last three days. Significant, and i mean significant swelling. But you should be okay for now, but we&#039;re gonna keep you here for a few more days so we can monitor how things develop, although I&#039;m optimistic that you&#039;ll recover without any permanent damage. Do keep an eye on those headaches though, some are prefectly normal, but if they get worse, tell us. Take it slow, no stress, no sports.
So now that you know what&#039;s going on with your head, why don&#039;t you tell me a bit about how this happened?
&gt;As he explained that you have a fracture at the back of your skull, you&#039;re suddenly worried about putting pressure on it. 
&gt;He seems to read your thoughts. 
Go on, lean back, it&#039;s been immobilized. 
&gt;You lean back and start to talk.
&gt;or at least you try to, but you stop as soon as you realize that everything is very fuzzy and ther are only some individual sounds and pictures available. 
&gt;It starts with.. what&#039;s her name again? 
&gt;the panther girl. 
uuhh...
&gt;Megan! 
&gt;Megan was at your place because... 
&gt;Alimony?
&gt;No, that can&#039;t be. 
&gt;But...
&gt;So she was at your place. She definitely was. 
&gt;You can see her in your kitchen, making tea. 
&gt;And then you can see her defending herself against Jenna. 
&gt;You have memory of a vague feeling of losing balance. 
&gt;And then there was police. 
&gt;And EMT&#039;s, as well as an ambulance ride. 
I.. think I fell. I must have fallen on something. I think... My girlfriend was there and someone else.
&gt;You don&#039;t feel particularly well with saying my rapist. 
And they were fighting? I think.
&gt;Dubian watches you closely. 
That&#039;s all I remember.
&gt;He nods. 
A bit of amnesia is normal in these cases. Those memories probably will not come back.
&gt;You swallow. Somehow the feeling of losing some of your lifetime, something that was probably important as Jenna attacked someone so much bigger than her, doesn&#039;t sit well with you. 
&gt;Come to think of it, why was Megan there? 
&gt;You get somewhat more uncomfortable. She didn&#039;t take you again, right? 
&gt;right? 
&gt;You absentmindedly nod as the doc explains a few more things about your injuries to you, mentions that the police, a neurological specialist and a few others would visit you tomorrow over the course of the day, then finishes up. 
&gt;Before he leaves, you have on final question: 
Do you happen to know where my phone is?
&gt;Does your boss know where you are? 
&gt;Probably not. Maybe check in there as well, it occurs to you as Dubian promises to send someone with your personal belongings so you can call your girlfriend. 
&gt; It doesn&#039;t take much longer for the door to open again and for Sharon to come in with a plastic bag. In it are keys, a dead phone and your wallet.
Nurse Sharon, right? Do you happen to have a phone charger I could borrow?
&gt;She scratches her head. 
I&#039;m not sure, I can see whether someone left one, but don&#039;t count on it.
&gt;She disappears and you&#039;re left with a dead phone in your hand, waiting. 
&gt;It doesn&#039;t take too long for her to come back, but the charger is for a pear phone, while you&#039;re on the robot side of the force. 
THanks, though.
&gt;She smiles apologetically. 
Were you trying to call someone? You can use our hospital phone line if you want to.
&gt;That occured to you as well, but it still wouldn&#039;t work. 
I don&#039;t know her number by heart.
&gt;Her smile changes to a smirk. 
Ah, I think I have the solution to that.
&gt; She turns to walk away, but she is still in the door as you hear her again. 
Mr. Anon, I think your problem just solved itself. I&#039;ll leave you two alone.
&gt;You turn, expecting Jenna... 

&gt;...but to your horror, it&#039;s actually Megan. She&#039;s standing in the door, trying to smile at you, but she casts her eyes down fairly quickly as she sees your reaction, or at least your momentary loss of control of your facial features. 
&gt;No stress your ass. 
Can I come in? I&#039;ll leave the door open.
&gt;That second sentence seems like something meant to comfort you, and it does, until you realize that Dubian is a lanky twig and Sharon probably weighs 95 lbs soaking wet. 
I brought you dinner, I&#039;ve spent enough time in hospitals to know how horrible the food is.
&gt;She pulls something large wrapped in paper out of the bag she is carrying. 
&gt;That does look enticing, but you&#039;re still not sure whether you want her in here. 
&gt;Then she pulls out two phone chargers. 
I&#039;m not sure what phone you&#039;re using, but I figured the battery would be empty by now.
&gt;The ability to call Jenna wins out. Plus, afte rthe inital shock, you really do want to know why on earth she wa sin your kitchen. 
&gt;Her entire stance also seems deferential, head bowed, as if to say &#039;I am no threat to you&#039;. 
Robot charger?
&gt;She nods, the fumbles for a bit until she holds the right one up. 
Come on in.
&gt;Megan walks in, leaving the door open as she had promised and hands you the charger.
&gt;You immediatly plug your phone in, then, after giving her another long look, carefully unwrap whatever food she brought you. 
Thanks, I guess.
&gt;You&#039;re not particularly comfortable with eating while she is here, as it would only drag this out longer. 
So why are you here?
&gt;She fidgets, then catches herself after a deep breath. Her gaze steadies, she looks you in the eyes. 
I wanted to see ho wyou were doing and figured you could need a few things.
&gt;She takes a few more things out of her bag. A book, some chocolate, a toothbrush, a clear bag with toothpaste, deodorant and shampoo as well as a razor and shaving cream. 
As I said, I&#039;ve been in hospitals often enough to have a pretty good idea of what they usually won&#039;t have and i figured you could use these.
&gt;That&#039;s it? That can&#039;t be it. There has to be something else. But why bring this stuff? 
I... Uhh. Thank you?
&gt;You do feel unwashed. 
&gt;But why is she here? 
So you&#039;re here because...
&gt;You trail off, but she gets the hint and ends the sentence. 
I wanted to see how you&#039;re doing.
&gt;Simple questions get simple answers. 
Better, I guess.
&gt;She nods. 
That&#039;s good to hear.
&gt;You raise your eyebrows. 
&gt;She gets the hint again. 
And... I wanted to continue our conversation where we left off.
&gt;ah, there it is. So you two had a chat. Why on earth would you have chatted with her? Alimony? For her? Why? 
&gt;but before you can ask her any questions, your phone vibrates as it turns on. 
&gt;You take it form the dresser and watch it cycle through boot, but Megan seems to be getting increasingly nervous the longer you hold it.
Are you going to call someone?
&gt;You nod.
My girlfriend.
Maybe you shouldn&#039;t, not right now.
&gt;She quickly follows up with an explanation, while she waves her arms as if trying to say &#039;YOu&#039;re getting the wrong idea.
I don&#039;t want another fight and I&#039;m pretty sure she&#039;ll start another one.
&gt;Wait, so Jenna had started the fight? 
&gt;She could be lying. 
&gt;after a second of trying to judge her intentions, you slowly put the phone down. 
Thanks. I know you probably don&#039;t want me here right now.
&gt;You silently nod, and she casts her eyes down. 
I ... Mind if I sit down?
&gt;You were expecting her to gesture towards the bed, but she actually gestures at the wall on the floor as there are no chairs in this room, despite there being a table that seems to be part of a set. 
&gt;She slides down on the wall, knees bent in front of her as she settles. 
&gt;Megan&#039;s eyes search your&#039;s and she makes a pause to emphasize what she has to say. 
I never figured you&#039;d take this so heavily.
&gt;Was that what you&#039;d been talking about? 
I mean, that night wasn&#039;t the first time I&#039;d done that, you know?
&gt;Apparently not. 
All the others... They enjoyed it.
&gt;She snorts. 
I mean, I met most of these guys more than once, you know. That was just the first time.
&gt;She looks at you again. 
But I never figured you&#039;d take it that hard. I mean, no one ever pointed a gun at me, you know?
&gt;Her voice is not exactly a whisper, but it&#039;s definitely to quiet to hear outside of this room. 
&gt;Gun, right, you had bought a gun. 
At least until you did.
&gt;Ah. Well. That&#039;s what you&#039;d bought them for. 
I didn&#039;t really take you seriously, I thought you were acting, drawing this entire thing out a bit because you liked it, which really confused me, but then you said you&#039;d kill me if I tried anything after I figured maybe I should play along.
&gt;That&#039;s... wait. No. huh? 
And I mean, I was so confused already, I mean, what were the odds of you getting me pregnant like that in the first place?
&gt;Oh nooooo. No no no no no. The word pregnant is a red flag so big that it tilts your brain and you spring in to action. Which is stupid. 
You&#039;re pregnant?
&gt;And the moment you say that, you realize that you&#039;re now at her mercy.
&gt;Her inredulous look, the raised eyebrow after that - she realized that you don&#039;t know. 
You don&#039;t remember?
&gt;She can tell you whatever she wants now, and as long as it fits those key frames in your head, you can&#039;t know whether she is lying or telling you the truth. 
&gt;Who knows? 
&gt;She could tell you that you had tea during your chat or after she&#039;d taken you again... no. She said you pointed a gun at her. How would she have overpowered you when you were armed without getting a scratch? 
How much do you remember?
&gt;Ah. Not a question you&#039;d want to answer. 
Enough.
&gt;She shakes her head. 
No.
&gt;Fuck. 
You fought with Jenna.
&gt;She nods. 
But why were... Why...
&gt; You shut your mouth. 
Why did I come to your place?
&gt;Your turn to nod. 
I wanted to tell you that I was pregnant. And that you&#039;re the father.
&gt;You sigh.
For real?
&gt;She nods. 
&gt;You fall back in to the pillow. 
Fuck. That&#039;s why you and Jenna fought, isn&#039;t it.
&gt;You turn your head to see her face. 
Kind of. I said I&#039;d keep them and then it escalated.
&gt;Wait, what? She was going to keep them? 
Stop. You&#039;re going to keep them?
&gt;She nods. 
why?
&gt;She seems fairly desperate now. 
Not like I have a whole lot of choice, you know?
&gt;You don&#039;t know. 
&gt;So you raise an eyebrow. 
&gt;Megan drops her head almost to between her knees and explains. 
I... I&#039;ve got the choice between having them or getting an abortion. And getting an abortion...
&gt;She looks you dead in the eyes. 
They&#039;re not that good. That...
&gt;She looks somewhere else. 
I probably will never have the chance of having babies ever again if I...
&gt;Her voice cracks, but she swallows and keeps going. Her arms are now tightly wrapped around her knees. 
... If I get them taken out.
&gt;This tower of a woman that seemed so menacing not that long ago, now sits in your hospital room, small as a mouse, tail and arms wrapped around herself, holding herself as tears flow from her eyes and she tries to fight them. 
I know I fucked up. I fucked up so badly.
&gt;Nothing is as uncomfortable as sitting in a room with someone else crying for reasons you understand all too well - but you&#039;re unwilling to reach out to them for reasons rooted in principle. 
&gt;It&#039;s difficult to feel afraid of her. 
&gt;Megan wipes the tears from her eyes. 
I...
&gt;She sniffs, then looks aside and snorts through her tears. 
You know, my dad left when I was 6 and my mom brought home a new guy every two years or so and I just hated it. And I promised myself I&#039;d wait with kids until I found the right guy, you know?
&gt;She stops looking anywhere else but at you and focuses on you. 
I made fun of all the girls that got pregnant at 16 and the baby mama thing and all of that because I knew how horrible it was for the kids and...
&gt;sniff
... here I am, with a choice of never having kids or kids with a guy that never wanted them and who hates my guts.
&gt; her voice cracks and she hits octaves a man couldn&#039;t even hit if he dreamt to as her voice fails her.
Fuck...
&gt;She stops bothering with her tears and just lets everything out, her shoulders heaving, face buried in her knees. 
&gt;You feel the conflicting forces of social pressure demanding that you comfort the crying woman and the unwillingness to comfort a being that caused you so much misery. 
&gt;Why is she even telling you this? 
&gt;But she is hitting a nerve. You saw your dad maybe once a year for a week or so during the holidays. 
&gt;Visiting him and his new family was always like being superfluous. Interrupting. 
&gt;And you promised yourself - you would never leave your kids behind. 
&gt;Never ever.
&gt;Which puts you between a rock and a hard place. 
&gt;But ultimately - what do you want? You&#039;d like to stay with Jenna, but you also don&#039;t feel comfortable with forcing Megan to get rid of her chance to ever conceive again. 
&gt;Then, maybe, you should take the kids - but they also wouldn&#039;t be Jenna&#039;s kids and she would always stay a stepmom. Moms love uniquely. 
&gt;Then again, if you were to live close enough that the kids could always go from one parent to the other on their own... 
&gt;But that still wouldn&#039;t allow you to see them take their first steps or speak their first words if they were with Megan at the time. 
&gt;Her assessment of &#039;everything is clusterfuck&#039; seems more and more accurate. 
&gt;single parents suck. But this constellation also sucks. Everything about this is garbage. 
&gt;Why the fuck did she have to pick you when she decided to go for a random guy on the street? 
&gt;If only... 
&gt;Well, if only won&#039;t really get you anywhere here, you realize. 
&gt;No, it&#039;s probably time for you to finally make some decisions. Take back agency. 
&gt;For better or worse. 
&gt;So you turn to Megan and say
Megan, I want you to keep them.
&gt;Megan lifts her head and you get to see a puffy face from the teras she had spilled. 
huh?
&gt;Sniff
I want you to keep them.
Why? Why would you?
&gt;Because you don&#039;t see them at fault for her actions. 
It&#039;s not exactly their fault for being here.
&gt;She wipes her wet cheeks with her paws, despite a continuing flow of tears. 
I.. You...
&gt;She struggles for words, her flow of tears increasing. 
I have to go.
&gt;Abruptly, she jumps to her feet, then runs from the room. 
&gt;You call after her, but she is already gone. 
&gt;Why do women have to be like this. 
&gt;Now for the difficult part - selling this to Jenna.
&gt;You have no idea how she is going to react. Well, maybe you did before. But you can&#039;t remember. 
&gt;Your phone is up and you unlock it, then navigate to your phone app. 
&gt;Jenna is in your recent calls lists and you take a deep breath...
&gt;...then you hit the call icon. 
&gt;the phone rings a few times.
Hello, you&#039;ve reached Jenna McMahon&#039;s mailbox. Leave a message after the beep.
&gt;Right. 
Hey honey, I&#039;m awake. Call me back.
&gt;You hang up, then decide to try sending her a message too. 
&#039;I&#039;m up, call me.&#039;
&gt;You wait until lights out, but Jenna doesn&#039;t call you back that night until you go to sleep. 

&gt;The next morning starts early. The nurse, kicks yout out of bed at 7:00, as punctual as WWI german artillery fire. 
&gt;Well, &#039;kicking&#039; is a bit of an overstatement, but it isn&#039;t exactly being woken up by mom as a kid on your birthday either. 
&gt;As you work through your morning routine, Jenna calls. 
&gt;But the bathroom door is fairly soundproof and you see 3 missed calls as you return to your bed for breakfast. 
&gt;But Jenna also sent you a message: 
&#039;Couldn&#039;t reach you, I&#039;m coming over tonight. Work now, I&#039;ll call you.&#039;
&gt;The nurse comes in and delivers your tablet with breakfast to you. 
Would you like some tea?
&gt;Tea for breakfast? You like tea, but you&#039;re not british. 
No, but thank you.
&gt;She looks confused. 
Oh, I thought that... nevermind. Would you like some soda?
&gt;What? 
Uhm, yeah, soda sounds good. Thank you.
&gt;She nods, then returns promptly with a bottle of soda. 
&gt;You try to talk to her about the tea thing, but before you can bring it up, your phone rings. 
&gt;It isn&#039;t Jenna, it&#039;s an unknown number. 
&gt;You pick up the phone. 
Hello?
&gt;A male voice answers. 
This is Detective Ron Mully with the Anoncity PD. Am I speaking to Anon?
&gt;Where the hell is he coming from? 
I ... yeah, that&#039;s me.
&gt;THe voice suddenly becomes surprisingly warm for a cop. 
How are you doing? I heard you got knocked around pretty badly.
&gt;You take stock of the situation. Headaches, a crusty feeling head, lots of itching scabs. 
Okay, I guess.
&gt;The cop keeps going. 
You got pretty lucky there, If I may say so. Listen, we&#039;ve got a couple more questions and I&#039;d like to come around to the hospital , I think that&#039;s where you are, right? I&#039;d like to come over and we can talk for a bit. 
&gt;While talking to cops about issues that aren&#039;t brought up by you personally is not ever going to do any good for you, in this case he might just be interested in the exact cause of injury. 
Sure. I don&#039;t exactly have anything to do.
&gt;Nothing to do... Hmm. Nothing to do? 
&gt;It dawns on you that maybe, you should have called your work place by now. 
I could be there in ... half an hour?
&gt;Sure, whatever, just hang up so you can call your boss. 
That&#039;s fine, see you then.
&gt;You hang up, then dial your workplace. How come your boss hasn&#039;t called yet? 
Vince here, speak.
&gt;He doesn&#039;t exactly sound happy. 
Hey, it&#039;s Anon, I just wanted to call in and tell you where I&#039;ve been the last couple of days...
&gt;But to your surprise, he immediatly lightens up. 
Anon! Great to hear from ya. How are you doing?
&gt;Huh. You suspected him to furious as to the lack of any notice to him from your side, but he is surprisingly happy. 
I... not that great. Two weeks of headaches ahead of me. I had a pretty bad accident, you know.
&gt;You can practically hear him distractedly nodding. 
Yeah yeah, listen, happy to hear that you&#039;re okay. You think there is gonna be any lasting damage?
&gt;Well, the doc said probably not. 
Doesn&#039;t seem like it.
&gt;Wait. How does he know about possible lasting effects? 
Alright kid, up for a visit from Tilly? I have to get going, got a meeting. I&#039;ll see you once you get better, make sure to keep that brain of yours intact. Bye!
&gt;He hangs up and you&#039;re a bit confused. But It doesn&#039;t saound like you just got fired so that&#039;s... good? Then again, a visit from Tilly is something to look forward to. She only has eyes for her boss, but everyone else likes to keep an eye on her for obvious reasons. 
&gt; She is an almost 6 feet tall blonde in her mid thirties that seems convinced that her way to her boss&#039; heart or at least affection is through her body, which she vigourously keeps in check through exercise, surgery, anything to keep her body an 11/10.
&gt;You wonder whether you should call your mom - she&#039;d probably make a fuss about it. Do you want to stress her out? hmm. There is not really a point in calling your dad, he&#039;d pretend to care, talk to you a little bit about how you&#039;re doing in general, but wouldn&#039;t be interested in details and then next time you&#039;d hear from him would be a christmas card. 
&gt;Call your sister? 
&gt;Might as well call your mother if you do that. 
&gt;You sigh. It&#039;s too early to deal with your fussy mother, but the longer you wait, the more pouting there will be. 
&gt;You bite the bullet. 
&gt;It dials, then she picks up. 
Hey Anon, its so nice of you to call, but I&#039;m really in a rush right now.
&gt;You decide to carefully hint at your injuries, playing what happened down as far as you can. 
Just calling to let you know I&#039;m alright. Gonna be alright too.
&gt;What happens next is best described as &#039;the music stops.jpg and everything freezes.&#039;
What do you mean, you&#039;re going to be alright?
&gt;It&#039;s not nice to do this kind of thing to your mother, but it&#039;s nice to hear that someone is so concerned. You feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. 
I got knocked around the head a little bit, I fell on that glass couch table and broke it. Hurt my head a little bit. But the doc says i&#039;m going to be alright.
&gt;You hear her breathe in in shock. 
Oh my god, there must have been glass everywhere! Are you sure you&#039;re alright? Honey, falling in to glass shards isn&#039;t funny!
&gt;For the rest of the call, you try and let on as little as possible as to why you fell through the glass, waiting for mother to calm down. 
&gt;It doesn&#039;t take much longer for your sister to message you, but before you can get a got read at it, there is a knock at the door. 
Come in!
&gt;The door opens and a surprinsingly slackish guy steps in. 
Hi!
&gt;He shakes your hand. 
I&#039;m Ron Mully.
&gt;He shows you a wallet with a badge in it from your local PD. 
How are you doing?
&gt;You&#039;d previously been fairly tense, expecting a gruff, authoritative guy.
&gt;But this guy is super relaxed. 
&gt;His smile is infectious. 
Well, headaches, but that&#039;s expected, I believe.
&gt;He nods sympathetically, then looks over your stuff on the dresser. 
Aw man, last time I was in a hospital, I must have picked the wrong one.
&gt;He nods to the as of yet untouched novel, the chocolate and the other assorted things Megan left with you. 
&gt;You smile. 
Oh, those were dropped off by -
&gt;a friend? Well.. not really. 
- a neighbor of mine.
&gt;He gives you a knowing look. 
Food&#039;s still terrible then?
&gt;You nod. 
Food&#039;s still terrible.
&gt;He chuckles. 
That neighbor, does that happen to have been... Megan?
&gt;You nod. 
&gt;He looks around, searching for something. 
Mind if I sit - hmm. Mind if I get a chair from somewhere nearby?
&gt;You shrug. 
No, go ahead.
&gt;Mully disappears, then comes back with that wide smile again. 
Alright, so I don&#039;t want to bother you too long. Would you mind telling me a little about how you got here?
&gt;Unlike anything you expected, there is no tape recorder and no pencil scratching on paper while you give a short run down on what you remember. 
&gt;Mully looks at you the entire time, asks a few questions, but there really isn&#039;t too much to talk about as your memory is practically a few flashes and mostly guesswork, which he doesn&#039;t really want to know too much about. 
&gt;He asks you about the reasons why Megan would have been there, but you just say you really have no idea. 
&gt;finally, with his smile having been replaced by a contemplative frown, he shuts up for a few seconds. 
hrmm.
&gt;He stares at the ground for a few seconds. 
hrmm?
&gt;You try to prompt him, but he just keeps his eyes on a spot somewhere below your bed. 
hrmm.
&gt;And before you know it, you&#039;ve asked a very dumb question. 
Detective, what&#039;s the usual punishment for rape? Purely hypothetically.
&gt;That gets him out of his mind. 
You wanna be a bit more precise there?
&gt;There is a certain edge in his voice. Not a lot, but a noticeable hint to come clean.
Well, hypothetically. I&#039;ve just been curious, I saw something on the internet earlier.
&gt;He looks at you, judging you it seems, as if he hadn&#039;t really seen you before. 
Depends, really. I&#039;m no lawyer, but usually the guy ends up doing time, and prison for rapists is hell.
&gt;Oh, so that&#039;s why he seemed so hostile all of a sudden. He was suspecting you. 
No, I mean if a woman were to rape someone.
&gt;Now you&#039;ve actually got him puzzled. 
What, like a kid? Like, taking advantage of a minor?
&gt;He looks up to his right, trying to remember something.
I think that&#039;s ten years average.
&gt;Not really what you were looking for. 
No, I mean, what if a woman were to force herself on a man, both of legal age?
&gt;He seems absolutely without a clue and scratches the back of his head. 
Uhhh... phew. Those aren&#039;t really covered by law in this state. Rape is defined as forced penetration without consent from the penetrated. So unless hypothetically she stuck something up his butt, it&#039;s not really rape.
&gt;What. 
Oh.
&gt;Oh shit, you have to keep this hypothetically thing up. 
I feel really sorry for that dude now.
&gt;Mully raises a questioning eyebrow. 
Which dude?
&gt;You shake your head dismissively while you tell a quick story.
I saw this post by a guy on seddit who was asking for advice on how to handle his marriage. He talked about being gay but his wife and her family was devoutly christian, as were his parents and it was all just going downhill, really and she had started choke him so he could do his marital duties and it was all just a really really sad story.
&gt;Mully nods emphatically. 
That sounds really, really rough. Did he say anything about getting out?
&gt;You shake your head. 
No, he wanted to stay for the kids, althoguh they only had one on the way. He liked her just fine, but as a friend, you know?
&gt;Mully looks you dead in the eye. 
Life is hard like that sometimes, but you can always get help. 
And, if he were to press charges here, he&#039;d get the kids, I&#039;d wager. She&#039;d look at a battery charge, The way that story sounds, multiple times, which makes a suspended term impossible. If she&#039;s blackmailing him, it&#039;s coercion. Either way, I know these things are hard to admit, but ultimately, living like that for the rest of your life sounds miserable. The sooner he gets out, the more life he will ahve left to live, you know?
&gt;You nod. 
I told him I wish him all the best, as he was adamant about somehow keeping everything going.
&gt;It doesn&#039;t feel like Mully is buying your made up sob story. He looks you dead in the eyes, until you flinch from his gaze, then keeps them on you for a little while longer. 
Alright. I&#039;ve talked to a few guys with issues like these, you know? Sons visited by either parent at night, guys in dorms getting visitors, I&#039;ve had big strong bodybuilders getting beaten up by 5 foot 90 pound girls. everything stays inside my head. No notes, nothing, just my head, so if you have something to tell me...
&gt;You could talk about Megan right now. 
&gt;Battery and assault. No way she&#039;s getting out of that if Jenna backs you up. 
&gt;But then he makes you reconsider. 
We all deserve someone who brings us chocolate when we&#039;re down, eh?
&gt;And that&#039;s when you remember that call with your mum. 
&gt;How worried she was. 
&gt;How she&#039;d wake you up not just on birthdays, but on every day. 
&gt;How she kept axing guys that turned out to not really accept you and your sister as part of the family. 
&gt;All the love and compassion a mother could give your kids. 
&gt;He was right, Megan had turned up with chocolate and books and food and everything last night. 
&gt;He interrupts you train of thought. 
Anon, I&#039;m guessing you want to think about some of this on your own, yeah?
&gt;You nod, slowly, lost in your thoughts. 
If you want to talk to me about something, I&#039;ll leave you my card, alright?
&gt;He pulls a card out of his shirt and drops it on your dresser.
&gt;You just nod, overcome by sentimentality. 
&gt;If you cry now, your ruse is so definitely up. 
&gt;Mully puts a hand on your bed, making sure you look in his direction. 
&gt;This man spreads empathy like a lamp spreads light, and he is a 3000W search light, but then he pretends to be a bit more gruff. Gunnery Sargeant-gruff. 
Get well soon, ya hear?
&gt;You nod, then mock salute with two fingers. It immediately takes the edge off your emotions.
Yes, sir!
&gt;You both chuckle as he leaves. 
&gt;As soon as you hear the door behind him click, you google battery charges. 
&gt;The amount of time Megan would spend in jail for double battery would make her miss almost all of primary school, never mind kindergarten. 
&gt;You think back on your childhood and realize how much you would have missed your mother if she had been in prison all that time. 
&gt;Jesus fuck. 
&gt;Could you do that to your own kids? 
&gt;Out of all the things you could do, singlehandedly robbing them of their mother for something that, if you&#039;re really being honest with yourself, didn&#039;t really physically hurt? 
&gt;A mom that seems to perfectly down with bring them chocolate and books? 
&gt;... 
&gt;Things really are a clusterfuck. 
&gt;Maybe you should have some chocolate. 
&gt;You should definitely have some chocolate. 
&gt;it&#039;s not exactly a hershey&#039;s bar, this is expensive stuff. 
&gt;and it tastes really sweet. 
&gt;You could think things through, but your head is buzzing and you&#039;ve never made a single good decision in the past when you&#039;ve been emotionally charged. 
&gt;So you have a look at the book instead. 
&gt;The Helium Sonata. 
&gt;hmm. 
&gt;A welcome distraction. 
&gt;But it&#039;s not exactly a long lasting distraction, as it doesn&#039;t take particularly long until your phone buzzes you out of the first few pages. 
&gt;It&#039;s your sister. 
&#039;HEY, I&#039;M TALKING TO YOU, DINKLEBUTT!&#039;
&gt;You open your phone. 
&gt;It&#039;s a series of increasingly pissy messages asking you how you are. 
&#039;Sorry, talked to an officer just now. Doing okay. Head kinda hurts.&#039; 
&#039;Oh look, his majesty graces this peasant with his presence.&#039;
&gt;What is up with her? 
&#039;Alright, fuck off then.&#039;
&#039;What?! first, you let mom tell me that you&#039;re in hospital for days, then you won&#039;t even tell your only sister who&#039;s worried about her little bro what&#039;s going on and now you&#039;re angry at me? You fuck off. &#039;
&gt;She follows up with an emoji stretching her tongue out and that&#039;s when you realize that she is just pulling your leg. 
&#039;You little brat.&#039;
&#039;I&#039;m not a brat, I&#039;m horrible.&#039;
&#039;You&#039;re a horrible little sister. Fine?&#039;
&#039;Thank you.&#039;
&#039;Mind telling me what the difference is?&#039;
&#039;No one likes a brat, but everyone loves a horrible little sister, and both get away with almost anything.&#039;
&gt;You chuckle. As you type your reply, it escalates in to a laugh, mostly fueled by relief that some parts of this world are still in order. 
&#039;That&#039;s really fucking dumb.&#039;
&#039;Fuck you too.&#039;
&gt;You wait for a second too long and she has sent you another message. 
&#039;So how are you doing, little big bro?&#039;
&#039;Since when am I little and big at the same time? Last time I checked, I was older and taller than you.&#039;
&#039;Ever since I turned horrible.&#039;
&gt;You start typing &#039;You always were horrible&#039;, but that would be playing right in to her game. 
&#039;You brat.&#039;
&gt;She sends you series of crying emoji. 
&#039;Why do you hate me so much?What did I do to deserve this?&#039;
&gt;ah, fuck it. 
&#039;You turned in to a horrible little brat of a sister.&#039;
&gt;a not really impressed emoji returns, followed by another message from her. 
&#039;meh. so what&#039;s happening to your noggin. Did you get all of your little sister love knocked out or what.&#039;
&#039;Fractured skull, had a part of it pressed in to my brain and apparently that was really swollen? Induced coma for three days, and lots of cuts all over the place. Headaches, but nothing permanent.
&#039;Holy shit bro, don&#039;t just kill yourself out of nowhere, alright? That&#039;s uncool.&#039;
&#039;It wasn&#039;t me. I think. I don&#039;t know.&#039;
&#039;wdym&#039;
&#039;Can&#039;t remember.&#039;
&#039;jeez dude. Talk about nothing permanent.&#039; 
&#039;well, yeah. But nothing permanently damaged.&#039;
&#039;except your memories.&#039;
&#039;Yeah.&#039;
&#039;You know I&#039;m gonna hurt whoever did that to you, right?&#039;
&#039;Kinda illegal. Just looked up battery, you&#039;d probably be in jail for like 5 years.&#039;
&#039;Oh yeah? Maybe i&#039;d just have to kill &#039;em and bury the body then. No one hurts my brother.&#039;
&gt;You&#039;re at a bit of a loss for words. Is she serious? She can&#039;t be. 
&#039;except for me, when he thinks its perfectly fine to not talk to me for like a month.&#039;
&gt;Ah. She absolutely isn&#039;t. 
&#039;Hey, I was out for like three days, okay?&#039;
&#039;and 3 days = 1 month?!&#039;
&#039;well, it wouldn&#039;t have been a month if i called you two days ago.&#039;
&#039;semantics.&#039;
&#039;true.&#039;
&#039;how&#039;s jenna?&#039;
&#039;okay, i guess.&#039;
&#039;You guess?&#039;
&gt;You start typing up an answer, but before you can finish, your phone rings. 
&gt;Your sister calls and you pick up. 
Hey.
&gt;there is a lot of noise on her end, but she is easy to make out. 
Lecture is over. Might as well talk. SInce you barely ever talk to me anyway, what&#039;s up with that? I&#039;m your cute little sister and you&#039;re all like.
&gt;She&#039;s silent for a second. 
You know bro, that&#039;s just not cool.
&gt;you forgot what&#039;s she&#039;s like sometimes. 
I know, I should call you more often. But I don&#039;t want to interrupt your lectures.
&gt;she snorts. 
Weak, bro, weak. You know lectures aren&#039;t in the evening.
&gt;Well, she didn&#039;t get all the wit your dad&#039;s genes had to give. 
Yeah, but you might be kissing a guy or something. And then I&#039;d pop in to your head because I called. Imagine you&#039;d have to think of my face while you were doing the horizontal tango -
&gt;you hear a loud snort, then coughing on the other end, followed by laughter. 
No fair!
&gt;What? 
The horizontal tango? How old are you, 56?
&gt;more laughter. 
You dick, you made me spill all my coffee!
&gt;You smile. 
Hah, you deserve it.
&gt;You hear someone trying to pout on the other end while laughing. 
You&#039;re horrible.
&gt;well, she deserves this for cheering you up. 
You too.
&gt;She sounds really heartwarmed now. 
Awww.  
&gt;The noise in the background dies down to almost nothing as you hear a car door shut. 
Alright bro. Go on, tell me about Jenna.
&gt;you sigh. 
We&#039;re having some trouble right now.
&gt;You can guess what&#039;s going to come next. 
Look bro, I know I made some bad calls on your relationships before -
&gt;Yeah. Like her bff Raquel back in High School. 
- but I honeslty think you should dump her.
&gt;Well... You&#039;re not really at a point in time where you know what will happen next. 
&gt;And you haven&#039;t thought about it at all yet. 
&gt;Your sister immediatly senses your hesitation. 
You&#039;re thinking about it already, aren&#039;t you?
&gt;well, no, but you also can&#039;t really see a way of having kids with Megan while Jenna is around. 
I... look, things are complicated right now. Like really really complicated.
&gt;She sounds a little dejected. 
You know you can talk with me about stuff like that, right?
&gt;You wonder how much of this will end up with your mother. Your sister has a habit of leaking to your mother things that you might not necessarily tell her on your own, albeit she isn&#039;t that much of a blabbermouth really. 
I know, it&#039;s just... I don&#039;t really know.
&gt;You take a deep breath. 
I bought a gun recently. Two, actually.
&gt;Her reply is angry and a lot dejected. 
That&#039;s the big deal? You know I hate those.
&gt;It&#039;s a tiny spill. But it&#039;s enough to break the dam. 
No, it&#039;s... Someone&#039;s pregnant. And it&#039;s not Jenna.
&gt;The answer comes back after a second. 
You&#039;re kidding, right? This is a joke.
&gt;You wish. You think. 
No.
&gt;You hear her breathe in. 
OH MY FUCKING GOD AND YOU HAVEN&#039;T TOLD MOM YET?
&gt;Well no, of course you haven&#039;t. 
It&#039;s really fucking complicated, okay?
&gt; and you launch in to the story. 

Holy shit, bro, you weren&#039;t kidding.
&gt;The missing part from Megan being in your appartment is still nagging at you, and you told her everything as you remember it and then Megan&#039;s version. 
Yeah. I mean, I don&#039;t wanna be like dad, you know? 
&gt;she seems to be walking now. 
Yeah. Look, I&#039;d leave, honestly. I can&#039;t see myself living with a rapist. But if you&#039;re gonna pick one, I&#039;d stay with Megan and the babies.
&gt;Megan&#039;s remarks from yesterday seemed... different. Not exaclty like she was a stone cold rapist. 
I honestly think she meant that in a way of she just kinda does this forcible thing for the first time, and then she always met the other guys again, you know. Like, a hardcore version of &quot;lets have sex on the first date&quot;.
&gt;She snorts
That doesn&#039;t make her any less sane, dude. That&#039;s fuckin&#039; cray cray.
&gt;You can hear her giggle at the other end. 
I mean... I can&#039;t even imagine. That&#039;s just wild. I don&#039;t even want to know how many STD&#039;s that girl has. You better get checked yourself too.
&gt;Shit. That never even occured to you. 
Yeha, that&#039;s... I really should do that.
&gt;She snorts. 
Bro, you&#039;re so out of whack, it went from not being funny at all to being funny again. I&#039;m coming down. You&#039;re gonna need me.
&gt;Wait what? No, you really don&#039;t need your sister taking matters in her hands as well. 
I&#039;m fine. Trust me.
&gt;that has her laughing. 
Dude, I trusted you to be able to do live on your own and you find the most horrible woman on the planet to get along with, call her your girlfriend and then manage to get another girl pregnant without anyone being able to blame you for it within reason and then knock yourself out on a table so hard that it and you break. That is the definition of not fine.
&gt;feeble excuses? Of course you have one. 
I don&#039;t want to you to miss any courses.
&gt;Well, there is this issue of you being a bit out of the loop on dates. 
Dude, it&#039;s friday and monday is a holiday.
&gt;One last try. 
Jenna is going to come over tonight.
&gt;That doesn&#039;t really work at all. 
Good. Can I tell the cunt the good news that she can fuck off and die?
&gt;YOu don&#039;t really want her to fuck off and die. You want her to stay with you, but you have to face the facts.
Please don&#039;t. I would have never ended your relationships and I wouldn&#039;t want you to end mine.
&gt;You&#039;d still rather tell her what&#039;s going to happen and see how she takes it instead of just giving her the boot. 
&gt;Your sister&#039;s answer is hard to hear, her phone seems to slide over something. You seem to make out &#039;maybe you should have&#039;? 
What was that?
&gt;Her voice clarity suddenly picks up a lot, as if she had picked up her phone. 
Nothing.
&gt;Screw that, you&#039;ve just told her some really in depth things about your life. 
Hey, no fair.
&gt;She sighs. 
Can we talk about this later?
&gt;oh well. 
Alright. got an idea of when you&#039;ll be here?
&gt;she taps on her phone. 
i----n six hours. Ish. Traffic looks horrifying.
&gt;Eugh. six hours? That&#039;s... that&#039;s a lot of fuel, actually. Fuel she shouldn&#039;t be paying for. 
You know I&#039;m paying for your gas, right?
&gt;And the warmth is back in her voice. 
Thanks, bro.
&gt;you answer in kind. 
Thanks for making the trip.
&gt;a car door slams shut on her end. 
anything for you bro, see you soon. Bye!
&gt;Sometimes you wonder whether she calls you bro because you told her that it&#039;s just dumb and silly to spite you or whether she forgot and just does it because she&#039;s an idiot. 
Bye.
&gt;with that, you hang up and only then do you notice how much your stress level has decreased. 
&gt;it will be nice to see your sister again. It&#039;s been a while, and while she does get on your nerves, she&#039;s someone you trust implicitly. 
&gt;Which is something you really could do with about now. 
&gt;Her perspective on these issues should help a lot with finding a way out of this mess. 
&gt;You hang on to your thoughts for a while, then take another bite of chocolate. 

&gt;lunch comes around. Nurse sharon brings in mediocre food, you eat it, take another cup of pills agains the headaches, then go back to reading your book. 
&gt;It&#039;s afternoon when someone else interrupts the Helium Sonata, which is a surprisingly well written Sci-fi-book. 
Hey, is Anon here?
&gt;Stage, right: goddess.
&gt;Tilly pokes her head in to the room. Well, her gray ears first, and then the rest of her bunny head. 
Hi Miss Hopps.
&gt;You smile, and she smiles back. 
We&#039;re out of office, you can call me Tilly.
&gt;Uh... alright.
Sure. I&#039;m Anon.
&gt;This feels weird. What exactly is she doing? 
How are you doing today?
&gt;Well, pretty nice actually. 
Got a nice buzz going with these pills, someone is making my food, could be worse.
&gt;She laughs. 
Except for that hole in your head, right?
&gt;you pretend to remember that just now. 
Oh, yeah, that. That still hurts.
&gt;you shrug. 
Can&#039;t have it all, eh?
&gt;She seems fairly conspiratorily. 
Guess you can&#039;t.
&gt;She takes the seat next to your bed. 
I have a little something from us at the office.
&gt;Its a lot of clear wrapping around a gift basket with some small sweets and a few assorted fruits.
&gt;Nothing fancy, but there is a gift card on it with your name and you definitely weren&#039;t expecting it. 
Thank you!
&gt;She smiles. 
oh, it&#039;s not much.
&gt;You examine it, then open the tie. 
&gt;The carrot sticks out like a sore thumb. 
&gt;You pull it out and give it a try. 
&gt;It&#039;s a carrot. A really good one, but still just a carrot. 
It&#039;s nice.
&gt;She nods. 
I know, they are really great aren&#039;t they? I found a farmer that grows them on a rooftop near my home. You can really tast ethe sun on them.
&gt;okay, this is getting really weird. 
Hey, you know, I gotta ask. Is Vince okay with me being out? I expected him to be a bit more... displeased.
&gt;She leans back in to the chair and folds her legs over each other. 
Oh yeah, I mean, I had to do a little digging to find you. He was pretty angry the day before yesterday, but then insurance called us about an ambulance ride. We didn&#039;t know a thing about what was going on and from there on out it was just a question of driving to the hospital and asking for your name. Dr. Dubian was kind enough to let me know that you were in a coma and Vince does take health seriously.
&gt;That... actually explains everything.
Ah. 
Thanks for that, I really didn&#039;t want to get fired. Can I interest you in some chocolate?
&gt;Tilly looks at the chocolate you offer her and then waves her hand.
No, thank you. I don&#039;t really have a sweet tooth, you know.
&gt;You break the carrot you&#039;ve nibbled on in half, then hand her the part that&#039;s untouched. 
&gt;She wants to decline, but you insist. 
Oh well, then don&#039;t mind if I do.
&gt;She happily munches away on it, while you complain a little about hospital food and finally, she looks at her wristwatch and declares its time to go for her.
&gt;You say your goodbyes and she leaves. 

&gt;You lie back and let your head sink in to the fluffy pillow. 
&gt;Midday has long passed and the light outside is turning late afternoon golden as your phone awakens you from dozing. 
&gt;Jenna. 
Hi Jen.
&gt;You hear clacking shoes in the background. 
Hello hon, how are you doing?
&gt;Well, the pain meds are working pretty well by now. 
Pretty good. Still cut to shit and high as a kite, but pretty good.
&gt;She sounds a little distracted, as a car door falls shut. 
That sounds great. Listen, I&#039;m sorry I couldn&#039;t call earlier, I&#039;m going to be there tonight, alright?
&gt;Uh... sure. She sounds awfully... disinterested. 
Yeah, thats fine. How are you doing?
&gt;She then goes in to a short tirade about her office rivalries, but stops pretty quickly as she still has another meeting coming up. 
Okay, alright. I&#039;ll see you tonight then.
&gt;You quickly wonder whether you should ask her to bring a nice dinner, but then decide against it. 
&gt;If she doesn&#039;t bring it up herself, she either has that planned already or too much on her plate. 
Yeah, see ya tonight.
&gt;you put your phone down, wondering how badly she&#039;ll take the entire Megan is keeping the babies thing. 

&gt;It takes another hour before the door to your room gets knocked on. 
Come in!
&gt;It opens, and your sister rushes in. 
Heybro,gottapee!
&gt;With that, the door to your bathroom gets flung open, then equally quickly gets flung shut and you raise your torso with the aid of the powered bed to a more upright position, expecting to spend some time talking to Sarah. 
&gt;It takes her a while on the loo while you shake your head awake a little bit, anticipating a lighthearted verbal machine gun firefight. 
&gt;But when she returns from the loo, a warm comfortable feeling washes over you and you smile. 
Hey Sarah.
&gt;She smiles back. 
Hey accident.
&gt;You snort. 
Wow, you&#039;re especally horrible today.
&gt;She chuckles. 
Special treatment for big dumb bros. 
How are you doing?
&gt;not a lot has changed since you called Jenna. 
High as a kite on meds, Pain&#039;s gone, everything is fluffy.
&gt;Sarah is interested. 
What are you getting?
&gt;You have no idea. 
White pills.
&gt;She makes her Duh! face. 
And what would those be?
&gt;You shake your head slowly. 
I have no-o-o-o idea. How was the drive down?
&gt;Sarah still doesn&#039;t seem happy about the question of your medication, but switches topics. 
Bo-ring. It&#039;s better when I get to bring someone.
&gt;You&#039;re about to suggest audiobooks, but Sarah has always disliked them. 
If only you&#039;d like audiobooks...
&gt;She shakes her head. 
You know I always fall asleep when I listen to them.
&gt;She moves to the right in her chair to look past you. 
Is that chocolate?
&gt;You nod. 
Mind if I have some?
&gt;Seeing as she has already gotten up and is making her way to the chocolate right now, you nod again as declining seems fairly pointless. 
Thanks, bro.
&gt;she takes one of the couple of bars and looks around the other things on your bed side table. 
That a lot of stuff. I&#039;m starting to dislike Jenna a bit less.
&gt;you divert your eyes slightly embarassed. 
That&#039;s actually not Jenna&#039;s.
&gt;Her mouth full of chocolate, she immediatly replies. 
No&#039;? Wha&#039; iff?
&gt;She has to do this on purpose. 
I don&#039;t think any of it is. She&#039;s kinda busy. Also, You know I love you, but could you please stop chewing with your mouth wide open? That&#039;s fucking disgusting. I refuse to believe grandma didn&#039;t drill this in to your head.
&gt;She swallows. 
Yeah, but the difference is that Grandma isn&#039;t here right now and with you, i can be a pig. It&#039;s very relaxing.
So let me get this straight, Jenna didn&#039;t even bring you chocolate?
&gt;You actually prefer less sweet treats. 
Well, no, but its alright, she&#039;s kinda busy.
&gt;She squints her eyes. 
Hold up, has she even been here since you woke up?
&gt;Well... 
We spoke on the phone, she&#039;s coming around tonight. Don&#039;t give her too much shit, she&#039;s busy at work, you know? 
&gt;Sarah does not seem to agree with your view of the subject. 
tsssk. I live six hours away and managed to be here before her?
&gt;well, yeah, but jenna works and... 
You don&#039;t have to work today?
&gt;She raises an eyebrow
So? If my boyfriend-
&gt;You know for a fact she doesn&#039;t have a boyfriend. You think. 
Wait, you have a boyfriend now?
&gt;She did not like that question. 
Stop rubbing it in. I was saying I would have been here a-zap.
&gt;ASAP is not a-zap. This woman. 
Yeah, but you&#039;re a lazy commie college student and she is a hard workin&#039; red blooded &#039;murican gal.
&gt;She smiles and you return it. 
Hey, you were a college student not that long ago.
&gt;You just poke your tongue at her. 
&gt;She returns the favor and you both chuckle. 
So who got you that chocolate?
&gt;Uhhh.. do you want to talk about Megan again? 
The basket is from work.
&gt;But your sister keeps on hitting the uncomfortable spots. Not missing a beat, she asks:
And the other stuff?
&gt;You wince inwardly. 
Megan.
&gt;Your sister looks at the chocolate bar in your hand, at the book, phone charger and toiletries. 
She brought you chocolate, a book and a phone charger?
&gt;you nod. 
You know, she might be the nicest rapist I have ever heard off. Still fucking wrong, but overall pretty good, 3/10.
&gt;She looks in to your eyes and takes another bite out of the chocolate. 
She seemed like she wasn&#039;t that horrible of a person.
&gt;Your sister raises an eyebrow. 
You know she dragged you in to a back alley and had her way with you, right?
&gt;You sigh. 
Yeah, i know, I just ... I mean, we talked a little when she brought me this stuff and I think she genuinely regrets it.
&gt;Your sister slowly shakes her head. 
Broski, you&#039;re so out of whack.
&gt;She has to be taking the piss with that bro thing.
&gt;Sarah chuckles.
Bro, you&#039;re so fucked. I mean, come on. A rapist?
&gt;You wince.
I think she&#039;s just misguided, you know.
&gt;You can see Sarah is about to say something, but then the door opens and a slightly breathless Jenna walks in.
Hey, honey!
&gt;She walks up to you, pecks you on the cheek, then turns to Sarah and greets her with a significantly colder tone. 
Hello Sarah.
&gt;Sarah smiles her fuck you smile. 
Hello Jenna.
&gt;You sigh, but smile at your girlfriend as you greet her. 
Hey Jen.
&gt;She somewhat warms to you. 
How&#039;s your head?
&gt;slightly worse than before. the tension in the room stresses you, and it made your head ache worse. 
Could be better.
&gt;She quickly strokes your forehead. 
It&#039;ll get better.
&gt;She then takes in the amount of stuff that&#039;s already on your desk and the cell phone charger. 
You should really thank your sister for this, you know?
&gt;it takes a second for you to realize that she assumed that book, chocolate and toiletries were from sarah. 
Uh, yeah.
&gt;Sarah tries her best impression of blinking guy meme behind Jenna&#039;s back. 
&gt;jenna takes some chocolate out of your basket form work, then grabs the book and gives the cover a cursory read before carelessly putting it back down. 
meh.
&gt;Sarah appears to start to say something, but you try to stop her by waving your finger in her direction as Jenna sits down on the side of your bed, her back to your other hand. 
&gt;All you get from Sarah is a shit eating grin and she interrupts Jenna as she is about to say something. 
Say, Jenna, what makes you think I brought him those things?
&gt;She turns around. 
You didn&#039;t?
&gt;Sarah shakes her head. 
Nope.
&gt;Jenna turns around, scrutinizing you, then the gifts. 
&gt;But before she can ask you about chocolate and books, Sarah draws quicker once more. 
You know, I&#039;m not usually this blunt, but how come you&#039;ve only shown up today?
&gt;WIth the atmosphere turning increasingly hostile, you&#039;re feeling seriously uncomfortable about now. 
&gt;Jenna goes in to full on verbal catfight mode and does not let you deescalate, shushing you as you try to get Sarah to dial it back down. 
Because unlike you, I have a job.
&gt;Sarah doesn&#039;t even flinch at that. 
Same. And yet i was here before you. 
&gt;Jenna seems to get somewhat more pissed. 
Flipping burgers is hardly a job that you will be missed at. No wonder you could just take time off.
&gt;Sarah gets equally bitchy. 
Because your work as a glorified secretary is so much more important.
&gt;Your stress level is rising, you can feel the pressure in your head past the pain meds. 
&gt;Jenna turns to you with a smile that says &#039;do what I say or else&#039;
Why is she here again and could you get her to shut up? I had a hard enough day already.
&gt;As if on cue, there is a knock on the open door and Sarah&#039;s eyes go wide as saucers as she does a double take. 
&gt;She looks at you, then at the door, then at you and mouthes wow. 
What?
&gt;Jenna follows Sarah&#039;s gaze, and that stops Megan dead in her tracks - but it&#039;s too late. 
YOU.
&gt;Megan seems to rotate through a few emotions, trying to decide whether to run or to fight. 
&gt;Sarah jumps in. 
You&#039;re Megan.
&gt;Sarah gets out of her chair. 
Hi. I&#039;m Sarah, Anon&#039;s sister.
&gt;Megan discombobulatedly waves back as Sarah gives her an introductory wave. 
I... Hi.
&gt;and then Jenna explodes. 
YOU! YOU WILL LEAVE RIGHT FUCKING NOW!
&gt;Sarah then looks at you before slipping past Megan, shutting the door and firing back at Jenna. 
I don&#039;t think she will.
&gt;Which redirects Jenna&#039;s anger right at her, but before she can act on it, you interrupt her. 
Jenna, please calm -
DON&#039;T YOU FUCKING TELL ME TO CALM DOWN. I will NOT be talked to like this right now.
&gt;Jenna turns back to Megan. 
YOU. LEAVE.
&gt;Sarah stays perfectly calm and casual, probably very aware how infuriating her stubborness is to Jenna. 
No.
&gt;Megan seems to draw confidence from her seemingly new ally. 
No, I&#039;ll stay here.
&gt;Her stance changes, from nervous flight to nervously defensive. 
&gt;Jenna then turns to you. 
Anon, her being here isn&#039;t good for you, you need to get her out of here.
&gt;But Sarah answers for you. 
No, Anon will not. Because unlike you, Megan here actually managed to show up already yesterday. 
&gt;Jenna&#039;s anger rises from pissed to nuclear. 
Jenna, calm dow-
&gt;Your feeble attempt at pacifying her at least slightly are comparable to pissing in to a fire tornado. 
NO! I WILL NOT CALM DOWN!
&gt;She breathes in and becomes queitly angry after realizing that yelling in a hospital is probably not the best of ideas. 
&gt;At least she&#039;s still that lucid, which is better than having her devolve in to a wild harpy - at least that&#039;s the word Megan used, which does fit her in her anger quite well. 
I will not calm down. You
&gt;She points at Megan
Need to leave.
&gt;Sarah folds her arms. 
She won&#039;t.
&gt;Jenna doesn&#039;t take that too well. 
And YOU need to shut the fuck up. Why are you even here?
&gt;Your head doesn&#039;t feel too good. 
Guys...
&gt;Sarah and Jenna ignore you as Sarah pours more oil in to the fire. 
Oh, so I&#039;m not allowed to show interest in the wellbeing of my bro? It&#039;s not like you seem to give too much of a shit, arriving here a week after he was admitted.
&gt;It&#039;s like waving a red flag in front of a bull. 
I was busy. With work. I can&#039;t just leave at the drop of a hat like a certain burger flipping yokel.
&gt;Your head isn&#039;t getting better. Being in the middle of this fight is a lot of stress. 
Guys please...
&gt;But the only one who seems to react and catch your eye is Megan, who looks curious, then concerned as Sarah launches in to her counter attack. 
Oh, thank you for your kindness. Bless your sweet hateful heart for putting your career before the guy you supposedly love. What did you have to do? Copy empty paper? Move some folders around? Shine someone&#039;s shoes? Water fake plants?
&gt;That seems to be enough for Jenna as she walks over to Sarah and physically starts to push her out of the room. 
Hey!
&gt;Sarah&#039;s protests are interrupted by the door opening, with a nurse barging in with fury in her eyes. 
What the hell are you doing here? This patient needs rest, not a WWE show!
&gt;Jenna freezes, her hands still on Sarah.
Out, all of you!
&gt;Megan raises her hands like a cowboy with a gun pointed at her back. 
&gt;Sarah quickly shoves Jenna&#039;s hands off of her, then begins to walk out as she straightens her clothing. 
&gt;But Jenna is having none of it. 
I&#039;m his girlfriend, I can&#039;t leave him now.
&gt;The nurse is absolutely not having any of her shit. 
Do you need me to call security?
&gt;Jenna doesn&#039;t seem to be finished arguing. 
Yeah, if you can just get those two out of here everything will be fine. I&#039;m his girlfriend and he really needs me right now.
&gt;You hear Sarah snort, a very cynical sound. 
&gt;The expression on the nurse&#039;s face tells you that this was EXACTLY the wrong thing to say. 
You get one more chance. Out. Now. Next call is to security to drag you out of here.
&gt;Meanwhile, Megan and Sarah have already made their way out of the room. 
Look, the other two are gone now, there -
&gt;The nurse reaches for the phone on the wall and dials a short number. 
&gt;She looks at Jenna as she talks. 
Yeah, hi, I need security in L wing room 245. ... yeah. Thanks.
&gt;Jenna looks incredulous. 
Wha--- no, everything is okay here.
&gt;The nurse silently points out of the room. 
&gt;Jenna seems nervous, looks at you, then at the nurse. 
LEAVE.
&gt;Jenna seems unwilling to go. 
But he needs-
&gt;the nurse cuts her off. 
REST.
&gt;With one last look at you, Jenna finally takes off. 
&gt;You take a deep breath and sink in to your pillow. 
&gt;Your head still feels weirdly painful, but it isn&#039;t getting worse anymore. 
&gt;YOu hear the nurse apporaching the bed. 
&gt;As you open your eyes, she has softened significantly. She&#039;s still not warm, more like a strict teacher, but it seems to be more of a tired expression than an angry one. 
Are you okay?
&gt;Her expression gradually softens even more until she actually becomes somewhat warm. 
I&#039;ve got a headache despite the pain meds.
&gt;She shakes her head. 
Did you not tell them that stress would be bad for you?
&gt;You offer half of a cynical smile. 
I didn&#039;t get the chance to. 
&gt;She sighs. 
How&#039;s the pain?
&gt;You take a moment to assess and quantify the pain. 
3/10, but its really weird.
&gt;She nods, the takes a pen and writes something in to a file thats at the end of your bed. 
I&#039;ll have to check in with the doc, we&#039;ll see about doing something about this, okay? In the meantime, no more visitors. I&#039;ll tell your friends.
&gt;You really don&#039;t feel like arguing and just nod. 
Alright.
&gt;She puts your file away and leaves. 

&gt;be Sarah. 
&gt;You&#039;re standing outside of your brothers hospital room with his weird rapist furry girl as the insufferable Jenna darts out of the room and seems to be hell bent on making a quick getaway. 
&gt;Megan is physically absolutely imposing. Clearly fit as hell and taller than any woman and most guys, she looks menacing even in jeans and a spaghetti strap top. 
&gt;Which somewhat takes the fight out of you, but not by a whole lot. 
You know that just because I had your back with Jenna doesn&#039;t mean we&#039;re cool, right?
&gt;Megan squints at you. 
I have no idea who you are, but thank you.
&gt;You point towards the room that a security guy is currently entering. 
His sister. Sarah.
&gt;Megan strokes the back of her head with one hand. 
Oh.
&gt;You decide to keep pushing, which makes you more comfortable with the hulking elegant lethal anthro in front of you. 
And I know you&#039;re Megan.
&gt;She somewhat shrinks down and becomes more quiet. 
Did he also tell you...
&gt;She trails off. 
&gt;You nod. 
&gt;That really takes the fight out of her and she visibly deflates and searches for something on the ground with her eyes to avoid your burning gaze. 
Everything?
&gt;Her eyes flitter up to yours as she asks that question. 
Everything.
&gt;Megan seems so much more manageable now. NOt at all as imposing, so you put your hand on her stomach and lean in to her and whisper. 
I know about these, and I promise you, if you ever do something like that to my brother again, I will find a way to put you in the ground and it will look like an accident. &gt;She sighs. 
How&#039;s the pain?
&gt;You take a moment to assess and quantify the pain. 
3/10, but its really weird.
&gt;She nods, the takes a pen and writes something in to a file thats at the end of your bed.

I know about these, and I promise you, if you ever do something like that to my brother again, I will find a way to put you in the ground and it will look like an accident. 
I wasn&#039;t planning to.
&gt;Megan gently pushes your hand away from her. 
But I don&#039;t know you and it would be great if you stopped touching me.
&gt;You let her brush your hand off. 
Okay. Now if you could, please, explain to me what you thinking process was on dragging him in to that side alley...
&gt;Megan fidgets. 
I... I think we should go somewhere more private if you want to talk about that.
&gt;You smile. 
I don&#039;t think I&#039;d feel too safe with someone like you somewhere in private.
&gt;Megan looks around at all the staff working on the station. 
Just... like, maybe outside? In view of the smoking area? I don&#039;t care, just not here.
&gt;It&#039;s not that you feel particularly in danger around her, it&#039;s more of a wary feeling after knowing what she had previously done that you feel the need to be on the safe side. 
&gt;But still, in view of others while giving her some privacy seems reasonable enoughy so you nod. 
Lead the way.
&gt;Megan turns and starts walking, following the way Jenna went with her Tail forming a relaxed reverse J behind her. 
&gt;You don&#039;t particularly feel like talking to her and she seems unwilling to discuss much with hospital staff in earshot. 
&gt;It doesn&#039;t take long for you to leave the building and you find a nice spot on a bench in the park that surrounds a part of the hospital. 
&gt;You can clearly see the smokers corner and they can clearly see you, as well as the lady at the reception desk. 
&gt;perfect. 
&gt;Megan sits down next to you, noticeably a bit up the bench. 
So? Why did you do it?
&gt;She swallows, audibly. 
I...
&gt;She takes a deep breath. 
I&#039;ve done this a few times.
&gt;She seems to search for something to look at that isn&#039;t your very judgy gaze. 
I&#039;d grab guys and pin them and have my way with them.
&gt;You smile in a very fake manner. 
That&#039;s insane. I don&#039;t think I want you near my brother, my nieces and nephews or my mum.
&gt;She raises her hands in a stopping gesture.
No no, I didn&#039;t just do it out of nowhere. I... I had a friend who asked me to do it. To him.
&gt;Your facial expression doesn&#039;t change one iota as you wait for a better explanation. 
He was... He wanted it that way. He wasn&#039;t a pred, you know. 
&gt;You interrupt as the term pred hasn&#039;t come up in your day to day interactions before. 
Pred? 
&gt;She nods, seemingly far more comfortable with explaining anthro subcultures. 
Yeah, pred, predator, you know. You&#039;re either a pred like me or prey like he was. Some guys get off on their DNA being part apex, but it&#039;s usually guys that have nothing else to be proud of. And some actually get aroused by being prey and being made to feel like it. 
&gt;You nod. 
Okay. I can understand that. But that still doesn&#039;t really explain why you would move to non consentual acts. 
&gt;She noticeably droops. 
Well, he liked it, and so did the next guy, and then I had a really annoying night and one guy just wouldn&#039;t take any hints and he&#039;d been a little dense but cute dense so I kind of just ... you know, took the first step and that really turned him on. 
&gt;She looks at you, searching for judgement, but not stopping in her explanation. 
And it slowly went more and more that way. I mean, I started to really like playing in to the predator thing and these guys really liked playing in to the prey thing on the first time and we&#039;d have a couple of lighthearted flings after. 
&gt;Her tone and demeanor are still very apologetic, as if she&#039;s trying to come up with an excuse. 
So I just ... I mean, they all really liked it, you know? 
&gt;She swallows. 
And I... I assumed all guys would be in to it. 
&gt;You shake your head. 
Well, that&#039;s where you assumed wrong. 
&gt;She nods and stares ahead in to the distance. 
Yeah, I see that now. 
&gt;You decide to prod her a little, verablly, as the silence drags on. 
So why him? 
&gt;She fiddles with her fingers.
One thing led to another, really. I&#039;d seen him before and he always looked miserable, especially with her around. And then that night I really needed it, like, you don&#039;t understand how it gets. 
&gt;She&#039;s looking at you now, in to your eyes, trying to explain a feeling. 
I... I wasn&#039;t always like this, you know? I used to be nor- human, I mean. But when you really need IT, once you&#039;re like this, it&#039;s really unlike anything you&#039;ve ever felt before. It gets so intense that you absolutely HAVE to do something about it. 
&gt;You&#039;ve got your finger up, face scrunched up. 
Wait, you were human? 
&gt;Megan nods. 
&gt;You&#039;re still incredulous. 
I&#039;ve never even heard of that. 
&gt;She seems far more comfortable talking about this and shrugs. 
It happens. Some people really lose their shit and it was weird in the beginning but always great for me. Got me out of my wheelchair. 
&gt;While this is interesting and you make a sidenote to get back to it later, you&#039;re still not done with your line of questioning from earlier. 
Back to where we were. Why him? 
&gt;That little dip in to her personal history seems to have given her a little more self confidence, but not a whole lot as she noticeably seems to shrink not quite as far again. 
I just... smelled him and got the heebie jeebies and then... I kinda get... tunnel vision. I mean I didn&#039;t even see Jenna until she was trying to drag me off of him, you know? 
&gt;Your eyebrow is raised as far as you can get it as you give her a very disapproving glare. 
And that happens with every guy you&#039;ve been with. 
&gt;She shakes her head. 
No, well, yes, but never like this, I mean, tunnel vision, yeah, but I&#039;ts never been like this where I just... I mean, he could have been with a cop in uniform and I wouldn&#039;t have noticed the cop.
