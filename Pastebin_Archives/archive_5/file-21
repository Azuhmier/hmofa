water.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are Anon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your girlfriend is a beautiful tigress</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Orange fur like the twilight horizon, stripes like brushstrokes of the blackest ink, and narrow eyes citrine and confident</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s at least a good head taller than you, a fur-covered, epitome of form and grace</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And a tail that tends to have a mind of its own, wrapping around your waist as she gazes undividedly at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have to admit, she may have been little out of your league</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you haven’t been on more than a handful of formal dates, so “girlfriend” might be a bit presumptuous</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So, what does Ruba see in YOU?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, you’re extremely patient with her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Listening to her stories attentively</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Waiting as long as it takes while she grooms herself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And helping her with her deathly fear of water</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ruba confided in you during your most recent date that she’s never been a good swimmer, and she always has to make excuses to get out of pool parties with friends</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So when you told her you’d do everything you can to help her, she was hesitant at first</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And then proceeded to give you a back-breaking hug</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decided to start with small, shallow bodies of water and work your way up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The first time she walked out with her emerald, two-piece bikini your jaw dropped</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her breasts were spilling out top and bottom, the fabric so stretched it left nothing to the imagination</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Neither did her bottom half, where her tail-tie was valiantly keeping her ass from devouring the rest of the swimsuit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even for such an outgoing, flirty feline, she was a little embarrassed to be so exposed before you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”It’s been AGES since I bought this,” she said glumly, trying to pull the corners into shape</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You offered to treat her to a new one, but she refused</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Thank you, Anon, but I don’t want to waste your money on something I might not wear more than once.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As arousing the ill-fitting bathing suit is, you’ll make sure that doesn’t happen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you eased her in over the following weeks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Taking her to public pools, and then the beach</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And then your adventure today</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you are on the way to Flood Frontier, the biggest waterpark in the region</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sadly, a lot of smaller ones still ban most types of anthros, lacking the money for filtration systems needed to stop the drains from clogging with fur</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The bigger places are accepting to everyone, albeit at a premium cost</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But Ruba is worth every penny to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The whole city around Flood Frontier profits off its popularity, and you booked a hotel nearby so you wouldn’t have to make the long drive twice in one day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You figured there’s stuff to do if you have to call it an early, unsuccessful night</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Both you and her are already in your swimsuits when you roll into the parking lot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try offering to buy her a new suit again, but once more she refuses</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This time out of pride</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I know how much you’ve been staring at me,” she purrs. “So if I’m going to be a cowardly little kitten I might as well be a sexy one for you.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She puts her large paw on your backside as the two of you walk through the front gates</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now YOU may need a bigger suit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You find a nice set of beach chairs to drop your towels off right by the wave pool</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The waters are calm for the moment, and you ask if she’s ready</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You both wade out a bit, Ruba up to her knees and you to where your feet don’t touch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You coax her out farther, trying not to treat her like an infant learning to walk</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gingerly goes deeper, now up to her waist</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then the siren blares</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And a rumble echoes from the far end</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The waves begin, first starting small and rapidly growing to whitecap crests</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You buoy in place as Ruba shrieks at what must look like a tsunami to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The waves die down by the time they reach the shallow part where she’s standing, but it’s still high enough to splash up to her chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few times the waves by you reach over your head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Anon!” she calls out whenever you dive beneath the surface</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s pronounced worry in her voice</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s genuinely terrified for your safety, and it’s probably the only reason she hasn’t already bolted back to the chairs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You let the tide carry you back to shore, right into her outstretched arms</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She holds you to her chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’d be arousing if you didn’t feel so much pity for her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Please, don’t do that to me,” she says into your ear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh well, maybe she’ll reconsider it later</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were hoping to save the “lazy river” till the end where you can relax and unwind, but Ruba really needs to get her confidence back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Humans and anthros of all sizes float along the continuous circuit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You find two large rafts for you both to lie on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ruba takes up all of her own, and even half of yours with her limbs splayed out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s a good thing the rubber is extra thick, because you’re afraid her claws might puncture the rafts as she keeps you from floating away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few young otters swimming in the river flip their siblings off their tubes and splash one another</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ruba shivers at the sight</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Don’t let those brats near me,” she moans</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pat her trembling paws</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s around noon when you exit the river, but you sit at some nearby tables for lunch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ruba normally has a hearty appetite, but today she seems to be drawing the meal out as long as possible</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask if she’s ready to take on some slides yet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She spends an extra long time chewing her mouthful before speaking</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Aren’t we supposed to wait an hour before touching water again?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This might take a while</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But eventually you persuade her to try some tube slides, tandem ones so she’s close to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Being the bigger one, she has to sit behind you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her claws dig into your shoulders, and her plump thighs crush your ribs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The slide attendant gives your double doughnut tube a kick, and Ruba lets out a squeak as you speed off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The tunnel is almost pitch black, but she seems to take the turning and drops well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s the end that you know she’s bracing for</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The last part is a straightaway with streaks of dim lights, opening up to the deep pool that catches sliders at the end</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her grip tightens into your skin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re both crying out together for different reasons</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She wails as the tube crashes into the pool, slapping the surface</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She rocks the tube trying to stay on while you try to counterbalance it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When it’s stable, you ease yourself off and drag her to the shallow steps out of the pool to help her out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ruba is laughing nervously, but there’s some triumph to it too</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her tail is coiled around your waist like a belt as you look at the park map for the next destination</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Thanks for toughing it out with me,” she says, leaning her head on top of yours</div></li><li class="li1"><div

        <textarea class="textarea">Aquaphobia [Tigress; Waterpark Hyjinks, Overcoming Fear]: Anon takes his tiger girlfriend to a waterpark to help her over her fear of water.

&gt;You are Anon
&gt;Your girlfriend is a beautiful tigress
&gt;Orange fur like the twilight horizon, stripes like brushstrokes of the blackest ink, and narrow eyes citrine and confident
&gt;She’s at least a good head taller than you, a fur-covered, epitome of form and grace
&gt;And a tail that tends to have a mind of its own, wrapping around your waist as she gazes undividedly at you
&gt;You have to admit, she may have been little out of your league
&gt;And you haven’t been on more than a handful of formal dates, so “girlfriend” might be a bit presumptuous
&gt;So, what does Ruba see in YOU?
&gt;Well, you’re extremely patient with her
&gt;Listening to her stories attentively
&gt;Waiting as long as it takes while she grooms herself
&gt;And helping her with her deathly fear of water
&gt;Ruba confided in you during your most recent date that she’s never been a good swimmer, and she always has to make excuses to get out of pool parties with friends
&gt;So when you told her you’d do everything you can to help her, she was hesitant at first
&gt;And then proceeded to give you a back-breaking hug
&gt;You decided to start with small, shallow bodies of water and work your way up
&gt;The first time she walked out with her emerald, two-piece bikini your jaw dropped
&gt;Her breasts were spilling out top and bottom, the fabric so stretched it left nothing to the imagination
&gt;Neither did her bottom half, where her tail-tie was valiantly keeping her ass from devouring the rest of the swimsuit
&gt;Even for such an outgoing, flirty feline, she was a little embarrassed to be so exposed before you
&gt;”It’s been AGES since I bought this,” she said glumly, trying to pull the corners into shape
&gt;You offered to treat her to a new one, but she refused
&gt;”Thank you, Anon, but I don’t want to waste your money on something I might not wear more than once.”
&gt;As arousing the ill-fitting bathing suit is, you’ll make sure that doesn’t happen
&gt;So you eased her in over the following weeks
&gt;Taking her to public pools, and then the beach
&gt;And then your adventure today

&gt;The two of you are on the way to Flood Frontier, the biggest waterpark in the region
&gt;Sadly, a lot of smaller ones still ban most types of anthros, lacking the money for filtration systems needed to stop the drains from clogging with fur
&gt;The bigger places are accepting to everyone, albeit at a premium cost
&gt;But Ruba is worth every penny to you
&gt;The whole city around Flood Frontier profits off its popularity, and you booked a hotel nearby so you wouldn’t have to make the long drive twice in one day
&gt;You figured there’s stuff to do if you have to call it an early, unsuccessful night
&gt;Both you and her are already in your swimsuits when you roll into the parking lot
&gt;You try offering to buy her a new suit again, but once more she refuses
&gt;This time out of pride
&gt;”I know how much you’ve been staring at me,” she purrs. “So if I’m going to be a cowardly little kitten I might as well be a sexy one for you.”
&gt;She puts her large paw on your backside as the two of you walk through the front gates
&gt;Now YOU may need a bigger suit
&gt;You find a nice set of beach chairs to drop your towels off right by the wave pool
&gt;The waters are calm for the moment, and you ask if she’s ready
&gt;She nods
&gt;You both wade out a bit, Ruba up to her knees and you to where your feet don’t touch
&gt;You coax her out farther, trying not to treat her like an infant learning to walk
&gt;She gingerly goes deeper, now up to her waist
&gt;Then the siren blares
&gt;And a rumble echoes from the far end
&gt;The waves begin, first starting small and rapidly growing to whitecap crests
&gt;You buoy in place as Ruba shrieks at what must look like a tsunami to her
&gt;The waves die down by the time they reach the shallow part where she’s standing, but it’s still high enough to splash up to her chest
&gt;A few times the waves by you reach over your head
&gt;”Anon!” she calls out whenever you dive beneath the surface
&gt;There’s pronounced worry in her voice
&gt;She’s genuinely terrified for your safety, and it’s probably the only reason she hasn’t already bolted back to the chairs
&gt;You let the tide carry you back to shore, right into her outstretched arms
&gt;She holds you to her chest
&gt;It’d be arousing if you didn’t feel so much pity for her
&gt;”Please, don’t do that to me,” she says into your ear
&gt;Oh well, maybe she’ll reconsider it later

&gt;You were hoping to save the “lazy river” till the end where you can relax and unwind, but Ruba really needs to get her confidence back
&gt;Humans and anthros of all sizes float along the continuous circuit
&gt;You find two large rafts for you both to lie on
&gt;Ruba takes up all of her own, and even half of yours with her limbs splayed out
&gt;It’s a good thing the rubber is extra thick, because you’re afraid her claws might puncture the rafts as she keeps you from floating away
&gt;A few young otters swimming in the river flip their siblings off their tubes and splash one another
&gt;Ruba shivers at the sight
&gt;”Don’t let those brats near me,” she moans
&gt;You pat her trembling paws
&gt;It’s around noon when you exit the river, but you sit at some nearby tables for lunch
&gt;Ruba normally has a hearty appetite, but today she seems to be drawing the meal out as long as possible
&gt;You ask if she’s ready to take on some slides yet
&gt;She spends an extra long time chewing her mouthful before speaking
&gt;”Aren’t we supposed to wait an hour before touching water again?”
&gt;This might take a while
&gt;But eventually you persuade her to try some tube slides, tandem ones so she’s close to you
&gt;Being the bigger one, she has to sit behind you
&gt;Her claws dig into your shoulders, and her plump thighs crush your ribs
&gt;The slide attendant gives your double doughnut tube a kick, and Ruba lets out a squeak as you speed off
&gt;The tunnel is almost pitch black, but she seems to take the turning and drops well
&gt;It’s the end that you know she’s bracing for
&gt;The last part is a straightaway with streaks of dim lights, opening up to the deep pool that catches sliders at the end
&gt;Her grip tightens into your skin
&gt;You’re both crying out together for different reasons
&gt;She wails as the tube crashes into the pool, slapping the surface
&gt;She rocks the tube trying to stay on while you try to counterbalance it
&gt;When it’s stable, you ease yourself off and drag her to the shallow steps out of the pool to help her out
&gt;Ruba is laughing nervously, but there’s some triumph to it too
&gt;Her tail is coiled around your waist like a belt as you look at the park map for the next destination
&gt;”Thanks for toughing it out with me,” she says, leaning her head on top of yours

&gt;You decide to slip a few calmer rides in to reward Ruba for her bravery, and prepare her for the rougher ones
&gt;You do a group tube next, sharing the oversized tire raft with a human girl and her buck companion
&gt;Ruba is pensively quiet through most of it, leaving you to make all the small talk
&gt;The bigger rides like this don’t quite jerk around as much, though splashes of water at every bend still make her gasp
&gt;It gets harder when convincing her to try the single-person body slides, but she relents
&gt;You wait at the bottom for her, waving as she hits the water pool at the end and submerges entirely
&gt;She’s still pinching her nose shut even after she gets to her feet
&gt;Her fur is completely, adorably drenched
&gt;Adjusting her top a bit, she gives you the first coy smile you’ve seen since entering the waterpark
&gt;But the mood doesn’t last forever, and unfortunately she catches sight of the colossal structure in the middle of the waterpark
&gt;”That thing’s a SLIDE?” she blanches. “I thought it was just for show! It’s almost vertical!”
&gt;Yup, The Big Slip
&gt;A sky-touching, fully enclosed drop that shoots you to the opposite side of the planet
&gt;You’ve seen big slides before, but this one in particular is a reason to give pause
&gt;Such a big cat giving such a pitiful mewl is enough to break anyone’s heart

&gt;That’s when she notices the “sissy stairs” in the corner, a descent of shame for those whose nerves get the better of them at the last second

&gt;You tell her you’ll go first and wait for her below

&gt;She doesn’t say a word as you break contact
&gt;”Feet first, arms crossed, head back,” the polar bear attendant says to you in a monotone
&gt;You do as instructed, giving one last look to Ruba upside down
&gt;You can’t read her thoughts, so her choice is now her own
&gt;You scoot forward and let gravity pull you down
&gt;It’s rough, to put it lightly
&gt;You’re in a free fall into the darkness, with the rushing water and air deafening you in the compact space
