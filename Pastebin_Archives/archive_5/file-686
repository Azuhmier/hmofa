Steven was never used to snow. He grew up in suburban Arizona and hardly vacationed in the winter, so he never got to experience it often growing up. His family has a cottage in the middle of nowhere, Canada. Which he visited often growing up, in the summertime, of course. 

But now, he’s going to be spending a whole week in that cottage surrounded by dense snow. This marks both the first time staying in the cabin and being in snow since he was a child. Ironically with one of his closest childhood friends, Aleks. 

He met her in elementary school. She had transferred from Iceland and they bonded over their common love of music. Her parents moved to Arizona for job opportunity.

She had a hard time adapting, which didn’t help the fact that she was bullied heavily when she was younger about being European, once being called a “communist slut”, which led to a hilarious moment when Aleks reported what they said and she repeated it in front of the whole class, loudly.
