            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Ursa Major [Bear; Cuddling, Hibernation, Minor Weight Gain (Bear)]: When it&#039;s time for hibernation, Anon helps his roommate prepare for her extended slumber.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are anon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your roommate is a bear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No, not THAT kind of bear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;An honest-to-god Kodiak brown bear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your slightly-more-than-a-friend roommate, Chyanne</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you met early in the year through mutual friends and really hit it off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were both looking for a new place, and soon you were signing the lease together</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At first things felt as natural as they could be for a human/anthro pairing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She may be female, but the species divide kept things from being too complicated, somehow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were just an anon and a bear sharing a two-bed place in the city</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Also sharing similar tastes in typical nondescript interests</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After about a month, however, you began noticing just how compatible you two actually are</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’ve grown accustomed to her earthly scent</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You love the way her fur looks after bathing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She has the kindest voice in spite of her imposing size</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s a damn fine cook as well, always offering you some of whatever she makes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Needless to say, the girl can definitely put it away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’ve tried your hand at making meals to reciprocate, but it’s a lot harder (and expensive) to prepare serving sizes for a bear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But Chyanne always appreciates the gesture</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And she won’t take your money when you offer it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Chyanne works for some kind of decoration and design company, focusing on the spring, summer, and fall holidays</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s paid well for the incredible effort she puts in, and in turn the company provides decent benefits</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One of them being “Hibernation Leave”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You see, many anthros possess instincts from their primal heritages</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bears who live climates with harsh winters or drastic seasonal weather changes often get lethargic around certain times of the year, even if they don’t actually go outside much</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This can be dangerous for bears who work in physically laborious jobs, and so laws were made to ensure job security during their absence</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Think maternity leave, but for hibernating</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To compensate, many bears are extremely hard workers the rest of the year</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Chyanne is definitely no exception</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still, with autumn already in full swing she seems stressed about something</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Neither of you have ever had to pull the “roommate intervention” card for disputes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’ve gotten along together almost perfectly together</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But today, she’s sitting on the oversized, mega-reinforced couch you two share for movie nights</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pats the empty space beside her for you to sit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Anon,” she says, “You’ve been an amazing friend since we moved in, and I feel bad for leaving you alone all winter.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her huge paw reaches over to your lap, and you clutch it with both your hands</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I have enough paid time off to get an early start to my ‘vacation’ over these next couple of weeks, and I’d like to spend them with you as much as I can.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t have a lot of work ahead of you either, and you tell her you can probably call in a few favors to be with her longer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A brief fantasy passes through you mind of you and Chyanne as your bear wife</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Employers are encouraged by the law to give a non-hibernating employee an ample amount of time off as well, so that they can safely acclimate their partner to a pre-hibernation condition</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You regret not booking your time off sooner, but Chyanne understands</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You deserve to live your life,” she says. “Besides, I’m going to have to spend a few days just sitting here binging anyway.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s fairly lean for a bear, likely from her active lifestyle, but there’s still an ursine amount of adipose to her frame already</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pats her stomach mournfully with her other paw</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’m going to get so fat….”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You give her a reassuring pat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”There’s one more thing I wanted to tell you,” she continues.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’ve already paid my rent for the whole hibernation, but I also paid yours off as well.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait, rent-free for the whole winter?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her she definitely didn’t have to do that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She just smiles</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I would feel much safer knowing you’re close by. I don’t want anything to happen where you might leave or get evicted.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you embrace in a tight hug</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The softness is heavenly, as is the gentle massage of her claws on your back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You and Chyanne are all but inseparable the next few weeks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you’re available, you’re going out to virtually every fair and festival in the area</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pretty much wherever there’s a lot of food</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She always has a snack close by, but she never fails to offer a bite</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you’re not around, she waits for you to return like a lonely pet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can almost always find her sitting on the couch chowing down on lunch when you get back, ready to spring to her feet when you open the door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After about a month, though, she doesn’t really “spring” much anymore</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When she rises from her seat it takes her some momentum to get going</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her paunch sticks out from under her shirt, making her pull it down constantly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She already had a weighty pair of breasts, but now they’re almost too mesmerizingly large to ignore</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Apart from a little extra fluff around the neck, though, she fills out rather uniformly and subtle</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, subtle until she stops fitting through most doors easily</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For the most part she’s unbothered by the weight</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Obviously she’s gone through this a few times before</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Being around you seems to make her flustered more than anything</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s self-conscious about every burp, everything she bumps into, and every broken seam or button</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you’re always there to cheer her up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Plus, she’s only looking cuter being puffed up like a teddy bear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually she slides back to being comfortable with you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Comfortable enough to bring out her “hibernation clothes” and unpack them out in the open</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Giant sweaters, enormous sweatpants…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When she gets to the bottom of the box she lets out a soft whine</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Oh no,” she says, “I forgot I trashed all my old nightgowns. I don’t have anything to wear to sleep.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have some curiosity about why a bear who naps through the winter would care about nighttime apparel</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then again, you’ve always been told not to poke a sleeping bear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I tend to wake up occasionally for some ‘midnight snacks’,” she says with her little round ears folded back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’m usually not too worried about the mess I make, so my stuff is really dirty when the spring comes.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask if there’s something difficult about buying bear-appropriate nightgowns</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Is it a money thing?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Is it a supply thing?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She taps her black nails together sheepishly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I just…I’m a little unsure about it,” she says. “I want to spend ALL my time with you, but that means I’d have to drag you through some embarrassing clothes stores.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Come on, like your mother never did that to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you’re going to be there for her, and she nearly breaks you in her hug</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s a bear-centric department store not far out of the city</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s unsurprisingly colossal in size</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not just in surface area, but even the ceiling seems to have its own atmosphere</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bears of all types are shopping here, not all of them preparing for hibernation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Those are the lucky ones</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or the ones who are hopped up on enough meds to power through their instincts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sadly, a few openly mock those who wander over to the heavily advertised “Hibernation Station”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Chyanne is unfazed by the taunting, instead more concerned about finding the perfect nightgown</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It catches you off guard how much input she wants you to have on the matter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What colors do you like?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Does this feel soft enough?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Is this too revealing?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She doesn’t wait for an answer for the last one before shoving the slip back on the rack</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When she holds another one up you get a view of just how massive the things are</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One by itself is like a whole bed sheet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks a little guilty for forcing you to come along</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reassure her again, and offer to pay for one of her nightgowns in sincerity</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Oh, Anon, I wouldn’t make you do that,” she says, actually laughing about it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why not?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pinches the price tag with her claws and holds it to your face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Holy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She just smiles and folds the nightgown over her arm, patting you on the head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I appreciate it, though,” she says. “You’re a real gentleman.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, here</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re definitely imagining what she’ll look like in that dainty little number</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hibernation approaches fast</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Chyanne is already looking more and more tired throughout the day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s also gained an impressive amount of weight</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So much so that when you finally get to see her walk out of her room wearing the rosy pink nightgown she’s practically stretching it out already</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s almost the weekend, and she announces the start of her “pre-all-nighter”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Basically, she wants you to join her in a sleepless sleepover party</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She tries to stave off her fatigue as long as possible, afraid the next time she nods off it’ll be for the winter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re chugging coffees and blasting music right along with her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It goes on for well over twenty-four hours, and you’re starting to really feel it catch up to you the next midnight</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She lets out a massive yawn and does her best to stand up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pulling you with her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Anon, I think it’s time,” she says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She points to the countertop where an envelope sits</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”There’s enough in there to cover our utilities for the winter, but…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her dreamy eyes take an unexpected seductive shape, as she looks into your own</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”We’ll save a lot of money on heat if you turn it down and cuddle up with me.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your body fights over where to send all the blood to; your pounding ears, or someplace down south?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Is she delirious from the lack of sleep?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Anon,” she says in a hushed voice. “I want you to be here with me for at least the first night. It would put me at ease to be close to you.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You can come in and sleep with me whenever you want. Don’t worry about disturbing me when you leave in the morning.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She doesn’t have to ask you twice</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You undress down to your own sleepwear and follow her to her room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’ve seen it in passing a few times, but unfortunately you see even less of it now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All electronics are unplugged and all the lamps are shut off save for a small night light that turns on when it senses heavy movement</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her bed sheets are pulled back and ready for the two of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The mattress is remarkably spacious, even holding Chyanne in her full hibernation weight</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She climbs in first, and pats the vacant spot next to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re the little spoon, obviously</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The night light dims to darkness as she wraps an arm around you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s not the smothering, crushing weight you feared, but an enveloping plushness like the world’s largest pillow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can hear her exhale, her heartbeat, and every gentle shift of her body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her paw clutches you close to her as though you were her favorite doll</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can’t help but feel a little aroused by having your head settled into her chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She doesn’t fall asleep immediately despite her haggard state, fending off her hibernation for just a little while longer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reach behind yourself, trying to touch and stroke as much of her as you can</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She chuckles deeply in her throat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s finally time </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Good night, Anon,” she whispers. “See you in the spring.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Goodnight, Chyanne</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sleep much longer than you usually do</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s already the afternoon when you wake up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You would have gotten up sooner, but your first attempt was stopped by a whimper and a tightening hold on you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s deep in sleep, for sure, but that won’t stop her from trying to hold on to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You manage to worm your way out of her grasp some time later</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re beaming at the beautiful creature and go about the rest of your day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every so often you can hear a snore or the sound of creaking springs from her bedroom</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;By the time night rolls back around, you’re ready to dive back in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She doesn’t stir one bit as you lift her arm and drape it back over yourself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s undoubtedly colder with the heat turned down, and the warmth from her body makes you wish you could hibernate with her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But at the same time be completely awake, so you can savor every moment with her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There are some nights when you have to sleep in your own bed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Usually from sickness, or when you need “alone time”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still, more often than not you’re slumbering with your roommate, some of the most serene rest you’ve had in your life</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You even put aside your whole day’s schedule just to stay with her a while longer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a couple of weeks you’re startled by heavy movement sometime during the morning</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s Chyanne, wandering around the place in complete torpor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s basically sleepwalking, raiding the fridge for a hearty snack or sometimes making a run (or rather, a lumber) to the bathroom</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s something you’ve heard ancient bears didn’t have to do much during their hibernations, but the evolution of anthros must have downplayed their instincts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually, you hatch a plan to help her </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You measure and time her brief moments of “awakeness” and prepare a meal shortly before she enters the kitchen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s a tuna casserole, one of her favorites</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks down at the dish in her drowsiness and begins to dig in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Almost an instant later and she’s licking the dish clean</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But it’s enough to send her back to bed without much mess or destruction of the kitchen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You keep this up for a few weeks, feeling much less lonely around the place even though she’s practically unconscious most of the time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a while, you start to notice some changes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s burning through the stored fat, and you can see a gradual decline in her overall girth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her nightgown seems to fit better, but the fit of her body around yours during the cold nights is no less pleasurable</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Spring is on the horizon, and Chyanne’s weight loss is much more apparent</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So much so that her nightgown has become ill fitting even for her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re on the couch one morning when she makes her rounds, and you’re struck with a second round of morning wood</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One of her gown straps had slipped from her shoulder, exposing a plump, pendulous breast</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her shaggy, overgrown fur is not enough to hide the dark nipple poking out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It jiggles as she consumes the meal you’ve made for her, catching some of the debris in her pelt as it falls from her mouth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re afraid to approach and fix it for her, but you’re also afraid to be caught staring should she prematurely snap out of her grogginess</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decide to slide it back on later that night</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Around the same time, you notice changes in her sleepwalking behavior as well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She has a dreamy smile sometimes, and every so often you think she’s looking in your direction</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her trips to the bathroom become more frequent, now becoming daily occurrences</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You also have to prepare food more often</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But even then she’s still shedding the pounds</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One morning, you awaken literally on top of Chyanne, splayed out trying to cover as much surface area as you can</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Both her arms are covering you, and they almost seem to be stroking your back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She lets out a guttural sigh and tightens her hold</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Mhhhmmm,” she coos</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lift your head in surprise</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You say her name softly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Mhhhmmm…Ahhmmomm,” she moans</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Did she just try to say “Anon”?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Mmmaaahhh…Ahmmom…mm-I…hhhuuvvhh yooohhh.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s slurred and breathy, but the message is clear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You clench tufts of her fur and nuzzle into her chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you return her confession in earnest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The day comes at last, and she actually beats you to the buzzer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A literal one, too</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The girl had a hibernation alarm all set and everything</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But she’s awake even before it goes off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When it rouses you from your own sleep, she’s ready to greet you with a smile</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Good morning, sleepyhead.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Good morning, Chyanne</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you get dressed and enjoy the company of one another around breakfast</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s close to her original size, but a little post-winter chub still remains</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’ve got some time left before I have to get back to work,” she says as she pinches the excess adipose, “so I hope we can have some more time together. I really want to get some exercise in.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You let her know you think she’s perfect as she is</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You’re so sweet, Anon, but I’ve been out cold for months now. I’m ready to go out and be active again!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She really does hit the ground running, that girl</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But her hibernation is still on her mind</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I hope I was a good roommate all that time.

        <textarea class="textarea">Ursa Major [Bear; Cuddling, Hibernation, Minor Weight Gain (Bear)]: When it&#039;s time for hibernation, Anon helps his roommate prepare for her extended slumber.

&gt;You are anon
&gt;Your roommate is a bear
&gt;No, not THAT kind of bear
&gt;An honest-to-god Kodiak brown bear
&gt;Your slightly-more-than-a-friend roommate, Chyanne
&gt;The two of you met early in the year through mutual friends and really hit it off
&gt;You were both looking for a new place, and soon you were signing the lease together
&gt;At first things felt as natural as they could be for a human/anthro pairing
&gt;She may be female, but the species divide kept things from being too complicated, somehow
&gt;You were just an anon and a bear sharing a two-bed place in the city
&gt;Also sharing similar tastes in typical nondescript interests
&gt;After about a month, however, you began noticing just how compatible you two actually are
&gt;You’ve grown accustomed to her earthly scent
&gt;You love the way her fur looks after bathing
&gt;She has the kindest voice in spite of her imposing size
&gt;She’s a damn fine cook as well, always offering you some of whatever she makes
&gt;Needless to say, the girl can definitely put it away
&gt;You’ve tried your hand at making meals to reciprocate, but it’s a lot harder (and expensive) to prepare serving sizes for a bear
&gt;But Chyanne always appreciates the gesture
&gt;And she won’t take your money when you offer it
&gt;Chyanne works for some kind of decoration and design company, focusing on the spring, summer, and fall holidays
&gt;She’s paid well for the incredible effort she puts in, and in turn the company provides decent benefits
&gt;One of them being “Hibernation Leave”
&gt;You see, many anthros possess instincts from their primal heritages
&gt;Bears who live climates with harsh winters or drastic seasonal weather changes often get lethargic around certain times of the year, even if they don’t actually go outside much
&gt;This can be dangerous for bears who work in physically laborious jobs, and so laws were made to ensure job security during their absence
&gt;Think maternity leave, but for hibernating
&gt;To compensate, many bears are extremely hard workers the rest of the year
&gt;Chyanne is definitely no exception
&gt;Still, with autumn already in full swing she seems stressed about something
&gt;Neither of you have ever had to pull the “roommate intervention” card for disputes
&gt;You’ve gotten along together almost perfectly together
&gt;But today, she’s sitting on the oversized, mega-reinforced couch you two share for movie nights
&gt;She pats the empty space beside her for you to sit
&gt;”Anon,” she says, “You’ve been an amazing friend since we moved in, and I feel bad for leaving you alone all winter.”
&gt;Her huge paw reaches over to your lap, and you clutch it with both your hands
&gt;”I have enough paid time off to get an early start to my ‘vacation’ over these next couple of weeks, and I’d like to spend them with you as much as I can.”
&gt;You don’t have a lot of work ahead of you either, and you tell her you can probably call in a few favors to be with her longer
&gt;A brief fantasy passes through you mind of you and Chyanne as your bear wife
&gt;Employers are encouraged by the law to give a non-hibernating employee an ample amount of time off as well, so that they can safely acclimate their partner to a pre-hibernation condition
&gt;You regret not booking your time off sooner, but Chyanne understands
&gt;”You deserve to live your life,” she says. “Besides, I’m going to have to spend a few days just sitting here binging anyway.”
&gt;She’s fairly lean for a bear, likely from her active lifestyle, but there’s still an ursine amount of adipose to her frame already
&gt;She pats her stomach mournfully with her other paw
&gt;”I’m going to get so fat….”
&gt;You give her a reassuring pat
&gt;”There’s one more thing I wanted to tell you,” she continues.
&gt;”I’ve already paid my rent for the whole hibernation, but I also paid yours off as well.”
&gt;Wait, rent-free for the whole winter?
&gt;You tell her she definitely didn’t have to do that
&gt;She just smiles
&gt;”I would feel much safer knowing you’re close by. I don’t want anything to happen where you might leave or get evicted.”
&gt;The two of you embrace in a tight hug
&gt;The softness is heavenly, as is the gentle massage of her claws on your back

&gt;You and Chyanne are all but inseparable the next few weeks
&gt;When you’re available, you’re going out to virtually every fair and festival in the area
&gt;Pretty much wherever there’s a lot of food
&gt;She always has a snack close by, but she never fails to offer a bite
&gt;When you’re not around, she waits for you to return like a lonely pet
&gt;You can almost always find her sitting on the couch chowing down on lunch when you get back, ready to spring to her feet when you open the door
&gt;After about a month, though, she doesn’t really “spring” much anymore
&gt;When she rises from her seat it takes her some momentum to get going
&gt;Her paunch sticks out from under her shirt, making her pull it down constantly
&gt;She already had a weighty pair of breasts, but now they’re almost too mesmerizingly large to ignore
&gt;Apart from a little extra fluff around the neck, though, she fills out rather uniformly and subtle
&gt;Well, subtle until she stops fitting through most doors easily
&gt;For the most part she’s unbothered by the weight
&gt;Obviously she’s gone through this a few times before
&gt;Being around you seems to make her flustered more than anything
&gt;She’s self-conscious about every burp, everything she bumps into, and every broken seam or button
&gt;But you’re always there to cheer her up
&gt;Plus, she’s only looking cuter being puffed up like a teddy bear
&gt;Eventually she slides back to being comfortable with you
&gt;Comfortable enough to bring out her “hibernation clothes” and unpack them out in the open
&gt;Giant sweaters, enormous sweatpants…
&gt;When she gets to the bottom of the box she lets out a soft whine
&gt;”Oh no,” she says, “I forgot I trashed all my old nightgowns. I don’t have anything to wear to sleep.”
&gt;You have some curiosity about why a bear who naps through the winter would care about nighttime apparel
&gt;Then again, you’ve always been told not to poke a sleeping bear
&gt;”I tend to wake up occasionally for some ‘midnight snacks’,” she says with her little round ears folded back
&gt;”I’m usually not too worried about the mess I make, so my stuff is really dirty when the spring comes.”
&gt;You ask if there’s something difficult about buying bear-appropriate nightgowns
&gt;Is it a money thing?
&gt;Is it a supply thing?
&gt;She taps her black nails together sheepishly
&gt;”I just…I’m a little unsure about it,” she says. “I want to spend ALL my time with you, but that means I’d have to drag you through some embarrassing clothes stores.”
&gt;Come on, like your mother never did that to you
&gt;You tell her you’re going to be there for her, and she nearly breaks you in her hug

&gt;There’s a bear-centric department store not far out of the city
&gt;It’s unsurprisingly colossal in size
&gt;Not just in surface area, but even the ceiling seems to have its own atmosphere
&gt;Bears of all types are shopping here, not all of them preparing for hibernation
&gt;Those are the lucky ones
&gt;Or the ones who are hopped up on enough meds to power through their instincts
&gt;Sadly, a few openly mock those who wander over to the heavily advertised “Hibernation Station”
&gt;Chyanne is unfazed by the taunting, instead more concerned about finding the perfect nightgown
&gt;It catches you off guard how much input she wants you to have on the matter
&gt;What colors do you like?
&gt;Does this feel soft enough?
&gt;Is this too revealing?
&gt;She doesn’t wait for an answer for the last one before shoving the slip back on the rack
&gt;When she holds another one up you get a view of just how massive the things are
&gt;One by itself is like a whole bed sheet
&gt;She looks a little guilty for forcing you to come along
&gt;You reassure her again, and offer to pay for one of her nightgowns in sincerity
&gt;”Oh, Anon, I wouldn’t make you do that,” she says, actually laughing about it
&gt;Why not?
&gt;She pinches the price tag with her claws and holds it to your face
&gt;Holy
&gt;Shit
&gt;She just smiles and folds the nightgown over her arm, patting you on the head
&gt;”I appreciate it, though,” she says. “You’re a real gentleman.”
&gt;Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, here
&gt;You’re definitely imagining what she’ll look like in that dainty little number

&gt;Hibernation approaches fast
&gt;Chyanne is already looking more and more tired throughout the day
&gt;She’s also gained an impressive amount of weight
&gt;So much so that when you finally get to see her walk out of her room wearing the rosy pink nightgown she’s practically stretching it out already
&gt;It’s almost the weekend, and she announces the start of her “pre-all-nighter”
&gt;Basically, she wants you to join her in a sleepless sleepover party
&gt;She tries to stave off her fatigue as long as possible, afraid the next time she nods off it’ll be for the winter
&gt;You’re chugging coffees and blasting music right along with her
&gt;It goes on for well over twenty-four hours, and you’re starting to really feel it catch up to you the next midnight
&gt;She lets out a massive yawn and does her best to stand up
&gt;Pulling you with her
&gt;”Anon, I think it’s time,” she says
&gt;She points to the countertop where an envelope sits
&gt;”There’s enough in there to cover our utilities for the winter, but…”
&gt;Her dreamy eyes take an unexpected seductive shape, as she looks into your own
&gt;”We’ll save a lot of money on heat if you turn it down and cuddle up with me.”
&gt;Your body fights over where to send all the blood to; your pounding ears, or someplace down south?
&gt;Is she delirious from the lack of sleep?
&gt;”Anon,” she says in a hushed voice. “I want you to be here with me for at least the first night. It would put me at ease to be close to you.”
&gt;”You can come in and sleep with me whenever you want. Don’t worry about disturbing me when you leave in the morning.”
&gt;She doesn’t have to ask you twice
&gt;You undress down to your own sleepwear and follow her to her room
&gt;You’ve seen it in passing a few times, but unfortunately you see even less of it now
&gt;All electronics are unplugged and all the lamps are shut off save for a small night light that turns on when it senses heavy movement
&gt; Her bed sheets are pulled back and ready for the two of you
&gt;The mattress is remarkably spacious, even holding Chyanne in her full hibernation weight
&gt;She climbs in first, and pats the vacant spot next to her
&gt;You’re the little spoon, obviously
&gt;The night light dims to darkness as she wraps an arm around you
&gt;It’s not the smothering, crushing weight you feared, but an enveloping plushness like the world’s largest pillow
&gt;You can hear her exhale, her heartbeat, and every gentle shift of her body
&gt;Her paw clutches you close to her as though you were her favorite doll
&gt;You can’t help but feel a little aroused by having your head settled into her chest
&gt;She doesn’t fall asleep immediately despite her haggard state, fending off her hibernation for just a little while longer
&gt;You reach behind yourself, trying to touch and stroke as much of her as you can
&gt;She chuckles deeply in her throat
&gt;It’s finally time 
&gt;”Good night, Anon,” she whispers. “See you in the spring.”
&gt;Goodnight, Chyanne

&gt;You sleep much longer than you usually do
&gt;It’s already the afternoon when you wake up
&gt;You would have gotten up sooner, but your first attempt was stopped by a whimper and a tightening hold on you
&gt;She’s deep in sleep, for sure, but that won’t stop her from trying to hold on to you
&gt;You manage to worm your way out of her grasp some time later
&gt;You’re beaming at the beautiful creature and go about the rest of your day
&gt;Every so often you can hear a snore or the sound of creaking springs from her bedroom
&gt;By the time night rolls back around, you’re ready to dive back in
&gt;She doesn’t stir one bit as you lift her arm and drape it back over yourself
&gt;It’s undoubtedly colder with the heat turned down, and the warmth from her body makes you wish you could hibernate with her
&gt;But at the same time be completely awake, so you can savor every moment with her
&gt;There are some nights when you have to sleep in your own bed
&gt;Usually from sickness, or when you need “alone time”
&gt;Still, more often than not you’re slumbering with your roommate, some of the most serene rest you’ve had in your life
&gt;You even put aside your whole day’s schedule just to stay with her a while longer
&gt;After a couple of weeks you’re startled by heavy movement sometime during the morning
&gt;It’s Chyanne, wandering around the place in complete torpor
&gt;She’s basically sleepwalking, raiding the fridge for a hearty snack or sometimes making a run (or rather, a lumber) to the bathroom
&gt;It’s something you’ve heard ancient bears didn’t have to do much during their hibernations, but the evolution of anthros must have downplayed their instincts
&gt;Eventually, you hatch a plan to help her 
&gt;You measure and time her brief moments of “awakeness” and prepare a meal shortly before she enters the kitchen
&gt;It’s a tuna casserole, one of her favorites
&gt;She looks down at the dish in her drowsiness and begins to dig in
&gt;Almost an instant later and she’s licking the dish clean
&gt;But it’s enough to send her back to bed without much mess or destruction of the kitchen
&gt;You keep this up for a few weeks, feeling much less lonely around the place even though she’s practically unconscious most of the time
&gt;After a while, you start to notice some changes
&gt;She’s burning through the stored fat, and you can see a gradual decline in her overall girth
&gt;Her nightgown seems to fit better, but the fit of her body around yours during the cold nights is no less pleasurable

&gt;Spring is on the horizon, and Chyanne’s weight loss is much more apparent
&gt;So much so that her nightgown has become ill fitting even for her
&gt;You’re on the couch one morning when she makes her rounds, and you’re struck with a second round of morning wood
&gt;One of her gown straps had slipped from her shoulder, exposing a plump, pendulous breast
&gt;Her shaggy, overgrown fur is not enough to hide the dark nipple poking out
&gt;It jiggles as she consumes the meal you’ve made for her, catching some of the debris in her pelt as it falls from her mouth
&gt;You’re afraid to approach and fix it for her, but you’re also afraid to be caught staring should she prematurely snap out of her grogginess
&gt;You decide to slide it back on later that night
&gt;Around the same time, you notice changes in her sleepwalking behavior as well
&gt;She has a dreamy smile sometimes, and every so often you think she’s looking in your direction
&gt;Her trips to the bathroom become more frequent, now becoming daily occurrences
&gt;You also have to prepare food more often
&gt;But even then she’s still shedding the pounds
&gt;One morning, you awaken literally on top of Chyanne, splayed out trying to cover as much surface area as you can
&gt;Both her arms are covering you, and they almost seem to be stroking your back
&gt;She lets out a guttural sigh and tightens her hold
&gt;”Mhhhmmm,” she coos
&gt;You lift your head in surprise
&gt;You say her name softly
&gt;”Mhhhmmm…Ahhmmomm,” she moans
&gt;Did she just try to say “Anon”?
&gt;”Mmmaaahhh…Ahmmom…mm-I…hhhuuvvhh yooohhh.”
&gt;It’s slurred and breathy, but the message is clear
&gt;You clench tufts of her fur and nuzzle into her chest
&gt;And you return her confession in earnest

&gt;The day comes at last, and she actually beats you to the buzzer
&gt;A literal one, too
&gt;The girl had a hibernation alarm all set and everything
&gt;But she’s awake even before it goes off
&gt;When it rouses you from your own sleep, she’s ready to greet you with a smile
&gt;”Good morning, sleepyhead.”
&gt;Good morning, Chyanne
&gt;The two of you get dressed and enjoy the company of one another around breakfast
&gt;She’s close to her original size, but a little post-winter chub still remains
&gt;”I’ve got some time left before I have to get back to work,” she says as she pinches the excess adipose, “so I hope we can have some more time together. I really want to get some exercise in.”
&gt;You let her know you think she’s perfect as she is
&gt;”You’re so sweet, Anon, but I’ve been out cold for months now. I’m ready to go out and be active again!”
&gt;She really does hit the ground running, that girl
&gt;But her hibernation is still on her mind
&gt;”I hope I was a good roommate all that time. I didn’t cause you any trouble, did I?”
&gt;Not at all
&gt;”How was I…in bed?” she says coyly
&gt;You tell her she talks in her sleep sometimes
&gt;”Do I?” she giggles. “What kinds of things do I say?”
&gt;You are silent for a bit, and she reads your face like an open book
&gt;”No…did I? Oh, no…”
&gt;She’s a little flustered
&gt;Now a LOT flustered
&gt;”I-I thought that was just a dream…I MEAN…A-anon, I didn’t …”
&gt;You’re nervous of what she’s trying to say, but also disappointed by what she’s trying not to say
&gt;”Anon…I don’t want to complicate things…unless,” she says
&gt;There’s something adorable about a giant brown bear tapping her nails together sheepishly
&gt;”Unless you feel the same way.”
&gt;You tell her you do
&gt;And you’re pulled over the kitchen table into her embrace
&gt;You’re ready to move things forward with Chyanne as you two share a deep kiss
&gt;But some part of you also can’t wait for the next winter</textarea>
