        <textarea class="textarea">&quot;I&#039;m hungry!&quot;
&gt;the fact your 2 pets said this in almost perfect unison sort of unnerved you
&gt;but to be honest a bite to eat sounded good right now
&gt;with that said you dread opening your fridge
&gt;unfortunately you don&#039;t have anything to eat outside, not anything your pets can eat anyway
&gt;so you swallow your pride, headed over and opened it
&gt;the emptiness in your fridge makes you heart sink
&gt;the only things in there are your leftover lasagna which you originally planned to take to work on monday, 2 full packs of hotdog wieners, a pack of cheese slices, a carton of milk, eggs, lettuce, onions, mushrooms and tomatoes
&gt;you struggle to imagine what you could make for them
&gt;you know for a fact they will not appreciate being given a salad as their first meal here so the veggies are out 
&gt;cats liking milk probably isn&#039;t just a myth so bailey would like the milk
&gt;but that doesn&#039;t make a meal
&gt;you&#039;d really like to avoid using the lasagna if you can
&gt;so that leaves you with the hot dog wieners, eggs and cheese
&gt;damn if only you had hot dog buns this would be easy
&gt;you&#039;re not much of a cook and you have no idea what you could make with this
&gt;thank god you have the internet just for this kind of situation
&gt;one quick google search on your phone later you got something
&gt;cheesy hot dog scramble
&gt;sounds terrible but it&#039;s pretty easy to make
&gt;pretty much just scrambled eggs with sliced hot dog and cheese mixed in
&gt;with that in mind you get to work
&quot;Master~, is it done yet?&quot;
&gt;you found out that coco is pretty much a slave to her stomach
&gt;you had put on the TV in order to distract them long enough to cook this
&gt;you don&#039;t actually have cable but you do have an internet connection on it
&gt;so they had just started browsing through some videos and movies you had downloaded
&gt;bailey seemed quite content to do this, she seemed to be mostly into stunt videos
&gt;whereas coco completely ignored the TV in favor of watching you cook and loudly complaining that it was taking too long
&gt;the only solace you got in this task is that since coco wasn&#039;t quite as happy at the moment the constant rhythmic thumping of her wagging tail against the sofa had stopped
&quot;Almost there coco, just wait 2 more minutes&quot;
&gt;you were actually pretty much done, just trying to thoroughly mix everything together 
&gt;but before you take it out to your guests you decide on a quick taste test
&gt;just to make sure it isn&#039;t toxic
&gt;you take a small bite and on the contrary it&#039;s one of the most bland things you&#039;ve ever tasted
&gt;it doesn&#039;t feel right to give them something so boring as a first meal
&gt;thankfully you do have a cupboard full of spices and sauces to help with this
&gt;just add a little bit of pepper and something called vegetable spice and you try for another taste test
&gt;but this one doesn&#039;t go so well
&quot;Hey! You&#039;re already eating it, leave some for us!&quot;
&gt;oops, looks like you got found out
&gt;well it&#039;s at least palatable now so you just chuckle at coco&#039;s antics and bring it over to the living room and laying it down in front of them
&quot;Bon apatite&quot;
&gt;despite her previous whining coco lets bailey take the first bite
&quot;So how is it?&quot;
&gt;bailey thinks for a moment while coco has a bite and says
&quot;It&#039;s really bland&quot;
&gt;ouch
&gt;you saw it coming from a mile away but it still hurt
&gt;coco give bailey a quick slap on the wrist and says
&quot;Well I think it&#039; very good, thank you master&quot;
&gt;you know shes just patronizing you but you can&#039;t help but feel better
&gt;but now your stomachs starting to grumble as well and sitting down to watch some TV over &quot;good&quot; food and friends sounds nice
&quot;So what are you guys watching on there?&quot;
&quot;Oh baileys just watching some guy do some stupid dangerous stuff&quot;
&quot;Thats whats so good about it! The thrill of not knowing if their going to make it.&quot;
&gt;you take a seat next to coco since baileys hogging the recliner and say
&quot;You know that it&#039;s not nearly as dangerous as it looks right? The people who set these things up always think of every possibility and have tons of backup plans in case anything goes wrong&quot;
&gt;as bailey begins to sink into her seat you realize your fuck up and quickly say
&quot;But you know no ones perfect, sometimes they miss something or all their backups fail and someone gets hurt, in fact I think I remember a video where that happens&quot;
&gt;baileys ears perk up at that and as she begins searching for it coco lays her head down on your lap and you begin scratching her ears
&gt;looks like your in for a lazy evening
&gt;you&#039;ve only been watching videos for an hour but coco is already sound asleep on the couch
&gt;the empty bowl that used to contain dinner sits cold on the coffee table
&gt;you&#039;re getting ready to wash the dishes while bailey is looking out the back screen door when she asks
&quot;Master, you mind if i go out and explore a little bit tonight?&quot;
&gt;you have to stop and think about it for a moment
&gt;cats are normally pretty good at finding their way home and she&#039;s not likely to run into anyone at this hour
&gt;there are no dangerous wild animals around and no real dangerous areas either
&quot;Do you want to go out alone?&quot;
&gt;bailey makes a nervous face and says
&quot;I don&#039;t mind if you tag along or not...&quot;
&gt;but it&#039;s clear from her face she does want to go out alone
&gt;you walk over to her and give her a quick pat on the head
&quot;You can go on out so long as you promise me you&#039;ll be back before 12, okay?&quot;
&gt;she smiles at you and says
&quot;Yes master don&#039;t worry&quot;
&gt;and quickly slides out the door and disappears into the night
&gt;you sigh and go back to cleaning the dishes
&gt;with that done the only thing left is to get ready for bed yourself
&gt;while lying in your bed you can&#039;t help but wonder if this was the right thing to do
&gt;before you lived alone but now with these 2 living here things were undoubtedly going to get more lively
&gt;you give 1 final sigh for the day and roll over to try to get some sleep</textarea>
