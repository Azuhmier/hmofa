Do you really think we are going to have to use a goddamn machinegun? A whole god damn wave of chucklers is going to launch an attack on Sugar Hill?” “Chucklers? Who’s being racist now?” Arpino replied. Anon pulled back the bolt of his M14 just far enough to check if it was loaded before saying “First of all, I never said you are racist, second of all Chucklers ain’t racist. Not like nigger is anyways. Hey Johnson, are we supposed to be parked here all night? If I got to listen to Arpino for 6 hours straight I’m gonna suck-start this rifle.” Johnson reached for a book he had stuffed between the two front seats and turned on his flashlight. “Lets see here...we gotta take a ride around the neighborhood at 11:30 and its...11:24.
