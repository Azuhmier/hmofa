            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Roleplay Gone Wrong [Jaguar; Roleplaying, Chasing, Lewd]: Pampered cats can have wild streaks, too. Anon learns this the hard way by indulging his girlfriend&#039;s secret kink.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anon and Chel</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A little beyond just friends</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You found her on the “Junglr” app and it became much more than a casual hookup</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s a large, gorgeous Jaguar with a flawless pelt, perfectly designed rosettes, jeweled eyes, and the cutest swishing tail you’ve ever seen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Though she has the exterior of a wildcat, she’s a total city girl and 100% creature of comfort</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She loves her upside down, nonfat caramel macchiato</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She hates being anywhere without air conditioning</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And she gets a little pouty when leaving trivial things at home</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you’ve always felt Chel wishes she could learn to tolerate a more rugged, “natural” lifestyle</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s always excited to go to museums and see the primal world</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She watches geographical documentaries more than anything else (except maybe cheesy action flicks)</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you’ve caught her a few times skulking around like a wild beast</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She comes to you one day with her phone in hand, squealing like a newborn kitten</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”My aunt and uncle are going on a trip for a week,” she says excitedly, “and they want me to do some house sitting for them while they’re gone!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’ve only heard stories of the opulent jaguars, most of them involving their giant, almost-mansion-sized home</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It almost seems a little too big of a responsibility for a girl who would rather smell the flowers than water them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Anon, would you come house sit with me?” Chel says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Alone in a fancy house with your girlfriend?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;How can you say no?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her aunt and uncle aren’t even at the airport yet before Chel drags you over to their place with several nights’ worth of clothes and supplies</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I used to love running around and hiding in the rooms here,” she says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see why</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She rattles off the list of the various bedrooms, studies, dens, and even a full greenhouse crammed into it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She takes you on a tour of the house, and even then you feel like you haven’t seen everything</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All the while she acts as though she’s going to quiz you on what she shows you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And bouncing around on her toe pads the whole time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re helping yourself to the food from the fridge when Chel approaches you with a cardboard box</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”A-anon,” she says nervously. “We’ve been dating for a little while now, and I was wondering if you would, ah…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her ears fold back as if she’s afraid of the answer she already expects</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”…Would do some roleplay with me?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s not kidding around here</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But it’s not easy to ever refuse your adorable jaguar, and you decide to give it a shot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Speaking of shots, your eardrums are almost blown out by her enthusiastic scream</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She opens the box and tosses you a pile of clothes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s an embarrassing set of khaki shorts and shirt, topped off with a scratched pith helmet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I got them from a friend who does safari tours,” Chel says. “Go put them on in the bathroom!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, you certainly have your pick of them around the house</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The outfit is a little small and you look ridiculous</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But it’s what she wants, and at least you’re not in public</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Though it’s unfair how dorky you’re dressed when you return to the kitchen and see HER outfit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or more specifically, the lack of an outfit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She has a petite, tattered loincloth tied around her curves, and a simple band of leader wrapped around her breasts that makes them spill out top and bottom</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She saunters over to you, running a claw down your chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Poor Anon,” she says. “Lost in the jungle with no gun, no radio, and no way to get back home. And he’s being stalked by a dangerous predator…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re actually pretty shocked by the drastic tonal shift of her voice</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I promise I’m not going to eat you,” she says, “but…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She squats into a four-legged stance</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You’re going to want to use the head start I’ve giving you. One, two…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You back away slowly, and then dash out of the kitchen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even with the previous tour of the house you quickly get lost</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There are a few rooms with multiple entrances, and you try to keep them in mind for easy getaways</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you hit a dead end when you reach a large study</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The place is decorated with potted plants, giant wooden masks, and elaborate silken rugs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s also one of many rooms to be connected to the house’s music system</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s soon filled with beating tribal drums and the stock sound effect of a wildcat snarl from pretty much every movie ever</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You would normally find it cheesy, but something about the predicament makes it unnerving</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You consider trying to barricade the door, but any heavy noise might give you away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you just wait, silently</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Keeping an eye on the closed door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But not the dumbwaiter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You spot Chel climbing out of the chute a little too late, her approach suppressed by the din of the jungle audio</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s not the Chel you know</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What you see is vicious beast, murderous intent in her eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You call out to her, hoping to at least see some kind of smirk or other acknowledgement</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But her mind is gone, and she lets out a savage roar</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And to make matters worse, you never established a safeword</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She lunges at you with claws exposed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You duck behind the curtains and manage to tangle her up with them just long enough to make your escape</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Down the halls you sprint, retracing your steps through the dual-entry rooms and slamming the doors behind you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The lock clicks moments before you hear intense scratching</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Several times she cuts you off, even tearing open your shirt as she swipes for you, but often overshoots her pounce and opens a chance to slip by</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s a miracle your pith helmet stayed on as long as it has, because you have to toss it in an attempt to buy yourself time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel momentary guilt as it sails at her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t actually want to hurt her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But she just bats it out of the air without slowing down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shouting her name has no effect whatsoever</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t know if it’s your luck or Chel’s desire to prolong the hunt that lets you gain some distance, but eventually you wander into the greenhouse</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thick foliage, dirt paths, and the ambience of fake bird chirps are everywhere</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The last place you want to be in with a hungry predator behind you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s her element, and she knows the place far better than you do</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You creep through the rows of flora, checking over your shoulder with every step</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shit, another dead end</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But there’s a long hose with a powerful spray nozzle at the end</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It probably won’t repel her, but maybe it’ll snap her out of her bloodlust</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You keep the nozzle at the ready, at the full blast setting, scanning the leaves for motion</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And then you spot her, gliding behind the thick brush</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You spray a deluge at her, powerful enough to rip blades off the plants and give you a full view at your target</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s just a cart with fertilizer on it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Clever

        <textarea class="textarea">Roleplay Gone Wrong [Jaguar; Roleplaying, Chasing, Lewd]: Pampered cats can have wild streaks, too. Anon learns this the hard way by indulging his girlfriend&#039;s secret kink.

&gt;Anon and Chel
&gt;A little beyond just friends
&gt;You found her on the “Junglr” app and it became much more than a casual hookup
&gt;She’s a large, gorgeous Jaguar with a flawless pelt, perfectly designed rosettes, jeweled eyes, and the cutest swishing tail you’ve ever seen
&gt;Though she has the exterior of a wildcat, she’s a total city girl and 100% creature of comfort
&gt;She loves her upside down, nonfat caramel macchiato
&gt;She hates being anywhere without air conditioning
&gt;And she gets a little pouty when leaving trivial things at home
&gt;But you’ve always felt Chel wishes she could learn to tolerate a more rugged, “natural” lifestyle
&gt;She’s always excited to go to museums and see the primal world
&gt;She watches geographical documentaries more than anything else (except maybe cheesy action flicks)
&gt;And you’ve caught her a few times skulking around like a wild beast
&gt;She comes to you one day with her phone in hand, squealing like a newborn kitten
&gt;”My aunt and uncle are going on a trip for a week,” she says excitedly, “and they want me to do some house sitting for them while they’re gone!”
&gt;You’ve only heard stories of the opulent jaguars, most of them involving their giant, almost-mansion-sized home
&gt;It almost seems a little too big of a responsibility for a girl who would rather smell the flowers than water them
&gt;”Anon, would you come house sit with me?” Chel says
&gt;Alone in a fancy house with your girlfriend?
&gt;How can you say no?

&gt;Her aunt and uncle aren’t even at the airport yet before Chel drags you over to their place with several nights’ worth of clothes and supplies
&gt;”I used to love running around and hiding in the rooms here,” she says
&gt;You can see why
&gt;She rattles off the list of the various bedrooms, studies, dens, and even a full greenhouse crammed into it
&gt;She takes you on a tour of the house, and even then you feel like you haven’t seen everything
&gt;All the while she acts as though she’s going to quiz you on what she shows you
&gt;And bouncing around on her toe pads the whole time
&gt;You’re helping yourself to the food from the fridge when Chel approaches you with a cardboard box
&gt;”A-anon,” she says nervously. “We’ve been dating for a little while now, and I was wondering if you would, ah…”
&gt;Her ears fold back as if she’s afraid of the answer she already expects
&gt;”…Would do some roleplay with me?”
&gt;She’s not kidding around here
&gt;But it’s not easy to ever refuse your adorable jaguar, and you decide to give it a shot
&gt;Speaking of shots, your eardrums are almost blown out by her enthusiastic scream
&gt;She opens the box and tosses you a pile of clothes
&gt;It’s an embarrassing set of khaki shorts and shirt, topped off with a scratched pith helmet
&gt;”I got them from a friend who does safari tours,” Chel says. “Go put them on in the bathroom!”
&gt;Well, you certainly have your pick of them around the house
&gt;The outfit is a little small and you look ridiculous
&gt;But it’s what she wants, and at least you’re not in public
&gt;Though it’s unfair how dorky you’re dressed when you return to the kitchen and see HER outfit
&gt;Or more specifically, the lack of an outfit
&gt;She has a petite, tattered loincloth tied around her curves, and a simple band of leader wrapped around her breasts that makes them spill out top and bottom
&gt;She saunters over to you, running a claw down your chest
&gt;”Poor Anon,” she says. “Lost in the jungle with no gun, no radio, and no way to get back home. And he’s being stalked by a dangerous predator…”
&gt;You’re actually pretty shocked by the drastic tonal shift of her voice
&gt;”I promise I’m not going to eat you,” she says, “but…”
&gt;She squats into a four-legged stance
&gt;”You’re going to want to use the head start I’ve giving you. One, two…”
&gt;You back away slowly, and then dash out of the kitchen
&gt;Even with the previous tour of the house you quickly get lost
&gt;There are a few rooms with multiple entrances, and you try to keep them in mind for easy getaways
&gt;But you hit a dead end when you reach a large study
&gt;The place is decorated with potted plants, giant wooden masks, and elaborate silken rugs
&gt;It’s also one of many rooms to be connected to the house’s music system
&gt;It’s soon filled with beating tribal drums and the stock sound effect of a wildcat snarl from pretty much every movie ever
&gt;You would normally find it cheesy, but something about the predicament makes it unnerving
&gt;You consider trying to barricade the door, but any heavy noise might give you away
&gt;So you just wait, silently
&gt;Keeping an eye on the closed door
&gt;But not the dumbwaiter
&gt;You spot Chel climbing out of the chute a little too late, her approach suppressed by the din of the jungle audio
&gt;It’s not the Chel you know
&gt;What you see is vicious beast, murderous intent in her eyes
&gt;You call out to her, hoping to at least see some kind of smirk or other acknowledgement
&gt;But her mind is gone, and she lets out a savage roar
&gt;And to make matters worse, you never established a safeword
&gt;She lunges at you with claws exposed
&gt;You duck behind the curtains and manage to tangle her up with them just long enough to make your escape
&gt;Down the halls you sprint, retracing your steps through the dual-entry rooms and slamming the doors behind you
&gt;The lock clicks moments before you hear intense scratching
&gt;Several times she cuts you off, even tearing open your shirt as she swipes for you, but often overshoots her pounce and opens a chance to slip by
&gt;It’s a miracle your pith helmet stayed on as long as it has, because you have to toss it in an attempt to buy yourself time
&gt;You feel momentary guilt as it sails at her
&gt;You don’t actually want to hurt her
&gt;But she just bats it out of the air without slowing down
&gt;Shouting her name has no effect whatsoever

&gt;You don’t know if it’s your luck or Chel’s desire to prolong the hunt that lets you gain some distance, but eventually you wander into the greenhouse
&gt;Thick foliage, dirt paths, and the ambience of fake bird chirps are everywhere
&gt;The last place you want to be in with a hungry predator behind you
&gt;It’s her element, and she knows the place far better than you do
&gt;You creep through the rows of flora, checking over your shoulder with every step
&gt;Shit, another dead end
&gt;But there’s a long hose with a powerful spray nozzle at the end
&gt;It probably won’t repel her, but maybe it’ll snap her out of her bloodlust
&gt;You keep the nozzle at the ready, at the full blast setting, scanning the leaves for motion
&gt;And then you spot her, gliding behind the thick brush
&gt;You spray a deluge at her, powerful enough to rip blades off the plants and give you a full view at your target
&gt;It’s just a cart with fertilizer on it
&gt;Clever girl
&gt;It’s all over as the jaguar tackles you to the dirt, your limbs pinned down by her full weight
&gt;That’s not [Cat’s] tender face
&gt;Those are not [Cat’s] caring eyes
&gt;And that’s not [Cat’s] graceful voice that speaks to you
&gt;”Remember, Anon,” she growls, “when I promised not to eat you?”
&gt;That’s right, she did!
&gt;She leans over and whispers into your ear
&gt;”I lied”
&gt;Drool is pooling from her mouth
&gt;She pulls her head back, fangs barred
&gt;And then she strikes
&gt;You close your eyes, hoping she’ll make it a quick, merciful kill
&gt;But instead of ripping open your jugular Chel seals her lips over the flesh of your neck
&gt;Her tongue dances sloppily over your skin, and her teeth are never used for more than delicate nibbles
&gt;She switches between vacuum-like sucking and blowing her hot breath over you
&gt;She’s so vigorous about it that she even makes a few raspberry noises
&gt;You can’t help but laugh
&gt;She then moves down to your exposed chest and licks it with her rough tongue in broad strokes
&gt;”I’m eating you,” Chel purrs triumphantly
&gt;She gently tugs at your nipples, and then resumes licking down to your navel
&gt;Eventually she pivots over you and unzips your shorts
&gt;You get a full view of her rump right over your face
&gt;She’s not wearing anything under that loincloth
&gt;”And now for the meaty part…”
&gt;Without the threat of imminent death, your leftover adrenaline pumps into your erection
&gt;The jaguar wastes no time fellating you, making it extra sensitive with that coarse tongue of hers
&gt;You squeeze the base of her tail and dive into her jungle flower, lapping at her own arousal
&gt;Your indulgence in her fantasy made her pretty horny, so in the race to induce orgasm you already have a commanding lead 
&gt;Chel whines in defeat as she climaxes early, dropping her backside entirely onto your face
&gt;She still manages to coax a load from you, drinking it all in
&gt;She scoots a bit forward to give you some air, and you inhale all the smells of the greenhouse mixed with her own aroma
&gt;”T-thank you, Anon,” she pants

&gt;You’re both still in your costumes as you refuel back in the kitchen
&gt;”We’re going to have to clean up this mess eventually,” Chel sighs
&gt;She’s talking both about your dirt-covered bodies and all the furniture you knocked over in the scuffle
&gt;You excuse yourself to freshen up a bit in one of the many bathrooms
&gt;”You don’t need to get TOO clean,” she says. “There are plenty of showers in the jungle…”
&gt;She’s obviously not ready to stop roleplaying just yet
&gt;But she lets you at least wash your hands from the grime, sweat, and juices
&gt;When you return back to the kitchen, Chel is gone
&gt;Oh no, not again
&gt;You tense up and guard yourself, but in the stillness you hear distant meowing
&gt;You follow the cries to the den
&gt;Chel had emptied of all the stuff in a large curio cabinet, and was now locked behind the elegant lattice doors
&gt;She has a collar on with a cord dangling from it, her claws grasping at the woodwork
&gt;”Oh no,” she feigns, “caged by the cunning hunter Anon. What will become of me?”
&gt;It’s going to be a long, interesting week</textarea>
