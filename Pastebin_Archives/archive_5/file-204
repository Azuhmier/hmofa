covers to reveal she’s nude</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;see that massive winter coat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;conflicted, angry, and horny</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;fuck it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;err, fuck her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you grab her by the hips and fuck the anger away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she’s screaming like a banshee the whole time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;cuddle time afterwards</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she may be small, but that massive winter coat of hers makes up for it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it feels like a cloud against your bare skin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you don&#039;t want to admit out loud how soft she is</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your anger is gone now, though half way through the screaming rutting you made her bite the pillow because damn can she get loud</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s done this screaming thing a few times but this is the first time it ended like this</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;normally she just runs off after you yell back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;maybe this was a test?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Guess you passed if you&#039;re allowed to cuddle pillow chest and nap on top of her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you both stay

class="de1">&gt;it was extremely confusing, but you’re sure it happened</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you opt to pay her a visit later today to clear things up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you wonder for a moment as you blink the sleep from your eyes if it happened</div></li><li class="li1"><div

though!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;because there&#039;s at least a pound of hair in your bed and a nice hard wet mark with little punctures in one of your pillows</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;not to mention the other wet mark at about hip level that doesn&#039;t smell like you at all</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;maybe she left because she wasn&#039;t supposed to be up so late or had to be somewhere?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you check your phone and notice it&#039;s noon and also monday</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re gonna call in today sick</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;see if you might get lucky and spend a lazy day with the friendly vixen from last night</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as familiar as she was you can&#039;t recall her name</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;had you ever hung out before you plowed her into your bedframe?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;if not that love-o-matic at the italian restraunt was dead wrong about you being a &quot;dead skunk&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;clean up, get breakfast, and call in sick</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;feeling refreshed, you step outside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your skin in bathed in warm spring sun</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;winter has just passed and it feels amazing to not open the door to freezing cold</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you walk down the street</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;looking at house after house</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;searching for the vixen’s home</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you end on a blue and white house</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you’re fairly certain it’s hers</div></li><li

butterflies in your stomach</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;was this a good idea? did she run away for a reason?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;is this even her house?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you’re certain it is</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you recall a few times you&#039;ve seen her before</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;like at that block party last year</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you’re certain she entered and exited the door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you push the doubtful thoughts out of your mind</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you give the doorbell a press</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;sealing for nervous fate</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you wait</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...</div></li><li

minutes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;okay well at least you tried</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You rang handsome?&quot; she says with a yawn and a dim smile</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her body is entirely nude and frizzy, making you think that she must have JUST woken up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;to be fair you only woke less than half an hour ago but she looks like she literally rolled out of bed and crawled down the stairs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I was curious why you left me all alone when I woke up&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her fur flattened slight and her ears tilted back in shame</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she mumbled something to herself and you cough to get her attention, her tail poofing out as she realized that you hadn&#039;t heard her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I woke up an hour after we both went to bed and I got a bit embarassed. We hadn&#039;t seen eachother in a long while and the first thing I do is yell at you then... fuck.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a while? it&#039;s only been a year since the party</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;A year isn&#039;t that long... mam.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her ears flip back forward as her entire body poofs up for some reason</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I. Anon. You... do remember me right? I remember you!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the only bell that&#039;s ringing in your head at the moment is the &quot;you fucking idiot&quot; alarm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon. We&#039;ve known eachother since second grade! We shared classes almost every year until I moved just before highschool!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You knew several foxes but none so fluffy or cute as her, and accidentally mumble so out loud</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m flattered anon, but you can&#039;t be serious that you don&#039;t remember me. Valjah Crule!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Valjah Crule? Valjah. Val?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;The only Val I knew was brown and shy. She was like a toasted marshmallow and you&#039;re a cute jet fluffed marshmallow.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Valjah slams the door in your face and screams loudly as she runs up the stairs, audibly tripping once before swinging the door open just as fast as she slammed it, putting a photo in your hands</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;4th Grade choir. you and me. See the brown toasted marshmallow? That was me before I molted you dolt.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh right, arctic foxes do that thing don&#039;t they, but she&#039;s still fluffy and it&#039;s spring</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Then why did you look like that for all of the years we knew eachother but now you&#039;re white? The party last year was mid summer and you were still your normal fluffy self.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Valjah huffs as she takes the picture back from you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We talked about this after the party. I walked you home because you got shitfaced. You came onto me and locked lips with me and I let you... then I recriprocated. You groped me a bit and I groped you back... We both got handsy without going into one another and then... we both came onto eachother. Do you not remember what we talked about before that?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh wow you got lucky, good job anon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Not gonna lie I don&#039;t even remember you giving me a handjob.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Very personal thighjob, anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t remember that at all.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Valjah&#039;s face almost seems to go red as she comprehends what you just said, her ears puffing up on their own as she gets rustled</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You fucked me like you remembered.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her tail swishes and poofs up as her fur softens a bit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;R-regardless of the hot steamy sex I&#039;m a hybrid, you wonderful idiot. My father was a red fox and my mother a frosty lil vixen he fell for. When I starte dto hit puberty I went through a single molt and now I&#039;m stuck in my winter fluff coat. If the winter is cold enough it getse extra puffy.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your own face goes red as faint memories of valjah talking about seeing you again fill your mind and you feel a bit guilty for fucking who you thought was  stranger, even if your boner knew the truth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t feel bad anon you&#039;re alright. It&#039;s been a while since we&#039;ve both been sober and talked.

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;hear loud screeching outside your house at night
&gt;look outside
&gt;arctic fox girl from down the street trying to court you
&gt;scream back at her because it&#039;s like 2am
&gt;you&#039;re furious
&gt;screaming stops
&gt;go to bathroom since you&#039;re awake
&gt;come back to bedroom
&gt;fox is under the covers
&gt;&quot;you rang handsome?~&quot;
&gt;conflicted anger boner

&gt;ask her what she’s doing
&gt;and how she got in
&gt;she doesn’t respond, instead removing the covers to reveal she’s nude
&gt;see that massive winter coat
&gt;conflicted, angry, and horny
&gt;fuck it
&gt;err, fuck her
&gt;you grab her by the hips and fuck the anger away
&gt;she’s screaming like a banshee the whole time
&gt;cuddle time afterwards
&gt;she may be small, but that massive winter coat of hers makes up for it
&gt;it feels like a cloud against your bare skin
&gt;you don&#039;t want to admit out loud how soft she is
&gt;your anger is gone now, though half way through the screaming rutting you made her bite the pillow because damn can she get loud
&gt;she&#039;s done this screaming thing a few times but this is the first time it ended like this
&gt;normally she just runs off after you yell back
&gt;maybe this was a test?
&gt;Guess you passed if you&#039;re allowed to cuddle pillow chest and nap on top of her
&gt;you both stay silent as you slowly drift away in a cloudy dream deep into her fluff
&gt;you dream about you and coach steve from middle school gym class going to disneyland
&gt;weird
&gt;wake up to immediately forget the dream
&gt;because more importantly, she’s completely disappeared
&gt;you reflect on what happened last night
&gt;it was extremely confusing, but you’re sure it happened
&gt;you opt to pay her a visit later today to clear things up

&gt;you wonder for a moment as you blink the sleep from your eyes if it happened
&gt;otherwise you&#039;re concerned about the fact your dick is literally wet and your bed is empty
&gt;it had to have happened though!
&gt;because there&#039;s at least a pound of hair in your bed and a nice hard wet mark with little punctures in one of your pillows
&gt;not to mention the other wet mark at about hip level that doesn&#039;t smell like you at all
&gt;maybe she left because she wasn&#039;t supposed to be up so late or had to be somewhere?
&gt;you check your phone and notice it&#039;s noon and also monday
&gt;you&#039;re gonna call in today sick
&gt;see if you might get lucky and spend a lazy day with the friendly vixen from last night
&gt;as familiar as she was you can&#039;t recall her name
&gt;had you ever hung out before you plowed her into your bedframe?
&gt;if not that love-o-matic at the italian restraunt was dead wrong about you being a &quot;dead skunk&quot;
&gt;clean up, get breakfast, and call in sick
&gt;feeling refreshed, you step outside
&gt;your skin in bathed in warm spring sun
&gt;winter has just passed and it feels amazing to not open the door to freezing cold
&gt;you walk down the street
&gt;looking at house after house
&gt;searching for the vixen’s home
&gt;you end on a blue and white house
&gt;you’re fairly certain it’s hers
&gt;you step up to the door
&gt;heart beating out of your chest
&gt;there’s butterflies in your stomach
&gt;was this a good idea? did she run away for a reason?
&gt;is this even her house?
&gt;you’re certain it is
&gt;you recall a few times you&#039;ve seen her before
&gt;like at that block party last year
&gt;you’re certain she entered and exited the door
&gt;you push the doubtful thoughts out of your mind
&gt;you give the doorbell a press
&gt;sealing for nervous fate

&gt;you wait
&gt;...
&gt;it’s been about 20 minutes
&gt;you check your phone just to be sure
&gt;5 minutes
&gt;okay well at least you tried
&gt;&quot;You rang handsome?&quot; she says with a yawn and a dim smile
&gt;her body is entirely nude and frizzy, making you think that she must have JUST woken up
&gt;to be fair you only woke less than half an hour ago but she looks like she literally rolled out of bed and crawled down the stairs
&gt;&quot;I was curious why you left me all alone when I woke up&quot;
&gt;her fur flattened slight and her ears tilted back in shame
&gt;she mumbled something to herself and you cough to get her attention, her tail poofing out as she realized that you hadn&#039;t heard her
&gt;&quot;I woke up an hour after we both went to bed and I got a bit embarassed. We hadn&#039;t seen eachother in a long while and the first thing I do is yell at you then... fuck.&quot;
&gt;a while? it&#039;s only been a year since the party
&gt;&quot;A year isn&#039;t that long... mam.&quot;
&gt;Her ears flip back forward as her entire body poofs up for some reason
&gt;&quot;I. Anon. You... do remember me right? I remember you!&quot;
&gt;the only bell that&#039;s ringing in your head at the moment is the &quot;you fucking idiot&quot; alarm
&gt;&quot;Anon. We&#039;ve known eachother since second grade! We shared classes almost every year until I moved just before highschool!&quot;
&gt;You knew several foxes but none so fluffy or cute as her, and accidentally mumble so out loud
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m flattered anon, but you can&#039;t be serious that you don&#039;t remember me. Valjah Crule!&quot;
&gt;Valjah Crule? Valjah. Val?
&gt;&quot;The only Val I knew was brown and shy. She was like a toasted marshmallow and you&#039;re a cute jet fluffed marshmallow.&quot;
&gt;Valjah slams the door in your face and screams loudly as she runs up the stairs, audibly tripping once before swinging the door open just as fast as she slammed it, putting a photo in your hands
&gt;&quot;4th Grade choir. you and me. See the brown toasted marshmallow? That was me before I molted you dolt.&quot;
&gt;Oh right, arctic foxes do that thing don&#039;t they, but she&#039;s still fluffy and it&#039;s spring
&gt;&quot;Then why did you look like that for all of the years we knew eachother but now you&#039;re white? The party last year was mid summer and you were still your normal fluffy self.&quot;
&gt;Valjah huffs as she takes the picture back from you
&gt;&quot;We talked about this after the party. I walked you home because you got shitfaced. You came onto me and locked lips with me and I let you... then I recriprocated. You groped me a bit and I groped you back... We both got handsy without going into one another and then... we both came onto eachother. Do you not remember what we talked about before that?&quot;
&gt;Oh wow you got lucky, good job anon
&gt;&quot;Not gonna lie I don&#039;t even remember you giving me a handjob.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Very personal thighjob, anon.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t remember that at all.&quot;
&gt;Valjah&#039;s face almost seems to go red as she comprehends what you just said, her ears puffing up on their own as she gets rustled
&gt;&quot;You fucked me like you remembered.&quot;
&gt;her tail swishes and poofs up as her fur softens a bit
&gt;&quot;R-regardless of the hot steamy sex I&#039;m a hybrid, you wonderful idiot. My father was a red fox and my mother a frosty lil vixen he fell for. When I starte dto hit puberty I went through a single molt and now I&#039;m stuck in my winter fluff coat. If the winter is cold enough it getse extra puffy.&quot;
&gt;your own face goes red as faint memories of valjah talking about seeing you again fill your mind and you feel a bit guilty for fucking who you thought was  stranger, even if your boner knew the truth
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t feel bad anon you&#039;re alright. It&#039;s been a while since we&#039;ve both been sober and talked. Wanna come in, have some coffee and chat?&quot;

&gt;a hearty smirk breaks your face as you try to break the ice with a joke
&gt;&quot;Hey now I already came inside this morning, but I wouldn&#039;t mind doing so in your bed.&quot;
&gt;Valjah lets out a long, almost fake sound laugh followed by an honest snort as she tries to contain herself
&gt;&quot;heh. Maybe when I wake up anon, but for now some coffee and chat if you want. If not you can just enjoy my beans and we can relax together.&quot;
&gt;Valjah prances into her kitchen of her empty home, presses a button on her coffee machine as it violently comes to life
&gt;still nude save for her censoring fluff she straddles a chair and smiles towards you lazily, her body still trying to wake itself as her ears twitch despite her recent rush to show you the picture from yoru shares past
&gt;the air is thick with the smell of coffee and a gentle waft of once, possibly still, horny vixen</textarea>
