A good household had generally a mix of the two, unless the owner had a preference for some.
This was simply truth.

Duchess Rainer Maria of the northern mountains boasted power and peace. No one dared invade her lands. But as she got older, more men began eyeing the lands her father started and her late husband died to keep from the savage hoardes to the east. The Duchess  had no sons, only a daughter.

But the time would come, as she was reminded by her mother, she would need to choose a true husband. Or her mother would choose for her.

The curtains opened on another day. &quot;Come Lady Alexandra, your mother awaits You in the breakfast hall&quot; female humans scurried about, readying the room and clothes for the day. Lady Alexandra yawned, showing her massive teeth before shielding her eyes from the blinding light while stumbling out of bed. &quot;Can&#039;t i just skip breakfast..&quot; she mumbled into her furry arm before stepping into the washroom.

The Duke, Alexandra&#039;s grandfather, had instilled a long tradition. The male human servants would all be called Dalton, the females would be called Cassandra if addressed at all besides &quot;Human.&quot; Females wore slim but chaste looking white suits, males wore dark suits and both would wear the symbol of the Duke at all times.

Handservant humans were given a special uniform, to somewhat differentiate them from the others.

Alexandra stormed into the breakfast hall and scowled at her mother while bowing, more on reflex than any real show of respect for her mother. &quot;MOTHER! You sent my Dalton away? To do what?&quot;
