        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Cliche Japanese school setting
&gt;Sitting on my desk, leaning on my closed knuckles, I stifle a yawn
&gt;Class is boring as always, and waiting for it to end feels like a god damn eternity
&gt;Oh! There it is, the sweet sound of freedom, the bells signifying school is over for today
&gt;Everyone grabs their stuff, and make their merry way out of school
&gt;My friends ask me if I want to go out with them, but I refuse, saying there&#039;s something I must do in the school
&gt;They look at me like I just grew a second head
&gt;No wonder why they&#039;d do that, I hate school, I’m usually the first to get out when it ends
&gt;I just shoo them away, saying the principal asked me to stay to speak to him
&gt;After everyone from my class leaves, I wait for a few minutes before my real mission starts
&gt;Sliding my backpack onto my right shoulder, I can&#039;t help but let a small smirk grow on my face as I leave the classroom
&gt;It takes but a minute or two to get to the classroom on the other end of the hallway
&gt;On my way there, I grab a conveniently placed mop leaning against a wall just outside of a classroom
&gt;Reaching my destination, I take the mop and firmly place it on the sliding doors
&gt;I walk up to the second set of sliding doors, and slam them open
&gt;There she was, the only student staying behind for clean-up duty in her class
&gt;And my victim
&gt;A female dog anthro with shaggy light brown fur, wearing standard school uniform, but with a beige sweater over it
&gt;The small dog yelped in surprise, her upright ears flicking in my direction before setting her gaze on me
&gt;I see her cheeks light up with a faint rosy hue, before widening in realization
&gt;She stops arranging the desks back in their places, takes her briefcase, and slowly strafes her way to the opposite set of doors
&gt;And I just turn my eyes to meet her movements
&gt;She suddenly bolts to the doors and try to pry them open, but to her shock, they are stuck
&gt;She tries to yank it open, but the door didn’t budge
&gt;And how would it? I tampered with it
&gt;My smirk grows a little wider as I finally step into the classroom and slam the doors close
&gt;Her ears once again turn to be before she does, the look on her face showing clear indication of how frustrated and frightened she is at the moment
&gt;Her soft, fur covered fingers let go of the doors as she staggeringly steps back when I start making my way toward her
&gt;She had no escape, the door next to her was stuck, I was in the way of the second, and there is no way she is going to jump through the window from the second floor
&gt;She backs away from me until her back hits one of the four corners in the classroom
&gt;Her head turns to the side with a gasp to see the wall behind her, before turning back to me
&gt;And when she does, I’m already right next to her, towering her surprisingly petit frame for an anthro
&gt;I slam my right hand on the wall next to her head, making her flinch in response, and lean down until our foreheads almost touched
&gt;She glares at me through her thick rimmed glasses, holding her briefcase against her chest
“W-why do you doing this to me?”
&gt;She manages to stammer out, her soft voice barely concealing her frustration
“Why do you keep… going after me like this?”
&gt;The corner of her eyes tear up, and she holds her briefcase tighter against her chest
“What kind of sick person are you to find bullying fun?”
&gt;I raise an eyebrow at her implication
&gt;Moi? Being this much of a sicko to torment a girl for my own amusement?
&gt;I just like to see her squirming adorably under my presence
“You have some guts calling me sick, Mrs. Stalker”
&gt;I smirk as soon as I hear her gasp in shock
&gt;She looks directly into my eyes, her deep brown orbs trembling with nervousness
“You think I never noticed you watching me from far away?”
“All the times you spent your lunch breaks, all alone, following me, watching me”
“Or when I had PE class, and you’d watch me from your classroom window”
&gt;Her breathing got labored, and the pink hue from when I showed up, came back in full force
“I-I wasn-“
“Yes you were”
&gt;I interrupt her, touching my forehead against hers
&gt;Her ears press back against her head, and she looks down in embarrassment
“So, I decided to have some fun with your little… infatuation”
&gt;I lean back a bit, and flick her lightly on her moist little nose
&gt;She’s practically trying to merge with the wall with how much she leans against it
“I gotta say, the best part was, and still is when I first approached you, and you got all happy, even wagging your tail”
&gt;My words must feel like knifes to her, because she starts to tremble in response to my words, even if ever so slightly
“Did you actually believe you had a chance with a guy like me?”
&gt;She closes her eyes, her tears finally flowing down her furry cheeks
“See, this is why I do this, you’re so vulnerable, like a target just asking to be taken down”
&gt;My smirk comes back as I see her sliding down against the wall
&gt;But I don’t want to have to kneel down, so I hold her arm against the wall, and keep her standing
“You’re a m-monster…”
&gt;She just manages to stammer out, and I smirk back at her
”A monster you’re crushing on”
&gt;I feel her shivering while pinning her against the wall
“N-no…”
&gt;She shakes her head, denying my claims
“No, you say? Then why haven’t you warned the Principal yet, hmm?”
&gt;I lean down and get my lips close to her ears
“I can answer that for you”
&gt;I blow some hot air in her ears, making her shiver once again
”It’s because you still like me”
&gt;She starts whining back, just like feral dog
&gt;But her lack of response is pretty much the confirmation you need that you’re right
&gt;In fact she just stands there, doing nothing, like she just gave up
&gt;That’s not fun
“Tsk, Just look at you”
&gt;I click my tongue, as I give her a full head to toe appraisal
“With your tacky sweater”
&gt;She flinches when I pull the sleeve of her beige sweater
“Your unruly fur”
&gt;I run my hand through her neck, feeling her squirming under my touch
“Your flat chest”
&gt;She unconsciously holds her briefcase tighter against her chest
“And your dorky, thick rimmed glasses”
&gt;I flick her glasses’ rim, making it loosen its grip and slide down her muzzle
“You’re just a nerdy girl dreaming the impossible”
&gt;I lean down and face her, almost touching noses
&gt;I can feel her hot, labored breath hitting my skin
“And you wanna know what else?”
&gt;I roughly grab her by the chin and force her to look me straight in the eyes
&gt;By then she was already a wreck under you, her entire body rocked in sync with her loud sobs
&gt;And streams of tears flowed freely from her closed eyes, soaking the fur of her face
“I wouldn’t want you any other way”
&gt;I capture her soft lips with mine
&gt;Her eyes widen, her ears perk up, and her entire body freezes in shock
&gt;I don’t let go of her lips for a full minute
&gt;Only when she finally starts to reciprocate, that I let go of her
&gt;Resulting in an unconscious whine escaping her lips
&gt;I gently caress the soft underside of her chin
&gt;And touch foreheads with her one more time
&gt;Looking straight into her beautiful, brown eyes
