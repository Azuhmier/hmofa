        <textarea class="textarea">New Anon in Town [Canine; 1st Person Point of View, New Guy]; When everyone around town is so happy and nice, how is a dog girl supposed to get a cool guy like Anon?

&gt;Just another day of being the “tough bitch” in town
&gt;Every other fur and feather is so content with living out their assigned roles day after day
&gt;I didn’t use to be the grump, the sourpuss, the loner
&gt;But after a few bad days it became my “theme”, and even though I’m so testy in their eyes they act like it’s just a quaint little personality trait of mine
&gt;Now I can’t get rid of it even if I tried
&gt;It makes finding a mate around here pretty fucking hard as well
&gt;The other dogs are slobbering meatheads, and I don’t roll over just because they beg
&gt;The bears LOOK like they know a good time, but they’re just too soft for someone like me
&gt;The rabbits aren’t bad, if you’re into sissy little girlyboys
&gt;Hell, I’d play for the other team if most of the girls weren’t already paired off with their own type
&gt;So here I am, sulking in the shadows as the rest of the town is getting ready to welcome some new resident
&gt;”Anon”, he goes by
&gt;Gee, wonder what kind of walking character trope he’s going to b-
&gt;Holy shit, is that a human?
&gt;I thought humans were just some stupid marketing icons
&gt;Like, something advertisers made up because they’re so “neutral” looking for products
&gt;And yet here he is, walking around all furless and naive
&gt;There aren’t many things I need to ask for around here; either nobody stops me from taking something, or they’re such sickeningly sweet neighbors they just hand it over
&gt;But as this Anon guy is swamped by all the others waiting to greet him, I feel something I haven’t felt in a long time
&gt;Want
&gt;I want HIM

&gt;He’s visited at his remote little house for hours, well into the evening
&gt;It’s not easy waiting for all the others to leave him alone, but if I’m going to do this I don’t want to be interrupted
&gt;I also want to be the last one he thinks about before he goes to sleep
&gt;Luckily he’s still awake when I rap on his door
&gt;Dude barely comes up to my chest
&gt;I make sure he gets a good look at it first
&gt;Before I can introduce myself, he says my name
&gt;…How the hell?
&gt;Apparently all the others around town have been talking shit about me already
&gt;Needless to say, I’m pretty damn livid right now
&gt;If those gossiping busybodies already ruined this for me…
&gt;Anon doesn’t seem to know any better
&gt;He just heard about me just like any other fur around town, and he probably thinks I won’t bully him if he preemptively tries to be friendly
&gt;Well, BUDDY…
&gt;…It actually kind of works
&gt;I expected him to put up a fight, or show fear, or have him see me with the same stupid whimsy like the rest
&gt;I didn’t think he’d disarm me with kindness
&gt;I’m so dumbfounded by it I barely remember being invited into his home
&gt;Nothing I didn’t expect from a bachelor pad, but it doesn’t look like anyone else in town got as far as me in here yet
&gt;Now I’m sitting on his couch, and he’s spilling his life story
&gt;Where he comes from, why he’s here, what he hopes to accomplish…
&gt;I’m not necessarily tuning him out, but when I hear the word I snap into focus
&gt;”Friend”
&gt;He’s looking to make some friends, and I’m damn well going to be his favorite
&gt;But it’s already getting late, and the poor guy is pretty tired from the trip and from getting bombarded with welcomes all day
&gt;He asks if I‘d want to come back first thing in the morning to hang out some more
&gt;Yeah…sure thing
&gt;I actually find myself heading back to my place pretty briskly
&gt;Probably a good thing, because everything seems to be getting pretty foggy out all of the sudden
&gt;I head inside and see that familiar bitch in the mirror
&gt;Then I get a good look at my face, and my eyes, and I see why everything was so misty on the way back

&gt;I’m at his door before he’s even fully awake
&gt;Son of a bitch, tail. Stay still!
&gt;He doesn’t look bothered by my early arrival
&gt;Actually looks pretty excited to see me
&gt;I really hope I didn’t mess up and get stuck with some perpetually merry little ditz
&gt;He had the whole town come to him yesterday, so now he wants to see the rest of it for himself
&gt;Fine, whatever
&gt;I’m easily the best guide he’s going to get anyway, seeing as how I know all the paths and back alleys from avoiding those grinning dimwits every day
&gt;We go to the shops, the restaurants, the meeting places
&gt;He’s keen on mingling with the community, which is something I can’t say I’ve wanted much from these people
&gt;It’s kind of endearing for him, I guess
&gt;He’s a lot more personable than I am, and maybe I can actually stand to be around this place with him at my side
&gt;Just wish he’d hurry up so we can be alone together again
&gt;…Man, I’m terrible
&gt;I feel like a spoiled pup wanting him all for myself, and all he wants is just to belong here
&gt;He’s made more progress getting through to these people already then I ever could in years

&gt;He’s had a pretty long day, and by the evening he’s ready to settle in
&gt;I would have thought he’d be sick of me tagging along, but he’s full of surprises
&gt;Anon seriously wants me back into his home for a little while
&gt;Alright, a second chance
&gt;Don’t fuck this up!
&gt;He’s hospitable enough, though he seems just as nervous to be here as I am
&gt;I mean, not that I’m nervous around him
&gt;How did I even get to the couch again!?
&gt;We’re just chilling together, but this time it’s me who’s acting like an open book
&gt;I tell him about my part in the town’s little ecosystem
&gt;How I’m seen as the designated grouch
&gt;How I’m probably invited to all the gatherings out of obligation instead of genuine companionship
&gt;How I&#039;m so fucking lonely every single day…
&gt;There it is, girl. You’ve said too much to this guy you barely know
&gt;I’m sure it would feel good to finally get this all off my chest if I weren’t spending all my energy to not break down in front of him
&gt;My throat burns too much from holding it all in to say anything
&gt;And he’s just sitting there staring at me with pity
&gt;Do something!
&gt;And he does; just gets right to the point and pulls me in for a hug
&gt;Even though I dwarf the guy, I feel so small in his arms
&gt;I love how smooth he is, and how it feels to have his fingers comb through my fur
&gt;I dreaded this was going to be my breaking point, but everything about his company puts me at ease
&gt;I don’t need some kind of easy lay or piece of meat to make me happy here
&gt;I’d be fine just like this for as long as I can
&gt;He practically knows my whole history by this point, but he has none of the judgment or resentment I have for myself
&gt;I don&#039;t deserve a guy like this
&gt;But even when I try to pull away he just keeps holding on, sapping my resolve until I’m all but curled up into his chest
&gt;He’s got the magic touch, this one
&gt;Goddammit tail, we’re having a moment! 

&gt;Boy have I gotten to be a smug bitch
&gt;Anon and I go pretty much everywhere together
&gt;He’s got to be some kind of oddity, tolerating a dog like me
&gt;Not just tolerating, but borderline infatuated
&gt;I don’t plan on being modest about my good fortune, either
&gt;All the other furs and feathers around town are shocked by the two of us being a pair
&gt;Not to mention being blown away seeing me not be such a downer anymore
&gt;Plus, I’m not the only one who changed a bit
&gt;I managed to make a dent in their cheery little facades, showing hints of jealousy in their goofy eyes
&gt;I absolutely relish it
&gt;But Anon’s too cool a guy for that kind of pettiness, and I feel lucky to have him as my better half
&gt;He’s barely been here for long and he already made me the happiest girl out there
&gt;Now, this town doesn’t seem so bad
&gt;It helps that it feels like I have a fresh start here
&gt;A new lease on life
&gt;And I want Anon to be in it forever</textarea>
