It&#039;s a shame he died before he could see the way you treat my little Mako. He surely would have changed his mind about humans if he could&#039;ve seen your generosity.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were pretty much all she had left at the time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While browsing the internet one day, you happened to across the website for Anima City</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Their mission statement was to accept all beastmen who sought the freedom that they all desired</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;An idea popped into your head, and as much as it would hurt you to do it, you knew it would be the right move to make</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You went over to her house one day, and together you came up with the plan to get her to Anima City</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She refused at first, saying that she didn&#039;t want to leave you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a bit of persuading, she eventually accepted that her safety would be more important</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every detail of that plan was meticulously crafted</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Today, that plan has finally come to fruition</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Normally a beastman traveling alone to the city would encounter hunters trying to kill them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Traveling with a human has made the journey much easier than most go through</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thankfully, you&#039;ve haven&#039;t had any violent encounters with anyone yet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just in case, you brought your knife with you, which was a gift from your grandfather</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Despite her tough look, with her abs and all, Mako hated getting into conflict with others, which as a shark always struck you as odd, but I guess it&#039;s the media&#039;s fault that sharks are seen as evil killers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stand there, hand in hand, fingers gently pressed against each other, on the cliff outlooking Anima City</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mako turns to you and says &quot;So, this is it, huh. Our final goodbyes are coming soon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tears slowly begin to form around her Prussian blue eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look back at her and say &quot;This will all be worth it. Knowing that you are safe somewhere fills me with a happiness you couldn&#039;t possibly imagine.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You kiss her right as the sun begins to set over the water</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The orange hue fills your visions as you embrace yourselves</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s hurry up before it gets too dark. Once we reach the shore it&#039;s just a short swim away. You sure you can carry me over?&quot; You ask her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Pshh,&quot; she says as she nudges you gently. &quot;Of course I can. The water is my element. Even if I can&#039;t, I&#039;ll still push my self to see your gleaming eyes once more.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you slide down the cliff and reach the base of the hill</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mako&#039;s long hair flew behind her in the wind like the sail of a ship in the summer breeze</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At the bottom she nearly trips, but fortunately you were there to catch her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The feeling of holding on to her will be one of the many things you will miss</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&#039;This is the home stretch,&#039; you think</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re running towards the shore when you suddenly hear some rustling in the bushes behind you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Two young men come out, one shorter than the other</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The taller one had long brown hair tied in a ponytail</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A red and black bandana concealed the rest of his features</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The shorter one had short, spiky, brown hair, as well as a short beard of the same color</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He brandished metal pipe when he revealed himself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So, looks like we got a couple of beasties trying to escape to their little safe space, eh Ryoshi,&quot; the short one said</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Unfortunately, you came into contact with us,&quot; the taller one added. &quot;Round these parts us hunters bet on who can take out as many of you disgusting beasts per week. Seems we&#039;re just one short of winning this time. Getting the both of yous will certainly allow us to claim victory, right Torappu?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Look, you&#039;re making a mistake you see,&quot; you tell them as you bring out your student ID. &quot;I&#039;m actually a human. You have no reason to hurt us.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Normally just showing your ID would be enough to get past anyone suspicious</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What about the girl?&quot; questions Ryoshi</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&#039;Shit,&#039; you thought</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;W-well, it&#039;s right here,&quot; stutters Mako as she reaches for her bag. &quot;Huh, looks like I forgot it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Obviously she was faking it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hopefully it would be enough to fool them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ryoshi steps forward</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You take us as some sort of fools, huh? Of course you have your ID on you, or at least you did.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Torappu flashes her ID in front of her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You seemed to have dropped a little something when you were headed down that cliff there. Now, if I&#039;m reading this correctly, it does say &#039;Mako Selachi; Species: Beastman; Subspecies: Shark&#039;, right?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anger and fear fill both of you tremendously</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Suddenly, Mako morphs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her soft, pale skin turns into a slightly rough, greyish skin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A long, flowing tail erupts from her backside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her head expands, leaving plenty of room for her sharp teeth to take their place</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her abs are even more noticeable from underneath her crop top</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To top it all off, a small dorsal fin forms near the top of her back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Seems I did read that correctly,&quot; Ryoshi snarkily comments</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you are standing side by side, not wanting to separate</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;From this angle you could easily see how Mako is a bit taller than you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Torappu steps a bit forward. &quot;We may not get those two hits, but one is still enough to win the pool this week, so it&#039;ll do.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So we got a human helping out a beast escape. Tell me, boy, do you not have any pride in your own species? Helping out some animal like that, I can&#039;t fathom it,&quot; Ryoshi adds</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;She&#039;s not some animal!&quot; you shout. &quot;She&#039;s the love of my life! I&#039;m doing anything in my power to make sure she can live the safe life we all desire!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh, so you&#039;re one of those people, huh? Rejecting your humanity to be with some filthy animal.

A BNA inspired Story
By HierophantHerp

&gt;You look up and you can see your destination:
&gt;Anima City
&gt;The safe haven of beastmen, an entire city dedicated to them to avoid the growing conflicts between them and humans
&gt;It was founded 10 years ago by Barbary Rose, a beastman geneticist turned politician, and Shiramizu Sori, the current Prime Minister of Japan
&gt;But you aren&#039;t going there for yourself, you&#039;re going there for your girlfriend, a shark beastman
&gt;Her name is Mako Selachi
&gt;The two of you had been friends for most of your lives, living in the town of Kuwana
&gt;Before you even started &quot;dating&quot; you would always hang out and go to the local amusement park, play video games at your house, or just grab a quick bite to eat somewhere in town
&gt;The memory of the day you asked her out still lives on vividly in your mind
&gt;It wasn&#039;t until much recently, when DNA exams became mandatory for students, did you actually learn that she was a beastman
&gt;She thought you would hate her for who she was, but you still loved her the same
&gt;Unfortunately, the same could not be said for the rest of your school
&gt;Human-beast relationships are heavily looked down upon, and even though you were a human, you were still bullied and called a traitor to your kind
&gt;You didn&#039;t care, you loved her
&gt;None of the people who were your friends who hated beastmen directly started bullying you, but you could definitely feel the distance between you growing
&gt;Your friends who still stayed by your side you cherished almost as much as you did Mako
&gt;Fortunately, your parents didn&#039;t seem to mind that you were dating a beastman
&gt;Things were much worse for Mako
&gt;Not only were friendships severed but the staff too
&gt;School teachers technically aren&#039;t allowed to show animosity towards beastmen, but the tension could still easily be felt towards her
&gt;Your cool and based biology teacher was the only one who showed any sort of compassion towards her
&gt;Thank you, Mr. Besu
&gt;Many of the beastmen who you two were friends with ended up moving away, most likely to Anima City
&gt;Eventually she stopped showing up to school altogether
&gt;Mako had already been living alone for a bit now
&gt;Her father died when she was young due to a nasty car accident, and he always had a hatred for humans
&gt;Her mother adored your kindness, but recently died due to heart complications, and partially because of a lack of information on how to treat beasts at the local hospital
&gt;You remember her mother one time telling you, &quot;He despised humans and thought all of them were evil. It&#039;s a shame he died before he could see the way you treat my little Mako. He surely would have changed his mind about humans if he could&#039;ve seen your generosity.&quot;
&gt;You were pretty much all she had left at the time
&gt;While browsing the internet one day, you happened to across the website for Anima City
&gt;Their mission statement was to accept all beastmen who sought the freedom that they all desired
&gt;An idea popped into your head, and as much as it would hurt you to do it, you knew it would be the right move to make
&gt;You went over to her house one day, and together you came up with the plan to get her to Anima City
&gt;She refused at first, saying that she didn&#039;t want to leave you
&gt;After a bit of persuading, she eventually accepted that her safety would be more important
&gt;Every detail of that plan was meticulously crafted
&gt;Today, that plan has finally come to fruition
&gt;Normally a beastman traveling alone to the city would encounter hunters trying to kill them
&gt;Traveling with a human has made the journey much easier than most go through
&gt;Thankfully, you&#039;ve haven&#039;t had any violent encounters with anyone yet
&gt;Just in case, you brought your knife with you, which was a gift from your grandfather
&gt;Despite her tough look, with her abs and all, Mako hated getting into conflict with others, which as a shark always struck you as odd, but I guess it&#039;s the media&#039;s fault that sharks are seen as evil killers
&gt;You stand there, hand in hand, fingers gently pressed against each other, on the cliff outlooking Anima City
&gt;Mako turns to you and says &quot;So, this is it, huh. Our final goodbyes are coming soon.&quot;
&gt;Tears slowly begin to form around her Prussian blue eyes
&gt;You look back at her and say &quot;This will all be worth it. Knowing that you are safe somewhere fills me with a happiness you couldn&#039;t possibly imagine.&quot;
&gt;You kiss her right as the sun begins to set over the water
&gt;The orange hue fills your visions as you embrace yourselves
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s hurry up before it gets too dark. Once we reach the shore it&#039;s just a short swim away. You sure you can carry me over?&quot; You ask her
&gt;&quot;Pshh,&quot; she says as she nudges you gently. &quot;Of course I can. The water is my element. Even if I can&#039;t, I&#039;ll still push my self to see your gleaming eyes once more.&quot;
&gt;The two of you slide down the cliff and reach the base of the hill
&gt;Mako&#039;s long hair flew behind her in the wind like the sail of a ship in the summer breeze
&gt;At the bottom she nearly trips, but fortunately you were there to catch her
&gt;The feeling of holding on to her will be one of the many things you will miss
&gt;&#039;This is the home stretch,&#039; you think
&gt;You&#039;re running towards the shore when you suddenly hear some rustling in the bushes behind you
&gt;Two young men come out, one shorter than the other
&gt;The taller one had long brown hair tied in a ponytail
&gt;A red and black bandana concealed the rest of his features
&gt;The shorter one had short, spiky, brown hair, as well as a short beard of the same color
&gt;He brandished metal pipe when he revealed himself
&gt;&quot;So, looks like we got a couple of beasties trying to escape to their little safe space, eh Ryoshi,&quot; the short one said
&gt;&quot;Unfortunately, you came into contact with us,&quot; the taller one added. &quot;Round these parts us hunters bet on who can take out as many of you disgusting beasts per week. Seems we&#039;re just one short of winning this time. Getting the both of yous will certainly allow us to claim victory, right Torappu?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Look, you&#039;re making a mistake you see,&quot; you tell them as you bring out your student ID. &quot;I&#039;m actually a human. You have no reason to hurt us.&quot;
&gt;Normally just showing your ID would be enough to get past anyone suspicious
&gt;&quot;What about the girl?&quot; questions Ryoshi
&gt;&#039;Shit,&#039; you thought
&gt;&quot;W-well, it&#039;s right here,&quot; stutters Mako as she reaches for her bag. &quot;Huh, looks like I forgot it.&quot;
&gt;Obviously she was faking it
&gt;Hopefully it would be enough to fool them
&gt;Ryoshi steps forward
&gt;&quot;You take us as some sort of fools, huh? Of course you have your ID on you, or at least you did.&quot;
&gt;Torappu flashes her ID in front of her
&gt;&quot;You seemed to have dropped a little something when you were headed down that cliff there. Now, if I&#039;m reading this correctly, it does say &#039;Mako Selachi; Species: Beastman; Subspecies: Shark&#039;, right?&quot;
&gt;Anger and fear fill both of you tremendously
&gt;Suddenly, Mako morphs
&gt;Her soft, pale skin turns into a slightly rough, greyish skin
&gt;A long, flowing tail erupts from her backside
&gt;Her head expands, leaving plenty of room for her sharp teeth to take their place
&gt;Her abs are even more noticeable from underneath her crop top
&gt;To top it all off, a small dorsal fin forms near the top of her back
&gt;&quot;Seems I did read that correctly,&quot; Ryoshi snarkily comments
&gt;The two of you are standing side by side, not wanting to separate
&gt;From this angle you could easily see how Mako is a bit taller than you
&gt;Torappu steps a bit forward. &quot;We may not get those two hits, but one is still enough to win the pool this week, so it&#039;ll do.&quot;
&gt;&quot;So we got a human helping out a beast escape. Tell me, boy, do you not have any pride in your own species? Helping out some animal like that, I can&#039;t fathom it,&quot; Ryoshi adds
&gt;&quot;She&#039;s not some animal!&quot; you shout. &quot;She&#039;s the love of my life! I&#039;m doing anything in my power to make sure she can live the safe life we all desire!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh, so you&#039;re one of those people, huh? Rejecting your humanity to be with some filthy animal. You&#039;re no better than them!&quot; Ryoshi snaps back
&gt;He briefly lowers his bandana, which reveals a sharp jawline, to spit on the ground, before lifting it back up
&gt;&quot;She may not be human, but she has infinitely more humanity than both of you combined!&quot; you yell back in her defense
&gt;The two hunters charge at you; Torappu to you and Ryoshi to Mako
&gt;He socks you right in the face, but you quickly recover
&gt;He proceeds to swing at you with his pipe as you fumble around your pockets searching for something
&gt;After many near misses, you finally pull out your butterfly knife
&gt;You take a few stabs at him, but they all barely miss
&gt;You look over your shoulder to see how Mako is doing
&gt;&quot;This is the first time I&#039;ve encountered a shark here. Guess there&#039;s a first time for everything,&quot; Ryoshi remarks as he cracks his knuckles
&gt;In the heat of the moment, those cracks sounded like they were as loud as supernovas
&gt;&quot;Please, I don&#039;t like hurting people,&quot; she pleads
&gt;&quot;With those big teeth you got there I surely doubt it&quot;
&gt;Ryoshi takes a few swings at her, but they miss
&gt;He throws one last punch at her, and it&#039;s a direct hit
&gt;She briefly screams in pain as she falls down
&gt;You look at her with terrified eyes
&gt;While you&#039;re not looking, Torappu takes a swing and knocks the wind out of you
&gt;Out of sheer will to survive, you are able to get up while out of breath and take a slash at your attacker
&gt;This time, you hit
&gt;Drips of blood add a stark contrast to his white shirt
&gt;You had heard rumors of sharks being invigorated by the smell of blood, but you had no idea that the same was the same for shark beastmen
&gt;A glow of raw anger emerges from Mako&#039;s eyes
&gt;&quot;You would hurt your own kind, yet you claim to have the moral high ground here,&quot; Mako remarks as determination and adrenaline rushes through her body
&gt;Ryoshi tries to throw a punch at her
&gt;Unfortunately for him, she intercepts it with a mighty snap of her jaws
&gt;While Torappu was distracted with watching his friend in pain, you swiftly kick at his legs, causing him to fall over and bang his head on a rock, knocking him out
&gt;Mako releases Kyoshi&#039;s hand as a waterfall of blood gushes out
&gt;She didn&#039;t bite him hard enough to cut off his hand, but just enough to send the message not to fuck with them
&gt;She gives him a final blow to head, knocking him out as well
&gt;You look at her, nod your heads, then run off away from the scene
&gt;As you run, she morphs back into her human form and grabs her stolen ID
&gt;The two of you make your way across the shoreline to a spot closer to the shore of Anima City
&gt;It was now dark out, and the moon shined valiantly in its reflection on the water
&gt;You could see some of the city&#039;s skyscrapers shining in the distance
&gt;The Medi-Cen was undergoing a bit of construction
&gt;Apparently there was recently a bombing there
&gt;You two sit next to each other on the rocks to recoup
&gt;Mako&#039;s head rests on top of yours on account of her being taller, even in her human form
&gt;Your fingers are intertwined with her&#039;s
&gt;Her dark silver hair accidentally gets in your face, so you move it out of the way
&gt;Your last time gazing at the moon together; you don&#039;t want to miss it
&gt;The two of you kiss for what seems like an eternity
&gt;The memories of the past you shared together come flooding back
&gt;The first time you rode Steel Dragon 2000 together
&gt;Apparently she accidentally morphed next to you out of excitement then, but you were busy being terrified of the coaster to even notice, so her secret ended up being kept for longer
&gt;Your first real date together
&gt;You took her out to the most expensive restaurant a minimum wage high school student could afford
&gt;She got really upset that they served shark fins then, but you didn&#039;t seem to understand exactly why
&gt;The day she told you she was a beastman
&gt;You were at her house, sitting on her waterbed
&gt;She formally morphed in front of you for the first time and said &quot;This is who I am. I won&#039;t be mad if you hate me for lying to you.&quot;
&gt;You just got up and kissed her
&gt;You accidentally cut your tongue on her sharp teeth, but you didn&#039;t let that ruin the moment
&gt;You could feel her shark tail caressing the sides of your legs out of pure happiness
&gt;Everything you did together was rushing back to you until you eventually returned to the present
&gt;Her lips leave yours, and she begins talking softly
&gt;&quot;Promise me, you&#039;ll find some way to visit me in the city&quot;
&gt;&quot;I promise,&quot; you softly respond
&gt;Once you too calmed down enough you both walk down into the water
&gt;Mako morphs again and dives into the water
&gt;It was like being in the water was a way of reinvigorating her
&gt;&quot;You sure you can do this?&quot; you ask her just in case. &quot;I hear there are beastmen that offer transport to those seeking refuge.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I hear some shady weasel runs that,&quot; Mako responds. &quot;Trust me, I can swim all the way there. I won&#039;t get tired or anything. As long as I keep my mouth open while swimming, water will get pushed into me and I can continue to breathe easily.&quot;
&gt;You had no idea that ram ventilation applied to shark beastmen as well
&gt;Even in your final moments you continue to learn more and more about her
&gt;You nod and jump in the water with her
&gt;She playfully splashes you as you climb onto her back
&gt;You make quick haste to the other side as the cold water occasionally splashes back up at you
&gt;Once again, her hair flows in the wind
&gt;After a few minutes, you made to Anima City
&gt;You let her take the first steps onto land; it was her life that was about to change after all
&gt;Mako was finally safe
&gt;Unfortunately, the uncertainty now shifted to you
&gt;Humans are not allowed to enter the city unless they are given special permission by Mayor Rose herself
&gt;Beastman came to this city to get away from humans, who knows how they may react to one trespassing into their city
&gt;The two of you considered saying goodbye before crossing over to the peninsula, but you insisted on seeing her in her new life in the city, no matter the risks
&gt;Mako seemed to be one step ahead of you though
&gt;She proceeded to give you a giant hug that completely encased you
&gt;At this point in the relationship you didn&#039;t mind the scent of seawater
&gt;You could feel her slightly raise you up a few inches
&gt;&quot;There,&quot; she said warmly, &quot;now your human scent won&#039;t be as noticeable.&quot;
&gt;She morphed back and the two of you went to a nearby map to find the place known as the Beastman Co-op
&gt;Apparently that&#039;s where she could get more information on living in the city
&gt;The two of you headed out towards her final destination
&gt;It wasn&#039;t terribly late out yet, so there were still people hanging around outside
&gt;As you two walked the streets while holding hands, the beastman citizen gave no second thoughts to your presence
&gt;&#039;Kind of ironic,&#039; you thought. &#039;For years beastmen have been hiding from humans. Now it&#039;s the other way around&#039;
&gt;Eventually you found the Co-op building
&gt;At the same time, a couple was walking to the door of the building
&gt;&quot;Oh, are you here for information regarding the city?&quot; the man with red hair asked. &quot;Sorry but we&#039;re closed at this time.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Gem don&#039;t be like that,&quot; the woman with auburn hair said. &quot;These two look like they just swam over here for safety. C&#039;mon, we can make an exception for them. Come inside now, we can fill you in on what you might need.&quot;
&gt;You follow them inside up some stairs into a small lounge area
&gt;You all sit down while the man brings over some papers and pamphlets
&gt;He hands you and Mako papers and proceeds to talk
&gt;&quot;Allow us to formally introduce ourselves. I&#039;m Gem...&quot;
&gt;&quot;...and I&#039;m Melissa.&quot;
&gt;&quot;We run the Beastman Co-op here to provide social services to citizens, and citizens to be, of Anima City. It looks like the two of you are in need of information on how to apply for residency. Don&#039;t worry, we can give you everything you need to get you ready for tomorrow. The offices are closed at this hour but will be open tomorrow, so don&#039;t worry you too.&quot;
&gt;&quot;We can also offer temporary housing until you two can find your own place.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You sure Melissa? We&#039;re already taking care of that girl, we&#039;re slowly running out of space here.&quot;
&gt;&quot;No, no, it&#039;s perfectly fine.&quot;
&gt;You worriedly look at Mako
&gt;You&#039;re going to have to tell them soon that you are human
&gt;Mako decides to be the one to break the news to them
&gt;&quot;You see, only one of us will be moving to the city.&quot;
&gt;The two look at you two confused
&gt;&quot;My lover here, he&#039;s...a human. We&#039;ve been dating for a few years now. I wanted to seek safety in Anima City after people found out I was a beastman, and he&#039;s done everything in his power to make sure I got here safely. He&#039;s not here to hurt any of your residents.&quot;
&gt;You decide to chime in
&gt;&quot;I am deeply sorry if me coming here has offended you in any way. I know this is supposed to be a special city for you beastmen, but I wanted to make sure that the love of my life could make it here and reach the life and acceptance she has desired for so long.&quot;
&gt;Gem and Melissa just look at you for a bit
&gt;You knew it, they hated you
&gt;You were going to get arrested, or even killed for trespassing the Beastman Special Zone
&gt;Mellisa decides breaks the silence
&gt;&quot;Love is a powerful thing, we would know. Someone who would risk their life to ensure the safety of the one they love the most won&#039;t receive any hate from us.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Be glad Shirou isn&#039;t here,&quot; remarks Gem. &quot;If he smelt your human scent he would have beat the crap out of you!&quot;
&gt;Good thing I missed him
&gt;&quot;We can help you leave the city unharmed,&quot; stated Mellisa. &quot;If you got to the docks, look for a mink named &#039;Marie&#039;. If you tell her Gem and Melissa sent you, you should be able to get across easily.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Just make sure you keep track of your money,&quot; added Gem.
&gt;&quot;Thank you so much,&quot; you and Mako say simultaneously and nod
&gt;The two of you head outside to say your final goodbyes
&gt;For what may be the final time in months, possibly even years, the two of you kiss
&gt;Once again, the memories of your past together come flooding back
&gt;You try to make this kiss last as possible
&gt;You try to squeeze the most out of this moment with her
&gt;Her arms wrapped around you fill you with enough warmth to make the sun look frozen
&gt;The taste of her kiss reminds you of home
&gt;As the stars above dance with the moon as their spotlight, you release your lips from each other
&gt;You both faintly say &quot;goodbye&quot; as tears descend upon your faces
&gt;You slowly begin walking backward, not wanting to break your gaze on her for as long as possible
&gt;Once she was out of your sight you heard the sound of a door closing
&gt;She was gone now

~ ~ ~

&gt;A few months have passed since the day you last saw Mako
&gt;You have tried calling her, but the city instated firewall had made it difficult
&gt;Not much news is ever relayed from the city, probably to be some sort of independence from the human and beastman world, so you are constantly on edge of whether she is safe or not
&gt;However, you do hear the news of Sylvasta Pharmaceuticals being behind a plot to wipe out the beastman population, but is thwarted
&gt;You pray that she was not harmed in any way in the attack
&gt;Your friends that don&#039;t hate beastmen constantly ask you questions about your experience
&gt;Questions such as what was the city like, did you get into any fights with hunters, or the one that got asked way too frequently: was sex with her weird?
&gt;Unfortunately, you could not answer that last one
&gt;A few days later, you hear what was possibly the greatest news you&#039;ve ever heard
&gt;Mayor Rose decided to open the city up to human tourists in an effort to build a bridge between the valley of differences between the two species
&gt;As quickly as possible, you back your bags to make your second trip to Anima City
&gt;You can finally return to the love of your life
&gt;Mako
