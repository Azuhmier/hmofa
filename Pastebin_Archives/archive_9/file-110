        <div class="source" style=" ">
            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It started as a passing thought, harmless really.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were sitting in your living room, enjoying a little TV after work, when it happened.  The thought, that is.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A fleeting image of a clearing in the woods.  As vivid as if you were there yourself.  And yet, despite its clarity, the vision vanished as quickly as it arrived.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You recognized those woods, vaguely, from your childhood.  Your grandfather often took you there when you were young, off to hunt.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were always a good shot, he said.  Never missed a single deer, no matter how your hands shook.  It wasn&#039;t until later that you realized the old man was the one shooting; the guns he lent you were loaded with naught but blanks.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even so, you loved those trips.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Perhaps these memories are why you saw that old clearing so well?  But mere memories could never explain the later visions.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a week of random, fleeting impressions of the woods, then came the more... worrying thoughts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A voice, gently needling you to come visit those well-worn paths again.  To wander the forest as you once did.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To... join the speaker, there in the wilderness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The visions changed.  In the center of the clearing stood a figure, too dark to make out.  Despite this, it filled you with fear... and intrigue.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After musing on it for a month, you obeyed the voice&#039;s insistence and trekked off to the woods, axe and survival supplies at hand.  You had planned to hunt once more, but something told you that bringing your rifle would be disastrous.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The woods have changed since you came last.  The paths are darker, less traveled.  The undergrowth teems with insects, the trees&#039; skin practically crawling.  Where birds once sang, now only the wind whispers a lamenting, wordless dirge.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Despite having spent years away from this haven of nature, your feet still remember the way.  It&#039;s only minutes before you reach the clearing, looking just as it did in the visions.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You remember fondly how many bucks your old man downed in this very field.  And yet, not so much as a hoofprint is to be seen here today.  It almost unnerves you, really, to see this once lively place so silent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a sigh, you take a seat on a moldering log.  You cast a mournful eye over the clearing, feeling the fall air hesitantly caress your face.  Dead leaves waft through the air sorrowfully.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For some reason, you feel as though it isn&#039;t supposed to be this way.  As though these woods should be much more vibrant, more lively.  After all, wasn&#039;t it always bustling when your grandfather brought you here...?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You rub your temples, feeling a faint headache coming on.  The rustle of leaves tickles your ears, almost masking a sound that sends a deathly shiver down your spine:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That same voice, from your visions.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Indeed, the deep, almost echoing voice, speaks softly, unmistakably coming from the brush behind you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Thank you for joining me here...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You leap from the log and spin around, brandishing your axe.  A low chuckle sounds from the thicket ahead.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;My my.  What precisely do you believe that weapon will do for you?  You need it not.  Cast it down, there, on the ground.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Confused, you tighten your grip on your axe.  The voice, once calm and detached, suddenly intensifies in tone immensely, becoming a harsh, gravelly whisper that seems to ring inside your very skull.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;CAST IT DOWN.  NOW.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You see a momentary flash of static across your view, and you drop the axe in a panic.  The voice instantly returns to its soft, almost soothing tone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;That&#039;s it.  Good.  You are an excellent listener, hmhmhm.  I knew you would be a wise choice...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can&#039;t help but blurt out:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Choice?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There&#039;s another smooth chuckle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yes, choice.  You were contacted, if you recall, roughly a month ago.  I trust you saw my message?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;The visions?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ah, yes.  A rather elegant term for a rather complicated method of contact, I suppose.  I can only assume you saw them, and that is what brought you here.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;That&#039;s right... who are you?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hmhmhm.  My my.  Inquisitive, are we?  My name is not important to you, nor the task I have for you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Task?  What are you talking about?  Stop talking in riddles and explain yourself!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your blood runs cold as a vicious snarl answers your outburst.  The voice again speaks in that harsh tone, directly within the boundaries of your skull.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;LISTEN TO ME, CHILD.  QUESTION ME NOT.  YOUR ANSWERS WILL COME WHEN I DEEM IT TIME.  NO SOONER.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Each word is accompanied by a distortion of your vision.  For a fleeting moment, you swear you see that shadowy figure from your visions, standing in the brush.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There&#039;s a rustling from within the tangled thicket, and you follow your instincts, breaking into a full sprint.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You run from the clearing, getting as much distance between you and the dark figure as possible.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That eerily serene voice continues to speak, sounding very much as if it were coming from directly behind you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Why do you run, boy?  I seek not to harm you.  I merely require of you one task.  I see it, in your mind: your love for these woods.  Do you not wish to bring them back to their former luster?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your mind races as you continue to run.  The voice never wavers in tone, but your vision slowly grows full of static.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually, you can no longer see to run safely.  You reluctantly stop your mad dash, catching your breath as quiet footsteps come to a halt behind you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Turn and face me.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your brain screams no, but your body betrays you.  With a painfully slow movement, you turn to see your pursuer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Standing before you, looking down, is a tall figure, wrapped in a billowing black cloak.  Atop the figure&#039;s neck rests the head of a deer, antlers glinting in the dappled sunlight filtering through the trees.  Eerie white pupils glow from within black eyes, staring into your very being.  A mouthful of jagged fangs juts from the otherwise normal snout of the deer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The figure stares silently for a moment, blinking slowly, breathing heavily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then, it... smiles?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Something vaguely approximating a grin crosses its furry face as it stares down at you.  You shudder at the sight of its myriad, daggerlike fangs.  It seems to notice your apprehension, and returns to a neutral expression.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hm.  I had thought you humans used such expressions for amicable discussions.  I suppose that is not the case after all.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The voice almost carries a tone of fascination.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The deer creature awkwardly stares at you, unblinking, as the wind blows through its wiry brown fur.  It clears it&#039;s throat, then speaks again.  Those fangs still frighten you, but it shows no signs of aggression yet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I suppose you must be curious as to why I summoned you, yes?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod slowly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ah, as I thought.  You see, Joseph-&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your heart skips a beat as the creature uses your birth name.  It chuckles at your shocked expression.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ah, hmhmhm.  How foolish of me, I nearly forgot you humans are not privy to the minds of others.  But, I digress.  Joseph, surely you have noticed the state of this forest.  The trees grow weary.  The insects claim more turf every day.  My children dare not walk these paths anymore, and those that do oft meet their ends at the hands of hunters like your grandfather.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Your...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yes, my children.  The deer.  Your people have not been kind to our home.  But, again, I digress.  I ask of you but one task: to help me restore this land to its former glory.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...how?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I need but two things, Joseph.  Your presence, and your consenting mind.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You step away from the looming figure, who regards you with a neutral gaze.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What do you need from me exactly?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To your shock, the figure sighs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;My children, they need more than one parental figure in their lives.  Joseph, they need... a father.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;A- I thought- you...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The figure chuckles once again, that disturbing &quot;smile&quot; resurfacing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You thought me a male, I suppose?  Not an uncommon misconception.  But, &#039;tis a mistake nonetheless.  I am the mother of this forest&#039;s deer, and they are my children.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re certain that confusion is plastered on your face, judging by the deer&#039;s bemused expression.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hm.  I had heard that humans perform better with a visual aid.  Perhaps...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The woman casts off her cloak gently.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Without the obscuring garment, her femininity is undeniable. A modestly sized bust rests below her fanged smile, and wide, motherly hips make themselves known below that.  Between them, however, is something rather concerning.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her waist appears to be a twisted, gnarled mess not unlike an old, rotten tree.  This malformed midriff abruptly flares up into visible ribs above, and perfectly healthy legs below.  Alongside this, her arms seem to fall somewhere between bone and timber in form, yet also bear soft brown fur.  In fact, her whole form does still bear the typical fur of a deer, no matter how twisted her flesh seems.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The deer woman smiles again, and you swear you see a faint reddish flush appear on the bare skin of her ears. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Does this convince you?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Distracted a bit by her remarkably humanoid form, you vacantly nod.  She chuckles and gently pulls her cloak back on.  A fleeting wave of disappointment washes over you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Okay... but what do you need ME to do?  You said they need a father...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hmhmhm, I can sense a mounting concern within your mind.  I do not require your services for mating.  Rather, I merely seek... a husband, I believe your type calls them.  Yes.  Someone to spend my days with, someone to help me watch over this forest and my wonderful children.  Someone who shares my love for these woods.  Joseph, I believe you are capable of providing all this, yes?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stammer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Y-yes, but-&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Excellent.  Then consider it done.  Joseph, from this day forward, you shall be the King of this forest, and I your Queen.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sighs happily, almost sounding relieved.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ah.  It is nice to have that burden off my shoulders.  Thank you for heeding my call.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;B-but...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She tilts her head unnaturally far to one side.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hm?  Is something the matter, my dear?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Y-you just met me, how can you love me enough to want me to be your king?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Love...?  Hm.  I must admit, I had not considered that matter.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel her eyes burning into your soul.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Joseph, do you love me?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You find yourself choked if answers, and soon feel a disturbing sensation, as if a soft, furred hand were rooting about within your brain.  Her eyes narrow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...I see.  I suppose that is to be expected.  You humans have a rather different approach to this sort of thing.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks genuinely thoughtful for a moment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Joseph. Can you... teach me?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Teach you what?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;How to make you love me. How to... romance, I believe the term is.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You want me to show you how romance works?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods, smiling.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You soon find yourself sitting in the midst of the clearing, next to the deer queen.  She serenely surveys her surroundings with a smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Is it not beautiful, my dear?  Our love will only make it more beautiful.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well, it isn&#039;t quite love yet.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks earnestly confused.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Truly?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Not yet.  Love happens over time.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ah.  How much time?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anywhere from first sight to months down the line.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her eyes narrow slightly, and you worry she may be getting impatient with you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...very well.  I will do whatever is required of me to earn your love.  For my children, my forest.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;If you&#039;re serious about this, I&#039;ll put my heart into it as well.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles again, gently placing a bony hand on your shoulder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...is this alright?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod, and she places her other hand on your other shoulder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What shall I do now?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uhh... well, we could just sit here and admire the beauty of the woods?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her eyes practically light up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ah, my favorite pastime.  Shall I tell you of the tales these trees whisper?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Over the next few hours, she regales you with stories of the forest&#039;s rich history.  She tells of battles fought within the darkened paths.  Of adventurers lost among the undergrowth.  Of the many magnificent creatures to roam this place.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As she speaks, you find yourself subconsciously drifting closer to her.  By the end of her stories, your arms are wrapped around her middle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually, night falls.  You yawn, and she frowns.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Mm?  I suppose you need sleep, yes?  I have a place for you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Huh?  It&#039;s fine, I can go home and come back tomorrow.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh... I had rather hoped you might consider these woods your home.  Though, I suppose that is to be expected.  Go to your home, my dear.  I shall be waiting for you in the morn.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The deer queen rises slowly, and strides off into the woods, vanishing.  You gather your things, then head home, where you soon fall asleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You awaken to the sound of a doe bleating below your window.  You glance outside, and aren&#039;t shocked to see the deer queen standing behind your home.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her voice echoes within your head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Good morning, Joseph, my dear.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Good morning.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quickly get dressed and make your way down to her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What shall we do today?  More romance?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;If that&#039;s what you want to do.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods eagerly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I desire to earn your love, my dear, and I shall endeavor to do so.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She hugs you stiffly, mimicking the action as you demonstrated to her last night.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...is that correct?  I worry that I may not have done that correctly.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You&#039;re fine, I promise.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles as you lead her back to the clearing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Today, there IS something else here: a small, tattered picnic basket.  The deer queen again flushes in her ears.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I... heard that humans sometimes share food in this manner when seeking a mate.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You carefully open the basket to find a carefully packed selection of various fruits and other edibles from the woods.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I trust these are safe for humans?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...yes, actually.  Good work.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her ears grow redder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anything for you, my dear.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You heart swells with affection for the deer queen, if only for a moment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;An hour passes.  You and your companion have finished the contents of the basket.  She gently rubs her twisted midsection with a happy sigh.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;My my.  That was a pleasant meal.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It was pretty nice, yeah.  Thank you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You are most welcome, my dear.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She tilts her head slightly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;May I ask... is it love now?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You chuckle warmly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Not yet, sorry.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She waves a bony hand dismissively.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Then I shall romance with you every day until it becomes love.  I am a patient woman.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;And what if it never works out?  What if we don&#039;t fall in love?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Then... I shall exit your life.  If you do not love me, I shall not force myself upon you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...thank you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She hugs you once again, this time less stiffly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Weeks pass.  Every day, the queen meets you outside your home.  She&#039;s lately began bringing small gifts, be they turkey feathers or unusual stones.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ve saved each and every one of them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Today, you again follow her to the clearing, as always.  Once there, you sit down, motioning for her to join you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What shall we do today, my dear?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Actually, I wanted to tell you something.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She frowns slightly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yes?  Is something the matter?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shake your head and smile.  You embrace her tightly, wrapping you arms around her thin middle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Not at all.  I just wanted to say... I love you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your queen smiles lovingly, gently hugging you in return.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;And I love you, my King.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you embrace your newfound love, you could swear the forest looks just a tad greener, a bit more lively.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You love it.</div></li></ol>        </div>

            RAW Paste Data        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;It started as a passing thought, harmless really.
&gt;You were sitting in your living room, enjoying a little TV after work, when it happened.  The thought, that is.
&gt;A fleeting image of a clearing in the woods.  As vivid as if you were there yourself.  And yet, despite its clarity, the vision vanished as quickly as it arrived.
&gt;You recognized those woods, vaguely, from your childhood.  Your grandfather often took you there when you were young, off to hunt.
&gt;You were always a good shot, he said.  Never missed a single deer, no matter how your hands shook.  It wasn&#039;t until later that you realized the old man was the one shooting; the guns he lent you were loaded with naught but blanks.
&gt;Even so, you loved those trips.
&gt;Perhaps these memories are why you saw that old clearing so well?  But mere memories could never explain the later visions.
&gt;After a week of random, fleeting impressions of the woods, then came the more... worrying thoughts.
&gt;A voice, gently needling you to come visit those well-worn paths again.  To wander the forest as you once did.
&gt;To... join the speaker, there in the wilderness.
&gt;The visions changed.  In the center of the clearing stood a figure, too dark to make out.  Despite this, it filled you with fear... and intrigue.
&gt;After musing on it for a month, you obeyed the voice&#039;s insistence and trekked off to the woods, axe and survival supplies at hand.  You had planned to hunt once more, but something told you that bringing your rifle would be disastrous.

&gt;The woods have changed since you came last.  The paths are darker, less traveled.  The undergrowth teems with insects, the trees&#039; skin practically crawling.  Where birds once sang, now only the wind whispers a lamenting, wordless dirge.
&gt;Despite having spent years away from this haven of nature, your feet still remember the way.  It&#039;s only minutes before you reach the clearing, looking just as it did in the visions.
&gt;You remember fondly how many bucks your old man downed in this very field.  And yet, not so much as a hoofprint is to be seen here today.  It almost unnerves you, really, to see this once lively place so silent.
&gt;With a sigh, you take a seat on a moldering log.  You cast a mournful eye over the clearing, feeling the fall air hesitantly caress your face.  Dead leaves waft through the air sorrowfully.
&gt;For some reason, you feel as though it isn&#039;t supposed to be this way.  As though these woods should be much more vibrant, more lively.  After all, wasn&#039;t it always bustling when your grandfather brought you here...?
&gt;You rub your temples, feeling a faint headache coming on.  The rustle of leaves tickles your ears, almost masking a sound that sends a deathly shiver down your spine:
&gt;That same voice, from your visions.

&gt;Indeed, the deep, almost echoing voice, speaks softly, unmistakably coming from the brush behind you.
&gt;&quot;Thank you for joining me here...&quot;
&gt;You leap from the log and spin around, brandishing your axe.  A low chuckle sounds from the thicket ahead.
&gt;&quot;My my.  What precisely do you believe that weapon will do for you?  You need it not.  Cast it down, there, on the ground.&quot;
&gt;Confused, you tighten your grip on your axe.  The voice, once calm and detached, suddenly intensifies in tone immensely, becoming a harsh, gravelly whisper that seems to ring inside your very skull.
&gt;&quot;CAST IT DOWN.  NOW.&quot;
&gt;You see a momentary flash of static across your view, and you drop the axe in a panic.  The voice instantly returns to its soft, almost soothing tone.
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s it.  Good.  You are an excellent listener, hmhmhm.  I knew you would be a wise choice...&quot;
&gt;You can&#039;t help but blurt out:
&gt;&quot;Choice?&quot;
&gt;There&#039;s another smooth chuckle.
&gt;&quot;Yes, choice.  You were contacted, if you recall, roughly a month ago.  I trust you saw my message?&quot;
&gt;&quot;The visions?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ah, yes.  A rather elegant term for a rather complicated method of contact, I suppose.  I can only assume you saw them, and that is what brought you here.&quot;
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s right... who are you?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Hmhmhm.  My my.  Inquisitive, are we?  My name is not important to you, nor the task I have for you.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Task?  What are you talking about?  Stop talking in riddles and explain yourself!&quot;
&gt;Your blood runs cold as a vicious snarl answers your outburst.  The voice again speaks in that harsh tone, directly within the boundaries of your skull.
&gt;&quot;LISTEN TO ME, CHILD.  QUESTION ME NOT.  YOUR ANSWERS WILL COME WHEN I DEEM IT TIME.  NO SOONER.&quot;
&gt;Each word is accompanied by a distortion of your vision.  For a fleeting moment, you swear you see that shadowy figure from your visions, standing in the brush.
&gt;There&#039;s a rustling from within the tangled thicket, and you follow your instincts, breaking into a full sprint.

&gt;You run from the clearing, getting as much distance between you and the dark figure as possible.
&gt;That eerily serene voice continues to speak, sounding very much as if it were coming from directly behind you.
&gt;&quot;Why do you run, boy?  I seek not to harm you.  I merely require of you one task.  I see it, in your mind: your love for these woods.  Do you not wish to bring them back to their former luster?&quot;
&gt;Your mind races as you continue to run.  The voice never wavers in tone, but your vision slowly grows full of static.
&gt;Eventually, you can no longer see to run safely.  You reluctantly stop your mad dash, catching your breath as quiet footsteps come to a halt behind you.
&gt;&quot;Turn and face me.&quot;
&gt;Your brain screams no, but your body betrays you.  With a painfully slow movement, you turn to see your pursuer.
&gt;Standing before you, looking down, is a tall figure, wrapped in a billowing black cloak.  Atop the figure&#039;s neck rests the head of a deer, antlers glinting in the dappled sunlight filtering through the trees.  Eerie white pupils glow from within black eyes, staring into your very being.  A mouthful of jagged fangs juts from the otherwise normal snout of the deer.
&gt;The figure stares silently for a moment, blinking slowly, breathing heavily.
&gt;Then, it... smiles?
&gt;Something vaguely approximating a grin crosses its furry face as it stares down at you.  You shudder at the sight of its myriad, daggerlike fangs.  It seems to notice your apprehension, and returns to a neutral expression.
&gt;&quot;Hm.  I had thought you humans used such expressions for amicable discussions.  I suppose that is not the case after all.&quot;
&gt;The voice almost carries a tone of fascination.

&gt;The deer creature awkwardly stares at you, unblinking, as the wind blows through its wiry brown fur.  It clears it&#039;s throat, then speaks again.  Those fangs still frighten you, but it shows no signs of aggression yet.
&gt;&quot;I suppose you must be curious as to why I summoned you, yes?&quot;
&gt;You nod slowly.
&gt;&quot;Ah, as I thought.  You see, Joseph-&quot;
&gt;Your heart skips a beat as the creature uses your birth name.  It chuckles at your shocked expression.
&gt;&quot;Ah, hmhmhm.  How foolish of me, I nearly forgot you humans are not privy to the minds of others.  But, I digress.  Joseph, surely you have noticed the state of this forest.  The trees grow weary.  The insects claim more turf every day.  My children dare not walk these paths anymore, and those that do oft meet their ends at the hands of hunters like your grandfather.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Your...&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes, my children.  The deer.  Your people have not been kind to our home.  But, again, I digress.  I ask of you but one task: to help me restore this land to its former glory.&quot;
&gt;&quot;...how?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I need but two things, Joseph.  Your presence, and your consenting mind.&quot;

&gt;You step away from the looming figure, who regards you with a neutral gaze.
&gt;&quot;What do you need from me exactly?&quot;
&gt;To your shock, the figure sighs.
&gt;&quot;My children, they need more than one parental figure in their lives.  Joseph, they need... a father.&quot;
&gt;&quot;A- I thought- you...&quot;
&gt;The figure chuckles once again, that disturbing &quot;smile&quot; resurfacing.
&gt;&quot;You thought me a male, I suppose?  Not an uncommon misconception.  But, &#039;tis a mistake nonetheless.  I am the mother of this forest&#039;s deer, and they are my children.&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re certain that confusion is plastered on your face, judging by the deer&#039;s bemused expression.
&gt;&quot;Hm.  I had heard that humans perform better with a visual aid.  Perhaps...&quot;
&gt;The woman casts off her cloak gently.

&gt;Without the obscuring garment, her femininity is undeniable. A modestly sized bust rests below her fanged smile, and wide, motherly hips make themselves known below that.  Between them, however, is something rather concerning.
&gt;Her waist appears to be a twisted, gnarled mess not unlike an old, rotten tree.  This malformed midriff abruptly flares up into visible ribs above, and perfectly healthy legs below.  Alongside this, her arms seem to fall somewhere between bone and timber in form, yet also bear soft brown fur.  In fact, her whole form does still bear the typical fur of a deer, no matter how twisted her flesh seems.
&gt;The deer woman smiles again, and you swear you see a faint reddish flush appear on the bare skin of her ears. 
&gt;&quot;Does this convince you?&quot;
&gt;Distracted a bit by her remarkably humanoid form, you vacantly nod.  She chuckles and gently pulls her cloak back on.  A fleeting wave of disappointment washes over you.
&gt;&quot;Okay... but what do you need ME to do?  You said they need a father...&quot;
&gt;&quot;Hmhmhm, I can sense a mounting concern within your mind.  I do not require your services for mating.  Rather, I merely seek... a husband, I believe your type calls them.  Yes.  Someone to spend my days with, someone to help me watch over this forest and my wonderful children.  Someone who shares my love for these woods.  Joseph, I believe you are capable of providing all this, yes?&quot;

&gt;You stammer.
&gt;&quot;Y-yes, but-&quot;
&gt;&quot;Excellent.  Then consider it done.  Joseph, from this day forward, you shall be the King of this forest, and I your Queen.&quot;
&gt;She sighs happily, almost sounding relieved.
&gt;&quot;Ah.  It is nice to have that burden off my shoulders.  Thank you for heeding my call.&quot;
&gt;&quot;B-but...&quot;
&gt;She tilts her head unnaturally far to one side.
&gt;&quot;Hm?  Is something the matter, my dear?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Y-you just met me, how can you love me enough to want me to be your king?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Love...?  Hm.  I must admit, I had not considered that matter.&quot;
&gt;You feel her eyes burning into your soul.
&gt;&quot;Joseph, do you love me?&quot;
&gt;You find yourself choked if answers, and soon feel a disturbing sensation, as if a soft, furred hand were rooting about within your brain.  Her eyes narrow.
&gt;&quot;...I see.  I suppose that is to be expected.  You humans have a rather different approach to this sort of thing.&quot;
&gt;She looks genuinely thoughtful for a moment.
&gt;&quot;Joseph. Can you... teach me?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Teach you what?&quot;
&gt;&quot;How to make you love me. How to... romance, I believe the term is.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You want me to show you how romance works?&quot;
&gt;She nods, smiling.

&gt;You soon find yourself sitting in the midst of the clearing, next to the deer queen.  She serenely surveys her surroundings with a smile.
&gt;&quot;Is it not beautiful, my dear?  Our love will only make it more beautiful.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well, it isn&#039;t quite love yet.&quot;
&gt;She looks earnestly confused.
&gt;&quot;Truly?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Not yet.  Love happens over time.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ah.  How much time?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Anywhere from first sight to months down the line.&quot;
&gt;Her eyes narrow slightly, and you worry she may be getting impatient with you.
&gt;&quot;...very well.  I will do whatever is required of me to earn your love.  For my children, my forest.&quot;
&gt;&quot;If you&#039;re serious about this, I&#039;ll put my heart into it as well.&quot;
&gt;She smiles again, gently placing a bony hand on your shoulder.
&gt;&quot;...is this alright?&quot;
&gt;You nod, and she places her other hand on your other shoulder.
&gt;&quot;What shall I do now?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Uhh... well, we could just sit here and admire the beauty of the woods?&quot;
&gt;Her eyes practically light up.
&gt;&quot;Ah, my favorite pastime.  Shall I tell you of the tales these trees whisper?&quot;
&gt;Over the next few hours, she regales you with stories of the forest&#039;s rich history.  She tells of battles fought within the darkened paths.  Of adventurers lost among the undergrowth.  Of the many magnificent creatures to roam this place.
&gt;As she speaks, you find yourself subconsciously drifting closer to her.  By the end of her stories, your arms are wrapped around her middle.

&gt;Eventually, night falls.  You yawn, and she frowns.
&gt;&quot;Mm?  I suppose you need sleep, yes?  I have a place for you.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Huh?  It&#039;s fine, I can go home and come back tomorrow.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh... I had rather hoped you might consider these woods your home.  Though, I suppose that is to be expected.  Go to your home, my dear.  I shall be waiting for you in the morn.&quot;
&gt;The deer queen rises slowly, and strides off into the woods, vanishing.  You gather your things, then head home, where you soon fall asleep.

&gt;You awaken to the sound of a doe bleating below your window.  You glance outside, and aren&#039;t shocked to see the deer queen standing behind your home.
&gt;Her voice echoes within your head.
&gt;&quot;Good morning, Joseph, my dear.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Good morning.&quot;
&gt;You quickly get dressed and make your way down to her.
&gt;&quot;What shall we do today?  More romance?&quot;
&gt;&quot;If that&#039;s what you want to do.&quot;
&gt;She nods eagerly.
&gt;&quot;I desire to earn your love, my dear, and I shall endeavor to do so.&quot;
&gt;She hugs you stiffly, mimicking the action as you demonstrated to her last night.
&gt;&quot;...is that correct?  I worry that I may not have done that correctly.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re fine, I promise.&quot;
&gt;She smiles as you lead her back to the clearing.
&gt;Today, there IS something else here: a small, tattered picnic basket.  The deer queen again flushes in her ears.
&gt;&quot;I... heard that humans sometimes share food in this manner when seeking a mate.&quot;
&gt;You carefully open the basket to find a carefully packed selection of various fruits and other edibles from the woods.
&gt;&quot;I trust these are safe for humans?&quot;
&gt;&quot;...yes, actually.  Good work.&quot;
&gt;Her ears grow redder.
&gt;&quot;Anything for you, my dear.&quot;
&gt;You heart swells with affection for the deer queen, if only for a moment.

&gt;An hour passes.  You and your companion have finished the contents of the basket.  She gently rubs her twisted midsection with a happy sigh.
&gt;&quot;My my.  That was a pleasant meal.&quot;
&gt;&quot;It was pretty nice, yeah.  Thank you.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You are most welcome, my dear.&quot;
&gt;She tilts her head slightly.
&gt;&quot;May I ask... is it love now?&quot;
&gt;You chuckle warmly.
&gt;&quot;Not yet, sorry.&quot;
&gt;She waves a bony hand dismissively.
&gt;&quot;Then I shall romance with you every day until it becomes love.  I am a patient woman.&quot;
&gt;&quot;And what if it never works out?  What if we don&#039;t fall in love?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Then... I shall exit your life.  If you do not love me, I shall not force myself upon you.&quot;
&gt;&quot;...thank you.&quot;
&gt;She hugs you once again, this time less stiffly.

&gt;Weeks pass.  Every day, the queen meets you outside your home.  She&#039;s lately began bringing small gifts, be they turkey feathers or unusual stones.
&gt;You&#039;ve saved each and every one of them.
&gt;Today, you again follow her to the clearing, as always.  Once there, you sit down, motioning for her to join you.
&gt;&quot;What shall we do today, my dear?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Actually, I wanted to tell you something.&quot;
&gt;She frowns slightly.
&gt;&quot;Yes?  Is something the matter?&quot;
&gt;You shake your head and smile.  You embrace her tightly, wrapping you arms around her thin middle.
&gt;&quot;Not at all.  I just wanted to say... I love you.&quot;
&gt;Your queen smiles lovingly, gently hugging you in return.
&gt;&quot;And I love you, my King.&quot;
&gt;As you embrace your newfound love, you could swear the forest looks just a tad greener, a bit more lively.
&gt;You love it.</textarea>
