&gt;Anon is competing in a surfing competition when he wipes out
&gt;As he attempts to get back on his board, he finds himself dragged through the water by his leg tether
&gt;He finds himself in a seaside cave, with a curious shark girl
&gt;His wetsuit is torn and he’s bleeding
&gt;It’s time for Anon to convince her not to eat him, but what else could he satisfy other than her hunger?
&gt;Anon has an idea…
