It was almost like he WANTED you to hurt him...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It makes you whine a bit, and you try to reassure the human by licking his cheek.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn&#039;t want to hurt him. Just... prevent him from harming himself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a few more moments you feel his body go limp, and you let go of him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He flops forward, unconscious. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This may have been a bad idea to knock him out... It&#039;s not like you could just leave him here!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You resolve to take him back to your home. He would be safe there. From the wilderness AND himself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a short time of carrying him, you arrive back at your home, a cozy little tent set up near a small creek and some apple trees.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lay him gently on the hides you used as a bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You make the decision to tie him up. After all, you had some knifes you used to gut fish and dress game, and you didn&#039;t want him to hurt himself (or you!) If he woke up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After you finish tying him up, he&#039;s still unconscious. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Satisfied that he won&#039;t be able to harm anything when he awakes, you leave the small shelter to gather some apples. The Human may be hungry when he awakens.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You set out to gather a few choice looking apples, putting them in a basket.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re walking back to your shelter with them when you hear a groan emit from the tent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s the Human! He&#039;s awake!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You set the apple basket outside of the tent, before stepping inside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sure enough, he sits there staring at you with confused eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re pretty surprised that he woke up this quickly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He&#039;s sweating a bit, and you can tell the distinctive smell of fear emitting from his body.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh no, he was afraid of you!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You let out a whine a little louder than usual, and look worriedly at him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To show you were no threat to him, you drop to the floor, crawling over to him slowly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You even lick at his face and neck a bit to show some affection.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Unfortunately, it seems to have the opposite effect on him, and he starts to panic a bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No, no no! You weren&#039;t going to hurt him!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quickly wrap your arms and legs around him, holding him close to your body in an attempt to calm him down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Using on hand, you guide his face into the space on your chest where your fragrant fur was thickest, right above the swell of your chest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You gently rub your muzzle against his head, and you can feel moisture start to gather in your fur.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh no, he was crying now!

&gt;Be anon. 
&gt;You&#039;re currently walking through some quiet, peaceful forest, looking for a suitable place to kill yourself.
&gt;You&#039;ve spent the last 10 years alone; with absolutely nothing to ever look forward to.
&gt;You&#039;ve decided that you have had enough of living.
&gt;Looking at your fathers old hunting shotgun, you decided it would be a surefire way to make sure the job was done right.
&gt;You were too nice to leave a mess in your apartment, so you had decided to end it all somewhere away from others, hopefully in an area where your body would never be found.
&gt;You didn&#039;t even bother to write a note. It&#039;s not like anyone cared enough to check up on you, so why waste the effort?
&gt;You stop in a grassy clearing.
&gt;Yeah, this will do okay. You were starting to get tired of walking anyways.
&gt;Not that it would matter in a few moments.
&gt;As you raise the shotgun under your chin, suddenly, something slams into you from behind.
&gt;You fall face-first, and before you can regain your senses, a furry arm snakes around your neck, pressing on your throat and choking you.
&gt;At first, you try to struggle a bit, but quickly give up. Why fight? You were only going to kill yourself anyways.
&gt;If whoever was choking you intended to finish the job for you, then so be it.
&gt;You hear a whine come from the person choking you, along with a gentle lick against the side of your face.
&gt;As your airway is constricted, you black out from the lack of oxygen.

&gt;You wake up groaning, sitting on something soft.
&gt;Opening your eyes, you take a moment to examine your surroundings. 
&gt;It seems like you&#039;re in some sort of weird triangular tent made of animal hides.
&gt;Try to get up, only to realize that you&#039;ve been hound at the hands and feet by a homemade, yet sturdy, rope.
&gt;As you try to wiggle out of your bindings, a flap on the tent opens, a large furred woman walking in.
&gt;Oh damn, it was one of those tribal wolves. You&#039;ve heard about them once or twice on TV before.
&gt;She seems surprised to see you awake, appraising you with wide eyes.
&gt;Before you can say anything, she lets out a loud whine, a look of deep concern on her face.
&gt;She drops to all fours, crawling over to you as you lay helplessly on the ground.
&gt;Shit, is she going to eat you? Is that why she took you back here?
&gt;Panic erupts in your mind as she begins to lick at your face and neck.
&gt;Before you can react further, she lays down next to you, staring at your eyes.
&gt;She scooches as close as she can next to you, before throwing a leg over you and dragging you into her arms.
&gt;One of her hands affixes itself to your back, while the other gently guides your face into the space above her breasts.
&gt;A memory flashes through your mind.
&gt;The last girl to ever hug you had been your Mother, back when you had graduated from High School.
&gt;You can&#039;t help but tear up a little.
&gt;You breath in through your nose, the scent of the Wolfess filling your body.
&gt;She hugs you tight, and your combined senses and emotions practically force the tears from your body.
&gt;As you softly cry into her soft coat, she rubs your back, whispering soothing, if unknown, words into your ear.
&gt;For the first time in a long while, things felt like they might turn out okay.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt;Be a tribal Wolfess.
&gt;Currently, you were stalking some random human through your tribes&#039; hunting grounds.
&gt;He was carrying one of those loud, tube weapons that humans were so fond of using.
&gt;At first you had been angry at him, thinking that he was going to try and hunt on land that wasn&#039;t his.
&gt;Now though, you were just curious.
&gt;He&#039;s had plenty of opportunities to kill the scattered game in the forest, but he&#039;s ignored all of the chances hes had.
&gt;Why was he carrying a weapon of he had no intention to use it?
&gt;When he stops in a grassy area though, your heart jumps into your throat.
&gt;His hand tightly grips the large weapon, and he begins to raise it pointed at himself.
&gt;By the Sky Mother, he was going to hurt himself!
&gt;Acting on instinct, you pounce at him, sending him sprawling into the grass.
&gt;Not wanting to give him a chance to retrieve his weapon, you do the first thing you can think of.
&gt;You choke him, your arm pressing against his windpipe.
&gt;This... was probably a bit too rough to be honest.
&gt;Even worse, he wasn&#039;t even trying to fight back! It was almost like he WANTED you to hurt him...
&gt;It makes you whine a bit, and you try to reassure the human by licking his cheek.
&gt;You didn&#039;t want to hurt him. Just... prevent him from harming himself.
&gt;After a few more moments you feel his body go limp, and you let go of him.
&gt;He flops forward, unconscious. 
&gt;This may have been a bad idea to knock him out... It&#039;s not like you could just leave him here!
&gt;You resolve to take him back to your home. He would be safe there. From the wilderness AND himself.

&gt;After a short time of carrying him, you arrive back at your home, a cozy little tent set up near a small creek and some apple trees.
&gt;You lay him gently on the hides you used as a bed.
&gt;You make the decision to tie him up. After all, you had some knifes you used to gut fish and dress game, and you didn&#039;t want him to hurt himself (or you!) If he woke up.
&gt;After you finish tying him up, he&#039;s still unconscious. 
&gt;Satisfied that he won&#039;t be able to harm anything when he awakes, you leave the small shelter to gather some apples. The Human may be hungry when he awakens.
&gt;You set out to gather a few choice looking apples, putting them in a basket.
&gt;You&#039;re walking back to your shelter with them when you hear a groan emit from the tent.
&gt;It&#039;s the Human! He&#039;s awake!
&gt;You set the apple basket outside of the tent, before stepping inside.
&gt;Sure enough, he sits there staring at you with confused eyes.
&gt;You&#039;re pretty surprised that he woke up this quickly.
&gt;He&#039;s sweating a bit, and you can tell the distinctive smell of fear emitting from his body.
&gt;Oh no, he was afraid of you!
&gt;You let out a whine a little louder than usual, and look worriedly at him.
&gt;To show you were no threat to him, you drop to the floor, crawling over to him slowly.
&gt;You even lick at his face and neck a bit to show some affection.
&gt;Unfortunately, it seems to have the opposite effect on him, and he starts to panic a bit.
&gt;No, no no! You weren&#039;t going to hurt him!
&gt;You quickly wrap your arms and legs around him, holding him close to your body in an attempt to calm him down.
&gt;Using on hand, you guide his face into the space on your chest where your fragrant fur was thickest, right above the swell of your chest.
&gt;You gently rub your muzzle against his head, and you can feel moisture start to gather in your fur.
&gt;Oh no, he was crying now! You were making things worse!
&gt;You can feel him deeply inhale through his nose, and then press his face willingly against you.
&gt;You can hear him quietly cry, kicking your motherly instincts into overdrive.
&gt;It was time to break out the big guns.
&gt;You gently rub his back, occasionally giving him a gentle scritch with your sharp claws.
&gt;You crane your head close to his ear and start to whisper a prayer your Mother used back when you were a pup whenever you were upset to calm you down.
&gt;It works like a charm, the Human going limp in your strong arms as he softly cries his sorrows away.
&gt;All you wanted to do was make him feel like everything was going to turn out okay.</textarea>
