>Be out there with your clever girl, camping
>She starts to undress and you have an idea where this is going
>There's that same look in her eyes that she always does just before she jumps you
>"Start running Anon. I'll give you a ten minutes head start."
>"Ten? Have the previous 'hunts' been too short for your taste?"
>Meanwhile she has finished taking off her clothes and walks next to you
>"I have something else I want to try this time."
>She snaps her jaws close next to your head and her eyes focus on yours
>"Run. Nine minutes"
>For a brief moment you stare at those hungry eyes before sprinting off
>Since you do not have a 'weapon', your only chance is to try and get to a place where she can't find you
>You've learned a few tricks in your previous games, once you even managed to drive her to a point of frustration when she couldn't track you down
>In the distance you can hear her start to vocalize. You guess your nine minutes are up
>However it is not the usual roar, it sounds more like those feral raptors you've heard in films. What was that sound for again?
>Help? She's calling for help?
>You hear another, responding to her call. It's from a different direction
>You're in trouble

>It's hard to try lose one raptor that's determined to get her claws on you
>Let alone two of them working together
>It's a hilly terrain and you can feel the wind on your back. At least you ran off to a right direction, should give you a bit more time
>You know how damn fast your girl can be when she's sprinting. If you get spotted it's game over
>Can't hear the girls anymore, they must be on the prowl. Here's hoping there aren't any other poor bastards around or they're in for a shock
>The answer for the call came from the bottom of the hill, you must either circle around to the other side or go straight up
>Your footprints will be a problem however. Your girl is closing in and you don't have time to start covering your tracks right now, it would make you too slow.
>As if on cue, you can hear them communicating again. It sounded like it was much closer this time, must have been easy for her to follow the direction you ran off to
>You try to look for something to give you an advantage and see the fores opening up on your right
>As you run towards it, it reveals to be an more rocky area
>Perfect. It's a lot easier to avoid leaving any tracks for them to follow

>It's a slow going but you have to try something
>You won't outrun them, not in a terrain like this, human stamina be damned
>It won't help when your pursuers have legs that can just jump over the obstacles that slow you down
>But your girl enjoys these little hunts of yours, and so do you
>It wasn't a big step from other roleplay you sometimes do
>It's not always like this, you have tried different settings.
>Sometimes she's waiting, trying to stop you before you reach the 'extraction'
>Sometimes it is you who's hunting for her
>There's also different types of gear you set out with, depending how even you want the playing field to be
>This time, with only the clothes on your back, it's very much not in your favor
>You wonder how did she get herself a 'packmate'
>The rocky surface is coming to an end and you must return to a softer terrain
>Trusting that you have gained some time, you risk using some of it to cover your tracks now
>The more time they spend searching where you left the rocks the more time you have to run

>You get closer to the top with every step, planning to head down from there to a different direction. One that's free from raptors
>You let out a small laugh when you hear an obviously annoyed raptor noises behind you
>Looks like you little trick worked
>Their frustration also helps to confirm your suspicions. The voices were both close together now, you managed to slip away
>The huntresses don't give up that easily though
>There is an exited bark and series of other following it, before it goes quiet again
>No time to waste if you want to keep your lead
>Some parts of the hill are more steep than the others. You try to navigate through the more passable, faster terrain
>You haven't heard anything from the girls from a while. Where are they?

>You're almost at the top when you hear them again, and your girl sounded like she was a lot closer than you feel comfortable with right now
>Perhaps going uphill wasn't that smart after all. She must have come straight up those parts you decided to go around
>You love those thighs on her but they're working against you now
>What's worse, the other call came from completely different direction that last time
>They must have separated again right after finding your tracks and planning to trap you on top
>It's also the direction where the wind keeps carrying your scent. Scent from the body that is now sweating from the exertion
>So much for slipping away. You have to figure something out or you will soon have a hungry raptor tearing at your clothes
>You consider trying to climb up in a tree. You would be trapped but at least they shouldn't be able to get to you
>That gives you an another idea
>It's a desperate attempt at last stand but they don't leave you much choice, the sounds are getting closer
>Acting quickly, you actually do climb one of the trees. At least to leave enough markings that show's you were there
>You trust that your girl will be following your tracks and hastily cover any others that you've made around the tree
>It's far from perfect but the trap is closing in

>You hide yourself from sight just when her heavy footsteps become audible
>Waiting behind your cover, you don't dare to move, barely even breathing
>There is another exited bark and the steps quickly pass your hideout
>She must have seen the tracks you left and gotten eager, thinking she finally got you
>You quietly dig your feet on the ground, preparing to jump on her
>Trying to wrestle a deadly predator, what are you thinking?
>Damn if you're going down without a fight
>Launching yourself towards her, you see your girl facing the tree trying to spot you up there
>The sudden noise makes her turn her head, letting out a surprised screech before you tackle her body
>You both fall down on the ground and you quickly try to sit on her back to keep the raptor down
>She thrashes for a while and tries to throw you off but you got your arms around her torso and your knees planted firmly on each side of her
>You lower your body on her back and move your hands on her chest
>"Got perhaps too exited there, did we?"
>In response your not so clever girl only bares her teeth to you and snarls
>She turns her head as much as she can, trying to get a bite out of you but you pull your own head back
>Her trashing starts to lose power as you keep fondling her and grinding your hips on her rear
>Soon the aggression drops from her face and is replaced by light panting
>You start to move one hand between her legs, your fingers seeking her opening. "A fine catch. It's not every day you manage to subdue a raptor"
>"Speaking of exited, are you not forgetting something, human?" Her lips curl upwards, smirking to you.
>"And what would that be?"
>She opens her jaws and lets out another tone. The same one she used to call her sister. 'Help'
>"Raptors are pack hunters"

>You don't hear an answer to her call and she does not stop
>In an attempt to shut her up you clamp your hands over her snout, closing it with an audible clack
>With your hands occupied, her arms now have more room to maneuver
>You understand the mistake right after she starts struggling again
>Her claws easily find grip in the soft ground and now aided by her arms, your captive twists her upped body
>You try to hold her still using your legs but it's a futile effort
>Rest of her body soon follows and now you're face to face with the raptor
>You can't let her snout free, her jaws will be on you in an instant
>But now her hands are completely free and if you don't free your own, you're left completely open to hers
>And there is that damn smirk again
>Your situation just turned a lot worse and she knows it
>You study her face, trying to determine the raptors next move and not daring to turn your eyes away from hers even for a moment
>However it's her eyes that move first, only to focus on something behind you
>You freeze up, realizing what she must be looking at
>Or more like who

>There's a soft huff against your neck
>Not getting away now
>The newcomer keeps taking in your scent, going through your hair, while the one under you slowly grabs your hands to free her jaws from your hold
>Her head shoots up, jaws full of sharp teeth opening and aiming for your throat
>You have time only to close your eyes before something wet starts running down your neck
>You can feel her teeth on your skin but there is no pain
>A muscular, slimy organ is moving over your exposed throat, tasting you
>While she's making sure you stay still, the one behind you reaches her foreclaws around your body
>You can feel her chest pressing your back and open your eyes to see another face coming over your shoulder, filled with hunger
>Sharp claws hook to hem of your shirt and start cutting it open, aiming to get what's underneath
>Good thing it was one of your cheap shirts, bad that wasn't your kevlar one
>The raptor makes quick work of your garment and the girl holding your throat moves her jaws lower, leaving a small nip on your shoulder on the way down

>Her maw travels past your collarbone and to your chest, resuming her licks there
>With your shirt completely in shreds, there's a pull on your arms to make you lose balance
>You are swiftly flipped around, your girl now looking down on your face
>Now see your other tormentor, the one that came to her sisters aid. 
>She's a darker shade of color, more muted, but with eyes just as piercing and displaying that same predatory intelligence
>Dark one approaches your face, head tilting from side to side, taking a good look at your features before turning away
>There's a nod between them and an approving snort
>The one sitting on you scoots forward, leaving your groin free for her companion
>Before you have time to think anything stupid, the claws return. This time on your trousers

>There's a tug followed by the feel of your belt coming loose
>While the raptor on your chest is just satisfied to watch you, her packmate is not
>Her head disappears behind your girl's back and you can feel warm breath on your skin
>Snout begins to work it's way under your waistband, seeking what's trapped within
>Rear end of your attacker remains in your field of view and your attention is focused there
>The muscular tail attached to that rear is swaying softly while she's bent down, sniffing inquisitively
>From this angle you can also see the parts that are found under her tail
>All the grinding and wrestling with your girl combined with the current view has left you in a prime state
>It isn't long before you feel something warm trying to wrap around your member
>Her movements get more aggressive now, trying to force the snout deeper in your groin
>"Easy there girl, easy."
>One on your chest glances behind her, letting out a small chortle
>"Looks like the aspiring huntress knows where the best parts are."

>Your trousers prove to be too tight for her to get any further, and she retreats after a few licks and an indignant huff
>The darker raptor disappears completely and you can feel claws carefully gripping around your waistband
>The one straddling you places one of her clawed fingers on your chest, drawing it down along your sternum
>As the one behind your girl starts tugging your trousers, you get the hint and lift your waist from the ground, allowing her to pull them down
>Now freed from the previous restraints, the raptor resumes her attack
>Your underwear is unable to stop the persistent predator and the flexible band gives way, allowing her access
>Warm maw closes around you and the tongue resumes it's actions, coating your member with saliva
>With better access this time, she's able to get you in her mouth completely and starts working her tongue around you
>You can feel her teeth on your sensitive skin, but the raptor is doing her best to not cause any damage
>Must be keeping you functional for her packmate's turn
>Her tongue keeps touching different spots around your member, focusing on a particular spot every time you throb in her mouth more agressively
>Warm breath on your groin, her clawed hands carefully feeling your scrotum
>Only thing you can see however is the watchful gaze of your girl and two tails swaying from side to side, one faster than the other

>Your face begins to show the pleasure inflicted by the raptor between your legs
>She has found a particularly good spot and is now doubling her efforts there, causing you to tense up
>Her maw is driving you crazy and you need more. You try to buck your hips upwards, seeking something to bury yourself into.
>In response you get a low growl and feel sharp teeth pressing just a tiny bit more in your skin
>Message received, you attempt to hold still and the pressure pulls away, leaving just the hot pleasurable tongue
>But there's a different kind of pressure now, deep in you, brought forward by her
>Your face must reveal this as your girl gives a sharp bark and you can feel the warmth leaving your groin
>The dark raptor comes in your view, licking her lips and walking past you, taking position behind your head
>Meanwhile your girl drags herself lower, her nether lips dragging over your exposed organ
>She takes hold of your undergarments, ridding them from you completely
>Bending down on your member, she gives the head a small lick
>Your dick twitches in reply which elicits a soft purring sound from her
>There's a nuzzle on your sack before she raises her head back up

>Both raptors start closing in on you again, moving towards eachother
>Your girl places her hips over yours while the darker one appears from behind you, planting her knees on either side of your head
>As she bends over, you are greeted with an unobstructed view of her glistening pussy
>You feel the weight lifting from your groin and dark hand grabs your member, directing it straight up right below your girl
>You can't see the expression on her, being covered by another raptor, but it's easy to imagine
>Waiting, wanting. The one she has given you many times in the past and hungry for the main course
>The huntress can't wait any longer and her hips start to travel down to yours
>Aided by her sister's hand, your dick finds it's mark
>Once the head sinks in, the grip from your base releases and the hips above your face begin to shift
>As your girl slowly impales herself, the other raptor mimics her movements, bringing her groin down towards your mouth
>Your lips meet just before your hips similarly unite with a second pair

>Now full, your girl lets out a small chirp and you can't help but to let out a moan against the other one's pussy
>She starts to grind on your face slowly, insistent you get to work pleasuring her further
>Trapped between the two predators, acting on that demand sounds like a smart move
>You put your tongue out, giving her a slow lick, tasting her
>Her reaction is to push against your face with more force
>You move your hands to her hips, grabbing them and holding her still
>She begins to protest, but quickly grows quiet when you increase your efforts on her
>The one around your dick is also going faster now
>Those powerful legs that helped her to catch you are now vigorously moving her up and down on your shaft
>Her insides grab you, trying to keep you in with every pull and welcoming you in with every push
>There are soft little trills coming from her direction as she keeps bouncing on you
>You try your best to keep going with her while you focus pleasuring her packmate with your mouth
>Her hips have grown still and you bring your other hand on her lips to help with the task
>There's an involuntary thrust from her and your fingers sink deep
>Combined effort of your tongue on her clit and your fingers in her pussy cause her join your girl's trills
>The movements on your dick grow erratic just when you think you're reaching your limit
>Despite the warmup they gave you, she's just as close. The chase must have gotten her real worked up
>After a few forceful thrusts, your girl comes, hilting herself to the base
>You're pushed over the edge by her contractions and come deep in her, filling her insides to the brim

>As you both ride your peak, the darker raptor desperately tries to keep herself going on your digits
>Your mind clears from the orgasm and you double down your efforts on her pussy
>It doesn't take long before there's a gush of fluids from her, covering your face while she's trying to milk you fingers
>Your dick is still in your girl, the huntress now pacified
>She's seems content to just sit there, feeling the warmth in her and watching the two of you finish
>She keeps making soft voices to her sister, encouraging and waiting for her to ride out her own climax
>The flow from her subsides and her legs are unable to support her
>You have to lift her hips from your face to get your vision back and stop her from inadvertently trying to suffocate you
>Incapable of keeping her balance, she collapses next to you, panting heavily
>There's a happy look on your girls muzzle when she lies down on your chest, giving your face a small lick
>"That was one of the most satisfying hunts I've ever had"
>Her 'packmate' just warbles in response, like there's no objection from her
>You stroke her head and she just closes her eyes, breathing more evenly now
>Your other hand keeps your girl close, rubbing her back as you hold her gaze

>The three of you simply lie there for a while, enjoying yourself and recovering from the ordeal
>Eventually you feel yourself going soft and prompt the raptor on your chest to stand. She slowly does so, pulling free from you
>Strands of your combined juices stick between your hips, stetching quite far before breaking up
>The results of a scuccessfull hunt
>You have it worst of them, getting trapped between the two
>Girls clear out the most of it but you will need something more than a tongue bath to get clean, the fluids are already growing sticky on your bodies
>"I saw a small stream when circling in the forest. It should be enough for a quick wash," the second girl says as she gets up
>There are pairs of attentive eyes on you. "Sounds like a plan. Lets go."
>You turn around and set out down the hill, only to realize something after a while
>"Right, which way is it exactly?"
>No response. You don't hear any footsteps either
>"Uh, ladies?" You turn around again
>Nothing
>Clever girls
