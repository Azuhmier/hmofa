>You are Sir Anon of The house Anon
>You are a noble born knight who has participated in countless battles
>You were Skilled with swordplay however preferred a Spear and shield
>You were also skilled in magic, a rare feat for many knights who didn’t "have the right attunement" as the court wizard who trained you said
>You were no wizard but could still use many simple and intermediate magic
>You were with your Platoon a group of 40 able bodied men all battle hardened and skilled
>You were to be reinforcements to an attack of a ...tribe?
>No…tribes meant organization
>A camp?
>Whatever it was to be called, you were reinforcing an extermination of those godless beast people
>The king had ordered all of them be exterminated or enslaved as common workers
>He had called them savages, practicing cannibalism, the males would eat the newborns of rival males, their magic dark and dangerous
>If they could be tamed it would be a miracle
>Why you were not part of the main attack was politics
>A baron has requested his son lead the attack to try to make a name for himself
>The son however was totally incompetent so you were to be the cleanup force
>You could hear your Men grumbling about how they would rather attack with the main force
>You allowed the grumbling for now
>The son had taken a full 2 Platoons to slaughter a tribe of savages who barely had weapons
>You arrive to total devastation
>The idiot had in fact wiped out the beast but from your count they had inflicted heavy casualties
>You’re guessing he just charged right without proper scouting
>You see a group men sifting through ashes and bodies of humans and beasts
>You ride up on your horse
>"You there" you say beckoning to the nearest one "Come, tell me what happened here"
>The man nervously approaches
>"Sir Stultus, ordered a full frontal assault on their walls' he said gesturing towards the wooden walls, covered with sharpened spikes and burning as fire ravaged them

>"And where is Sir Stultus now?" you ask 
>"Dead Sir, He attempted to duel what he thought was the leader and was impaled by one of the other savages"
>So you were the ranked officer here now
>"How many dead or wounded?" you ask 
>"68 casualties sir"
>Fuck 68 out of 80 dead or wounded
>You sigh and run your hand over your helmeted face and head
>"Start searching for any living Humans, get them out of here for medical attention" you Order your men
>"And any surviving beasts?" your 2nd in command asks
>"If they surrender take them prisoner. If they refuse, kill them" you say simply
>You dismount your horse and begin the search as well
>Over the next 30 minutes you find several injured men 
>You perform simple healing magic, nothing that would fully heal them but enough to keep them alive until they were able to get to a proper healer
>As you look through a hut you hear a stirring on the other side of it
>You’re near the outskirts of the... camp thing
>You follow the sound 
>You find a beast, injured, trying to crawl away
>There is an Arrow through her leg and a deep gash in her side
>You take up your spear and ready it
>"Beast, I am Sir Anon, I demand you surrender or face death" you command
>She jumps slightly and rolls over to face you 
>She just stares, you’re looking into her eyes
>She’s a reindeer Beast at least 240 lb. of fat and muscle
>You could tell she was heavier set but strong, probably stronger than you
>Her eyes were bright green and the clothes (if you could call them clothes) she had they were covered in blood
>You couldn’t tell if it was only hers
>You saw fear in her eyes, as she stared up at you, your spear readied
>You weren’t expecting this, to kill another in battle was honorable
>But here you were standing over this...woman...beast... 
>She was unarmed and trying to flee
>You had orders but this....
>"Do you understand what I’m saying?" you ask softly so only she could hear
>She’s frozen staring at you
>"Nod if you do"
>She gives a slow nod still fixated on you

>So she does understand
>"Do you surrender?" you ask
>You see a slight fire in her eyes
>She shakes her head
>You raise your spear to strike a killing blow
>There is such fear yet defiance in her eyes
>You slam the spear tip down into her
>But you miss on purpose
>The spear tip is buried in the ground next to her face
>A look of shock and fear is on it as she continues to stare
>"Please" you plead " I beg of you to surrender, I don’t want to have to kill you so please at least for now submit and I will personally see that your wounds are healed and you are taken care of, so please submit to me"
>She seems taken aback, shocked you would literally beg her so you could spare her life
>Finally in barely a whisper she says in a shaky voice "I-I surrender to you, Sir Anon"
>You let out a sigh of relief and pull your spear out of the dirt
>You attach it to your sling on your back which also holds your shield then lift your visor
>"Thank you" you say as you kneel next to her
>You reach for the arrow sticking through her leg
>"This will hurt" you say as you grip the pointed end with one hand and the bottom with the other
>She grits her teeth, strange, how can beasts with no sharp teeth eat each other...
>"Do it" she says
>In one deft movement you snap the arrowhead off and pull the bottom so the arrow comes out clean
>Blood has started spurting out of the newly opened hole
>She starts panicking at the sight
>"Calm down calm down" you say "You’re only going to make it harder for me to heal up"
>She stops and looks at you, wincing through the pain
>You rub your hands together and whisper incantations to yourself before pressing your hands on the entry and exit wounds
>They close slightly as the bleeding stops
>You can see some of the pain on her face slide away
>You perform the same spell on her side
>"What is your name" you ask as you wrap bandages around her wounds
>"I am Radka"

>You finish up bandaging her wounds and look over her once more
>She it’s very... voluptuous, her breasts are larger than you’ve ever seen on a human
>You shake your head to rid yourself of the thoughts about her and her body
>You also notice that instead of feet she has hooves 
>She also has antlers, how bizarre 
>"Well Radka, are you able to walk?" you ask calmly
>"I... I don’t think I can Sir Anon" she answers quietly
>"Very well, now I’m sorry for this but I’m going to have to bind you and carry you to my horse then" 
>You could, of course, go get your horse but that would either let her run and get an arrow to the back or one of your men would find her and kill her outright
>"I refuse to be bound" she retorts
>"You have just surrendered to me, please make this easier for both of us, I’ll leave them as loose as I can so they look tight but won’t hurt" you say almost pleading
>You really didn’t want to hurt her or bind her but you knew that if you just left her legs and arms free your men would ask questions
>Questions you didn’t want to answer
>So you went back into the hut you were searching and find a moderate length of rope
>Radka is staring at you intently, trying to see what you want from her
>Under her watchful gaze you bind her legs together at the calves and arms at the wrists
>"Is that loose enough for you to be comfortable?" you ask
>"I would prefer no bindings at all...but yes they are" she responds
>You help her up to her feet, you were going to have to throw her over your shoulder if you wanted to carry her
>She was at least 6 inches taller than you, and you were taller than average
>She looked down at you and smirked
>"You plan on carrying me Human?"
>You clink your helmet visor down and then wrap your arms around her waist and hoist her over your shoulder getting a small yelp in surprise
>"I may be smaller than you Beast but I am no whelp" you say to her through your helmet
>"I can see that" she says trying not to be impressed
>You’re walking to your horse when your 2nd in command, Pate, notices you
>"You found one alive eh, Anon?" he says striding over to you 
>"I have, she will make a fine slave in my estate" you say with more gusto than necessary
>"You always find good stuff on these battlefields, last time you found that enchanted ring" he says looking Radka over "she’s a strong one, I wonder if they produce milk though"
>"That ring was cursed" you respond “I had to have the court wizard cleanse it before I could even use it"
>You set her on your horses back so her stomach is over the saddle
>"Pate, I cannot go back via horseback, take them men home and I will catch up and report to the governor when I arrive" you say
>He does a sloppy salute and starts leading them, carrying the injured with them
>"Am I to be your slave now Sir Anon? If that was the case I would not have surrendered" Radka says bitterly
>"You are only if you want to be and when we have to act like it" you respond glancing around
>"What do you mean by that?"
>"I mean if I were to say you were not my slave you would be killed or sold off to another noble" you reply calmly "If you were to wear my house crest strained to your fur you would not be hassled in town and technically be free of prosecution"
>"You mean for me to act like a slave but be free?" she says with confusion "how?"
>You explain your plan as you walk
>She was to pose as your slave until you could find a way to get her out of the country
>She would have to have your house crest stained to her fur signifying she was yours so no Humans would bother her while she was in town
>In public with you she was to act like a normal slave but in private she could act as she wanted
>She eyes you wearily
>"Why would someone who has killed so many of my kind do this for me?” She asks
>"I haven’t killed any beast men actually, I’ve killed plenty of humans in battle, but no beast men" you answer
>"You led the attack on my village!" she snaps
>"Nope, I was just to be the cleanup force, your people killed the leader of that attack force"
> You reach your estate on the outskirts of the city
>You unbind her and help her off your horse and help her hobble inside, keeping weight off her leg
>You lead her to a bedroom and lay her down
>"I must go report to the governor and get a healer to come to heal your wounds the rest of the way" you say
>"What if I get hungry?" 
>"There is food in the kitchen and pantry, help yourself" you say before leaving
>The governor and Lord Stultus would not be pleased with your report


>You arrive at the Governors Castle and remove your helmet was you walk in
>You make your way to the governors meeting chambers
>"Sir Anon has returned from the hunt of the beast men" you hear the court scribe announce
>You were not going to enjoy this
>"Ah Sir Anon" governor Ducibust says happily "I hope you have good news for us"
>You grimace
>"Although we did exterminate or capture all of the beast men, we lost 68 men in the initial attack, a few less if the healers can help some of the wounded" you say 
>"And my son?" Lord Stultus asks
>"He was killed in the initial attack, it seems he lead a full frontal charge at the village walls and was killed in the subsequent fighting" you say with a grimace

>"You were tasked with keeping him safe" Yells Lord Stultus "I’ll have you hung for insubordination"
>"No, he was tasked to follow orders, Lord Stultus, let him tell us what happened before we defer Judgement so quickly" you Brother says 
>David Anon, Your older brother who inherited your father's title as Lord Anon had been school in politics since he was a child
>You were the 2nd born so you were taught to fight in wars and serve as a knight, and got none of the inheritance
>Your brother however cared more about you than father had, and had given you about a fourth of the families riches as well as your current estate
>Lord Stultus grumbles to himself, you can’t hear it but you hear the word "favorite" said
>Governor Ducibust nods at your brother 
>"Yes, let’s hear what happened before we decide anything"
>You start "Sir Stultus had myself and my platoon position ourselves about 2 miles away from the village, he took his 2 platoons he was given charge of and lead a full charge at their walls"
>"Why would he have you position yourself 2 miles away?" Lord Stultus interrupts
>"He said we were to be the "Clean up force" whatever that means, anyway he led a charge on a solid wooden wall, then got impaled by a beastman" you finish
>The governor scoffs and says "he led a direct charge against a wall? What would you have done Sir Anon?"
>"I would have scouted the area first then simply used flaming arrows to draw them out, then capture those as slaves" you respond
>"I see and were any slaves captured?" the governor looks at you keenly
>He had been keener on capturing rather than extermination "messy business" he called it
>You were forced to agree
>"One that I know of" you respond
>"Is the captor inclined to sell?" he questions you leaning forward with an eager look in his eyes
>Society had a sort of "keep what you kill" Mindset
>Nobles could challenge Nobles for land, slaves, etc. although that was quite rarer now
>As well though if a person was to capture another during wartimes, they would keep that captive as a slave or whatever
>"He is not" you respond
>"Pity.... very well, Have another scout party find another village to raid... that is All Sir Anon, you are dismissed"

>You take your leave and head to the local healer, Devin, to get Radka healed up the rest of the way
>He was a close friend of yours as you had been taught healing magic together when you were young
>He was just much better at it than you
>"Anon!" He says with a smile "showing up in full armor? I can’t heal you with that on"
>You laugh 
>"No healing for me Devin, I need you to come by the estate and heal up someone for me"
>"You can’t bring them here?" he says confused
>"Leg Injury, I would take it as a personal favor if you could help me out" you say
>You beckon him closer and whisper "it’s a Beastwoman I captured"
>"Ah" he says nodding "I never took you as a slaver Anon"
>"Not slave, servant if anything" you say "So can you come by or not?"
>"Yes, I’ll be there within the hour"

>You ride back to your estate
>You go to your room and begin removing your Armor
>You never had taken a squire or had servants before so you learned to put on and take off your own armor
>Radka was in fact the only person who had ever been here with you
>You were fairly independent when it came to food and drink alike
>You finally finish taking it all off and putting it all on its rack along with your spear and shield
>You trek to the room you had put Radka in
>You were about to knock when you hear something 
>You press your ear to the door
>You hear it again
>A small sob
>You slowly open the door to find Radka sitting in the corner crying almost silently
>You had seen crying like this before
>It’s the kind of crying people couldn’t hold in
>You had seen it on the fathers of men killed in battle, their gruff exterior being cracked apart by their emotions
>You approach softly
>"Radka?" you say softly
>She jumps and tries to wipe her face quickly
>"Hey what’s wrong?" you ask
>MISTAKE
>She’s up and has punched you in the face, knocking you off your feet 
>"WHATS WRONG?!?!? WHATS WRONG?!?! EVERYONE I KNOW HAS BEEN MURDERED BY YOUR KIND!" She yells
>"THEN YOU COME ALONG AND SAVE ME LIKE THE COWARD I AM! I SHOULD HAVE DIED THERE"
>She breaks down crying again
>You sit there nursing a bloodied nose and let her get it out of her system
>She finally looks up and looks at you 
>"I-I-I'm sorry Sir Anon I shouldn’t have struck you" 
>"Just Anon" you say as you stand up, crack your neck "hell of a right hook you got there"
>She huffs out a small laugh
>"I was trying to run when your people attacked... everyone else tried to fight and I ran" she cries softly 
>"And its lucky I found you" you say "I think most others would have tried to kill you or worse"
>"Worse?" she says with a small huff "What could be worse?"
>You give her a sad look
>"Do I need to say it?" you ask wearily
>She blinks for a second before it hits her like a ton of stone
>"You humans are monsters!" she cries trying to scurry away, reopening her leg wound
>"Hey hey hey calm down!" you say trying to chase her down
>You finally get a hold of her
>"I’m no monster, just like you're no mere beast" you say "Now stop squirming you’re going to get blood everywhere"
>She looks at her bleeding leg
>"Trust me please" you say in the begging tone you gave her to get her to surrender
>"Why should I Anon? Why trust a man who has killed his own kind?" she retorts
>"Because right now I’m all you have" you answer "and I swear as a Knight I will protect you from other humans or other beast men if need be"
>You stick out a hand slowly
>"So please just trust I have your best interest at heart, you don’t have to like me, hell you could hate me, but trust me
>She hesitates before taking your hand.
>"Ok Anon, I trust you"
>"Good, I have a friend coming over to fully fix those wounds of yours, then we can see what we can do for food" you say as you walk out of the room
>"Stay there I’m getting something to wipe up that blood" you call
>You get a small rag to clean up the blood and curse your own stupidity for asking her what’s wrong
>You begin heading back to her room when you hear a knock on the door 
>You opening to reveal Devin standing there with a stupid grin
>"Why are you so happy?" you ask him
>"I’ve never gotten to see a Beast up close!" he says excited
>"Ok well follow me and I hope you don’t mind the blood" you respond
>"Anon I’m a healer, most of the time all I see is blood"
>Fair enough
>You lead him to the door and knock
>"Radka, the healer is here with me to fix your wounds up proper" you call through the door
>You hear shuffling then "ok come in"
>You open the door and see Radka has been looking out the window based on the blood trails
>You give her a displeased look but continue in
>"Radka this is Devin, he’s a healer, he’s ....excited to see you" you say throwing in some caution
>Before you can introduce her to him, Devin has already pushed past you and is looking her up and down
>"wowareindeerbeastwomanineverknewtheyweresostrongandhadsuchresearvesoffattha" he’s talking a million miles per hour
>Radka is reeling back trying to get away from him
>She looks at you terrified for help
>"DEVIN" you yell
>He stops and looks at you sheepishly
>"S-sorry anon I got excited" he says looking down
>"I can see that but you’ve terrified her" you say gesturing to her
>You walk over to Radka and sit her down on the bed
>"Sorry Radka he forgets that people need to be treated like people....he even does that with humans" you whisper to her
>Devin walks over slowly 
>"I’ll just Uhmm...I heal her wounds up" he says like a scolded child
>He performs the spell on her leg and side healing it up perfectly
>"Wow he's much better at that than you Anon" Radka comments with a smirk
>"OOOOOOOOO SHE CAN TALK?!?" Devin cries excitedly "I didn’t know they could talk!"
>"Yes I can talk little man" Radka says with an angry huff
>"Oh Uhmm sorry I...I don’t get to see or treat beast men often...Not alive anyway" Devin says with sad look
>"Thank you Devin, now if you excuse us we have to get Radka acquainted with her new home" you say stepping in between them and shooting a look at Radka
>She looks ready to punch Devin, you could take her punches pretty well, and he however couldn’t
>"Ah yes" he says before turning at leaving "Please let me speak with you sometime Ms. Radka I would love to learn about you"
>Radka looks at you
>"That was very strange Anon" she says "Why are humans so weird?"
>"Devin is....Odd. Very talented in magic and studies but has odd interests, including Beastmen"
>She stands up testing her leg 
>"I can see what you mean talented with magic, my leg feels like I never had an arrow through it"
>You smile 
>"Good, let’s give you a tour then work on getting you some proper clothes" you say leading her out

>You take her around town, making sure she is behind you
>You show her the city and take her to the seamstress
>The seamstress almost didn’t want to take your gold
>She said she didn’t work with beast men and that her work was too precious
>You actually laughed at that
>It was clothes, not some elaborate piece of art
>You haggled her down to a little over what you normally paid
>When asked what style her servant uniform would be you just said
>"Whatever is popular now"


>It had been a few weeks since Radka Had come with you to live with you
>Not much had happened between then and now
>She was now part of the town and your household
>Your brother had come by at one point to see how you were doing after the raid on the Beastmen village
>When he saw that you had Radka with you he laughed
>"So you were the one that captured the Beastmen? No wonder you didn’t want to sell" he laughed
>"Good to see my brother finally embracing his nobility and finally taking a servant" he said as he gave you an awkward one armed hug when he left
>"Nobility? Finally take a servant?" Radka questioned looking confused 
>"My family is a noble house of the king" you explain
>"I don’t understand"
>"Noble is Uhmm...." you try to explain
>"Nobility is when a family has power and position over other families"
>You scratch your head warily 
>"My house has served our king for over 200 years and its given us leverage over other houses and given us better positions in life"
>"Your brother said you’re "finally embracing it" or something? What did he mean Anon?" she asks you with a puzzled look on her face
>You looked at her, her green eyes blazed at you and you noticed each of her ears had 4 piercings going down them
>"I never liked the idea I was better than anyone" you said with a sigh "Because of that I never took servants, a squire, or even a chef to be at my beck and call" 
>"I always lived here alone handling what I needed to handle and doing whatever needed doing. My brother always said it was beneath me and that I should have slaves or servants to do everything" you said
>She’s looking you up and down
>She always seemed so confused learning things about you, like you were just another monster but one that slowly was becoming less
>You want to change the subject so you do
>"Your new outfits have been finished" you say quickly, 
>You grab you things to go out among the town and look her over
>She was still very curvaceous, ample hips and large, large breasts
>Her body stored its fat reserves in ways that made her look life she couldn’t handle herself
>But you knew that she was strong
>She had become a lot less hostile towards you after about a week
>No threats, no punches, just her living with you

>She didn’t like that she had to have your family crest stained into her Fur
>It was on her right shoulder and always had to be visible in public
>It was annoying but necessary so she wouldn’t be bothered
>"Hey it’s better than a brand" you said while she had it done
>"What’s a brand?" she asked with venom to her words
>You had grabbed a hot poker and explained it
>She was, of course, repulsed
>But now she was here with you and you were ready to go get her new "uniform"
>You walked to the seamstress with Radka in tow
>When you arrived the seamstress gave you an annoyingly coy smile
>"What?" you asked her
>"Nothing, here beast go try on your uniform" the seamstress said handing over the uniform to Radka 
>Radka, in turn, huffed angrily at being called Beast,
>She stomped off to the dressing room
>You could hear her changing and one or two thoughts floated into her head about her body
>You tried to shoo them away but they persisted 
>"How I do Look Anon?" she stepped out of the dressing room
>If your jaw could have hit the floor it would have
>She was wearing a French maid outfit
>"I like it” Radka said with a smile and a swift twirl
>You turn to the seamstress 
>"Why? Why is it a maid outfit" you ask her 
>"You said whatever was popular" she said with that annoying grin "All the lords are having their mistresses wear these"
>"She’s NOT my Mistress! She’s my servant!" you yell
>"Whatever you say Sir Anon" 
>Radka looks unhappy now
>"You don’t like it Anon?" she says with a small frown
>"No, I do like it of course but it’s...not what I expected" you say placing you thumb and forefinger on the bridge of your nose
>You pay the seamstress and Radka follows you back to your home
>"I never had anything like this when I lived in the village, most of our clothes were just animal hides" she said as you walked
>"This is so much nicer than all that stuff and more comfortable too" 
>"Well I’m glad you like it Radka"
>You liked it too, it accented her curves more than you thought possible and was tight in all the right places
>You were going to have a much harder time living with her now

>Weeks passed, Radka talked to you more about herself and her life prior
>She was from the far North only to have been chased out of her homeland by other beast men
>She said they were cannibalistic and would hunt down the plant eater beast men like herself
>You told her about yourself, your schooling, and your upbringing
>She seemed confused about inheriting titles and linage 
>She thought it odd that your brother became a Lord whilst you were only a knight
>It took a while to explain all that
>Radka also decided it was her job to get food from the market
>"You always pick the over ripe veggies and I hate it" she said as her justification
>To be honest, you didn’t eat vegetables much
>She was ... reluctant to pick up meat for you but she did anyway
>She was out at the moment picking up food in her ...uniform
>You had grown to appreciate the Strongfat reindeer living with you
>You almost revered her as a close friend
>You were lost in thought when she burst through the door 
>"Some jerk wad of a fucker shoved himself into me and that knocked all the food I picked up onto the ground" she yelled bitterly
>"THEN he said I was going to have to be punished for bumping into a Knight" she said "so expect a messenger or something"
>You groaned
>You had heard of this before
>One knight came to mind about it but you hoped it wasn’t him
>After about an hour you heard a knock at your door
>You opened it to reveal a small wiry man
>"Sir Anon, Sir Beariston would like you to know that your Slave" 
>He looked at a piece of parchment
>"The deer? Assaulted him in the market today and wishes for her to punished for it" he looks at you as he says it
>"Ok fine, let him know she'll be punished" you say dismissively 
>"He Uhmm... he wishes to punish her himself, Sir Anon" he says nervously
>There was no way you were going to let that happen.

>Sir Leeroy Beariston, also known as the "mad bear"
>He should be a lord by birthright after his older brother suddenly died after falling on his sword in an apparently freak cleaning accident
>He refused the title but kept the inheritance
>Beariston, like yourself kept no servants or slaves but it was for a different reason
>The man had a sadistic streak a mile wide,
>He never captured any slaves, he was too busy bashing those poor beast to pieces with his war hammer
>So be bought them, male, female, human or beast.
>Any sold to him killed themselves within a week
>Those that didn’t kill themselves were found after about a month, mutilated with screams painted on their faces
>It was even rumored that some farm animals would go missing and find themselves in his stables
>The only reason he wasn’t tried for such things was his own prowess in battle
>He would rush into battles with no self-preservation, laughing madly and obliterating anyone in his path
>You had heard that recently even slavers refused to sell to him, something about that they might be slavers but they had decency
>So he went into town and would have some poor slave "accidentally" bump into him then demand he get to punish them
>Those slaves would often come back with stories of multiple rapes and object penetration
>He couldn’t maim them after all, since they weren’t his

>There was no way you were Letting Radka anywhere near that monster
>"Well Sir Beariston that will not be necessary and I will handle punishing my own slave" you say calmly
>The teen fidgets a bit "Sir Beariston said if you refuse he will challenge you to a duel in the Arena for the sake of his honor"
>So that’s how he got all those nobles to let him have their way with their slaves
>Duels between nobles happened occasionally but were much rarer now
>They usually ended when one gave up and the winner would decide what to do with the winnings, be it land, slaves, or just honor
>Most were friendly spat between knights who wanted to gloat over their friends that they beat them in an official duel
>You were a well battled knight, but you didn’t know if you could take Beariston on
>But you couldn’t let anything happen to Radka, you had sworn a knight’s oath
>"If that is really what he wants, then I await the official challenge" you say in the same calm voice
>The teen snuffles a bit then runs off
>"What does he mean duel? I can take a whipping if that all he wants" Radka asks when you close the door
>You explain the duels and Who Beariston is, and what he does...
>"You’re going to have a battle to the death?!" and "He does WHAT!?!" were things she kept repeating
>You knew it was only a matter of time before he officially challenged you

>The next day the challenge was issued
>"Sir Anon, Sir Beariston has issued a challenge for a duel for the sake of his own honor" it read
>"If this challenge is denied then Sir Beariston shall have the right to Punish the Slave as he sees fit, otherwise the duel shall take place on the fortnight and shall be at 11:00 am"
>You read it aloud to Radka, who shivered slightly
>"As he sees fit" she quoted "he would do worse things to me to spite you"
>You agreed
>"Well let’s prepare then" you said
>"Prepare? How are we going to prepare?" she asked you incredulously 
>"For starters, no ale between then and now, only water, no workouts, and we have to sharpen up my weapons" you listed a few things
>"Well then Anon.... Let's get started then" Radka said with a stammer in her confident voice

>The arena was a basic circular building with raised stands with seats
>The one in the capital was much, much nicer than this
>The ground here was just bare packed down dirt
>You sat in the Staging area
>Radka helping you put in your armor and checking over your weapon once more
>Your standard spear wouldn’t work against armor 
>Instead of a flat spade-like point this one had a thick elongated pyramid for a tip to punch through heavy armor
>Your shield was steel and bore the family crest
>"Ok, here I go" you say to Radka
>She grabs your armored arm
>"Anon... Could we just...run?" she says holding your arm as she looks at you
>There is genuine fear and concern in her voice
>"We have to do this Radka" you say as you clink the helmet visor down
>You step out of the staging area into the arena grounds, to applause and cheering, this was a public spectacle after all
>Sir Beariston is already there about 20 meters from you
>He's easily a head taller than you and wielding a Warhammer with 3 Long spikes on the head of it
>You doubt you could even lift the hammer let alone swing it
>"Are both duelists ready?" you hear Governor Ducibust call out
>You raise your spear and Beariston raises his hammer
>"Very well" he said "Let the duel Begin!"
>As soon as "begin" started leaving the Governors lips Beariston was charging you down
>You had your shield and spear ready
>He does a tremendous overhead swing which you sidestep and thrust your spear into his Side
>It pierces his armor but doesn’t stop him at all
>He jumps away and swing his hammer
>You raise your shield just in time only to feel the spikes have gone through the shield
>You try to pull him off balance with a sharp yank of your arm but he’s too big
>HE yanks with all his might and fully flings you a good 5 meters
>Your shield is wrenched off your arms and you hear a sickening Crunch - pop!
>Your left arm is hanging uselessly as you get to your feet
>It must be dislocated, possibly broken judging from the pain you felt
>No time to dwell because he’s charging you again
>You raise your spear and thrust into his stomach as he barrels towards you 
>It hits the side of his armored stomach and pierces but he either doesn’t feel pain or doesn’t care
>He swings his hammer, catching you in the side
>Pain explodes from your ribs as they break and as those spikes pierce your armor
>You’re flung again 
>You hear the crowd gasp and a few claps
>You’re face down in the dirt and you roll over to see Beariston pull your spear out of his stomach and lift his visor
>He was going to gloat and you were going to prepare
>"You should have just let me have my fun with your reindeer, Anon!" he bellows as he Lumbers Haughtily towards you
>You feel like you could pass out from the pain but not now
>You focus yourself and your Mana
>"But now I get to kill you and have her ALLLLLLLLLL to myself! Imagine all the fun we're going to have"
>He stops at your feet
>"I want you thinking about that as you D-"
>He’s cut off as you unleash a fireball spell you had been charging as he gloated
>It goes straight into his open visor
>The crowd cheers 
>You smell the cooking flesh and burning hair as you roll away
>Beariston is screaming and swinging his hammer wildly
>You doubt he could see now, his eyes were probably burned away,
>You roll further and Snatch up your spear
>It’s getting harder to breath
>"Focus Anon, stay conscious" you think
>He has stopped swing and you take the chance
>You stab your spear into the back of his Knee and dart away as he swings at you
>He is facing you
>You don’t need to gloat
>You stab your spear straight into his face
>You hear the crowd explode into cheers and applause
>You see Radka running to you as you fall to your knees
>The world goes black

>You awake with a start
>Your vision is blurry and you try to sit up only to feel a gentle pressure holding you down
>"Don’t get up Anon, your body is healed but still you took a hell of a beating, both inside and out" 
>Your eyes focus 
>It’s David talking
>Devin and Radka are sitting next to you
>"How bad was it?" you mumble out
>"I’m surprised you weren’t Dead anon" said Devin "Dislocated shoulder, compound arm fracture, 7 broken ribs, a punctured lung, punctured kidney and a ruptured spleen!"
>"But I’m not dead" you respond with a smirk
>"Yes we were able to heal your wounds but you’re going to be in pain for at least another day" Devin retorts
>"How long have I been out?"
>"1 day" answered David "Good Job Anon, you’ve really helped out the Family with this one!"
>"I...I wha? You’re confused
>"You gained Beariston’s Title! You're a Lord now, you gained all of his financial assets as well as his estates! Good job picking a fight with a lord with no heirs!" he exclaims excitedly "You've really helped out the family, we now have 2 lord Anon’s on the governors counsel! Father would be proud!"
>You hadn’t thought about that, at least you were able to have some pull in things now
>"I must take my leave then" David says as he leaves "I leave you in Devin’s hands"
>Devin stands up "my work here is actually done, he just needs bedrest"
>Devin leaves and gives you a look "don’t you strain yourself anon! I don’t want to have to tell Radka to strap you down"
>"Fine, I’ll be good" you sigh
>At last it’s just you and Radka
>"You...Stupid...Annoying... Dummy!" she says before throwing herself onto you in a huge hug
>"Ow ow ow ow" you say as you wince away from her
>"Sorry!" she says, releasing you from her death grip
>You rub your sore body
>"You didn’t tell me he would beat the shit outta you!"
>"You’ve seen him! You knew he was big as fuck" you retort with a laugh
>Laughing hurts
>"You shouldn’t have done all this for me Anon" she says quietly "I could have taken his punishment. You nearly died for me! I’m technically your Slave! You almost died for a slave!
>"I promised I wouldn’t let anyone hurt you, besides I knew I would win" you say again with another chuckle
>Ow
>She gives you a smile and you noticed her ears flick slightly, that’s...new
>"I’ll go get you some water" she says as she walks towards the door
>"Fuck that get me some ale" you snort
>"You were just in a battle!" 
>"All the more reason for an Ale" 
>"Fine!” she says as she stomps off with a huff
>"And get yourself one too!" you call after her
>She comes back up a few minutes later with large Mugs of Ale
>You take the mug and tap the side of her mug with yours
>"To not being dead" you say
>"To you being the best person I know" Radka says softly
>You take a sip and then a deep drink "ohh yes" you say to yourself
>She drinks her and then coughs a bit
>"This is disgusting!" she snaps
>"It’s an acquired taste" you say before drinking again
>"Ugh I prefer wines" she sighs "I could make some"
>"Why don’t you then? If you like to do that you can" you say 
>"Oh uhh. I would need a lot of fruits and space" she says
>"We have a whole new estate and a bunch more money because of this duel" you say finishing your drink
>"We?" 
>Radka looks perplexed
>"Why do you say "we" have that? You have that" she says confused
>"Oh please we live together, we share everything, and we get along great I think" you say sternly "What’s mine is yours"
>Her mouth is agape and you see that ear flicker again
>What does that mean?
>You get up and stretch
>"Hey, you’re supposed to stay in bed!" Radka says with worry in her voice
>"No, I was told not to strain myself, I can go get food" you say as your back pops slightly
>"Then why did you have me get you Ale?!" she snaps 
>"Because I can"
>"I take back my toast you’re a dick"
>You shrug "I wanted to know what it felt like to be waited on"
>"I’m hungry I haven’t eaten in a whole day" you say "I need something to eat"
>"I... I haven’t eaten either" Radka admits
>"Hmm why not?" you query
>"I was worried about you Anon!" she say exacerbated "You literally went into a Deathmatch for me and you think I wouldn’t be worried!?"
>She walks up and hugs you 
>"I...I...thank you Anon... You’ve done so much for me" she says, now in a soft shaky voice "You saved my life, you fought for me, you’ve literally done nothing but nice things for me since we met"
>The hug hurts but you weren’t going to break it
>She was pouring out feelings to you finally 
>You in turn wrap your arms around her and look up into her eyes
>There’s that ear flicker again
>Could that be her equivalent of a blush?
>Were you going to ask? 
>No, that would be dumb considering if it was she would be embarrassed 
>She lets go of you and you hold her for a few more seconds
>You finally let go and begin getting some food ready
>She gets a big, big salad of those weird veggies you don’t like to eat and you got some beef and more ale
>"Were you serious about letting me make some wine?" she finally asks after finishing her meal
>Man she fucking inhaled that thing
>"I’m not "letting you" I don’t get to decide what you can do or not, if you want to make some wine make some wine, you know where to get the cash for the ingredients"
>She smiles "and you’re ok letting me use your - our new place for it?" 
>"Yea as long as it doesn’t like...blow up or something from some weird spell you do" you say before chomping into a bit of your meal
>"It’s not spells it just letting the stuff ferment and knowing what spices and stuff to use" 
>You laugh
>"I know it isn’t spells, I was joking! Honestly I’m not that dumb"
>"You fooled me then" Radka quips at you
>"Ouch my pride" you quip back
>You finish your meal and spend time insulting each other playfully
>You stand up and stretch, multiple snaps and pops greet you as your body heals from being very broken
>"Radka I’m going to go to sleep, hopefully I won’t be hurting so we can go check out our new estate" you say as you walk slowly
>"Hopefully there isn’t a sex dungeon in there" you say with a shudder
>"I...I’ll come with you to bed anon" Radka says quietly
>You stop and turn around to find her already standing and next to you
>"Devin said I should watch and take care of you after all" she says with a small smile
>"Well, I guess I can’t argue Nurse Radka" 
>She play punches you
>Ow
>Going down the stairs was easier than going up them
>You have to take each step cautiously it feels like your legs could give out
>They did at one point and Radka caught you
>You finally reach the top and curse your father for having this place built with so many stairs
>You make your way to the bedroom and get into your basic undergarments and turn to see Radka totally nude
>Her Breasts are as big as Melons and you can truly see how strong she is
>"I don’t sleep in anything" she says noticing your amazed look
>"I... Uhmm....Just...Wow" is all you can say before she gets into your bed
>You slide into the bed after her
>You would be lying to yourself if you hadn’t fantasized this
>Her body was like nothing you had ever seen before and it left you wanting
>You press up against her body, sliding one arm under her neck and the other around her waist
>Her fur is softer than you imagined and silky smooth against you
>You rub up and down her side getting a series of small shivers
>You see her ears flick again and you pull her back to your chest
>If you weren’t in constant pain, you would have the biggest hard on
>But alas for now you were content snuggling with her, rubbing and exploring her body
>You loved every second of it and loved the feel of her
>She likewise seemed to enjoy it, rubbing her back against you and grinding on your crotch with her perfect ass
>You wish you could do something now
>But you could feel yourself fading
>With one last move of strength you lean over and kiss the side of her muzzle
>"I’m glad you’re here" you say as you fade into deep sleep

>You wake up with Radka still in your arms
>She’s still asleep and snoring slightly 
>Cute
>You slide your arm out from under her and get up making sure not to wake her
>You get a view of her body one more time and can’t help but stare
>Her sides and ass are plump and perfectly rounded
>You can even admire her antlers just barely rubbing on the bedframe
>You walk to the kitchen and prepare a breakfast for Radka and a breakfast for you
>She still can only eat plants, you can eat both plants and meat so you prefer mixing them if you can.
>Radka gets on you if you don’t eat your veggies 

>You bring her breakfast in bed
>"Raddddkaaaa" you say softly
>"Mmmm no sleeping" she says trying to shoo you
>You leave the breakfast on the nightstand and get back into bed with her 
>Bliss

>She awakes about 30 minutes later 
>She stretches slowly and rolls over to face you 
>"Good morning Radka" you whisper as her eyes struggles to stay open
>"Mornin'" she whispers back half asleep
>"I made you breakfast, it’s on the table behind you" you say as you rub her sides gently
>"Tanks anon" she says, still groggy
>You get back up and get dressed
>You were going to have to go to the Late Sir Beariston’s estate with Radka and the governor 
>Something about tallying up what you gained and what you could give away or sell
>You walk around the bed and kiss Radka on her head right between her antlers
>"I have an errand to run really quick, I’ll be back and we can go to our new place" she say to her
>"Ok Anon" she says as she sits up and rubs the spot you kissed
>You smile and head out
>You mount up your horse and ride quickly to the governor’s estate
>You knock and after about a minute a small Sheep Beastwoman answers
>"Hello sir, how can I help you" she says keeping her eyes down 
>So submissive
>"Hello Miss, I’m here to see the Governor, please tell him sir -ahem- Lord Anon is here to speak to him" you say to her
>She does a small curtsy and leads you inside
>"I’ll go get my master, please make yourself at home" she says meekly before scurrying off
>After about a minute, you hear scurrying behind you and catch a quick glimpse of a half-dressed dog Beastwoman dart into a doorway
>Shortly after the Governor appears looking like he got dressed in a hurry 
>And he was coming from where you suspected the Dog girl had run from
>Ahhh so that’s why the Governor was so interested in having Beast slaves
>You stored this thought for later 
>"Ah Sir Anon! I mean Lord Anon now! Welcome to my humble home" the governor says slightly panting
>"Did I interrupt something Governor" you say knowing full well that you did "I can come back later after you -ahem- finish"
>He smiles not knowing that you saw his companion
>"Not at all Lord anon, now how can I help you?" he asks catching his breath
>"Today at say noon I would like to go over Beariston properties and other things I have gained" you respond
>"Ah yes, your family never did waste time, I’m surprised you’re back on your feet after the beating you took" 
>You shrug
>"I’m not in pain anymore and I had a very good healer help" you respond
>"Plus I’m sure all the training you went through, in any case noon will be fine, I will meet you at Beariston’s estate" the governors says happy to get rid of you
>You take your leave and ride back to your estate, to find Radka up and dressed in her Maid uniform
>"What was that about Anon?" she asks as you dismount
>"I had to see the governor about the property we gained, something about the bureaucratic processes" you respond as you walk to her
>You give her a quick hug 
>"We are to meet him in about 2 hours" you say as you separate
>"I see" she says dejectedly
>"What?" 
>"What’s a bureaucratic process?" she asks
>Oh
>You spend about 20 minutes explaining the process and everything that goes with it
>She understands some of it but frowns at a few parts
>"You humans are weird" she says finally
>You laugh
>"Yes I guess so"
>"Well, since you said I could make wines, I’m going to run to the market and get some fruits and stuff, I’ll only be gone about an hour" she says turning away from you
>You slide an arm around her waist and pull you to you and kiss her right on her muzzle
>She looks surprised before falling into the kiss herself
>You finally separate and say "be safe we have a lot to do later"
>She smiles "I’m sure we do"

>After an hour Radka returns with a cart full of fruits and spices
>"We need a lot of variety!" she said when you asked why so much
>You help her stash it all away in cupboards
>You mount up and get your second horse for her to ride on
>"I have to ride that?" she says looking at the horse "I don’t know how to ride a horse"
>The only time she’s been on a horse is when your captured her it seems
>You tell her just to get on and that the horse will follow yours
>You ride for the new estate
>You arrive and the Governor is already waiting for you there
>"Ah lord anon right on time" he says
>His eyes fall on Radka
>"Was this the slave that the whole debacle with Beariston was about?" he says looking her up and down as she dismounts
>"She is indeed" you answer 
>"No wonder you would fight for her" her says 
>He leans closer to you "she has breasts like cabbages"
>"Uhh…Thank you" Radka says
>"She also has great hearing!" the governor says 
>"Anyway, let’s get to this!" he says excitedly
>You guess that seeing Radka got him in a good mood
>You start going through the house room by room
>Radka looks around and sniff the air
>"Somethings wrong anon" she says
>You stop and look at her
>As does the governor
>"What does she mean, Lord Anon" he asks
>You look at her and raise your eyebrows for an explanation
>"Something smells off" she says and walks towards a bookcase
>"There’s something behind this bookcase" she says sniffing
>You walk over and push it 
>It’s heavy, too heavy for you to move alone, it its solid wood and 10 feet tall
>Beariston was much bigger than you were
>Radka helps and you both move the bookcase revealing a door
>"Huh that’s weird" the governor says as he casually walks through the door and immediately vomits
>The smell hits you like a ton of stones
>The thick door and the bookcase might have covered the smell but now it was wide open and you could see the contents
>Body parts, blood caked tools, dried blood splatters on the floor
>There is even a table with a body still strapped to it
>"What the fuck" the governor reels back out of the room 
>You rush over and slam the door shut
>"Well I know what room I’m cleaning out first" you say
>"What? Why not have her do it?" the governor says wiping his mouth on a handkerchief 
>"I’m not going to put her through that" you spit the words out before you can stop yourself "There were humans and beast bodies in there and her sense of smell is much better than mine"
>"Ah yes that makes sense, you are experienced with...gore..." he says, still in shock about the room
>"Let’s move on" you say
>"Yes...Yes gladly"
>The rest of the walk through goes smoothly
>"Right then Lord Anon, I hereby relinquish the late Sir Beariston’s properties and title unto you" the governor says at the end
>"Good luck" he adds
>He mounts his own horse and rides off leaving you alone with Radka
>"That was awful" Radka finally says "Did he really have to talk about my breasts?"
>You smile at her
>"He has sex with his own Beastwoman slaves" you confide in her 
>Her eyes go wide "Isn’t he married?"
>"He is indeed, I believe his wife is away most of the time because she takes care of her father" you respond calmly "But we now have to deal with this place"
>"You think we should use this place for making wines and stuff?" she asks you looking up at the estate
>"Well, I’m certainly not living here"
>"Me either"
>You make a mental tally of thing you need to clean that room
>Your first thought was just fire. Burn it all.
>But those were people at one point
>Radka comes up next to you and gives your upper arm a squeeze
>"Let’s go home" She says
>You couldn’t agree more

>Its getting dark as you arrive back at your estate
>You send Radka inside to handle dinner while you feed and stable the horses
>She seems to enjoy cooking for your both even if she is a total vegetarian
>You get inside and she has already finished 
>She has a huge bowl of oats and 6 carrots 
>You have venison and some bread
>You had questioned her if she felt uncomfortable with you eating "feral" deer
>She said it did at first but realized that you were an omnivore and needed to eat
>You both eat in silence for a while
>"I’m glad you stuck up for me in front of the Governor" she says breaking the silence
>"What?"

>"You said you were going to clean that room up instead of making me in front of the governor" she explains "And then you stuck to it, instead of backing down when he confronted you…I...I liked that"
>"Oh" you say simply
>"I wouldn’t make you clean that up, that’s a fucking mess and a half" you say, sipping from a cup of ale
>"Still I appreciate it"
>you walk over and sit next to her as she munches on a carrot
>You put your arm around her waist and pull her into a hug
>"I said I would be there for you and I meant it" you say
>She leans her head onto your shoulder and finishes her carrot 
>You rub her sides and appreciate the curves of her body
>Her generous chub over those steel like muscles
>She in turn puts her arm around you
>You both sit there in silence appreciating each other’s company
>You break the silence finally
>"I...I never thought that day when I captured you...I would capture my best friend and my... well...yea" you say trying to piece the words together
>"I never thought I would have a better life with a human than I did with my own people, I never thought I would met a human willing to die for me" she says 
>"I’m glad that you trusted me from day one" 
>She turns to look at you and you look at her
>Deep into those bright green eyes
>You kiss her and feel her tongue slip past your lips 
>You in turn push back with your tongue and pull her closer to you
>You feel her breasts push against your chest
>Your hands are all over her back rubbing and feeling her soft fur

>Suddenly she pushes you away
>"I...I need to go lay down" She says as she gets up and starts to walk off
>You reach over and grab her wrist gently
>"Don’t go" you plead 
>You look into her eyes, you think you see tears forming
>She pulls her arm away slowly, you watch her ears flick rapidly 
>"I have to go to sleep" she says before turning from you and walking off
>You sit dejected and confused
>Sid you push it too far? She seemed like she was enjoying it
>You sit and finish your ale and get yourself another
>Looks like Alcohol and solitude will be your only companions tonight
>You sit and drink for a while lost in thought about Radka

>Be Radka
>You had just left Anon Alone at his table after a very very passionate kiss
>You were confused about yourself, about Anon, and about who you were to him
>He was your captor, yet he treated you better than your own people had
>He never asked you for anything, other than trust him
>You didn’t understand what you were feeling about him
>He was a great person to talk to, to hang out with and to explore hobbies you had seen humans practicing
>But he was your captor
>So you didn’t understand these feeling you had in your head about him
>You wanted to be with him and stay with him
>You loved the smell of him, on the days he came back from sparring he smelled of Musk and adrenaline 
>He made great company, and would always listen to what you had to say 
>But....
>He was a human, granted a human that nearly died for you, but a human nonetheless
>He had never shown any type of affection other than hugs in thanks for you doing something for him
>At least not before today anyway
>Like when you knew he would be tired after a day of teaching young knights how to use a spear correctly, you had bought the best cut of meat from the butcher and cooked it just the way he liked it
>He was even considerate of how you felt, offering to leave his own dining room table to eat if his eating meat made you uncomfortable
>You found yourself at your bedroom door, you had walked by total muscle memory to it
>You enter your room and place your hands on your muzzle 
>You wanted to go back out there to him
>You wanted to hold him like he held you last night, despite the pain he was in
>But you couldn’t betray your people.
>Could you?
>You had fled from "your own people"
>In the village he captured you from, they were trying to sell you off to the biggest male of the rival tribe for peace
>He treated you as an equal
>You sit down on the floor with your back to the door
>You sit lost in thought about him and yourself
>As you sit, you hear Anon going to his room 
>You had just rejected him in the heat of the moment
>Even when you went to leave he tried to pull you back
>But you pulled away and left him
>He must hate you now or at least will never try to be that passionate again
>You wait there for a bit before getting up and leaving your room
>You walk silently towards his room 
>Hopefully he’s already asleep
>Maybe he'll forgive you, if he wakes up with you next to him
>Or maybe he won’t, but you wanted to be near him

>Be Anon
>You had given up hope that Radka was going to come back out 
>You had hoped she had just lost her nerves and was going to try to get them back
>But you were wrong it seems
>You were disappointed that you thought she could want you
>You take the last gulp of your ale and get up
>You walk 
>You think about her 
>Her feeling
>Her personality
>Her body
>The feel of her fur on your skin
>The heat you felt from her kiss
>You find yourself at her door 
>You go to knock but stop yourself
>If she didn’t want you then, she wouldn’t now
>Besides she was probably asleep
>You walk off to your room and get into your bed
>It seems so much colder without her in it with you
>You lay in bed for a moment when you hear a quiet clicking sound
>You had heard it enough times to recognize those hooves of hers on the wood floors
>You don’t move and pretend to sleep as you hear your door open and the clicking get beside your bed
>You feel your covers shift slightly 
>Uou feel her slide slowly and cautiously into your bed
>You feel her pull your arm around her and in-between her breasts
>You hear her whisper a tearful "I’m sorry Anon"
>You break and pull her closer causing her to give a startled squeak
>You wrap your other arm around her and kiss her neck "its ok we can slow it down if you want"
>She rolls over and faces you
>She then kisses you without warning
>"I don’t want it slower" she says when you both break away "I just want to be with you"
>You smile at that
>Her beautiful green eyes glow like stars
>You pull her into another kiss and rub your hands along her sides
>She rolls back over and you pull her back into your chest, savoring the feeling of her soft fur and the warmness from it
>You feel her Press her prefect ass against your crotch and grind on you gently
>You in turn place your hands on her breasts and explore them
>You at last find her nipples and give them a quick squeeze getting a gasp from her
>She presses against you harder

>You left hand creeps down her side as your right hand continues to massage her breast
>Your hand slides down her side, feeling her fur and exploring her generous chub
>You give her belly a sharp squeeze
>"Mmm I like this" you whisper into her ear as you do it
>She lets out a soft moan
>"Mmmmmmm I’m glad you do Anon" she moans out
>Her ears flick slowly

~~~~~~~
>you awake to the sounds of birds chirping outside
>Radka must already be up because she’s not in bed with you
>You sit up and can hear your body creak and groan
>Maybe letting a reindeer ride you wasn’t the best idea
>You think for a moment
>Worth it
>You stand up out of bed and stretch
>More creaks and pops
>You throw on some clothes and head to the kitchen where you see Radka in only a shirt making breakfast for you two
>"Morning Love" you say with a yawn
>"Morning" she says with a chipper smile
>She brings you a plate of eggs and has a bowl of oatmeal for herself (with extra brown sugar in it)
>You were thinking while you eat
>You didn’t realize how intense you were getting before Radka asks "what’s wrong anon?"
>You snap back into eating from the back of your mind
>"Radka…I don’t want to have to hide this, to have to hide us..." you start
>She’s looking at you confused
>"What?" she asks
>"I want you to go to the common slave places, the pits, the markets, talk to slaves and try to get dirt on as many of the noble families as you can" you tell her
>"Wha-why?" she asks even more confused
>"I’m going to get the king to stop hunting beast and make them full citizens" you explain
>"And that will be easier with noble support?" she asks half to herself half to you
>"Yes, can you do that for me?"
>It was a simple plan, nobles hide familial  secrets away from people who matter, slaves and servants not so much, the best place for info on them was with them

>Radka slowly eats her oats and looks outside
>"You really want us to be a thing?" she asks finally
>"I want us to be a thing that doesn’t have to be hidden, why should I have to hide my love? Why can’t I use this new political power to change it?" you rant mainly to yourself
>"Why do you want it so bad? I’m fine pretending" she says between bites of her food
>"I just want to be able to love you anywhere without having to hide it" you say
>She thinks for a moment
>"Alright Anon. I’ll talk to them other slaves" she says finally
>You walk around the table and hug her from behind
>"I love you Radka, someday I promise ill make you my wife" 
>Her ears flick and one swats you as it does
>"I love you too Anon"


>It’s been several weeks since you asked Radka to find out things about the Noble families
>The Delaney family was apparently stealing other houses prized racing horses and...Eating them? 
>Lord Clawson had be experimenting with illegal magic to try to make hay into gold and had killed several servants trying 
>House Barccus had all male orgies with their slaves
>Lord Stultus had a.....torture chamber that he used often
>The Governor had a Beast Lover...And so did his wife
>Those were only a few 
>You needed to confront the governor first and get him on your side
>You think he might be the easiest to convince though
>As was the case you were knocking on the door to his estate
>The same sheep answered the door
>"H-hello Lord Anon, it's nice to see you again" she says opening the door and leading you inside before she shuts it behind you
>You smile "Good to see you too, Marie right?"
>She freezes up "How did you-" 
>"Radka" you say simply
>"Oh right, let me get the governor for you" she says before hurrying away
> The governor come out shortly after and greets you warmly
>"Lord Anon! What an unexpected surprise!" he says as he shakes your hand
>"Good to see you governor, we have something we need to discuss in Private, but bring your dog servant"

>You watch as he stiffens up, his smile disappears
>"What do you want Anon" has says barely above a whisper
>"I just want to talk, that’s all" you say with a sincere smile
>"Uh huh" he says as he turns from you
>"Marie fetch Elizabeth and have her meet us in the Lounge!" he calls out before turning to face you
>"Follow me" he says simply 
>He leads you deep into the estate and into a large well lit room
>There is a fireplace and a large coffee table surrounded by 3 couches, forming an incomplete square
>The governor walks over to a table with some very expensive looking bottles of liquor are
>"Anything to drink?" he says before pouring a large glass for himself and promptly drinking it down
>Its noon and he just chugged a glass of scotch
>Whew lad did you have him on edge
>He pours himself another and sits on a couch
>You sit on the couch opposite him
>After about a minute of waiting, a border collie Beastwoman enters the room
>"Close the doors behind you Elizabeth" the governor says
>"Yes Master" she says before turning and closing the doors
>She then walks over and sits next to him with a confused look on her face
>"Master what’s goin-"
>"You can drop the act" you say dismissively
>She looks at you with more confusion
>You sigh
>"I know what’s going on between you too"
>She looks alarmed and he looks glum
>"What do you want from me Anon? My title? My house? My...my Lover?" the governor croaks out
>You roll your eyes
>"No! I already said I just want to talk" you say exhaustively
>"Then why bring this up" she asks
>"Because I want your support, I want to petition the king to change the laws regarding beast men and to do that I need support" you explain calmly
>The governor looks shocked
>"Why do you...." his voice trails off 
>"The reindeer?"
>You nod
>Suddenly his smile is back
>Elizabeth is confused again
>"What? You mean His slave Radka? The one he fought Beariston about?" she asks
>"I think our friend Anon here is like us" the governor says

>"Like us?" Elizabeth asks
>"He is in love with that reindeer of his" the governor responds, still smiling "Am I correct Anon"?
>you nod
>"I want people to be able to love who they love without hiding it" you say simply
>"You have my support then Anon, however what about the other houses?" he asks you
>"You were the first I can to but I have some dirt on other houses, I won’t let them in on the details but I’ll get their support" 
>He nods
>"Very well, when the time comes you will have our support" he says putting an arm around Elizabeth
>You smile "I’ll see myself out then" 
>You stand up and go to leave
>"Anon, be careful out there, some people don’t want things to change" Elizabeth says
>You Nod in acknowledgement "I got it covered"
>You leave the room and make your way to the front door
>"Ah Uhmm t-thank you Lord Anon" Marie says with a bow
>you smile "Just Anon will do Marie"
>She fidgets "o-ok Anon" she says before looking at her shoes, her ears fluttering
>Hm you’ve only seen Radka's ears to that 
>You mount up and head to the Delaney residence
>The Delaney’s were newer Nobles having gained power from wealth earned from gambling
>You never had dealt with them as they usually had a hand in "underground" activities
>You think they will be easy to persuade, after all they favor money over anything else
>You arrive after about 40 minutes
>Their estate also has a race track for horses or any other animal so it was located outside the city
>You knock and to your surprise the door opens almost immediately
>"Took ya lon- Hey you ain’t Nigel" 
>A man opened the door and is now looking at you confused
>"Whatchu want?" he asks you 
>"I’m here to see Lord Delaney, if yo-"
>"No one just sees Pa ya wanker, you best get out of here before I fuck you up" he interrupts you

>"I am LORD Anon Here to speak with LORD Delaney" you say firmly to him 
>You lean in closer "Unless you want to explain to your father why the man who killed sir Beariston is now challenging him to a duel, I suggest you fuck off and tell him"
>Your voice is cold malice
>You don’t have time for this bullshit
>The color drains from his face
>"Right....Right away lord Anon" he stammers looking both ashamed and afraid
>He closes the door leaving you waiting outside
>Hm manners maketh the man 
>These people seemed to know nothing of it though
>Even Radka who had grown up in the forest was more polite than these fucks
>You wait outside for about 10 minutes before the door reopens
>"Ah Lord Anon, the younger one too, here to see me?" 
>You look to the voice and see an older man
>He's about 50 from the look of him but his eyes
>His eyes have the look of a younger man, a man who loves to see every new exciting thing that can happen
>He has a warm smile and he extends a hand out to you
>"Sorry for my boy's rude reaction to you" he says still smiling as you take his hand in a friendly handshake
>"It’s not every day we get an... Unexpected visitor" he says shaking your hand wildly
>"I don’t usually make house calls" you say with a smile
>"Ah yes you've been trained in battle, not politics" he says releasing your hand and beckoning you inside
>The main foyer is large enough to fit 50 people easily
>There are a few overly padded chairs around 
>He sits in one and smiles
>"Please have a seat, the now lord Anon" he says gesturing to a chair across from him
>"I bet on that fight between you and Beariston" he says with a warm smile as you sit
>"I bet you would lose actually"
>Great

>"Well I’m happy to have made you lose that bet" you say with a smile
>"Actually so am I, Beariston was a monster of a person, everyone knew it, you're a much more sensible person to deal with" he responds with a bright smile
>Fuck he's good 
>You can’t drag this out, he's a master negotiator and you aren’t
>You smile back 
>"Look. I just want your houses support on some... petitions I have ideas for" you say 
>"Ah right to the point then, fine you have my support; provided you do something for me" he says with a calculated smile
>Fuck me
>"What do you want then Lord Delaney" you say with cold indifference
> "I have some...things I need hidden, if you can-" 
>"Done" you cut him off
>"The late sir Beariston had a hidden dungeon in his estate, if you have people clean it of the....offal.... that he created, it’s yours to use as you please" 
>"So eager! I like that! And what promises do I have that it won’t be found?" He has a smile that you with you could have
>"The rest of the estate is going to be used for wine making by my slave, no one knows about it and rooms with random whatever would be dismissed as secret spices" you answer him with cold indifference
>You don’t care if he is hiding bodies as long as they don’t look like bodies
>"Alright then "Lord" Anon you have my support on anything you purpose although I don’t care much as long as I make a profit" he says as he spits into his hand and then extends it to you 
>You follow suit and shake his hand
>Gross
>"Well alright then Anon, you have my support" he says
>"Just stop that reindeer of yours asking questions ok?"
>Caught
>"Ok I will" you answer "I’ll take my leave then"
>"We will see you around" he says

>You leave the Delaney estate and head home
>Today was productive to say the least
>Gaining 2 supporters for your petition 
>You didn’t know if the others would be as easy to persuade
>In fact, you knew Lord Stultus wouldn’t listen to you at all
>He still blamed you for the death of his incompetent son
>But still, you were going to get his support regardless of what you had to do
>The ride to your estate is a long one, the Delaney household is on the other side of the city
>You arrive and see Radka outside getting all her fruits and spices ready to start making wine
>"Hi Anon! You’re just in time to help me get all this to the new place!" she says with a warm excited smile
>You smile at her and dismount your horse 
>"We have support from the governor and the Delaney’s, Plus the Delaney’s will clean that room for us in exchange for them being able to use it as a hiding place" you say as you start helping her
>"Ooo that’s great Anon! I never wanted to go into that room anyway, too....gross..." she says
>You get everything ready and head to the new estate which you were going to call the Winehouse because you could 
>You both headed there laden with various fruits 
>"This is going to be fun! I haven’t made wine in so long and I want to try new things!" Radka chats happily as you make your way there
>You arrive and start taking things into the Winehouse 
>Radka puts down what she’s carrying and you walk over to her
>You kiss you passionately and pull her close to you
>You wrap your arms around her and pull her close to you
>She breaks away after a second
>"What as that for Anon" her green eyes blaze 
>"I’m in a good mood and I missed hanging out with you today" you say rubbing your hands down her back before resting them on her plump ass
>You squeeze it and kiss her again
>Her hands are on your back and massaging you gently
>You pick her up, getting a squeak of surprise
>She wraps her legs around you regardless of her surprise

>You carry her to the nearest flat surface which just so happens to be a small table
>It creaks in protest as you set her on it but you ignore it
>You pull away from her and pull her panties off her
>Who would have thought this maid outfit would have been so great for easy access?
>Her panties are thrown to the floor and forgotten 
>You begin kissing down her body, focusing on her neck
>Then her breasts which you expose and give a health suck on bot nipples
>You kiss and squeeze her tummy
>You kiss downwards to her thighs and then focus on her clit
>You kiss and lick it 
>Her legs are on your shoulders, her hands on the back of your head
>You continue licking and kissing her clit then push 2 fingers into her pussy
>Her insides are warm and wet and very inviting
>Her juices tasty and sweet
>You lick and suck her clit getting moans and gasps as you work your fingers in and out of her
>You knew where her spot was, so you being your trademark alternating finger curls to graze her g spot over and over
>She’s pushing your head deeper into her pussy, her fingers running through your hair
>"Oooh Anon you know just what I like" she purrs out between the gasps
>You would smile but your mouth is a little busy 
>You lap at her clit harder 
>You can feel her muscles shuddering and spasming 
>Her legs wrap around you tight and you feel her convulse violently 
>She relaxes and lets you up stroking her fingers down your chest as you stand up
>"Lose the pants" 
>You quickly take off your pants exposing your already rock hard erection
>"I’m always surprised at how big it is Anon" she says looking into your eyes
>You position yourself against her wetness and push in with one quick sharp thrust
>She gasps and then wraps her legs around your waist, her arms over your shoulder
>Your hands are on her ample hips
>You kiss her and feel her tongue fight yours 
>Slowly at first, you push and pull yourself in and out of her
>You squeeze her hips and speed up

>The table groans in protest as you fuck her harder
>She’s gasping and moaning between your kisses 
>The muscles in her pussy clamp down on you hard
>You move your hand and put your thumb on her clit and tweak it firmly as you push deeper into her than before
>Her eyes go wide from the sensation and her legs tighten their hold of you
>"Ah ah a-a-non! I’m so close keep going! Faster! Deeper!" She cries 
>You follow her instructions and pump faster into her
>Her legs spasm around you and she pulls you to her
>You maintain enough distance to keep going like a piston into her wetness
>"Do it Anon, give me it all" she says before kissing you
>You give one final hard thrust and release everything into her
>Her walls coil and milk everything from you
>You stay pushed deep into her, she’s holding you close and rubbing your back
>"I love you Anon" she says looking into your eyes
>You put a hand on the side of her muzzle
>"I love you too Radka"

~
>Winter is here
>The Winehouse is all set up and there is plenty of fermenting fruits 
>You have been going to various noble houses gaining support for your cause
>But one of the things that’s been standing out recently is other lords are struggling
>The harvest this year was not as good as previous years
>You and Radka had enough but other houses had huge numbers of family members 
>People were starving
>You were cautious and had gone hunting and been able to get some quail and a deer for yourself
>You had also bought a bunch of wheat and oats for Radka before winter even hit
>You get to your estate and clean the deer and butcher it
>After all that is done, you head inside
>Odd
>Radka normally greets you
>"Radka?" you call out into the house
>Silence
>You begin to panic
>"RAKDA?!?!" you shout
>"I’m in my room" you hear her call out
>She sleeping in your room now
>After all you two had sex just about every moment you could
>You go to her bedroom door and knock
>"Radka you ok?" you ask as you open the door
>"No don’t come I-!"

>You don’t know what you were expecting but it wasn’t this
>Radka was there Naked but...
>She only had one antler
>"Don’t you dare laugh!" 
>You have to stop yourself
>You swallow down the laughter and put on a serious face
>"Oh well that’s new" you say walking forward and picking up the one antler that had fallen off
>"I’m Molting you jerk its normal" she quips as she tries to take the antler from you
>You dance away from her 
>"I’m keeping this! I wanna keep them both" you say as you dodge away from her
>"No that’s weird Anon! Gimme it!" she makes a grab at you but you slide under her arms and run out the door
>"YOU FUCK!" She calls after you
>She’s now chasing you around the house
>You’re laughing like a madman and she’s swearing up a storm 
>She finally catches you with a flying tackle that sends the antler skidding across the floor
>"I’m still keeping them" you say as you wrestle to get on top of her
>She however has you firmly pinned 
>"Why do you want to keep them!?! I’ll make more!" she asks as she sits on you
>"I just want to! I like having little things like that around! It’s a fun reminder of our first year together!" you say as you struggle to get away
>She sighs "fine you can keep them but no making anything weird with them"
>She lets you up and you sit on the floor next to her
>You reach over to grab the one on her head
>She slaps your hand away
>"No touching! My head is sensitive and it hurts if you try to pull it out, we'll just have to wait till it falls out" 
>You scoot closer to her and hug her
>"It’s gonna be weird seeing you without antlers" you say as you squeeze her side
>"Just wait till I grow the little ones with velvet on them" she says
>You stand up and help her up
>"How did the hunt go by the way?" she asks 
>"I got some game quail and a deer" 
>"I want to go out and forage in the forest sometime, I know a lot of plants out there that I can eat or make good tea out of" 
>"That’s cool! I’ll come with you and try to learn them"
>What a fun date that would be

>You’re both sitting on the floor relaxing when you get a sudden knock at your front door
>You weren’t expecting anyone today
>Radka looks at you, then panics 
>Before you can say anything, she runs to her room and slams the door shut
>You get up and stroll to the door and open it up
>It’s the governor and Elizabeth
>"Ah Uhmm Hello Governor, I wasn’t expecting you today" you say ushering them in
>"Please Anon call me Bruce" he says as he walks in 
>You close the door behind them and turn to face them
>"So what can I do for you today Bruce?" you ask as you lead them to your living room
>"We would like to discuss you taking in one of my slaves Anon" he says sitting down
>What
>"Uhh I don’t quite understand what you mean Bruce" you say quizzically
>"You remember Marie? The sheep? She’s totally smitten with you and Radka" Elizabeth is the one to speak this time
>You’re very confused
>"Yes, I remember her but what? Smitten? Me AND Radka?" you ask
>"She is totally infatuated with you and Radka yes, we only know this because we found her...sketches and asked her about them" Elizabeth explains
>"Sketches?" 
>Elizabeth’s ears flick and fold down
>"Very....Erotic sketches of you and Radka, and you and her, and her and Radka" Elizabeth clarifies
>"Which is why we think she'll be happier with you here" Bruce says calmly
>"But hold up, I don’t even know her, why would she be so infatuated with me?" you ask
>"You'll have to ask her that, but will you take her in? I know she'll be well taken care of" 
>"Uhmm - I- uh- I guess" you say
>You hear Radka’s door open and hear her shout "Fine with me too!"
>Radka walks out of her room and plops herself on the couch next to you
>"Ah Lovely as ever Radka" Bruce says "I see you’re molting"
>"Thank you and yes I am, it’s a bit embarrassing to be seen but I want to hear about this" 
>"Ah yes of course, as I told Anon we think our friendly Sheep Marie would be happier with you two here" Bruce explains to her
>"Yes of course! That would be fun!" Radka says quickly
>You hadn’t expected her to agree so quickly
>"We talk all the time at the markets! She’s a great friend! We talk about everything!" Radka explains 
>"When can she get here?" you ask
>Bruce smiles
>"She’s outside waiting in the carriage actually" 
>Damn they're good
>Elizabeth stands up "I’ll go get her!" 
>She bounds out the door and after a little bit, she comes back in leading the sheep girl behind her
>"What’s going on" Marie asks looking from you to Radka to Bruce
>"You didn’t tell her?" you ask
>"Surprise Marie! Anon and Radka just agreed to you living with them from now on!" Elizabeth happily exclaims
>Marie stands there staring at Elizabeth
>"What?" 
>"You are going to live with us now Marie!" Radka says jumping up and hugging the sheep
>"We'll bring your things by later" Elizabeth says "Even your drawings"
>"Radka why don’t you and Marie go to your now old room, I’ll help you move your things to mine once I see our guests off" you say standing up
>Radka pulls Marie along to the room and you hear her moving things around
>You walk Bruce and Elizabeth to the door 
>"You better take care of Marie Anon" Elizabeth says shooting you a dangerous look
>"Of course he will, you saw what he did for Radka" Bruce answers for you
>They walk to their carriage still talking
>"Don’t take too long with that petition Lord Anon" Bruce yells out of the carriage
>"I won’t" you yell back
>You head back inside and see Radka and Marie carrying her things to your room
>"You like gardening right? Anon has a big garden in the back where you can plant whatever! He doesn’t care about that stuff" Radka says to Marie as they walk by
>You peek into Radka’s old room
>Dam they worked fast
>You stroll around the house and see Radka’s molted Antler on the floor and pick it up 
>You had almost forgotten about it
>Then you go to your room and see Radka hanging her cloths in the wardrobe with Marie behind her looking, well, sheepish

>"I didn’t expect this" she says noticing you looking at her
>"Radka and I are happy to have you here" you say with a smile
>Her ears flick back and forth 
>"Done! Now we just need to wait till they bring your stuff Marie" Radka says turning from the wardrobe
>Your life is going to be getting a lot more interesting

>True to their words the governor and Elizabeth bring by Maries things 
>You notice Elizabeth give Marie a stack of parchments and a bunch of drawing equipment
>Marie looks flustered as Elizabeth whispers something in her ear
>You watch her ears wiggle quickly before she sees you looking and darts away to her room
>She’s a strange one
>You help bring in everything else and then settle in for the night
>Snow has started falling outside and you have the fire going in the fireplace
>"Fucking finally!" Radka says as she walks over to the couch where you were sitting
>She points to her head and her other antler has fallen out
>"That thing was throwing my whole head off balance" she says as she rubs the spot where it was
>"My horns are due to fall out soon too" Marie says as she walks into the room
>You had always seen her in a uniform but now she was wearing leisure cloths
>A Basic tank top and shorts
>You also got a view of her body too
>She’s about a foot shorter than you, has two 6 inch curved horns
>Her hips are extremely wide and she had breasts the size of apples
>"Aren’t you cold Marie?" You ask her
>She looks at you and her ears flick quickly
>"Uh....n-no Master Anon, I have all this wool" she says indicating the fuzzy wool all over her body
>"Just Anon will do Marie, and I guess you have to shear it?"
>More ear twitches
>”Ah...y-yes I do...I’ll need help with that too" she mumbles
>Radka is smiling
>"Ohh someone has a crush on my Anon" she says half teasing half seductively
>Marie’s ears are flapping so fast you could swear she was going to take flight
>"N-no I don’t, I-I...I’m just not used to him yet!" Marie protests
>"Nu uh don’t lie to me Marie"
>Radka slides over to you and lays on her stomach with her face near your crotch
>"Elizabeth told us about the pictures you drew"
>Radka is unzipping your pants
>”WH-what are you talking about!? What are you d-doing?" Marie protests
>She’s cute when she’s flustered
>"I think you know what I’m doing" Radka says as she pulls your member out and strokes it
>You can feel her hot breath on it
>Marie is squirming slightly at the sight of Radka stroking you but stares transfixed
>You place a hand on Radka Plump rear and give it a quick Smack
>"Lick it Radka"
>"Ooo yes Anon" She purrs before giving it a few very wet licks
>Radka is looking at Marie while she licks you
>"Don’t you want to have some Fun Marie?" Radka says before taking your shaft into her mouth
>Marie has her hand at her crotch and is squirming
>She slowly gets up and walks over
>You can clearly see her legs shaking
>She kneels in front of you and is staring as Radka bobs slowly on your shaft
>"C-can I try Radka?" she says softly
>Radka opens her mouth and licks you one last time 
>"Mhm but first" 
>She pulls Marie into a kiss 
>Marie looks startled at first then relaxes into it
>"See? Much better" Radka purrs
>You slip your hand under Radka’s pants and push one finger into her slit
>Marie takes your member into her soft hands and it rubbing up and down slowly
>She’s just staring at it as she does this
>"Bigger than you thought huh?" Radka says as she spreads her legs so you can push a bit further into her
>"Y-yea" Marie stammers
>"Why don’t you try to lick it" Radka says seductively 
>"C-can I?" Marie asks looking up at you
>You nod
>She nervously opens her mouth and starts to slowly move her head towards your cock before backing off a bit
>"I-I don’t know if I can" She says looking away from you and Radka
>"Anon why don’t you help our nervous little sheep" Radka says as she runs a hand down your thigh
>"With pleasure dear" you say as you grab the back of Maries head with your free hand
>"Open Wide Marie" Radka teases
>"W-wai-!" 
>You pull her head and shove your member into her mouth mid word
>"It’s rude to talk with your mouth Full little sheep" you say as you pull her down until you feel her gag slightly
>Radka gets up and then kneels behind Marie
>She pulls Marie's tank top down exposing her Breasts and bright pink nipples
>"You want to feel good too right?"
>"Mhmmm" Marie moans into your cock 
>You guide her head with a slow rhythmic motion 
>Oh wait she has horns
>You grab both horns and use them like handles to guide her as Radka’s hands creep down Maries body and to her crotch
>”Oh myyyy someone is wet" Radka says as she pull 2 fingers up to show you them
>They are glistening with Marie’s wetness 
>Radka licks her fingers and then slides them back down to finger Marie
>"Anon what’s that thing you do when you finger me?" Radka says softly as she kisses Maries Neck
>You remove one hand from your grips and Show the finger motions you do, making sure Marie can see it as well
>"Ohh right"
>Marie’s reaction is immediate
>She’s shivering and moaning on your cock as you continue to guide her head
>"Radka do you think our little sheep is thirsty" you ask 
>"mMhmmm I do Anon, do you have something for her?" 
>Radka is teasing Maries nipples with one hand and fingering her with the other
>"Oh I think so" you begin moving her faster
>Marie isn’t resisting as you push your cock deeper into her throat with each pull 
>You groan as you get close
>"Do it Anon give our sheep a drink" Radka encourages you
>You pull her down and release into her mouth with a groan
>You can feel her tongue licking around you as she tries to get it all
>You let go of her horns and she backs away until she just has the tip
>You feel a soft lick as she tries to get the last bit of cum off it
>Radka then pulls Marie into another kiss
>You watch them both make out with each other and can feel your erection return with a vengeance
>The kiss finally breaks 
>"Ah I wanted some too" Radka murrs at you 
>Marie isn’t saying anything though
>She’s a shivering mess, you can see her pants are soaked through
>"Hm Hm I think she might want more Anon" Radka teases as she runs a finger over Maries Perky nipples
>"I think we should go to the bedroom and show her some more fun" you say as you stand up 
>You then pick Marie up and carry her to your bedroom with Radka following closely
>You lay her on the bed and strip her of her soaked shorts and her shirt
>Radka is already Naked and she helps you out of your cloths

>Marie is still shivering but is now looking up at you
>"You ready for the real thing little sheep?" Radka cooes to her 
>Marie nods
>"No no no, you have to say it!"
>Radka is sliding onto the bed next to Marie, leaving you standing at the edge of it
>Her hand sliding down to Maries drenched pussy
>"I-I want A-anon" 
>"What do you want to do?" Radka is rubbing Maries Clit while kissing down her neck
>Your dick is diamonds
>"I-I want A-anon t-to...” Maries is gasping trying to get the words out as Radka starts sucking her nipples while still rubbing her clit
>"You want me to what Marie" you ask as you prod Marie’s wet lips
>"P-please A-anon I want you t-to “she gasps "f-fuck me please"
>"Good Girl" you say calmly before shoving your Cock into her with one solid thrust
>Marie Bucks up into you and she lets out a "Aahhhhnnnn fuckkkk" 
>Did she really just cum from you putting it in?
>Radka had been teasing her
>She was tight, very tight
>It felt similar to Radka but the pressure on you was in different places
>You Begin to slowly pull out of her only to quickly thrust back in 
>Radka is still rubbing on Maries clit and is looking up at you
>You in turn put you hand on her pussy and begin rub her clip
>You continue thrusting into Marie and savor the feeling of each time you thrust her spasms slightly

>"Mmmmmmm Anon, I want fun too" Radka murrs quietly to you
>You pull out of Marie and Push into Radka
>Tightness all around 
>Marie has regained composure and is watching you fuck Radka intently
>Radka wraps her legs around you as you speed up thrusting into her
>Marie slides off the bed and pulls you into a kiss
>Her tongue pushes into your mouth and yours pushes into hers
>"Mmmm Sexy" Radka cooes "Anon, do you think we should let our little sheep feel you cum inside her?"
>"That depends on what she wants" you say and you pull away from the kiss
>You look into her Hazel eyes
>"What does the little sheep want?
>"Please Anon let me feel you cum deep in me" Marie whispers shyly
>You smile as you pull out of Radka
> "Aww I was close..." 
>"Come here then" you say as you lay on the bed
>"Ooo I see what Lord Anon wants me to do" Radka cooes suddenly
>Maries straddles you and positions herself over your cock before sliding down onto it
>You place your hands on her wide hips to help guide her
>Radka in turn straddles your face
>You bury your mouth into her pussy and lick her clit and lips
>Marie starts Bouncing gently on your cock 
>"Ooo Faster little sheep" Radka teases her
>You lick deeper into Radka pussy 
>She tastes bitterly sweet
>Marie speeds up the bouncing and you begin thrusting up into her
>You focus your tongue on Radka's clit
>"H-holy fuck A-anon" Radka Gasps
>Marie isn’t saying anything intelligible

>She now falls forward onto your chest
>"T-that was f-fantastic Anon” she says softly
>You pet her head with your left hand and pull Radka close with the other
>You three bask in the afterglow before drifting off to sleep.

>It’s been about 2 months since Marie moved in with you and Radka
>Most nights were sex filled evenings between you three
>Some nights were comfy cuddles by the fire
>Sheep wool and reindeer fur are great for keeping warm
>As well you had been going from noble house to noble house gaining support
>Some just joined you outright
>But most...most asked for food
>The harvest was worse than you had thought if nobles were basically begging for food
>When you asked Marie and Radka how your own food was looking they smiled and said it was fine
>You had the idea they were keeping something from you but you didn’t push it
>At last the only house left was Stultus, the father who still blamed you for his son's death the day you met Radka
>You were riding to the Stultus estate with a knot growing in your stomach
>Radka had gained information about him from other slaves
>He kept a torture room where he would vent his anger on some poor....something
>You mentally apologized to the poor creature as you walked to the door and knocked
>A Small Cat Beastman opened the door and looked up at you
>"Uh.....Hi" you say to him
>"Hello Sir, Lord Stultus is...busy can you come back later?" the little cat says
>"No, tell him Lord Anon is here to see him" you say calmly
>The cat winces slightly at your words and closes the door
>After a few minutes of waiting in the brisk winter air, you hear what sounds like shouting behind the door
>A different Cat, a female this time, opens the door and invites you in
>"Follow me" she says leading you into the house
>You instantly regretted being unarmed as you were growing suspicious
>She leads you to a library were Lord Stultus is sitting 
>"Ah the renowned Lord Anon, the bear killer and murderer of my son, here to see me finally" he says looking up from his book
>"I have heard of you going from house to house, trying to get support for something and wondered when you would come"
>He closes his book and looks at you with a frown
>"You won’t be getting any support from me however" he says
>"You got my son killed and then have the audacity to come to me. Do you have no shame?"
>Looks like you’re going to have to do this the hard way
>"I have plenty of shame but your Idiot son isn’t one of them Sir"
>His mouth is agape 
>"How dar-" he starts
>"You sit there telling me how I let your idiot of a son die when he charged into a WALL, either you never taught him how to fight or you taught him totally wrong, perhaps as a joke" you push the insults further
>You take a seat across from him even though he never offered a seat and you cross your legs and look at him
>"I did come here for your support but upon arriving I realized I don’t need it, after all who would listen to a house whose name literally means Stupid?"
>his face is red with anger
>"That’s what it means right? Latin for stupid? I even read up on why your house has the name! Apparently your great great great grandfather got the Kings 3rd son or was it 2nd son? Killed in a hunting accident and the king changed it to Stultus" you say with a cold smile
>"You...You fucking Knight, you think you have power now? You walk into my house and insult me, insult my son and insult my abilities! I’ll fucking show you, you spit on my honor so ill spit on your grave. I challenge you to a duel SIR Anon" he spits at you
>Just as planned
>You smile
>"Tomorrow then" you say as you stand up and walk away
>"I'll fucking kill you Anon! Or My name isn’t STULTUS!" he yells as you walk out
>You actually laugh at that
>You leave and head home
>Tomorrow is going to be interesting

>You once again stand in the waiting area of the Arena
>Radka and Marie are with you helping you put on your Armor
>"You sure this is a good idea Anon?" Marie asks you as she tightens the clasps on your gauntlets
>"Anon will be fine Marie" Radka assures her
>"Just don’t get hurt to bad this time ok Anon?"
>You smile but realize you have a helmet on
>"I’ll try not to" you say calmly
>You have your spear and shield ready
>Suddenly, there is a knock on the door
>Marie looks confused, but you nod at her to open it
>Lord Delaney walks in 
>"Ah Lord Anon, I was hoping to see you before the fight, " he says
>He hands you a long curved dagger, which you affix to your belt
>"I didn’t bet against you this time, don’t make me a loser again" he says with a smile before leaving
>"What was that about and what’s that Dagger Anon?" Radka asks
>"Just part of the plan" you say calmly
>You Slide your Visor up and Kiss Radka then Kiss Marie
>"I’ll be right back" you say with a grin
>You walk out into the Arena to cheers
>You feel the brisk winter air and breathe out small bits of steam
>You raise your spear to the crowd getting further cheers
>You wait for a moment before Stultus walks out of his waiting area
>He gets cheers as well although not nearly as many
>Bruce, errr the governor raises his hands for silence
>"Are the Duelists ready?" he shouts
>You raise your spear again 
>Stultus draws his sword and raises it
>"Then you may begin!" he says to roaring cheers
>You Instantly Heft up your Spear and take a running lunge 
>You Fling the spear at him and continue running
>He barely has time to put up his shield before the spear collides with it 
>By the time he recovers, you’re on him
>He swings his sword at you but you block it and place your Free hand on his Helmet
>You let lose a fireball directly into his helmet
>With a Loud Bang his helmet flies off and he is sent flying back from the force
>They always forget you can use magic
>He picks himself up as you pant slightly
>That took a bit out of you, running in armor and using magic like that
>You draw your dagger and have your shield ready
>His face is one of fury
>He charges and is swinging his sword wildly
>He’s not even using any technique just flailing about
>Hou take a swing with your dagger but he parries it
>You’re wide open and he tries to stab you but you’re able to dodge to the side
>You ram him with your shield and then slam it downwards onto his foot
>the sound crunching of metal and bone and screams fill the air
>You’ve crushed his foot
>He doesn’t have long to scream before you stab the dagger into his neck
>the crowd goes wild as he falls and his blood soaks the ground
>You pant and then raise your shield 
>Victory or death and death would have to wait again


>The following day
>You are at the once Stultus estate with Radka and Marie
>It’s now yours along with all the slaves and things inside
>You walk in and are greeted by not 2 but 4 Cats
>"Uhh Hi" you say to them
>"Hello Master, we are yours to command now" one cat says
>"I’m Sheryl"
>"I’m Meryl"
>"I’m Deryl"
>"And I’m Derrell"
>You blink at them
>"Seriously those are your names?" you ask 
>Sheryl Sighs
>"Lord Stultus was not a creative man" she says
>"Anyway, where is it" you ask
>They look at each other and shift on their feet uncomfortably
>"Where is what...?" Deryl ...or was that one Derrell, asks
>You look at Radka
>"The torture chamber you told me about" she says to Meryl
>"We aren't allowed in there" Sheryl says
>"I didn’t ask who was allowed where, take me to it now" you say firmly
>You didn’t have time to bring them up to speed on the various parts of being your "slave"
>Something was in that room and it probably needed to be put out of its misery
>The cats look uncomfortable
>Marie steps forward "You aren’t in trouble we just need to see what we have to clean up"
>Sheryl steps forward
>"Follow me" she says
>She leads you through the Estate and up to a fireplace where she pulls a candle holder
>"We aren’t supposed to know about this room but we...we heard the screams" she says as the fireplace swings open
>In the room is a large table, there are various tools and instruments all neatly arranged
>You look around and see a figure slumped in a corner 
>You look at Marie and Radka and walk towards it
>Grabbing a torch, you walk closer to it to get a better view
>Oh god
>It’s a small Opossum girl
>Her small body is covered in scars, half her tail is missing, there are fresh wounds all over her back
>She looks up and you and immediately begins to weep silently, and tries to cower further into the corner
>One of her eyes is badly damaged and you can see fluid leaking out of the socket
>You can tell she’s been starved
>You snap out of your trance
>"Radka get Devin, Marie get Water and Food ready, Cats Get a blanket and a bath ready" you order
>"What is it Anon?" Radka says as she walks up
>"NOW!" you shout
>You never raised your voice before and that sends them all scampering off to their various tasks
>You kneel next to the poor girl
>"I’m not here to hurt you, its ok its ok" you says softly to her
>She whimpers and is shivering in fear
>"Blanket" 
>One of the cats hand you a blanket
>You gently pick up the opossum 
>She goes limp, playing opossum? You don’t know but you wrap the blanket around her
>You carry her out of the room 
>"Cats gather everything in that room and either burn it or give the metal to the blacksmith" you order
>Marie arrives with water and a bowl of oatmeal
>She sets it down and walks over 
>"Anon, what’s this all about-" she stops mid-sentence as she see the Girl and her hands go to her mouth
>"Oh god" is all she can say
>You get the water and put it to the opossum’s mouth 
>"Here’s some water and food" you assure her
>She stops playing dead and drinks the water greedily
>Marie hands you the oatmeal bowl and you begin feeding her
>You notice most of her teeth have been pulled out
>You take your time feeding her spoonfuls of oatmeal
>Radka arrives after about half an hour with Devin
>"Anon what’s going on" Devin says as he walks into the room
>Radka walks over to you
>Her reaction is the same as Maries 
>You carefully set the Opossum down and let Devin look her over
>"Oh my...most of these wounds are years old"
>He looks at her eye
>"I can’t fix that eye either... I can heal these open sores and lacerations though"
>You look at the cats
>"How long has she been here?"
>The cats look at each other
>"We don’t know, all we know is that he uses that room whenever he has a bad day" Darrell says
>You grimace and look at her
>It was probably your fault that her eye was like that
>"Anon can you pick her up and carry her to the bath? We need to wash these wounds before I heal them"


>You pick her up gently and carry her to the bathroom of the house
>The cats had warm water already in it
>She’s clinging to you, afraid of the water
>"It’s ok" you say 
>She refuses to let go
>Welp gotta do what you gotta do
>You climb into the tub with her still clinging to you
>Clothes and all
>"Radka can you hand me a rag and some soap" you say as you unwrap the Opossum from the blanket
>Radka Gives you a rag and you begin washing the open wounds and sores on her back 
>She whimpers slightly as you do
>Marie is talking to the Opossum reassuring her 
>"Anon I don’t think she can talk" Marie says as she looks at you
>"I think you’re right" you say as you finish washing her
>"Devin what are we going to do about that eye?" you say as you pull yourself out of the tub
>You shiver slightly from the water
>You get a good look at her paws
>Some of the digits were missing
>"Oh you poor thing, how long were you in that room?" you say rocking her gently
>Devin is shifting his weight uncomfortably 
>"I ...Uhmm...We...Uhmm..." 
>"Out with it Devin!" you snarl
>He jumps at your sudden ferocity
>"Sorry Devin"
>He looks down at his feet
>"Its ok Anon, I need to Uhmm... Pull the damaged eye out before it gets infected and then heal the wound" he says with a Frown
>You look down at the small girl
>"Ok what do you have for pain?' you ask
>"Uhmm I have Poppy milk, it’ll put her to sleep pretty easy then we can get to work fixing her up" he says reaching into his bag
>"OK let me dry her off then we can get to it" you say
>Radka and Marie Help you dry her with some blankets from the other room 
>They also help dry you off
>"What are we going to call her?" Radka Asks
>"What about Kathrine?" says Marie with a smile
>"That will work" 
>Devin Hands you a small bottle of white liquid
>"Ok Kathrine I need you to drink this for me" you say as you uncork the bottle and hand it to her
>She looks at it then at you with an unsure look in her eye
>"It’ll make you sleep so we can heal your wounds better" you assure her
>She looks at it one more time then downs it in a gulp
>She sticks her tongue out in disgust
>"Bleh" is the sound she makes
>"I know its gross, but after you wake up well make you some good Oatmeal"
>"Merrr" 
>She makes a little sound then her eyes close
>She’s still breathing at least
>"Ok Devin, what do you need me to do" you ask
>"Uhmm. Place her on a table and hold her eye open" he says shifting slightly
>"Anon I’m not sure I can do this, I mean, look at her! She’s been torn apart by Stultus! I don’t want to do anything else to her...”
>You grab his collar and pull him to see her
>"You want to Pussy out because of what someone else did? SHE needs your help Devin, I need your help, and you’re the only one I trust to do this"
>You let him go and he straightens his stance
>"You’re right Anon, let’s get to it then"
>You carry her to a large wooden table and set her down softly
>"Marie, Radka you might want to look away, I doubt this will be pretty" you say
>Radka walks over and hugs you
>"I’ll help"
>Marie looks uncomfortable
>"I’ll go get some food for her to eat" she says
>"Make sure its soft, she doesn’t have most of her teeth" you say 
>She nods and hurries off
>You focus back on the task at hand
>You hold open the damaged eye 
>God what did Stultus do
>Devin has a small Knife and tweezers
>"Radka will you please get me a bowl?"
>She does and he gets to work pulling out the eye piece by piece
>The whole process takes about 30 minutes
>He then mumbles a few words and light shines from his hand causing the bleeding to stop 
>"Flip her over Anon" he says to you
>You roll her onto her stomach and he heals the open sores and slashes on her back
>Now just time to wait for her to wake
>The cats come back up and tell you they’ve finished
>Radka goes and talks to them about their new life under you
>Basically they were in charge of this house 
>You weren’t going to live there that’s for sure
>Marie comes back and sits in your lap 
>You wrap your arms around her in a hug
>"This is my fault" you say into her woolly neck 
>"What is Anon?" she asks
>You motion at Kathrine (who was wrapped in a blanket)
>"If I hadn’t pissed of Stultus so much she wouldn’t have lost that eye" 
>"And she would still be in that dungeon, besides HE did that to her, not you"
>You nod slowly
>"I still feel bad about it"
>Suddenly one of Marie’s horns falls off
>"Took long enough" she says as she picks it up 
>You reach and grab it 
>"I’m keeping them" you say as you fiddle with it
>"You’re weird Anon"
>You set the horn on the table and tickle her sides
>"Yea well you’re stuck with me" 
>She giggles and squirms which causes the other horn to fall off
>After about an hour of waiting Kathrine stirs and opens her eye
>Marie slides out of your lap
>"Hey Kathrine how ya feeling?" you ask as you stand up and look her over
>She sit up and smiles at you
>She runs her paws over her body and then puts one to her missing eye
>She frowns 
>"Sorry we couldn’t save your eye" Devin says looking down at his feet
>She Slips off the table and takes a few uneasy steps
>She’s only about 4'10

>"Cats!" you call out
>"Yea Anon?" one of the cats appears out of nowhere beside you
>Goddamit they're just like normal cats
>"Can any of you make cloths" you ask him
>"Sheryl can! SHERYL" he yells
>"Yea Deryl?"
>Sheryl appears on the other side of you like she had been there the whole time
>Radka and Marie are looking dumbfounded at the apparent teleportation abilities of the cats
>"Anon needs your sewing" Deryl says
>"Oh? What do you need Anon" Sheryl says looking up at you
>"I need you to make Kathrine some clothes please" you say to her
>"oh yea I can do that easy! Anything special?" she says very excitedly
>"Uhmm make sure she's comfortable" 
>"Sure thing!"
>You turn to look at Kathrine and see her walking around much easier now
>You turn back to Sheryl 
>She’s gone
>"How did she-" you turn to Deryl
>He’s fucking gone too
>Goddamit
>Devin packs up his equipment
>"I guess I’ll be going then" he says
>"Wait Devin" you say
>"I’m currently sitting on 2 lordships and I can’t be double lord Anon, I read up on the laws and I am allowed to appoint a new lord" you say
>"You don’t mean-" he starts
>"How about it? Lord Pepper?" you say with a smile
>"I’ll take the title but if you must call me by a title I prefer Doctor, sounds much better for my patients anyway" he says
>"Alright then Dr.Pepper"

> A month has gone by since you had taken in Kathrine and the Cats 
>Deryl and Derrell enjoyed helping Radka at the Winehouse
>Meryl and Sheryl enjoyed reading in the library of the Late lord Stultus
>You were currently at your estate with Marie and Kathrine
>Kathrine still couldn’t speak well
>"Ayenon, Wadka, Mawie" is all she could really say besides gibberish
>Right now she was playing with some toys
>You think she’s a teenager 15 or sixteen at most but it looks like she’s always been in that dungeon so long she hasn’t had a chance to enjoy things like well, playing
>Marie is currently out back in the garden planting seeds since spring is around the corner
>"Kathrine I’m heading out back to see in Marie needs help" you say to her
>She gives you a thumbs up "ok Ayenon"
>Well she can at least say ok
>You walk to the door to the garden and slide it open
>You see Marie kneeling next to a plot of soil
>Suddenly she does something strange with her hands and a shoot grows out of the dirt 
>Within seconds its growing leaves
>She looks up and see you staring
>"Oh Uhmm hi Anon"
>You're dumbfounded
>"Life Magic? You know Life magic?" you choke out
>"Uhmmmmmm surprise!" she throws her arms up
>"That magic is a reason the king wants your kind killed! And you know it?" you say with awe
>"It’s how we've been able to eat so well this winter!" she says with a knowing smile
>Fuck that makes sense actually
>"Well fuck, can you teach me it?" you say with a smile
>You’re already this far along with the beast men, might as well learn something
>Marie Smiles
>"You’re not mad? I thought you would be furious about it, in fact I had a bet with Radka you would be" 
>"I’m not mad...just...disappointed that you kept it from me" you say frowning slightly
>Her ears go flat
>"Sorry Anon...I can teach you, but I have to charge!" she says with a happy bounce
>"What is it you want? More clothes? Extra brown sugar? Alfalfa sprouts?" you inquire
>"Tempting with the alfalfa but no, I want your help with Shearing my extra wool! She says excitedly
>"Oh Uhmm... that’s it?" you ask
>"Yep!"
>"Well ok when do you want to do it then?" 
>"NOW!" she dashes over to you and grabs your hand before pulling you inside and up the stairs to the bedroom
>"Kathrine stay out of trouble!" is all you can say before Marie closes the door to the bedroom
>" OK First I need you to brush ALL my wool" she says as she rummages through her things 
>"Then use these to shear it all off!" she produces a large brush and a pair of shearing clippers
>"Uhmm...ok then" you take the brush and sit down on the bed
>She sits on the bed in front of you and scoots herself into your lap
>"Much better" she says as she grinds on you
>NO BONER NO! FOCUS!
>You begin gently brushing through her dense wool getting the occasional "ooooh" and "ahhh"
>She raises her arms
>"You gotta take my shirt off and brush that wool too" she says
>You help her with her shirt and she grinds on you a bit harder
>"And my pants too Anon" she says looking over your shoulder with a smirk
>BONER OVERLOAD
>You slide her pants down and continue brushing trying hard not to focus on the Wide hips and ass grinding on you as you brush
>The battlefield! Nope. Fighting in the arena! Nope. Radka? Fuck that just made it worse!
>You're struggling to remain focused on brushing her wool out but she’s determined to torture you while you do it
>Her occasionally guiding your hand to brush the wool just above her nethers
>Her letting out a moan every now and then
>All the while she’s still grinding on you
>You finish brushing her after what feels like an eternity

>You take up the shears and gently start snipping away at the wool on her
>"Marie T-this would be a lot easier if you weren’t grinding on me so much" you stammer 
>"Now what fun would that be" she says looking over her shoulder with a smirk
>"After all you had so much alone time with Radka Before I moved in, now I get you alllll to myself" she wiggles her ass on you harder when she draws out the word All
>BONER AT MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE
>You focus on the clipping and try to keep your hand steady
>She’s really making this hard for you
>And you hard....
>After a LOT of grinding you finish clipping the wool on her back
>"Mmm I think you should work on the wool on my shoulders Anon" she says as she gets off your lap
>"Ok let me just-" you say as you try to stand up
>She pushes you into a sitting position on the edge of the bed and pulls off your pants
>"Marie what are you doi-" she’s already knelt in front of you and taken your cock into her mouth
>She bobs up and down a few times then opens her mouth and licks it
>"Keep clipping Lord Anon" she says with a smirk
>Your hands tremble slightly as she continues sucking and lick you
>Every time she pushed it into her mouth you could feel her tongue wrapping around it
>You Shake your head and steady your hands and continue shearing off the wool
>Breathe
>You can do this stay focused on shearing not the Full on deep throat blowjob you were getting
>Fuck she was good at it
>You’re getting close 
>"F-fuck Marie I’m going to-" your leg is spasming from the feeling
>She stops abruptly letting your cock free of her mouth with a soft pop "Nope not allowed to yet" she cooes at you
>BONER AT CRITICAL MASS
>But now you can focus on the shearing
>You quickly get done with her shoulders and the wool around her ears and where her horns would be
>"Now it’s time for my Front and legs" she purrs at you
>She’s laying down on the bed on her back
>her pink nipples are partially obscured by wool
>She’s wet, you can see the wool around her pussy is glimmering from the dampness
>You begin trimming around her Breasts, Small compared to Radka's but enough for you to get a handful of
>She takes your member into her hand and is slowly pumping, keeping you on edge
>You trim carefully around her nipples
>"Make it short around them" she says as she rubs you a little harder
>You finish there and head down clipping the wool on her stomach 
>You hadn’t been able to see how fit she was prior because of all the wool but you could see how slender her waist really was now
>You put down the shears for a moment and run your fingers over her
>Starting from the neck you rub your fingers down her
>A gentle caress of her breasts
>Run your fingers around her navel and sides
>She giggles
>"I’m ticklish Anon stop that"
>She finally let’s go of your ever throbbing erection
>"Can’t have you popping the moment we start the real fun" she grins at you
>You pick up the clippers and get back to shearing off the wool around her nethers
>"Extra short down there Anon" she says calmly
>You trim the moist wool around her Lips and decide it’s time for a little payback
>You set the trimmers down and give Marie a smirk
>"What are you plannin-" she’s cut off as you lower your head to her soaked labia
>You spread them gently with your thumbs before licking her clit
>"Ahhhh heeyyy that's n-n-no fair!" she stammers as you continue to lick her 
>Paybacks a bitch
>You push a finger into her pussy as you continue to lick small circles on and around her clit
>She’s shivering and her legs are spasming slightly
>One more finger should do it
>You slowly insert one more finger into her and fell around for her weak spot
>Her moans are the reward you get when you finally touch it
>She shudders and bucks her pelvis up 
>"AH AH ANONNNNNNNN" She Bleats
>She nearly kicks you in the head because her legs spasm so hard
>She’s panting and her eyes look like they are slightly crossed
>You smile and pick the clippers back up and continue trimming the wool off her legs
>She finally regains her composure when you finish with her legs
>"Radka wasn’t lying about you being good with your mouth" she pants 
>"You two have been talking about me doing stuff like that?" you say surprised
>"Oh we talk about everything Anon" She says with an evil smile
>She rolls over onto her stomach and Slides herself up onto her hands and knees
>She pushes her Wide rump against you and rubs it up and down on your member
>"Well Lord Anon what are you going to do to your little sheep" she teases you
>You grip one of her supple ass cheeks and Give a firm Slap to you over
>"Ohhhh" she moans "yes punish me more"
> You continue spanking her earning moans
>With each Spank you can see her hooves curl upwards slightly
>With your cock firmly between her substantial Cheeks you grip both cheeks and glide it back and forth 
>She moans and moves to match your rhythm
>You back up slightly and position your shaft to her Bountiful honey pot and thrust it in
>"AHHHHH" she moans "So fast Anon"
>She slowly wiggles her hips against you 
>You begin thrusting in and out of her slowly but with enough force to get a wet *SLAP* each time her ass hits your abs
>You spank her ass as you speed up with each thrust getting a chorus of moans and cries of pleasure for the sheep
>"P-punish me more" she moans occasionally
>The wet and wetness of her insides is intense 
>Each time you spank her you feel her insides tighten on you
>Her legs are spasming and her twin hooves curl 
>Her pussy clamps down on you as she begins to orgasm
>She lets out a Long "BAHHHHHHHHHHHH" before falling forward 
>You can see her tongue out and her eyes are completely glazed over
>You were close yourself so you continue thrusting until the pressure of her walls is too much
>You erupt into her with a final hard thrust
>You stay there inside of her for a minute before slowly pulling out
>You see your seed slowly start dripping out of her
>She’s still completely out and is a shivering mess
>You are about to Lay down next to her when you hear a loud CRASH from downstairs
>Kathrine! FUCK!
>You hastily pull on your pants and rush down to see Kathrine on the counter eating from a jar of honey
>She must have knocked over a few plates on her quest for it as they are broken on the floor
>She looks at you and gives a "YUM" before shoving another spoonful of honey into her mouth
>You sigh and clean up the mess letting Kathrine enjoy her treat
>As you finish up Radka arrives with a case of her Wine
>"Hey Anon, I brought some wine! Let’s all have a good Night together" she says happily
>"Where’s Marie?" She says as she looks around
>"Wha?" Marie is coming downstairs, still naked and still leaking your seed onto the floor
>Radka Looks at you
>"Ready for round 2 Anon?" She says with a smile
>Fuck yea you are

>It’s been a month or so since you sheared Marie
>Between sparring, learning Life magic and Teaching Kathrine how to...well everything, you didn't have time to write up your petition to the king
>Right now you were with Marie and Radka in the forest
>It was mid-day, light streaming between the leaves of the trees
>You could head birds chirping, woodpeckers pecking, and well, nature
>Radka was foraging
>You and Marie were practicing life magic
>Yhe cats were taking Care of Kathrine, who loved playing with them
>"ok try this seed Anon" Marie says holding up a Small seed
>You breathe in and put your hands over the seed
>Vines erupt and grow out of control 
>"Well I mean those were flower seeds but you made it grow pretty big at least" she says
>The vines have already grown up a tree 
>"You put a lot of power into your spells Anon, too much for food growth but you could probably grow a tree if you tried hard" Marie says with an impressed look
>"For you to be able to make that many vines grow that fast is... well its unheard of"
>Radka walks over
>"Such a good teacher" she says before giving Marie a kiss
>She then walks to you 
>"Such a good student"
>You get a kiss and a mouthful of her tongue, you can taste both her and Marie
>Score
>She’s parts from you and walks into the woods humming and picking different leaves and plants for things
>You continue trying to make flower grow or food
>You have a small sack of seeds in your pocket, various foods, flowers etc.
>"Anon, try this" Marie hands you an Acorn
>"Uhh you sure?" you ask with a raised eyebrow
>"I want to see what you can do even without full training, put everything you have left into this one then we'll take a break" she says with a smile
>You breathe in and focus
>Everything you had, right Anon you can do this
>Your hands go rigid as you spill all of your mana into the acorn
>It explodes into a 20 foot tree knocking you back a few feet
>Radka claps from where somewhere in the forest
>You guess she can see you but you can’t see her
>"NICE ANON!" She calls
>Marie walks over and helps you up then looks at the tree
>"Not many people can do Life magic Anon" she says as leaves continue to sprout and grow on the tree
>"Even fewer can do things like this"
>"Well I have a good teacher" you say with a smile
>"I think you just have a knack for it Anon" she says looking at you
>"Shush and take the compliment" you say as you give you a hug
>She nuzzles into your neck
>You pet her head and graze the little velvet covered nubs that are her horns
>She shivers
>"Hey no touching the Nubs! They’re sensitive!" she says playfully hitting your chest
>"But they're so cute!" you say putting up an arm to protect yourself
>You separate from her
>You kept the Dagger Lord Delaney gave you on your person now
>You would rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it
>You walk to the tree you grew and carve R+A+M
>"What’s that mean Anon?" Radka says popping out of a bush with a fistful of leaves
>"Radka + Anon + Marie" you say with a smile 
>"Aww Anon I never knew you were so mushy" Marie teases
>"Only when it comes to you two" you say pulling her into a Hug
>"You two are the best things to ever happen to me, before I met Radka I was all War and battles and die for honor, and before I met you I hadn’t had a Lady that treated me like I was able to do magic right" you say
>Most of your teachers had been men, the women that taught magic were... angry
>Angry you were able to do magic and fight
>And if you ever messed up a spell, you were punished
>You winced at the memories
>"Even though a magic user can do every type of magic, it doesn’t mean they are the best at it! Look at Devin compared to you in healing! He can do much better than you, but you’re better at fire and apparently Life magic" Marie says
>"Hey I want in this hug too" Radka pushes her way in
>You hug them both and are grateful that you have them
>You’re panting slightly from using so much mana in one go
>Radka notices and get overly excited
>"Oh oh oh oh! Try this eat it! EAT IT!" she shoves a small bundle of leaves into your mouth
>"Blech! What the fuck Radka, those taste awful" you say as you are forced to swallow them
>"They Help with Stamina and Mana in beast men I wanted to know if it worked for humans!" she says excitedly
>You frown
>Why did it have to taste so bad?
>But you were feeling better and more energized
>"Does it work as a tea? Or you know anything else?" you ask 
>"Nope you have to eat them" Radka says shaking her head
>Her little Nubs for antlers were cute as well
>Marie Looks over the tree one more time
>"I think you’ve got down Life Magic Anon, I mean you need to practice before you can grow food and stuff but you have the right way to do it down" Marie says looking up at the still growing tree
>"Very impressive"
>"Alright then! I’m done foraging! You two ready to head home?" says Radka as she puts and arm around you
>"Yea I think we're done, let’s get home and hope Kathrine and the Cats haven’t gotten into too much trouble" you say with a smirk
>"They keep letting her have all the honey she wants! She’ll be bouncing off the walls when we get home" Marie Bleats angrily
>"They're all just Kids, the cats are only about 17 and Kathrine isn’t really in the right mindset at all" you say as you walk towards the house
>You three walk home together, it’s relaxing and there is a gentle spring breeze
>After about 2 hours of walking and talking you arrive at your estate
>Entering you Find Kathrine at the Table doodling with some charcoal
>Sheryl is sewing up some clothes on Meryl
>Deryl and Derrell are Practicing sword fighting techniques with sticks
>"Hey Anon! We found this book on sword fighting!" Derrell says with a smile
>Deryl takes the opportunity to whack Derrell in the paw with his stick
>"OUCH no fair!" Derrell says shaking his injured paw
>"Don’t get distracted!" says Deryl
>"I’ll show you distracted!" Derrell says as he pounces on his brother
>"Hai Ayenon" Says Kathrine walking up and giving you a hug and a snaggle toothed grin
>She has on a leather eye patch you made for her, however Marie added a pink Heart to the center of it
>"Boys boys. No rough housing in here! Save it for the Winehouse or the stupid house" says Marie rushing in the separate them
>"Your feet are wrong for sword fighting anyway" you say as you walk over to them
>"Here" you give them their sticks and put them in the correct stance
>"I thought you used a spear? How do you know how to sword fight?" asks Deryl
>"I’ve trained with many weapons, I just prefer a spear" you answer
>"Hey Sheryl Hey Meryl, was Kathrine good while we were gone?" Radka says to the girls
>"Mhm! she drew a lot! She found Maries drawing stuff!" says Meryl
>Maries ears stick up "Wait did she find my drawings?"
>"No I hid those" Radka answers 
>Marie sighs in relief 
>You sit on the couch and begin Drafting up your petition to the king
>Time to buckle down and do this

>Later than evening
>You’re finishing up your final draft of the petition
>Radka Laying on the couch reading a book about different spices
>Marie is finishing up knitting something out of her wool you sheared
>Kathrine is drawing
The cats usually stay at the stupid house but they decided to stay the night at your estate
>"Come here Anon! I made this for you" Marie says holding up the...thing she made
>You get up and walk over to her
>"It’s a cloak with a hood! For when you have to wear armor and its cold!" she says throwing it over you
>It is indeed a cloak
>It’s a bit itchy though
>"Thanks Marie, I love it" you say giving her a quick kiss
>"I've just finished my petition to the king as well, tomorrow I’ll be riding to the capital to present it" you say as you take off the cloak and fold it up
>"Ooo fun" says Radka without looking up from her book
>"I’ll be gone a day or two" you say as you Fold the petition and place it in an envelope
>You seal it with wax and set it aside
>"I'm coming too Anon, don’t want you getting lonely" Marie says as she rubs a hand down your chest
>One of the cats makes a retching noise "Get a room you two" Derrell says
>"It’s my house I can do what I want!" you say as you throw a stick of wax at him
>"Yea yea yea" says Deryl
>Kathrine has fished up the thrown wax stick and is now doodling with that
>"It’s going to be an early morning tomorrow, I’m going to turn in for the night" you say
>"Ok Anon goodnight" say the cats in unison
>Super freaky when they do that
>Radka puts down her book and gets up
>"I guess I’ll come if you’re going to be leaving for a day or two" she says walking over to you and hugging you
>"I’ll come too" says Marie with a warm smile
>"Kathrine don’t stay up too late, Cats, Have a good night" you say
>"OK Ayenon!" 
>You go up to the bedroom and lay down 
>Marie snuggles into you, with her ass on your crotch
>You wrap your arms around her
>Radka snuggles in behind you making an Anon sandwich
>She put her arms around you
>Bliss

>The ride to the capital was uneventful
>You had woken when the sun rose, said farewell to everyone, given Radka a Kiss and headed off
>You arrived about midday and had requested an Audience with the king
>You were currently waiting to see him
>Marie was behind you and wearing a formal dress
>"May I present Lord Anon of House Anon" says a Meister as you walk into the throne room
>You had never met this king before, his father had traveled the kingdom, seeing his domains and his people
>This one never left the capital
>The first thing you notice is that the King is fat
>Not just fat, but absolutely rotund
>There was a food shortage and he was this big?
>"Ah Lord Anon, the lord killer" the king says showing his crooked teeth "What do I owe this....pleasure?"
>You get to one knee and do a formal bow
>You raise before saying "Sire I have a proposition to end the food shortage"
>"We have a food shortage do we?" the king asks surprised
>"We do, and my proposition is...unorthodox but has full support of the other noble houses" you say politely
>How was he this unaware of his kingdoms affairs?
>"I Propose that we welcome the Beast folk into the kingdom, their magic can grow food faster than we can and it would allow us to feed our people" you say 
>"Ah" says the king simply "Is that so?"
>You extend your hand with the sealed envelope
>"Here is my full petition along with the names of the houses that support this" you say
>A Squire gets the envelope and hands it to the king
>"Hm...This won’t be necessary" says the king as he simply holds the letter to a torch
>"Bind him"
>You feel a spell wrap itself around you and you fall forward
>"Wha?" is all you can muster as you fall
>"I knew one of the houses would bring this forward, trying to present life magic as a good idea" says the king rolling forward in his throne
>"BUT IT IS HERESY! Only the GODS may have to power to give life"
>He Stands and waddles to you 
>"You are a heretic Lord Anon and for that you will die, but first...” he motions behind you
>You hear Marie squeal 
>You Struggle against the spell
>You had to protect her
>"Spare her, punish me for this, she had nothing to do with this" you plead as you try to fight the bonds with your own magic
>"Oh Lord anon I think she does, I think she got into your head with her magic and made you do things you wouldn’t" he says pulling out a dagger
>You can see Marie struggling against two guards that are holding her
>"Please she’s just a Slave! Have Mercy on her!" you pleads
>"Mercy? Why would I spare Mercy for a beast?" he sneers
>He then Stabs the dagger into Maries heart
>She falls forwards
>"NOOOOOOOOOO" you scream out as you struggle harder
>"Its...ok Anon"
>Marie is crawling to you, one hand pressed to her chest
>You struggle with all of your might
>If you could get out you could heal her
You had to
>"It’s ok Anon" she repeats 
>She is in front of you 
>She puts a hand to your face and rubs it 
>"I...love...you..." 
>She collapses and you watch the life drain slowly from her eyes
>The curses you spew to the king would make the pagan and arcane demons blush
>"Put him in a cell for execution tomorrow, I want to make an example out of him" you hear the king say before you feel a thump in the back of your head and the world goes black

>You awake in a cell, chained to the walls
>"MARRIEEEEEEEEEE" you cry as you hit the stone walls with your fists
>You would avenge her, you had to
>It was your fault she was here
>But first you had to get out
>You had to save the Cats and Kathrine and Radka
>But how? What did you have to get out of this?
>The window?
>Magic?
>Could you use fire? No... You would just end up burning yourself up
>...Life?
>You had seen trees growing through stone
>The chains had enough slack to allow you to pat your sides
>Could there be?
>Yes
>You still had some seeds in your pockets
>Now you needed a hole to put them in
>You pull the chains and see the plate they are attached to wiggle
>Bingo
>You pull the chain with your right hand to make enough space behind the plate to place one seed
>You focus and pour Mana into it then release
>A tangle of vines erupts, Shattering through the stone and freeing the plate from the wall
>There was now a fairly size hole
>you stowed the rest of the seeds into the hole 
>all your mana has to go into this
>Once again, you focus and the wall explodes into a grow of vines, bushes and briars
>You now had a hole you could climb through
>You climb through getting a few scrapes from the briars but you ignore them
>You needed a horse
>You quickly gather up the chains to stop them from clinking and sneak around the outside of the castle
>You’re sneaking until you hear a horse whinny on the other side of a wooden wall
>You must have found a stable luckily
>You can hear voices as well
>This has to be quick
>Over the wall 
>Kick open the stall door 
>Onto the horse 
>Go

>You ride through the night
>The sun is rising as you approach the city where you lived
>You can see your estate on the outskirts
>You are there in a flash and hurry inside
>Blood
>Lots of blood
>You were too late
>You look over and see Derrell, the broken pieces of your spear littered around him
>His body has slashes and cuts all over it
>You reach out a hand and close his eyes
>"I’m sorry Derrell" you whisper
>"They came last night, we got word too late to help but we were able to get some of your friends to safety" 
>Lord Delaney
>"You still have many friends here, your other slaves... If you still want to keep up that charade are hidden in the former dungeon of the Stultus manor" he says
>He puts a hand on your shoulder
>"I’m sorry about your sheep Anon but they need you, the guards are all your squad mates and will turn the other way for now but you need to get out"
>You look over at Derrell’s body
>"I’ll see to it he is given a proper burial" Delaney says
>You need a few things
>You grab your shield, the cloak Marie made you, a self-portrait she made and....her horns
>You don the cloak and pull it to cover your face
>"Will you come back Anon? Ever? We need you to if we want change here"
>"I will" you say 
>You leave your now former home

>You run to the Stultus house
>Even when your veins burned and your heart felt it would melt you ran
>You don’t see any guards so you head inside being careful none the less
>You make your way to the dungeon and open it
>You see Radka, Kathrine and Sheryl, Deryl and Meryl cowering
>Then, they see it’s you
>You rush to hug you but you stop them first 
>"In in in" you usher them before closing the secret entrance behind you
>You all then crumple into a group hug 
>"Mawie?" says Kathrine
>You look down and shake your head
>Radka Sobs
>"Derrell fought them when they came, he gave us time to escape" says Deryl
>His face is stone cold
>You knew that look, you had seen it in someone who couldn’t feel at the moment…or ever again
>You all remain in the dungeon until night
>Kathrine is asleep in her arms
>She cried herself to sleep
>Radka has her head on your shoulder to your right
>The cats are piled to your left, snuggled against you
>You stir
>"We have to go, we can’t stay here"
>You open the entrance a crack and peek through
>All clear
>The six of you sneak together out of the house and to the forest
>You sigh in relief as you reach the forest
>"Well....I guess you all are free now technically, if you want to leave and find homes elsewhere...I... I won’t stop you" you say to your now former slaves
>Radka whacks your head 
>"Of course I’m staying with you Anon" she says
>The cats look at each other
>"We're staying" they say in unison
>"I Stay Wif Ayenon"
>Kathrine said her first ever sentence 
>You smile
>"Let’s go then" you say turning from the city
>"Where are we going Anon"
>"To find the other beasts" you say
>You will be coming back
>And you’re going the bring a few friends with you


>Be King Crassus
>When you inherited the crown from your father, you had thought ruling would be easy
>And it was for a While
>Until the Heretic, Lord Anon disappeared 5 years ago
>You nearly had outright rebellions when you said he was privately executed to preserve his families honor
>You didn’t know he was that well liked
>The Military saw him as a fearless leader 
>Your military leaders mourned losing him, he was apparently a good leader
>The nobles saw him as a man who helped them feed their children (he apparently literally gave them food)
>The peasants saw him as a noble with their best interests at heart
>As well, you had to put down many small uprisings after they learned he had a fix for the supposed food shortage
>You had him so close to being executed and he escaped
>No doubt to run off and die in some cave with his beasts
>Speaking of beasts, the extermination wasn’t going nearly as planned
>More than a year after Anon the Heretic escaped...
>A reindeer Beastman appeared
>Not just any reindeer Beastmen though
>From what your soldiers told you he was.... small
>Well as big as a normal human but SMALL for a reindeer beastman
>4 years ago he just...appeared and organized the beasts
>Carrying a spear that had a 2 foot tip, a fire blackened, battle worn shield, and 2 long knives with horns for handles
>At first he was the only one who wore armor, although he wore a black cloak as well, obscuring most of his body from sight
>Only his armored muzzle and antlers could be seen 
>No doubt he found some dead knight and used their armor
>But now other beasts were wearing armor and using defensive techniques
>Now almost every extermination raid on a village ended in failure
>And more so he had...weaponized their heretical life magic
>If your soldiers charged vines grew and tangled them so they couldn't advance
>Horses got tangled in briers and refused to gallop onwards
>You had heard of Bamboo growing through someone down south but.... that couldn’t be true
>This deer was a thorn in your side that you couldn’t get rid of
>Every attack was routed, every advance blocked
>You tried to out technology them
>Crossbows worked the first time
>But then.... They had Crossbows, bigger crossbows then your men could use
>You were frustrated and angry, these were mindless beasts!
>You had your mission from the gods
>Your advisers told you that the gods were at your back, that they wanted these beasts wiped out or enslaved
>And yet…Anon could have been right?
>Should you have let these beasts join? 
>No!
>You just had to find new ways to kill them


>You are Radka
>You are in the frozen north, your homelands
>You would say Anon had dragged you north again but you had volunteered to stay with him
>He loved you, you knew it and you loved him but...
>Since Marie died, you could almost see the hole in his heart where she had been
>You had loved her too
>She was your best friend besides Anon
>When she died it did more to him though
>Maybe because he was there when she died
>Maybe because he blamed himself for her even being there
>He didn’t know but there were nights where you saw him crying her name in his sleep
>Him saying "I’m sorry I’m sorry" as tears poured down his face as he slept
>But he loved you
>His face lit up when he talked to you and hugged you
>Even now in the cold he hugged you tight and the warmth in his words
>"I Love you Radka" 
>He was the same anon you fell in love with
>Cracked but not broken
>And you had a surprise for him that not even Kathrine could spoil

>You are Anon
>You are in the frozen north with your love Radka
>You had been travelling, meeting the beast men, rallying them
>You had gone south to meet the Sand cat assassins and their queen
>They lived in seclusion, being hired by man and beast alike to kill politicians and whomever else
>The Cats, Sheryl, Meryl and Deryl had stayed behind with them
>They wanted to train, to avenge their brother
>You had traveled west, gained support of the prey species
>Deer, reindeer, horse and mice and bird beast men
>They were overjoyed to join and were happy you took a reindeer as a life mate
>You had traveled east, and met with the Long-fangs, a tribe of Coyotes
>Their Leader, Bongwater, was insane you were pretty sure
>He gained power by killing, raping and torturing his way to the top
>You had seen him literally eat the face of another coyote that called him "soft"
>You were also pretty sure he fucked the corpse then ate it when you left but... you didn’t want to think about that
>Money and violence ruled their society 
>And they loved it
>It took almost a year to convince them to join your cause
>Bribes and violence, you had killed more Coyotes than you thought you needed too but Bongwater loved it
>With each one you killed he put another mark on your armor
>"To show you are one of us Human" he cackled as he chewed the remains of your victims
>Where humans dueled for profit and honor the long-fangs fought simply for fun
>Killing each other, eating the bodies of anyone who fell
>You had to tell them they could eat the bodies of the soldiers they killed
>But you had allies in them and as long as they kept their...."society" to themselves you would leave them alone

>Right now you were talking to Rav...err...Jackson
>While he hated humans he...Admired the society
Which is why he took up a human name, Rav being his wolf name, Jackson being his human name
>He's a huge black furred wolf
>He was a warrior who gained power through fighting 
>He led his group "the Pack" with an iron fist
>80% of them were warriors, male and female 
>When you arrived you were worried that they were the same group that had caused Radka to flee to the south
>They had actually wiped those ones out, he called them cockmonglers and had several snow white pelts from them draped over his throne
>He had actually presented Radka With one of the pelts as a gift when you arrived
>He said it was to show that they would never do such a thing as hunt other beast men down
>When you arrived he welcomed you with open arms 
>"We have heard of the Human travelling tribe to tribe to gather us beasts against his own kind" he said with a smile
>You had given him a large sword that you had taken from a knight who attacked the long-fangs while you were there
>Bongwater fucking LOVED that you killed other humans
>He cackled and danced around the bodies waving around his 2 axes before tearing an arm off one of the fallen humans and chowing down
>Jackson loved the sword you presented him and made a point of learning everything he could about humans and their society
>You were currently sitting at a long Table with Jackson, Radka, and several of his advisers
>Jackson was scratching his ears and pondering
>"So I join you and we attack? After what becomes of me? I want your word I’ll be one of the lords of the land"
>You nod
>"I have no desire to take your power from you, when the king falls you will be the king of the northern realms and answer solely to me" you say calmly
>"And why answer to you?" he growls
>You sigh
>"The only thing you would answer to is if I called upon you for war, other than that you would be solely independent" you say to him
>"I don't want to take away your power, nor impose my own laws and taxes, you have this realm and will keep it but on the plus side you and your people will be able to come and go as well as trade"
>The 20% of his tribe that were nor warriors were fishermen, whalers and feral seal hunters
>They pulled fish as large as a man out of the water, or the leviathans of the deep and set upon them like locusts
>Raw, cooked, they didn’t care
>Right now a plate of fish and whale blubber was being set before you by a large female wolf
>She winks as you thank her
>Radka grunts in disapproval at you
>You look at her and shrug
>You weren’t flirting! You were being flirted at! Not your fault!
>She had an enormous plate of dried seaweed
>Apparently it was delicious but you couldn’t bring yourself to eat it
>You eat a chunk of blubber
>Chewy
>"Why do you wish to attack your own people anyway?" he asks as he tears through his own meal, a raw chunk of bloody seal meat
>"Personal reasons but that aside, the current king is a fat fool who can’t see his people are starving" you answer eating away at your food despite the grisly sight in front of you
>Radka looks like she is about to puke and leaves the room
>Jackson looks up at you and Nods
>"You want to help your people, even if that means war, so be it. You seem like a good ally for the future Anon, we shall forevermore be Allies" he says
>Another wolf hands him a small knife
>He stands up and so do you
>You walk to each other and head to the center of the room
>"Never thought I would do this with a human" he says with a grim smile
>He uses the knife and cuts a long gash into his paw
>He then hands you the knife
>You cut into your hand
>You extend your hand to him as the blood drips onto the floor
>He takes your hand with his bleeding paw
>"Our blood hits the same floor this day and shall always be drawn together" he says
>You nod 
>Another ally, another friend

>You walk to the Cabin Jackson provided you for your stay
>Radka is dry heaving into a pot when you walk in
>"Hey sorry about that Radka" you say as you rub her back with your non cut hand
>"That’s not it Anon, I don’t mind a little gore" she says into the pot
>"I have something to tell you" she says standing up and taking your hands 
>She’s looking into your eyes with pride
>"Huh?"
>"A-anon, I don't know how but...I'm pregnant" she says
>Your mouth drops open
>You stand dumbfounded for a moment
>Then pull her into a hug
>"That's Amazing Radka! This is AMAZING!"
>You were officially married to Radka at this point, at least according to beastman laws you were
>"Have to told Kathrine?" you ask
>"You know her, she hasn’t sto-" she pushed away from you and pukes into the pot
>"She hasn’t what?" Kathrine says as she walks in and sets her shield down
>Kathrine grew up
>Although she was still only 4'10 she had gotten much stronger
>She trained and sparred with you regularly
>She used a sword and shield, she said spears were too long for her to use right
>Also half her teeth were metal 
>Forged and set into her jaw to replace the ones Stultus had ripped out
>Radka looks up
>"She hasn’t stopped talking since she learned how to" she finishes
>You hug Kathrine
>"How was training Kiddo?" you ask her
>"Good! These wolves are strong but lack technique, I gave them a few pointers and showed them a few things but they will be great allies if you can convince them to join"
>You hold up your bandages hand "convinced them earlier" you say with a grin
>"That’s awesome!” she says jumping and giving a fist pump
>"Also Radka has something to tell you" you say with a smiles
>"Kathrine I’m -HURRRRKKK" She pukes again
>"Hi Hurrrkkk, I’m Kathrine" Kathrine says with a stupid smile
>This fucking opossum
>"Fuck you" Radka says as she wipes her mouth
>"Aww love you too mom" Kathrine says 
>"I was going to say I’m pregnant" Radka says 
>"REALLY?!? HOW?!" Kathrine jump and zips over to Radka giving her a hug
>"I don't know but I don't care either!"
>You are Anon, exiled Knight and lord, spouse to a fallen love, uniter of beasts, and soon to be father

>You Are King Crassus
>The beasts attacked in the night
>Using war Machines you had never dreamed of
>Giant crossbows that fire bolts that could pierce stone
>They flowed through the gates like....someone had left them open...
>The Coyotes flooded in from the wastes to the east, half dressed and some totally unarmed, mauling and eating anything or anyone they could
>the Wolves came from the frozen North wearing Black armor and carrying crossbows, swords and shields
>Small sand cats, had simply climbed the walls like they were trees and jumped rooftop to rooftop to your castle
>From the west came the Deers and horses and Birds
>And all lead by that deer
>You could see his outline as he stood on the wall, fires at his back as the city burned
>He raised his spear high to howls and Cheers from the beasts
>You saw the light from his hands as Vines ad Trees exploded to life around him, giving the beasts things to climb so they could get into the castle
>You could hear them coming 
>You could hear him coming
>You were terrified
>The doors to your throne room explode into fire and ash
>You cower behind your throne as you see a 8 foot Black wolf stride in
>A Cackling Coyote covered in blood and eating the arm of one of your guards
>A small cat dressed in a tight purple suit
>And him
>The deer
>His cloak flowing around him like water over a stone
>He walks to you slowly
>You can’t see his eyes but you can feel the hatred burning as he looks down at you as you cower
>"P-please have mercy"

>You are anon
>The attack was a success
>Attacking at night
>Lord Delaney had come through and had the gates left open
>And all your forces piled through like it was nothing
>Having bird beast men to deliver messages meant coordinating was easy
>There were casualties of course
>You could barely contain the Long-fangs as they tore through the city 
>But the Pack Kept military discipline only attacking those that fought
>The sand cats were so quiet you doubted anyone knew they were there until it was too late
>The Prey were the most merciful, letting those that surrendered live
>The king's men tried to keep you out of the castle by shutting the doors
>You made plants grow to the windows and you forces flooded in
>You walked to the throne room
>Jackson, the ruler of the Pack and king of the north to your left
>Bongwater, the insane leader of the Long-fangs, who was already eating someone’s arm to your right
>Scarlet, the small queen of the sand cats walking in front
>Radka, Sheryl, Meryl and Deryl behind you as you cast a fire spell to destroy the doors to the throne room
>And there he was
>The fat coward
>Hiding behind his chair and shivering
>You could also smell he soiled himself
>He looks up at you, snot running down his face, tears in his eyes
>"P-please have mercy"

>You remove your helmet
>You had used Some of Radka’s old Antlers to fix into the helm so that no one would know you were leading the beasts
>You set down your old shield, the family crest scraped and burned off of it
>You pull out one of your daggers, one you had saved for this occasion, its sister blade for executing knights who attacked your forces  
>The blade was fixed into one of Maries horns
>You grasp it tight and look at it, running an armored thumb over the ridges of her horn
>Remembering her laugh, her smile, her smell
>Her death, her last words
>"I love you"
>You look at him and frown
>His eyes go wide
>"Y-you? Anon? Have mer-"
>You stab the blade into his heart
>"Mercy? Why would I spare Mercy for a beast?"

>The clean up after the battle was quick with the help of the pack and the prey
>The long fangs ran back to their hole as soon as the battle was done 
>The sand cats disappeared like they always do
>Fucking ninjas
>You were in your throne room
>Radka in the throne next to you, her belly swollen
>You were King, and she was your queen
>You finally didn’t have to hide it


>Decades later
>Your reign was long and prosperous
>The life magic from the beast men ended the famine 
>The trades with the pack brought meats and fish the land
>Your kingdom had a golden age
>Technology bloomed and made life better
>But that didn’t matter now as you lay alone in your bed
>Radka Had passed a few years ago 
>She was buried with Marie
>Well you never found Maries body but her tombstone sat under a giant oak tree
>An oak tree with the letters R+A+M carved into it
>You were going to be buried there too
>Radka’s crown had sat on her empty throne 
>And you had an empty heart
>But not all was sad
>You look to your left and see your son, Derrell, a reindeer and your Daughter, Marie, a human
>You see Kathrine, tears pouring out of her eye, down her muzzle
>"It’s ok" you whisper out 
>It hurts to talk
>You look to your right and see the cats Meryl Sheryl and Deryl
>"Keep an eye on them for me will ya" you cough out to them
>"We will Dad" says Sheryl
>You stick out both hands
>The cats, your adopted children, grab hold of your fingers
>Your son and daughters hold your fingers on your other hand
>You smile and sigh and close your eyes

>You open your eyes and sit up quickly
>Where are you?
>It’s misty 
>You stand up 
>It doesn’t hurt anymore, 
>You look at your hands
>No wrinkles
>You rub your face
>You're young again
>How
>HELLO
>You call out
>"Hey Anon" you hear a familiar voice
>Derrell the cat has appeared besides you
>He hugs you
>"I missed you Anon, thanks for looking after my sisters and brother"
>"I missed you too buddy" you hug him back
>"Come on, everyone is waiting" he grabs your hand and leads you
>Your brother is there, he had died of starvation about a year before you led the beast men to victory
>"You always had to outdo me didn’t you? King huh?"
>"Just had to do what was right" you say hugging him
>"I know Anon"
>"I’ve been waiting for you Anon" you hear a voice
>Her voice
>You break from David and see her
>Marie
>She’s as beautiful as you remember
>She extends her arms
>You rush into a hug with her
>You cry into her wool
>"I’m sorry I’m sorry"
>She pets your head
>"It’s ok Anon, we're together again"
>"All of us"
>You feel arms wrap around your chest from behind
>You would recognize those arms anywhere
>Radka
>She slides around and the three of you hug each other close
>"Come On Anon, let’s go" Radka says as you part after what feels like a lifetime
>She sticks out her hand
>Marie stick out her other hand
>You take their hands into yours and walk off into the mist together
