>Saturday night
>Alone again
>Checking e-mail when something pops into your inbox
>You're not sure why you even chose to get updates from that site, but before you delete it, the picture catches your eye. 
>It's a live stream of a tigress lady, but with a partner you can't quite identify from the thumbnail.
>Fuck it, wasn't doing anything else tonight anyways.
>Loading the stream, you're immediatly met with a gratifying view of a dick
>"Look at it! So big!" a tug, "No spikes, no knots!", a rub, "Just big human cock!"
>No way that thing's real, gotta be some kind of aug or something
>Snapped back out of those thoughts by the tigress 
>"Who likes what they see"
>Shit, you're into this
>Wind up staying though the whole thing, justifying it to yourself that you were needing to blow off some steam anyways.
>Still though, that tigress seemed like she was really enjoying that
>That couldn't possibly be what human dicks are actually like, but now your curiosity is piqued.
>Not like you had plans for tomorrow night anyways, and it's been too long since you've even had a one-off partner.
>Time to see what all that fuss is about
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>Saturday night
>Chatting with buddies online
>One of them sends a link "Hey dude this is perfect for you"
>Follow it
>Dude's balls power hour
>Just about to send an angry reply when a tigress slides on-screen with a recliner
>"Seriously Anon, we all know you like the antro ladies.  Tell you what, come with me to the bar tomorrow, I want to try out a new racer and it might give your sorry ass a chance to hook up"
>About to go into a counter-argument when you hear the sound of the tigress moaning from your other tab.
>Argument = invalid
>"Fine, fine, what time are we meeting?"
>You get details hammered out, save a copy of the video, and log off for the night.
>Tomorrow was promising to be an interesting day, at least.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>Sunday evening
>The bar is busy, not not packed, so it's a perfect night to scope out for a nice human guy to spend some time with.
>Taking a spot at the bar, order a small sandwich and a drink, and start looking over the crowd
>There's a some pairs sitting down at the tables already, with more people filtering in and out of the arcade at the back.
>A fox with greying fur sitting and talking happily with an older human woman.
>A human who's been spending every passing second gazing holes though every passing ass, pass
>A younger human who's managed to find himself surrounded by 5-6 lionesses, it looks like he's got enough troubles without you barging in.
>It's going to take some time to find someone in this crowd
>And you don't have much of a game plan aside from strolling up and asking "Hey I want to see your dick.  Wanna fuck?"
>Your food arrives, and you mull over your options as you eat.
>As you eat, you notice a man coming out of the arcade alone
>Not bad looking, around 6', short dark hair, and looking for a place to sit
>Game time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>You made it to the bar with Felix, no issue
>Felix pretty much drug you straight into the arcade, not even bothering to eat or get a drink before hand
>A high-speed hovercraft racer is the game of the day.  Peeling though cities at what feels like 500 KM/h
>You hold your own decently enough, but Felix is pretty much racing circles around everyone
>After 2 GPs, you need to get yourself grounded again, so you excuse yourself
>Felix refuses to leave until he's finished every circuit, so you're flying solo for the rest of the night probably
>Making your way out of the arcade, you start feeling hungry, so you take a second to look for a place to sit
>A chill runs up your spine, someone's got eyes on you
>Those lionesses seemed pretty occupied, but you might've caught the attention of one of them
>A quick check confirmed that they were all still on that other guy though.  They're practically smothering him at this point.  Lucky bastard.
>Scoping around you finally lock eyes with your predator
>She's a frog of some sort, sitting at a table near the bar, and gazing at you pretty intensely
>She locks eyes with you, and gives you a wave towards the table
>Well, this is kinda why you came here in the first place, so, time to  see what you can do
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>You're half surprised, half relived that the human actually started heading towards you when you beckoned him.
>But now you've got to decide what to do, what to say, and how not to completely scare him off immediately.
>You spent your time eating trying to throw every single idea, no matter how ridiculous, into your head to mull over, but that just left you with too many things to try.
>The few ideas you liked, you tried to follow through in your head, but that just gave you a skeleton idea with no content.
>And now there was a cute human standing next to your table, with you sitting there trying desperately not to look flustered.
"Hey there Hon.  Looking for a place to sit?  Why don't you share a table with me, seating's a bit full right now."
>All right, good opening, was the "Hon" too much though?
>"Thanks, that'd be nice.  Didn't get much of a chance to eat before my friend pulled me into the arcade.  My name's Anon." He replies, while sticking his hand out to you.
>Yuo give his hand a friendly shake. "I'm Cricket, nice to meet you.  And before you ask, my parents had an interesting sense of humour." 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>You sit down with Cricket, and order yourself a sandwich and a Dr. Pepperâ„¢
>"So, what brings you out here tonight?" You ask
>"Well, if I'm being honest, this place has a bit of a reputation of being friendly for both humans and anthros, and I'll admit to having next to no contact with humans before.  I wound up finding something that piqued my curiosity, and figured I'd see if I could find out what all the fuss is about."
>You're a bit surprised and at the same time not
>Humans and Anthros don't always get along
>'Play it cool and remain calm' you think to yourself
>"Well I'm here now, so go ahead and ask any questions you might have"
>You start ping-ponging questions back at forth at each other
"Yeah, if we spend much time in water, our skin goes all wrinkly, like prune skin."
"Some frogs can jump like, 30 times their own height with a little buildup.  I could probably get up to the ceiling here on a good day."
"I think we mostly used to be endurance hunters, just out-lasting stuff until it was too tired to get away"
"I prefer looser fitting clothes, we tend to breathe though our skin a little, so if I wear anything too covering I wind up short of breath."
"Work?  I man the tools for an oil operation nearby, make sure everyone's got what they need, keep tabs on inventory, all that fun junk."

>After about an hour of Q&A, she pauses briefly, then motions for you to come closer.
"So, um, this might be being a little bit too forward but, you seem like a nice guy, and I was hoping I could convince you to maybe spend the night at my place tonight?"
>Error in brain thought process, initiate *Stupid_talking.exe until brain function resumes
>After a second too long, you finally manage to sputter out "Haha well, I do my best not to come off as an axe murderer.  I'd be happy to spend more time with a beautiful lady like you."
>She relaxes a bit at that, and leans back down with a hint of a blush still on her face.
"Well, unless you've got another reason for sticking around, do you want to hit the road?"
>You take a glance towards the arcade, and see Felix looking right at you, shit-eating grin at the ready.
>He gives a quick thumbs-up and disappears back into the arcade.
"I'm ready if you are, why not get going?"
>The two of you leave, get into her car, and hit the road.
>The trip is going smoothly when you hear a loud "REEEEEEEEEEEEEE" and breaking glass behind you.
>Another car's decided to get up close and personal with a building.
>You turn to Cricket, give a small shrug and you both agree to let someone else deal with that.

>The rest of the ride to her apartment in uneventful, if but a bit silent due to nerves.
>Getting to her place, you can already notice that the entire floor seems a lot warmer than what you'd expect.
>She did mention that this floor was mostly for amphibians and reptiles, makes sense that the temperature would be cranked.
>Getting into her place, your immediate concern turns from figuring out what the hell is happening to worrying if you're going to melt.
>humidifiers, it would have to be multiple humidifiers to make things this... moist.
>Good lord, if there's any more strenuous activity than holding hands you might just sweat to death.
"Ah!  Sorry if it's uncomfortable in here, I wasn't expecting company, lemme turn these down a bit"
"Help yourself to a drink if you want, glasses are in the left cupboard"
>While you busy yourself getting some glasses, you ask if she wants anything.
"I'll take a *Insert mid-range alcoholic beverage of choice*, should be right above the fridge!"

>You carry the drinks over to Cricket who is already sitting a couch waiting for you.
>As the humidity slowly drops, you sit down next to her with a smile.
>"So uhm...geez i dont really know how to go about doing this Anon" She says taking her drink and running a webbed hand on the back of her head
>"What do you mean Cricket?"
>She sips her drink and fidgets a bit
>"Like, I saw a stream the other night of this tigress and a human going at it, and it really piqued my interest but I dont really know how to start it out"
>You take a big gulp of your drink and set it down
>Liquid courage and all that jazz
"I'm not great at this either, so how about just taking it slow?  I saw that stream too!  She was something else wasn't she"
>Her eyes light up a bit
>"Oh my god YES and so was he!  I mean sure it was mostly about her but damn"
>You smile, "If you want we can watch it again"
>She looks a bit nervous
>"Uh... ok we can do that, one sec"
>She gets up and walks down the hallways of her apartment
>You rub your fingers through your hair and take a deep breath
>Ok this is fine, you're about to watch a porno with a girl you just met
>Hold back the spaghetti a bit, you can do that
>After a moment she comes back with a datachip in her hands, which she inserts into her TV
>It starts immediately, A golden tiger sitting in the lap of that giant human
>"Hey guys and gals~ Here I am, Janet Diamond, finally going to do something a little bit different with a veeeery special guest!"
>Cricket sits down a little further from you than you'd like
>Fuck it, might as well TRY to be a bit more alpha, after all she invited you to her apartment
>You slide over and slip a hand behind her,wrapping it around her waist
>She squeaks in surprise as you pull her over to you so that you're right next to each other
>"Lets enjoy this together Cricket"
>She nods and leaned onto you a bit, but you can tell shes a little apprehensive
>The Tigeress on the screen reveals her counterparts nethers and you see crickets eyes light up
>"Ooo look at that Anon" she half mumbles
>You can see her fidgeting slightly all the while leaning onto you more and more
>She has her eyes locked on the screen absentmindedly rubbing her hands on her thighs
>Was it this easy to get Anthros in the mood?
>Fuck it might as well help
>Your hand is still around her waist so you begin rubbing  up and down her side
>She jumps slightly at the sudden movement like she had forgotten you were there
>"Hey Cricket?"
>She turns  to you and you pull her slightly into a kiss
>"HMMF? mmmmm"
>Her being startled by it at first was adorable
>She breaks from the kiss with a slight moan
>"Mmmm kiss me more Anon"
>Your lips lock with hers once more and you feel her tongue pushing against yours earnestly
>>She breaks from the kiss panting slightly
>"How about i do this?"
>She gets up from the couch and straddles you
>"Much easier this way huh?" she teases as she rubs a hand down your chest
>"Mhmm much easier"
>You put your hands on her waist and she grinds against you
>She leans forwards and you kiss again as your hand slide up to her breasts
>As you grope and knead them gently she moans into your mouth
>"Ohhhh yes Anon, Harder!"
>You happily oblige, squeezing them and pressing them together with your palms
>"This needs to come off!"
>She grips the bottom of her shirt and begins lifting it off only to pause midway.
>"Uh, so I'm a glass frog..so uhm.. please dont freak out?"
>She lifts it the rest of the way revealing those glorious orbs
>And her heart, which can be seen beating through her translucent skin
>You pause for a moment then look at her face
>"You hate it dont you? Uhm I'll just -"
>She starts getting off you only to have you pull back down with your hands on het shoulder
>"I dont hate it Cricket I was just a bit surprised thats all."
>She lets out a relieved sigh
>"Oh good, I was a little self conscious about being a bit see through"
>Your hands run up and down her sides once more
>Smooth and slippery
>>You reach down and pull your own shirt off and throw it aside
>"Ooo I like, someones been hitting the gym" She cooes as  she runs her hands down your chest and Abs
"Now, let's get rid of these"
>She slides off you and begins undoing her pants, you quickly follow suit and unleash the beast
>But when you look up at her she looks visabily disappointed
>Ego rating : 0 
>"I thought it would be bigger, like his"
>She points to the Huamn on the TV who is currently getting deepthroated by the tigeress
>You frown
>"That dude has to be over 7 feet tall!  And LOOK at that thing!  Its like the size of my arm!"
>She looks from him to you for a moment
>"You're right.  Plus I think that might actually hurt me"
>A thought pings the back of your head as she starts moving closer to you again
>"Uhh are you on birth control Cricket?"
>She stops and freezes
>"No, I.. I don't ever go out and meet people like I did today"
>Rule 1: Don't fuck up
>Rule 2 : Always have a backup plan
>"Its ok!  I came prepared."
>You grab your pants and rummage through the pockets
>Pulling out a sunglass case you open it up and pull out a condom
>"You always carry condoms with you anon?"
>You feel yourself blush
>"Uh, yea actually.  Getting to USE them is a totally different matter though"
>Shes laughs slightly and climbs back onto you
>You can feel the slight dampness of her skin and the flowing wetness of her slit against you

>The feel of her damp skin, moist and malleable beneath your fingers drives you crazy
>Were all anthros this way?
>You don't know or care as you feel her body press against you
>The condom you had get enveloped by her as she carefully slides down
>This is nothing like you imagined or envisioned
>You pictured something similar to your hand
>What was the term?
>Palmala Handerson?
>Instead you get a flowing wetness and tightness beyond compare
>All around you gripping your shaft with an incomparable wetness
>It's enough to make you gasp in shock as she slides down the length of your shaft
>She gasps as well, feeling you in her as she puts a webbed hand to her stomach
>"Oooooh, I definitely couldn't handle him if you fill me up this much"
>She casually motions over her shoulder to the Hologram showing that Tigeress straddling the giant human
>You sigh in relief as she start slowly pumping up and down on you
>How could you compare to that human?!
>Well what you lacked in size compared to him you'll just have to make up in stamina
>Maybe, hopefully
>You grip Cricket's smooth, slightly damp skin, gasping for air as she uses her powerful legs to pump up and down on you
>Honestly you had taken her muscle control for granted when you decided to go home with her
>But what did you expect?
>Smooth tight legs, like coiled steel, tightening around you
>A heart, barely visible through her gorgeous breasts
>Her strong arms and hands on your shoulders as she rode you
>And you couldn't complain
>How could you
>Compared to any human girl she was so many steps above them
>Her tightness, her moans of pleasure in your ear, her attentiveness to you
>Even the semi drunk whispers of "oh my god it feels so goooooood" in you ear drove you further as you helped her
>Your hands on her waist, you finger digging into her moist perfect skin
>Giving enough firmness for you to grip yet wet enough for them to slide against you
>As you help her pump up and down on you, you feel her long wet tongue running down your cheek and shoulder
>You dont even care and you help bring her hips down to meet your own
>Was this was it was like to be with an anthro?!
>How long had you missed out on this?!
>You feel her pussy clamp down on you  as you bring her down upon you, hurried gasping in your ear and you hold her waist
>"ohhh god oh-"
>You cut her off and keep pumping into her like a piston, testing the silicon barrier between you and her
>Her tightness and gasping moans in your ear push you over the edge
>You erupt into her, wrapping your arms around her as you gasp for air in sheer pleasure
>Holy fuck, that was better than any human you had ever been with
>After a few minutes of holding her waist and burying your head against her chest you relax and breathe deep, slumping back against her couch
>After a few deep breaths she finally speaks
>"Wow"
>You cant help but repeat the sentiment
>"Wow"
>Nothing you had ever felt compared to her tightness and warm moistness
>Every thought of sex and how it should be
>Every wet dream you ever had melted away to her, Cricket the glass frog
>And you hoped her heavy breathing meant the same as she slid up off of you
>"Wowwwww" she moans happily as she lift herself off you, revealing a balloon of cum wrapped around your semi hard cock
>"I'm SO glad I had you wear a condom Anon, otherwise you would have knocked me up for sure"
>She leans forwards, wrapped her damp arms around you
>"But I would be happy to get birth control if it meant seeing you again"
>Seeing her again?
>She was willing to see you again?
>Maybe have a relationship beyond sex?!
>Her personality was mesmerising
>her body was incomparable
>Even as you heard the tigress murmur about how big the human she was with was, you couldn't help but think of Cricket
>You pull her into a kiss and rub your hands slowly up and down her back
>"I would love to see you again Cricket"
>You mean it as you run you hands up and down her damp sides, savouring the feeling of her skin
>She seems to share the sentiment as her long tongue explores your mouth
