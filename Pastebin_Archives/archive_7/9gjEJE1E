>The bar was dark and smoky and smelled of tobacco and hash and cheap wine, as was the current fashion in Furrytown, where all the freaks live. 
>Not many baseline humans came to this part of town. It wasn't so much dangerous, though there were certainly back alleys where an incautious visitor could get his ass kicked--
>It was the culture shock.
>In a world where genetic engineering and cybernetics were making it possible to be whatever you dreamed of, a lot of dreams were on public display.
>Not all of them were to everyone's taste.
>There were cat people and dog people, fox people and bird people, now in a much more literal sense, and more.
>Back in high school you'd fallen in love with a pretty albino anime-girl with big red eyes and pale silvery blue hair, but she hadn't had much to say.
>Horse genes and even appearance were popular mods, though you noticed that the guys with them tended to be vain muscleheads who'd rather sit at home and flex in front of a mirror than go to a party.
>and the girls--well, there was something off-putting about their great height and the eyes on opposite sides of their heads, however graceful they were, not to mention the enormous sloppy horsepussy.
>Pony folk were smaller and had less inhuman features. You'd dated a shy pony girl for a while, with a pale pink mane.
>She was obsessed with trying to guess all your most secret fetishes, though.
>You'd dated a tall, predator-lean girl of a fantasy carnivore species that called themselves "sergals," and had seriously weird genitalia.
>Tonight, though, you had something different in mind as you nursed your beer.
>A group of bots and cyborgs were on one side of the dance floor, doing some kind of synchronized, coordinated thing that couldn't really be called "dancing" any more,
>with impossible, perfect mechanical precision.
>On the other side were some dancers in leather, with mods you hadn't seen before. You tried to decide whether they were lizards, or foxes.

>Then you saw the gill slits and the teeth.
>You'd heard rumors about shark mods, and you were intrigued.
>And you saw another one, sitting at the end of the bar by herself, wearing a little black dress and smoking a cigarette in a long holder, like something out of the middle part of the last century.
>The "Holly Golightly" effect was only slightly spoiled by the thick-lensed nerd glasses she was wearing. And the long snout, and teeth.

>She wasn't super-curvy, or super-muscular, like the other sharkgirls, but intelligence glittered in her warm brown eyes.
>You walked over and decided to offer to buy her a drink.
>She smiled, but said "No, thank you. Alcohol and this stuff," she said, waving the cigarette holder, "sneak up on me."
"That stuff?"
>"It's some weed a friend of mine grows. Want a hit?"
"No, thanks. I'm walking."
>She giggle-snorts at that.

>You find this absolutely adorkable.
"So, I'm curious about the, um"
>you gesture with a hand
>"Genemod thing?"
"Yeah. If it isn't too personal--well, please understand I'm looking in from the outside."
>"That makes sense. Can I tell you a little story?"
"Sure."
>"Once there was a little girl named Lily. She was bright and curious, but she was very sick, with a disease called leukemia."
>"She fought hard and the doctors used every drug and treatment they had, but she couldn't be saved, or at least her body couldn't."
>"Her parents had money, and the first wave of genemods were happening, along with braintaping and brain uploading."
>"And her favorite animals had been sharks, and she was already obsessed with them."
>"It's a philosophical question--did the little girl die, and is the braintaped copy of her installed into a cloned genemod body just a copy?"
>"It has all her memories. From her perspective, she's really the original--as much as anyone can be said to be anything these days."

>"People get computer interfaces wired directly to their brains, they get electronic eyes that can see infrared and x-rays."
>They get replacement limbs of perfect gleaming stainless steel, a hundred times stronger and more precise than the originals, that'll run for a century on a nuclear battery."
>"People get their brains uploaded to leave the physical world for virtual reality, even MMO games. There was that one guy a few years back, that von Schoenherr guy,"
>"He got himself braintaped then installed copies of his own mind in about three dozen mlitary-grade genemod clone bodies--things with built-in bulletproof armor and claws and poison-sacs and worse."
>"He called them 'bodyguards' but was really trying to start some kind of terrorist organization to overthrow a government somewhere and set himself up as a king."
>"And these new copies of him objected to being used as cannon fodder, so they decided to kill him instead. Supposedly he had the nerve to be SURPRISED."
>"But that's a depressing topic," she said, taking another hit and going slightly cross-eyed.
"I suppose it is."
>"I suppose you have the usual baseline-human questions?"
"Well, if you put it like that, yeah."
>"You're a curious little monkey. You ought to be careful."
"Are you dangerous, then?"
>she bares her teeth, which just for a moment, in the dim lighting, gives her a demonic aspect
>"Grrr! " she says, leaning forward to grab you by the shoulder. "I'll eat ya!"
>and this is startling enough that you are taken aback
>she laughs, as if this were the funniest thing she'd seen in years
>to be fair, she's probably more than halfway to half-wasted
>and you can't stay mad, because she's making these adorable little snorting noises as she laughs
>Another of the shark-women walks over, this one tall and imposing in a glistening black leather corset,
>with big fin-ears and a thick red ponytail hanging down her back.
>Her eyes are green as a cat's, with vertically slit pupils.
>"Is this guy giving you trouble, Lily?"

>"No, no! I'm just teasing him. He's being perfectly polite. I should apologize to him."
>You give your politest smile to the newcomer, who looks like she has at least eight inches and a hundred pounds on you, none of it fat. And that's not counting the teeth, or the impressive bony claws on her fingertips.
>"Be nice to Lily. We sharkmods look out for one another. We can be your very best friends. But if you treat us bad we get unfriendly. And you won't like that."
>"You're going to scare him away, Vi."
"Vi?" you ask, still smiling.
>"Violence."
>Well, that escalated qui--
>Lily snorts again. "Her real name is Violet."
>Violet glares at both of you.
"I won't tell if you won't."
>Violet shakes her head at you, but she's smiling. She smiles more when you buy her a pitcher of beer, and she begins drinking from the pitcher as though it were a mug.
"So, I'm just curious. I've heard rumors but it's not a very common package, at least around here."
>Lily nods.
"I've heard you have gills in addition to lungs."
>She nods again. "We do, but swimming pools are a pain in the ass for us. We have to swim and breathe mammal-fashion. The chlorine hurts our gills. I love to swim, but in the ocean."
>"And I once got an infection in my gills from a hot-tub belonging to people who didn't change the water enough."
>"I see. And the eyeglasses?"
>"I'm near-sighted, out of water. Under water, I'm not."
"Like the original?"
>"Got it in one."
"Ah. So, do you have the, uh, the abrasive shark skin? The sharp scales?"
>"'Placoid scales' is the term for the overlapping microscopic razor-sharp bony scales, and most of us don't. It's tough armor but it shreds clothing--and other people's skin."
>"And we have a normal mammal skeleton, more or less, made of hard bone."
"Not cartilage?"
>"No, it wouldn't work well for walking around on land as a biped."
"I've also noticed," you gesture to your head.
>"Ah, ears. Some of us opt for large external ears like Vi has, some of us don't. Some opt for hair, some don't. A few of us have retractable claws, but that one isn't common."
"You're both very aesthetically pleasing."
>"Thank you."
>She turns to Violet. "He means he thinks we're pretty."
>This time it's Violet's turn to make snorting sounds as she giggles.
>Lily looks at you silently for a while.
>"Would you like to continue this conversation in a little more privacy?
"Sure."
>Violet smirks.

>Lily leads the way out a small door and up a flight of stairs to a little apartment above the bar.
>As you step into the room, Violet appears in the hallway, then joins you.
>You raise an eyebrow.
>"We look out for one another, always," says Vi. "Think of me as a sort of chaperone."
>Lily passes the cigarette and holder to Violet, who says "oh, thanks!" and takes a deep hit herself.
>You and Lily sit on a little couch, while Vi arches her back, eliciting a crackling sound from her spine, and lies back on the bed, arms folded behind her head, watching with heavy-lidded eyes.
>It's less noisy here.
"There were other questions I had," you say, and your voice is louder than you expected in the sudden quiet.
>"Oh?"
"If you don't have shark skin or scales, what sort of skin do you have, exactly?"
>She smiles. "Subtle. I like that." And she slowly strips off the long black formal gloves she'd been wearing, and picks up your hand between hers.
>On her hands her skin is a uniform sea-grey, and it feels warmer to the touch than you had expected. Her skin is firm, with a tacky quality that makes you think of latex.
"That makes me think of dolphins."
>"It's the same they use."
"Ironic."
>"Not really, sharkmods and dolphin mods aren't enemies."
"Ah."
>you reach up slowly and touch her dark auburn hair
>she smiles, reaches up, and takes out her hair pins, letting her hair fall about her shoulders
>you touch her cheek, which is soft and warm, like her hands
"um, is she going to--"
>from across the room, Violet exhales a cloud of resinous smoke and says "yeah, I like to watch," and grins at you.
>Lily actually blushes for a moment at this
>and you take the opportunity to lean forward and touch your lips to hers for just an instant
>"Well, now," she says. "Are you sure you want to do this? You don't know your own peril."
"Can't I have just a little bit of peril?"
>"No," says Violet, from the bed. "It's much too perilous."

>you smirk
>and Lily grins slowly, exposing her very impressive teeth

>"Touch them," she whispers
"Pardon?"
>"My teeth. I want you to see that they're not much sharper than normal human teeth. They won't cut you."
>and you put a finger to her lips, slowly tracing the outline of her mouth
>and then gently move your fingertip around the edges of several of her teeth--they're sharp, but not sharp enough to cut on contact like razor blades
>and she opens her mouth further, and coils her long, pointed tongue around your finger, smiling merrily all the while, licking it softly
"Lily, I like you more and more."
>Violet snorts again from the bed
>and you and Lily begin to kiss in earnest
>her hot, wet tongue tracing your lips, then touching yours
>you nibble and suckle gently on her tongue, and her lower lip
>her mouth tastes of weed but you don't mind
>her face is lighter in color than her limbs, and you can see her becoming flushed
>she stands up, turns around, and says "Please unzip my dress."
>and you oblige
>then remove your clothing as she takes off the dress and her undergarments, finally her eyeglasses
>she stands before you
>she is petite
>the top of her head does not come up to your chin
>and her face, the front of her throat, her chest and belly, they are almost white
>her limbs and back are mottled in shades of grey
>she has beautiful, pert pale white breasts with dark grey nipples that are already erect, and a round, firm ass, with a long, slender, finned shark tail coming from the base of her spine
>her dorsal fin is smallish, vestigial really, but then it'd have to be for most clothing to fit her
"You're beautiful, Lily."
>she smiles and steps forward, to wrap her arms around your waist, and then her flexible, muscular tail
>you put your hands on her shoulders
>and Violet walks up to put her hands over your hands, and grins at you, her face flushed like Lily's
>you stand there a moment, with Lily's body between you
>you look Violet in the eye and raise an eyebrow
>her response is to smile and nod, and you can see Violet's nipples are becoming erect even through the leather of her top
>and she wraps her own long, muscular, powerful tail around you and Lily in a firm hug
>Lily says "Would you like to get on the bed?"
"That could be a good idea, I think."
>and the three of you get on the bed, Violet as "big spoon" and Lily as "little spoon," and you facing them both.

>You kiss Lily again, and touch her breasts softly, then kiss and suckle her nipples
>Violet kisses the back of Lily's neck, and her hands roam Lily's body
>she winks at you
>Lily, the object of your attention, moans and squirms at your touch
>you reach down between her legs and stroke softly
>she opens her legs for you and puts her hands on the back of your hand as you gently, gently, probe between and inside
>and find her already becoming wet
>you taste her juices, and she is as salty as the sea
"I want to eat you," you whisper
>Violet snickers
>"Now, a man eating shark? That's not something I get to see every day."
>As Lily lies on Violet's belly and chest, you kneel between both sets of knees
>Lily has no trace of pubic hair and is as smooth down there as a bell pepper
>you raise an eyebrow
"What, no cloaca?"
>"No, no cloaca!" they both say in unison, but they both laugh.
>she moans softly and squeals a bit as you begin to lick her
>Violet makes eye contact with you and grins, baring all her teeth
>and says "Suck on her clit. She likes that. Suck it hard. You love that, don't you, Lily?"
>and she grabs Lily's hair and pulls it, just a bit
>Lily's only response is to put her hands on the back of your head and pull you into her, and cry out with pleasure as you do just that
>Violet says "Yeah, eat her, boy, eat her good," and puts her hands on the back of your head too, over Lily's. "Get in there, stud. Make her scream."
>Lily's hips buck as she cries out and tries to thrust herself into your mouth, Violet is unrelenting. "Oh, don't stop, you don't know how pent up Lily here has been, how long it's been"
>"She needs this, give it to her. Be nice to her and maybe I'll be nice to you, stud," and she begins to pull your hair, which is beginning to turn you on
>you look at both of them, their beautiful, beautiful, inhuman, demonic shark faces, one grinning and staring back at you with inhuman, vertical slit pupil eyes, the other, cross-eyed and jaw slack and long inhuman tongue lolling in ecstasy
>you don't understand everything that you're feeling right now
>but you know that right now there's no place in this or any other world you'd rather be than right here

>Lily pants in Violet's arms, and Violet tenderly brushes her hair out of her face
>and Violet gets something out of a dresser
>it's a very large vibrator
>Violet looks at you, and grins again
>"How do you feel about eating out a girl's asshole, stud?"
"If she's clean."
>"She is.  She's a dirty, dirty girl, but not that way."
>and she rolls Lily over in her arms to face her, and begins to enter her with the vibrator, kissing her and running her fingers through her hair.
>she presents Lily's ass to you, and lifts up Lily's long, slender, muscular shark tail to reveal a perfect little glistening puckered grey donut
>Lily is already moaning again as you kneel and begin licking her asshole
>which makes her giggle, squirm, and squeal
>Lily's hands disappear up under Violet's leather skirt
>as she and Violet continue to kiss and moan into one another's mouths
>you lick her asshole around and around and stick the tip of your tongue into it, which makes her moan louder and louder
>you reach up underneath her and put a finger on her clit even as Violet fucks her harder and harder with the vibrator
>and Lily arches her back and squeals again, then collapses on Violet, her face flushed, sweat forming on her eerie grey skin
>making it glisten in the light and just for a moment resemble latex
>Violet kisses her again, and smiles at you
>"Now I think you've earned a reward."
"That sounds good. What do you have in mind?"
>"Ever had a shark suck your dick, stud?"
"I can't say as I have."
>"I like your attitude. I guess you were expecting to be spending some time with just her, right?"
"Yeah, more or less."
>"We wore her out, stud. But she likes to watch as much as I do, and maybe she'll learn a few things."
"Okay. Can we kiss and pet a little bit first?"
>"I wouldn't dream of doing it any other way."
>and Violet gets atop you while Lily rolls to the side to watch with sleepy eyes and a smile.
>you feel Violet's solid weight atop you and it excites you

>Violet puts her hands on your shoulders and kisses you, hard, her tongue exploring your mouth
>you run your fingers through her long red hair, fondle and stroke the lobes of her long, pointed ears with your fingertips
>"You like this, don't you, stud? The big mean sharks have you and you can't get away, and you don't have any choice in this at all."
>"Now it's your turn. Now you're our fresh fish, our fuck meat." She play-bites you on the shoulder.
>she runs her claws lightly down your sides, making you shiver, then kisses you
>you touch her breasts through the heavy leather and she growls into your mouth
>she reaches down and grabs your cock firmly, and begins to stroke it
>"And that means you can just let go, and go with it, and feel, right?" and kisses you again, her tongue probing deep and hard in your mouth
>you feel something tickling your leg and look to your left to see that it's Lily, touching you lightly with the tip of her caudal fin, on the end of her tail
>then Lily wraps her muscular tail around your leg, and winks at you
>Violet wraps her tail around your other leg, and the two of them smoothly lever your legs apart
>Lily puts an arm around your shoulders, and holds you close, and kisses the side of your neck, and whispers in your ear:
>"We need your seed, human. Give it to us," and reaches down to touch your cock, then tickle your balls
>"Or else," adds Violet from between your knees, pantomiming snapping her jaws closed on your cock
>Lily play-bites you on the arm, just hard enough to leave marks, and not for the first time you wonder how easily she could kill you
>you are a little afraid and yet more turned on than you've ever been in your life
>Violet kisses the tip of your cock and licks it
>and hands the vibrator to Lily, who slides it into Violet's cunt and begins to pump it in and out
>even as Violet closes her lips around your cock, looking up at you with her demonic eyes
>"Come for us," whispers Lily. "Come for us, empty those balls. Shoot your hot spunk all over us, we need it."
>Violet play-bites your cock, just enough to let you feel the tips of her teeth on it, and works her head up and down, stroking your cock expertly with her hot lips and hot wet mouth and tongue
>"Give us your seed, please. We need your human cum," whispers Lily, even as Violet licks a clawed finger and slides it with surprising gentleness into your asshole to press on your prostate.
"I'm going to come, I'm going to come," you moan
>"Yes, come for us, right now," says Lily, and so you do

>and Violet sucks your cock deep into her throat to swallow your seed, moaning into you as Lily fucks her hard with the vibrator, tears forming at the corners of her eyes
>the three of you collapse into a sweaty heap in the bed, and you find yourself lying between Lily and Violet
>you kiss each of them delicately on the tip of the nose
>Violet grins at you, cum dripping from her lips and nose, even out of her gill slits
>and says "That's the way it is around here. Sometimes you eat the shark."
>And Lily kisses you on the ear, and says "And sometimes the shark eats you."
>And presently the three of you begin to doze.

END (I'd say "FIN" but in a sharkgirl story, that could get confusing)
