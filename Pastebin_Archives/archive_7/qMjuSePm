>It is Easter.  Or, April Fool's Day.  Both, actually.
>Since you work in a mall... it's been a pretty shitty day.
>You got assigned to assist the Easter Bunny this year.  Joy.  And since it's April Fool's, every single dad thinks he's a comedian.
>You've never seen so many joy buzzers in one day before, and frankly you hope to never see one again.
>Thankfully, the day is finally over.  You're in the staff room, all alone, getting ready to leave.
>Suddenly, someone speaks from behind you; a woman, by the sound of it.
>"Rough day today?  'Tis the season for pranks, after all."
>You grunt and nod noncommittally, not even looking at your conversational partner.
>"Not much of a talker, huh?  That's okay.  I'm chatty enough for both of us."
>You hear her take a seat in one of the cheap, creaky chairs behind you.
>"...mind if I tell you a story?  I love telling stories, and I think it'll brighten your mood a little."
>You sigh and turn around.
>"Lady, I just wanna go-"
>...you find yourself face-to-snout with some sort of blue wolf woman.  She grins with far too many teeth, and her tail coils around her mischievously.
>It then occurs to you that this woman is sitting in your favorite chair... entirely nude.
>"You wanna go... home?  I don't think it's time to clock out yet, is it?"
>You look at your watch...
>Shit.  10 minutes.
>"Alright, fine.  Make it quick."
>Immediately, her grin somehow widens.  She gestures wildly.
>"Great!  Let me tell you the Tale of the Real Easter Bunny."

>You roll your eyes and sit down, prompting your storyteller to stand up.  Or, more accurately, to leap from her chair, sending her modest bust into a fit of bouncing.
>Hm.  Maybe this won't be so bad if you can get a show out of the deal.  She begins weaving her tale.
>"Once, years ago, there was a powerful goddess by the name of... Coyote.  THAT'S ME!"
>Her last two words are amplified somehow, and blue confetti bursts from behind her.  She smiles as if waiting for a reaction.  When you don't respond, she continues talking.
>"The wonderful Coyote was a bit... mischievous.  She loved to play tricks on people, and she was the best at it, too.  But, sometimes her tricks had some... unexpected effects."
>Her toothy grin becomes a bit sheepish.
>"One day, Coyote decided to pull a prank on a rabbit.  It involved twenty cans of shaving cream, a handful of pop rocks, and the hair of a black dog.  It was so funny!  But, in her excitement... Coyote accidentally injured the rabbit.  Oops!"
>A laugh track plays from nowhere.  You yawn, and she tilts her head.
>"Mm?  Bored already?  I know, I know: let me make this interesting."
>She strolls over to you, swaying her hips exaggeratedly and letting her breasts bounce wildly.  She stops just in front of you, smiling.  She snaps her fingers...
>And your clothes vanish.

>"W-what the hell?!"
>"Relax, I know how to keep you humans happy!  I think.  It's been a while, I may be rusty.  Let me just..."
>She drops to her knees, then buries your member in her cleavage.  Her fur is incredibly soft, as are her tits.
>She grins wider when you find yourself standing at attention.
>"Oh good, that still works!  Now, where was I...?  Ah yes!  Coyote's great prank injured the rabbit, which was a problem because... that rabbit was the Easter Bunny!"
>As she speaks, Coyote absentmindedly massages you with her bust.  Despite her apparent lack of focus... she's not bad.
>"The rabbit spoke to Coyote, saying 'Someone has to take my job tomorrow!' So... Coyote took up the ears herself!"
>...before your eyes, her pointed ears lengthen, resembling those of a rabbit.  She winks, and gives you another good stroking with her tits.
>"So, Coyote adopted the ears- and tail!"
>Her long tail shrinks into a powderpuff.
>"And became the Easter Bunny.  Now, she had no idea what the Easter Bunny is supposed to DO... so... she winged it."
>You suddenly interrupt her.
>"Hey, uh, you may wanna stop, I'm about to-"
>You finish up mid sentence, coating Coyote's chest and face in your seed. Her expression doesn't change.
>"Gah-hah, I guess I don't know my own strength.  Don't worry, there's still plenty of story left; lemme just-"
>She rotates around, presenting you with her toned, firm ass and newfound cotton tail.
>Without a word of warning, she simply starts grinding against you.

>"Now then; since she had no idea what was expected of her, Coyote did Easter her own way: with gusto!  She went allll around the world, hiding rabbit eggs."
>"What? Rabbits don't lay eggs."
>She looks over her shoulder with that toothy grin, your earlier, err, tribute still dripping from her face.
>"Who's telling this story?  Rabbits do in fact lay eggs, thank you; why else would rabbits be part of Easter?  Humans, I swear."
>She temporarily redoubles her efforts, practically assaulting your rod with her rump.
>"ANYWAY.  Coyote hid rabbit eggs allll around the world, and told people to find them.  It was a hoot; she put all kinds of prizes inside!"
>"What kind of prizes...?"
>"Anything!  Money, fame, happiness, bees, candy... Coyote even put a few of her teeth in some of them, for good luck!"
>"Did people... like her prizes?"
>"Of course!  Everyone loved Coyote's Easter; they all screamed with joy!"
>She grins nostalgically just as you pop off another shot, this time coating her back, tail, and ass.
>"Err, sorry about that."
>She snickers and waves a hand dismissively.

>"Okay, story's almost over.  Let me just-"
>She readjusts herself again... then spears herself on your dick.
>"There we go!  Alright, so: people loved Coyote's Easter SOOO much that the old, hurt Easter Bunny approached her.  'Coyote,' she said, 'you're doing a really good job, but we're afraid people might have TOO much fun.  So I'm gonna take it from here.'"
>As she speaks, Coyote rhythmically pushes herself up and down your length, slowly speeding up.
>"So, Coyote did the reasonable thing and became Coyote again.  But-"
>You can't help but let out a moan.  She cuts herself off midsentence.
>"Already?  But I haven't even finished my story!  Fine, fine; let me help."
>She suddenly shifts into overdrive, pumping herself up and down at blinding speeds.
>You can't help it; you blow a load inside the goddess.  Once you're finished, she pants a few times.
>"...feel better?"
>You nod, breathless.  She smiles again.

>"Great!  Looks like my work is done then.  Happy Easter, human."
>She pulls herself off of you, cum dripping from her blue fur, and starts to walk off.  As you watch her hips sway, you realize something.
>"Wait!  You didn't finish the story!"
>She stops and immediately turns 180 degrees.
>"Oh, right!  Anyway, Coyote let the Easter Bunny have her job back, but she had the last laugh.  Y'know why?"
>You have to know.  You HAVE to.
>"Why?"
>"Because Coyote knew how Easter worked all along!  It was all a joke, gah-hah!  Plus, it wasn't even Easter; it was Halloween!  Gah-hah-hah-hah!"
>The goddess doubles over, guffawing at her own story.
>You can't help but join her in laughing, even though it wasn't that funny.
>She breathlessly pats you on the back as the two of you slowly stop laughing.  She eventually sighs, and the room goes quiet.
>She smiles at you, ears and tail returning to normal.
>"One more thing, human."
>"What's that?"
>"Good luck finding your uniform."
>Before you can say anything, she dashes out of the room, cackling with glee and leaving a trail of your seed behind her.
>You are so fired.
