ANONS ANTHRO EXTRAVAGANZA

>Be Anon
>24 years old, living in a small city in the Midwest
>You stand at 5'10", with pretty average looks.
>You were living by yourself in a cheap apartment downtown.
>Life was pretty good, aside from your shitty job.
>You're not sure why you thought becoming a mailman was a good idea.
>It's the middle of October and you're just chilling at home on a Sunday morning watching some Netflix, and browsing 4chan.
>Suddenly, your good friend George calls you.
>George had been your friend almost your whole life, and he was always doing something interesting.
>Your relationship had been a bit strained recently though, because of his new girlfriend.
>She was an Anthro.
>You didn't consider yourself a racist or anything, but there was just something about Anthros that made your skin crawl.
>You weren't sure if it was the fur, the teeth, or just the way they carried themselves on those weird digitigrade legs.
>Probably all three, now that you thought about it.

>After a moment, you answer the phone, and you hear Georges familiar voice:
>"Hey, Anon! You busy today?"
>You tell him no, and that you were just planning on hanging out at home all day
>"Well alright! Listen, there's a huge costume party going on tonight right outside of town, and I got invited."
>"The dude who owns the house said I could bring as many people as I wanted, and you were one of the first people on my mind."
>"So what do you say? You wanna come? There'll be free booze, and women aplenty. Maybe your antisocial ass will even meet someone!"
>Debating your choices for a moment, you ask him what time you would need to ready by, and if there was anyone else coming with you.
>He responds almost immediately:
>"I know you don't have a car, so I could pick you up around 6:30. And I'm bringing Kate along."
>Ugh. Kate. You didn't want to say you didn't like his girlfriend, but you really didn't like his girlfriend.
>She was nice enough, but you didn't even like "normal" cats, let alone ones almost the same height as you.
>But you didn't want to let her get in the way of your lifelong friendship with George, so you bite your tongue.
>You remember that you don't work tomorrow, so you decide that you might as well go. It would make George happy, and you needed some points with him if you didn't want to drift apart as friends.
>You respond saying that you were willing to go, and he could just call you when he was on his way to pick you up.
>George responds with a happy tone of voice:
>"Great! Fantastic. You don't have to bring anything, I've got us covered."
>"Just remember to, uh, wear a costume. I'll see you tonight, man!"
>And with that, he hangs up.
>Maybe he was right, and you would meet someone.
>It sure had been awhile since you had been with someone, and you were hoping to end your dry spell.

>When 6:15 rolls around, you're sitting on your shitty apartment's shitty couch, waiting for your friend to arrive
>You were too lazy to go out and get a costume, so you decided to just wear your mailman uniform.
>Blue pants, Polished black shoes, a Blue button-up shirt with the Postal Service logo, a plain blue cap, and a beige canvas mailbag.
>Maybe people would think it was funny.
>As you're debating if you should change into something else, your phone goes off.
>Picking it up, you see it's George.
>"Anon! I'm about 10 minutes away. Be ready to go."
>You reply, saying you'll be waiting by the curb.
>"Cool, cool. See you then."
>You hang up, and move to the door.
>You exit your apartment, taking your phone and keys with you.
>You lock the door, and head down the steps, walking out onto the sidewalk
>As you wait there, you get some strange looks from people, probably confused at the guy dressed as a mailman just leaning on a wall
>Pretty soon, you hear a car roll up, and a quick glance confirms It's George. And Kate.
>"Get in loser, We're going partying!"
>George was dressed up as Superman. He was wearing some cheap bootleg costume you're pretty sure couldn't have cost more than $5.
>Sighing, you get in the backseat and buckle up.
>You greet your friend, and nod at his girlfriend.
>She was an Abyssinian cat, standing at 5'8'', with bright blue eyes.
>She was dressed up as an Egyptian, wearing a generic black dress, with fake gold jewelry, and a felt headdress.
>Kate looks at you and gives a small smile.
>"Hi, Anon! You excited about the party?"
>You nod silently at her.
>Why did she always have to be so enthusiastic about everything?

>As George pulls away from the curb and drives off to the suburbs outside the city, he pipes up:
>"Haha dude, are you seriously just wearing your work uniform?"
>You tell him to shut it, and that you aren't wasting money on something you'll only wear once.
>He chuckles a bit, before he starts chatting with his girlfriend
>You space out a bit, and look out the window, checking out the city as it rolls by.
>After a while, you decide to check out what he's bringing to the party, and look into the plastic bags on the seat next to you
>Oh hell yeah.
>It's a two liter of the best soft drink ever made.
>Dr. Pepper™.
>The other bag held some cheap vodka, which you were sure there was going to be loads of at the party.
>After about 20 minutes of driving, you ask George when you're going to get to the party, and if he knew where he was going.
>"Don't worry, Anon. We'll be there soon. It's on the edge of some suburbs in a huge farmhouse. I've been there before."
>Satisfied with the answer, you lean back into your seat and think about what you're going to do at the party.

>After a while, you're jolted awake as the car comes to a quick stop. You must have dozed off.
>George looks back at you with a smile on his mustached face and tells you:
>"Wake up, Anon! We're here! Grab the bags next to you and let's go in!"
>You mumble out an okay, and get out of the car, stretching as you stand up.
>Your eyes widen a bit as you look up at the house.
>George wasn't joking when he said it was large. The damn place must have cost a fortune for the owner.
>You also think George was full of shit when he said it was on the edge of the suburbs.
>You're somewhere out in the country, and the house is in-between a field of wheat, and a huge cornfield.
>You guess it doesn't matter though, as you weren't the one paying for gas.
>You grab the bags out of the car, and follow your companions up to the front door.

>Before your friend can knock, the door suddenly opens, the sound of a party spilling out onto the lawn.
>A tall Doberman stands in the doorway, and he smiles when he sees your group, and yells back into the house:
>"Hey, George is here! And he brought friends!"
>He looks back at you guys, and motions for you to come inside
>"Well don't stand there like a bunch of chumps, come on in!"
>He looks at the bags you're holding, and smiles
>"If that's booze, just go and put it somewhere in the kitchen. It's right on the right when you come in"
>You walk in the door, and suddenly the faint smell of fur and Anthro musk assaults your senses.
>The house is packed! 
>You look around, and quickly realize there's barely any humans here. It's mostly just Anthros of various species.
>George had neglected to tell you this, and you were going to make it a point to remind him of this later.

>Following the Dobermans instructions you turn right, go past the stairs, and head into the kitchen.
>You place the bags on a table, not bothering to take the Vodka or Dr. Pepper™ out of the bags.
>Looking around the kitchen, you can see various foods set out.
>That and a few Anthros.
>One of them greets you, and you give a small wave as you turn back to find your friend.
>You walk back into the living room, and he's nowhere in sight.
>Kate is talking to some black cat. She notices you, and waves you over.
>Wanting to know where George went, you steel yourself before approaching her.
>She smiles at you as you walk over, before turning back to the ebony cat.
>"Oh, I'd like you to meet Anon! He's a friend of George."
>The other cat turns to look at you, and you see she's dressed up as Catwoman. Very Original.
>She reaches out to shake your hand, and you reluctantly take it to be polite.
>To your surprise, she doesnt shake it, and instead brings it up to her mouth to kiss it gently, her warm lips pressing against the back of your hand.
>While you internally scream at the unwelcome contact, she smiles and introduces herself
>"Hello, Anon. I'm Samantha."
>You respond by telling her your name, and then you quickly turn to Kate, asking her where George went.
>"Oh, he went to the bathroom. He'll be back in a couple minutes. Why don't you talk to me and Sammy here while you wait?"
>Before you can respond, Samantha frowns at Kate, and starts talking.
>"Kate, please don't call me Sammy. You know I hate that nickname."
>"Anyways, so, Anon. I like the costume. Where'd you get it? It looks so high quality."
>You quickly reply that it isn't really a costume, as your anxiousness grows as you stand in the room full of Anthros.
>"Wait, you really are a mailman? That's neat. What do you do? Drive the mail truck?"
>You tell her you do in fact drive the truck, and you can feel the spaghetti starting to fall out of your pockets. You didn't have much experience talking to women, and it really showed.
>Before she can respond, you quickly excuse yourself, and head back into the kitchen
>If you have to talk to Anthros, you might as well do it more relaxed.

>The kitchen this time is empty, save for the one Anthro who greeted you before.
>This time though, he thankfully seems to be on his phone, and not interested in chatting.
>You pour some of the Vodka your friend brought into a plastic cup, and take a sip.
>You can almost instantly feel some of your anxiety leave you.
>This was a party, and goddamn it you were going to have fun whether you liked it or not.
>You glance at the clock in the kitchen, and see it's only 7. This was going to be a long night.
>You walk back into the center of the house, and George is standing there talking to Kate and Samantha.
>You approach them, and stand next to George, while the three of them chat.
>After a moment, George puts his hand on your shoulder, and tries to introduce you to Samantha
>She stops him and says that you and her had already been introduced by Kate.
>George smiles at you, and asks you if you're enjoying yourself yet.
>You shrug, and tell him you think the party is alright so far.
>He responds:
>"Don't worry, Anon! It's still pretty early, and there's a lot of people to chat with."
>He leans in closer to you, and says in a hushed tone:
>"And these Anthro women go crazy for human guys. Believe me."
>Upon hearing those last words leave his lips, you cringe a bit.
>If any Anthro tries to come onto you, you think you might just off yourself.
>Apparently your expression betrays your thoughts, and his smile falters
>"Or you can just hang out and watch TV or something. Nobody is going to force you to do anything."
>Suuure. You trusted these Anthros about as far as you could throw them. And you were willing to bet that wasn't too far.

>20 minutes pass, and as you finish your first drink, you feel a little less awkward.
>After pouring yourself a full cup of Dr. Pepper™ (You didn't want to get wasted just yet), you sit down on a couch near the television.
>There's some boring documentary about the history of Halloween on, and you quickly lose interest.
>Instead, you choose to look around the room at the other guests.
>Fuck, there's Anthros of every shape and size in here.
>Some are wearing elaborate, expensive costumes they must have planned in anticipation of the party, like Samantha.
>Others are wearing shitty dollar store costumes they must have purchased right before they got here, like George.
>While you're busy looking around the room, you almost don't notice the female Border Collie sit close next to you. A bit too close.
>Her costume confuses you a bit and you can't immediatly place it.
>She's wearing a tattered, old fashioned dress, some worn out jeans, and a straw hat.
>When you see the straw poking out of her sleeves, and glued to her dress it hits you. She's dressed as a scarecrow!
>She smiles at you while you look at her costume, and she points at herself with a clawed thumb and introduces herself:
>"Heya there, human! My name is Rylee. What's yours?"
>You stammer out an introduction, and she nods.
>"Anon, huh? Nice name. Even better costume. It looks pretty realistic. Where'd you get it?"
>You repeat what you said to Samantha, and she excitedly responds.
>"Oh wow! You're really a mailman? I wanted to be one when I was younger, but I couldn't bear to leave my parents farm."
>She chuckles a bit, and gestures to her body
>"Hence my costume."
>She smiles, and looks down at the drink she's holding.
>"One of the things I like about this party is that theres always a ton of free alcohol. The guy who owns this place isn't a cheapskate, that's for sure."
>She turns her gaze from her drink, and looks you right in the eyes.
>"And there's always lots of interesting people to meet."
>Before you can respond, and spill your spaghetti everywhere, she continues.
>"Anyways, I just wanted to introduce mysemf. I'm going to go talk to one of my friends now."
>"If you get bored, come find me. Or maybe I'll find you."
>Then she does something terrifying.
>She winks at you.
>"See you around, Mr. Mailman."

>Rylee stands up and leaves you sitting on the couch, and you watch her walk deeper into the house.
>You look back at the TV, and try to come to terms with what she just said.
>Ok, so you're pretty sure an Anthro just flirted with you. So that happened.
>To your own surprise and slight shame, you consider taking her up on her offer, before realizing what you're thinking of.
>It's your duty to secure the existence of your people and a future for human children.
>At least that's what you read on a human thread on /pol/.
>Speaking of humans, you see George smiling at you as he walks over to you, and you stand up to talk to him.
>"Nice, Anon. It's good to see you're finally socializing. I almost thought you didn't like Anthros or something from the way you were acting earlier."
>Yeah. Almost.
>"That was Rylee you were just talking to. She lives a couple miles down the road from here. She usually keeps to herself, but I think she likes you."
>Oh boy. What good news.
>"Anyways, I'm going to grab something to eat. Want to come with?"
>You say sure, and that you were getting hungry anyways.
>You walk into the kitchen for the 4th time that night, and check out the food sitting around.
>Pretty standard looking food. It looks like a lot of the people brought their own stuff.
>Overall, it all looks pretty good, and you take a bit of what looks best.
>You end up with some roasted chicken, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, and a little Styrofoam bowl of chili.
>As you're getting napkins and a fork, George disappears out the door with his food.
>When you leave to follow him, he is again nowhere to be seen.
>Goddamn it George.

>You walk out into the hallway where you saw Rylee head off to, and look for a place to eat.
>At the end of the hallway, you end up in a dining room about the same size as the living room.
>There were about 10 Anthros in here eating and chatting with each other.
>You pick a spot at a table where nobody else is sitting nearby, and start to pick at your food.
>It all tastes pretty average, except for the chili. 
>It's some of the best chili you've ever eaten.
>You're so concentrated on eating, that you barely notice somebody sitting next to you.
>Looking up, you see that it's Samantha again.
>She sets down her plate, before looking at you and speaking. 
>"Hello again, Anon. Enjoying the meal?"
>You tell her the truthfully that you're really enjoying it.
>"That's good to hear, Anon. I wouldn't want you to be... Uncomfortable."
>She gives you a toothy grin as she says the last part of that sentence, and you feel a bit uneasy when you look at her teeth.
>Those damn things look sharp enough to cut through bone

>Trying to take Georges advice from earlier, you're about to ask her how her meal is, before she does something about a dozen times worse than Rylee winking at you.
>Under the tablecloth, you feel her long black tail coil around your leg, just above your foot
>You're about to start sweating bullets, but her tail withdraws just as quickly at it wrapped around you.
>Samantha gives you a small grin before saying:
>"Oops. Sorry, Anon. The thing has a mind of its own, I swear."
>Personally, you think she's full of shit.
>And aren't black cats supposed to be bad luck?
>Okay, maybe that's a bit racist, but still. You draw the line at tails wrapping around any of your extremities. 
>You tell her just to please not do it again
>You then ask her how her meal is, and she responds with a bit of a confused look
>Maybe that's not the reaction she was expecting from you?
>"Oh. Well, um... It's good, I suppose. I prefer more... Refined foods, though."
>What is it with cats and trying to act fancy?
>"To be honest, I really didn't come here for the food though."
>"I came here to... Socialize. And that's what I'm doing right now."
>Unsure of how to respond, you sip your drink.
>You really don't like where this conversation is going.
>As you try to think of a way out of the dining room without flat out booking it, she asks you another question.
>"So. How's life been for you? I know you live in the city, and I know you're a mailman."
>You reply that living in the city is alright, but sometimes your hours made you murderous.
>"And do you live with anyone? Any roommates?"
>For some reason, this question makes you uneasy, but you reply anyway, telling her the apartment was barely large enough for just you.
>"Interesting... Anon, would-"

>You interrupt her, asking if she's seen George within the past 10 minutes.
>She seems a bit upset you interrupted her, but she answers your question.
>"Yes... He was with Kate. They were dining on the back lawn."
>"Now like I was saying, would you like to-"
>You interrupt her again, apologizing, but you say that you really need to talk to George about something.
>You can see by her expression she's a bit upset that you're brushing her off like this, but you really don't want to keep this conversation going.
>"Well, fine then. If you actually feel like talking to some fool sitting in the grass, go ahead and do it. I won't stop you. I'll be here if you change your mind."
>At the moment, you decide you don't much care for Samantha.
>You're kind of bothered at how she just called your best friend a fool, but you let it go.
>You don't want to be "that guy" who starts shit at a party.

>After tossing your empty plate and bowl in a large trash bin near the door, you move to the back of the house to go out the back door.
>You end up in what looks like some sort of sitting room.
>A door leading to the back porch is in here, and you go through it.
>When you go outside, you see that the sun is almost fully set, and it's really dark out.
>You almost forgot how dark it got outside the city. There was so little light you could even see the stars out.
>Looking around, you see you're on the back porch. Rylee is out here, and she gives you a small wave, before looking back at a group of several Anthros and resuming talking to them.
>You get off the porch, and look out to the backyard.
>Other than a large bonfire about 30 feet away from you, you can't see shit in this darkness.
>You see George and Kate sitting by the bonfire, and you go over to talk with him.
>You stop when you see they aren't just sitting there.
>They're making out. You couldn't understand how he could stand dating an Anthro, let alone kiss one.
>Feeling a bit grossed out, you move back up onto the porch, deciding to wait another 10 minutes and then come back if they're not doing anything.

>As you walk over to the door to go back into the sitting room, you see someone turn to follow you in your peripheral vision.
>You enter the room, and stand near a wall. You don't want to go back by the dining room or living room, because you don't want another encounter with Samantha.
>The Anthro you saw turn to follow you enters the room through the same door as you, and walks over. Here we go again.
>You think It's a guy, based on the slim build and lack of breasts, but then It speaks.
>"Hey... Your name is uh.. Anon, right? George and Kate were talking about you..."
>Oh God. It's a woman, and she sounds wasted.
>A Rat Woman to be exact. And you thought cats were bad.
>She's dressed up in a really cheap looking suit. She's also wearing blue latex gloves and a paper-mâché clown mask
>She must be a Payday 2 fan.
>"My name's Erika... It's nice... Uh... To meet you. Anon."
>"You, uh... Wanna sit down?"
>Hesitating for a moment, you nod, and sit down on a nearby couch.
>She sets her mask down on a nearby table, before sitting down as close as she can to you.
>Seeing her mask off, you get a better look at her face, confirming for sure that she is in fact a woman.
>"So... You, uh... Go to parties often?"
>She gives you a goofy looking grin characteristic of someone who's had a few more drinks than they should have.
>This should be fun. You sigh, thinking that you might as well humor her.

>You reply saying that you don't really go out much. The only reason you're here tonight is because you don't work tomorrow.
>"Oh. What, uh... Do you do? For uh, work I mean..."
>You gesture out your outfit, and she sits up for a second, grinning.
>"Hehehehee, did you just wear your uniform for a costume?!"
>Based on the way she enters a fit of loud laughing after she finishes her sentence, you guess that you wearing your uniform must be the funniest thing in the world to her right now.
>She leans in closer to you, one of her hands resting on your shoulder.
>"I... I like you. You wanna, uh... Get out of here?"
>You feel your dick start to betray you, and give an involuntary twitch.
>You successfully will it back into submission, and try to form a sentence to say to her.
>Before you can respond, she rests her head on your shoulder and mumbles into your ear:
>"I really like humans... I've seen the videos online..."
>Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck what do you do?
>After a couple seconds, you decide to say the first excuse that comes to mind.
>You stammer out that you need to use the bathroom real quick, and she narrows her eyes and smiles at you.
>"You, umm... Want me to come with?"
>You tell her you're fine by yourself and she pouts at you.
>You try to get up, but she keeps a solid grip on your arm.
>"W-wait! I want to give you something... Just real quick..."
>She reaches into one of her suits inner pockets, and pulls out her phone
>"In case you change your mind... Here's my number..."
>She pulls a napkin out of her pocket, and quickly scribbles a number on it with a pen that was lying on a nearby table.
>She thrusts the napkin into your mailbag, and lets you go.
>She winks, before saying:
>"See you sooooon, Mailman..."

>Getting up, you walk back down the hall and head into the bathroom next to the kitchen.
>You lock the door behind you, and sit on the closed toilet with a sigh.
>You pull the napkin out of your mailbag and look at it.
>The drunken scrawl is beyond understanding, so you toss it in the wastebin next to the sink without a second thought.
>As if things weren't uncomfortable enough for you already, now you had drunken Anthros trying to get in your pants.
>You get up and walk over to the sink.
>You splash some cold water on your face, and groan into your hands.
>Looking at your phone, you notice two things:
>One, It's still only 8:23.
>Two, your phone was starting to get low on battery.
>You knew you forgot something, and that thing was charging your phone before you left.
>You jam the phone back into your pocket, and step back out of the bathroom.
>You head out the front door and walk around the house to the backyard; not wanting to risk another encounter with Erika.

>Heading around the porch and to the bonfire, you see George and Kate just sitting there normally now.
>George smiles at you as you approach, and he tosses you a beer.
>Eh, why not.
>You crack open the beer before George starts talking:
>"Hey, Anon, my man! How's the party treating you? How was the food?"
>You say that the food was good, especially the Chili.
>Hoping he doesn't sense anything is off, you say that the Party is going pretty well, and you're even having a little bit of fun.
>"Haha, that's good to hear. By the way, I'm pretty sure Rylee made the Chili. I'll have to tell her you liked it."
>You shrug. Out of all the Anthros you've met tonight, Rylee was by far the least promiscuous out of all of them, so you guessed it was okay.
>Getting back to the point, you ask when he's planning on leaving.
>He frowns at you, saying:
>"Wait, what? Already? We've only been here a couple hours, Anon."
>Sensing his disappointment in you, you instead tell him you just want to know when you're leaving so you can be ready then, and that you're in no hurry.
>Lucky for you, George was always bad at telling when someone is lying.
>"Well, alright! That's good to hear. Here I thought you were wanting to leave before you even got a buzz going on."
>You shake your head and smile, and take a sip of the beer.
>It's surprisingly good beer, for being at a party.
>"Well, Anon, If you don't mind, I'm going to sit out here and watch the fire. With my girlfriend."
>Kate purrs at him in response, and you take the hint.
>You tell him you'll catch up with him later, and turn to head back into the house, going around the side again.

>While you're walking around the side of the house by the Cornfield though, you hear something and stop in your tracks, turning to face the countless rows of corn.
>There's rustling inside the Cornfield, along with the sound of people talking and laughing.
>Not wanting to get involved, you quickly turn back around, only to be walk straight into a large pair of furred tits.
>Sputtering, you step back a bit and look up into the face of a large Anthro Draft Horse.
>She stands at nearly 6'10", with light brown fur. Atleast that's the color you think it is. It's too dark our to be sure, the sun having fully set.
>Blushing, you look down, shaking you head at yourself
>You look back up in her eyes, and apologize for walking into her.
>In response, she grins at you, before laughing.
>"Hahaha, don't worry about it!"
>Well, at least she isn't drunk.
>She motions for you to walk in front of a window, so you can both stand in the light shining through it.
>Looking at her in the light, you see something that you can't help but grin at.
>She's dressed up as a mailman. Or mailwoman. Whatever.
>It's not as nice as yours, considering hers is just a costume, but still. Not a lot of love for mailmen when it comes to this kind of thing.

>She looks a bit surprised when she gets a better look at you, and then she smiles widely.
>"Well would you look at that! A human. Not a lot of you guys out here in the country, you know."
>You reply that you were from the city, and you had come here with your friend George.
>"George? Isn't he Kate's boyfriend? Or am I confusing him for someone else?"
>You nod, and she nods back.
>"So, humie. What's your name? Mine's Sandra, but you can just call me Sandy. It's what all my friends call me."
>You give her your name, and she seems a bit confused.
>"Anon, huh? I don't know any Anons."
>She looks back at the cornfield.
>"I'm guessing you heard the noise in there?"
>You reply that you did, and she continues:
>"Yeah, sounds to me like a bunch of drunken fools running around in there. I swear, I don't have any ill will towards you city folk, but it seems like you people always act the stupidest when you're drunk."
>That gets a small chuckle out of you, and makes her smile.
>Suddenly, she points at your uniform.
>"I heard there was someone else dressed up as a mailman here, and I think I found him."
>"Yours looks a lot better than mine. Where did you find a shirt with the, uh, logo on it?"
>You were getting a little tired of explaining your profession, but you do it anyways.
>"Oh, neat. I could never be a mailman. I don't have a problem with waking up early, but it just seems like it would be so boring!"
>"Uh, no offense, of course."
>You agree with her, saying that waking up in the morning isn't bad once you're used to it, but doing almost the same thing every day for the past 2 and a half years gets old pretty quick.

>After a minute, the two of you move to the front porch, so you can stand in the light.
>The two of you chat up there for awhile, and when you run out of beer, she walks into the house to get some more for the both of you.
>While you wait, you suddenly feel your phone vibrate once in your pocket.
>You pull your phone out of your pocket to check the text, expecting it to be from George, maybe telling you he was ready to leave.
>Nope, not from George. You were almost glad, though. You were really enjoying the conversation you were having with Sandy. You knew not all Anthros were bad, but this one was downright pleasant.
>Checking the text though, you frown.
>It was from an unknown number, and the text didn't seem very legible:
>"hey annon itd me erija"
>Oh god, It's the drunken rat again.
>How the hell did she get your number?!
>You respond to the text saying Hello to her, and asking her how she got your number.
>"goerge gave.it 2 me"
>God fucking damn it, George.
>"i have a ssurpise 4 u"
>You didn't like where this was going.
>Seeing Sandy walk back onto the porch with two beers, you put your phone on silent, and stick it back into your pocket.

>"Whatcha doing on your phone, Anon?"
>You tell her you were just checking the time. It's nearly 9'O clock.
>"You planning on leaving soon? I think I might head out soon. Probably after I finish this beer."
>You thank her for the beer, and resume your conversation.
>It was nice to talk about politics with someone who shared your views, and you finish up just as soon as the two of you finish your bottles.
>She smiles at you, before saying:
>"Well, Anon, I think I'm gonna head home now. It's getting late... I got one question for you before I leave, though."
>You ask her what it is, and she leans down, her mouth close to your ear.
>"You wanna come with me?"
>You find yourself seriously debating whether or not to take up her offer.
>Boner, I swear to god if you pop up i'm never watching porn ever again.
>The more sober part of your brain wins the internal debate.
>You respond with a sorry, but you think you're going to stay. You tell her you really enjoyed her company, though.
>To your surprise, she doesn't seem too upset, and just shrugs, still smiling at you.
>"No skin off my back, Anon. If you ever change your mind though... Here."
>She pulls out her phone and tells you to do the same.
>She asks for your number, and you give it to her.
>She texts you to make sure you aren't trying to fake her out, and she's pleased when you get the message.
>"Well Anon, It sure was nice being in your company, but sadly, I gotta leave."
>She squats down to your height, and to your surprise, pulls you into a gentle hug.
>You return to hug to her delight, and she whispers in your ear:
>"Don't forget to message me once in awhile, you hear?"
>And with that, she gets back up and steps off the porch.
>You watch her walk down into the street, before she gives you one last wave (which you return), and walks off into the night.
>She must live around here like Rylee, if she's walking home.

>Checking your phone, you see that Erika never sent you another text.
>If you were lucky, maybe she had passed out somewhere in the house, or was otherwise too smashed to communicate anymore.
>You decide to head back into the house, as it was starting to get chilly outside.
>It was the middle of October, after all.
>Walking back into the living room, you see a few people scattered around.
>You pick a spot near the TV, and it seems someone switched the channel to some military documentary
>/k/ would be proud
>While you're sitting there, a couple anthros decide to sit next to you, seemingly wanting to watch it too.
>You sit there for awhile, sipping your beer, and chilling silently with anthros
>By now, you don't even notice the smell of fur, and you settle in comfortably; the alcohol working nicely on your system.

>After awhile, you get up, and walk into the kitchen to see if theres any of that Chili left.
>You're quickly greeted by Rylee, and when she sees you, you notice her tail start to wag a bit.
>"Hey there, Anon! I heard you liked my Chili!"
>You tell her you did, and that it was really good.
>"Yeah, I ran into George while he was grabbing some drinks, and he told me."
>"He gave me your number too, so I could send you the, uh, Recipe."
>You didn't know what it was with George, and him giving people your number. You were going to make sure to talk about it.
>On the bright side, atleast Rylee will send you her Chili recipe. Hopefully.
>Looking at Rylee, you see her smile falter for a moment, and she suddenly asks you a question:
>"Um, Anon? I... Need to do something real quick. It's a dog thing, so you wouldn't understand. Is that alright with you?"
>You nod, saying that you'll do anything she wants as long as she gives you that chili recipe.
>In retrospect, you could probably have worded that better.
>She eyes widen, and she gives you a toothy grin.
>It looks like she's just fine with how you worded it.
>Suddenly, she reaches for you and takes your shoulders.
>Before you can say anything, she pulls you in close to her, her tits poking you.
>She leans down and buries her muzzle in between your neck and shoulder.
>She sniffs deeply for few moments and then pulls back, sighing happily, her eyes narrowed, and her tongue hanging out of her mouth.
>She then collects herself, lets go of you, and stands back up straight.

>"Thanks, Anon."
>Well that was confusing.
>You're about to ask what the hell just happened, but she anticipates this and answers quickly:
>"Ummm... Like I said, It's a dog thing. We like to know the scents of our friends so that we can identify them, or where they've been."
>"Also, It's a good indicator of whether or not that person is... Romantically involved with someone else."
>"It's traditional in most canine cultures to mark their mates by rubbing against them to transfer scents between the two."
>"N-not that you would be, uh, interested in anything like that."
>She looks at you, clearly thinking that she went a little too far with the explanation
>You shrug, and tell her it's fine, and that you didn't mind. As long as you get the chili recipe.
>Her tail begins to wag again, and she beams at you
>"Oh thank God... I thought I creeped you out."
>"You know, you kind of smell like that rodent girl I saw hanging around. The one in the suit."
>You tell her that her name is Erika, and she had been leaning on you for awhile.
>"Oh, okay. So you two aren't... Together?"
>You tell her no, and that you two were just talking.
>She seems satisfied, and continues:
>"Ok. I'll be sure to send you the Chili recipe when I get home."
>You ask her if there would happen to be anymore Chili in the kitchen, and she gives you a sympathetic shake of her head.
>"Sorry Anon, but it looks like it's all gone. Next time I know I'm going to see you, I promise I'll make some special, just for you~."
>She plans on seeing you again?
>Well, she does have your number.
>You thank her, and she pulls you in for another hug.
>She sniffs you quickly one more time, and lets go of you.
>"Just to make sure I got it memorized. I plan on sticking around for a few more hours, so I'll be sure to say Hi if I see you."
>You nod at her, and she walks out of the kitchen.
>You liked realized that you kind of liked Rylee. There was just something about a farmgirl who says she'll cook for you that tickles your fancy.
>Shaking your head, you grab a mini bag of chips off the table, crack open your third beer, and sit on a stool in the corner.

>You pull out your phone to check the time. It's 9:48.
>Before you put your phone back in your pocket, you notice you got another text from Erika.
>You sigh, and open the text.
>You almost drop your beer when you see what she sent you
>Oh.
>FUCK.
>It's a picture of the Rat anthro with her pants down around her ankles, one hand spreading her glistening slit open, a finger tracing the opening.
>It comes with a text sent right afterwards.
>"come.and fimd me amon <33"
>This is past simple flirting now. She's literally asking for you to come fuck her.
>Your body reacts to the image as you stare in disbelief at it, and you start to harden.
>Looking at the text, you see it was only sent 6 minutes ago.
>When you look closer at the image (for research purposes), you see that she's in the bathroom.
>She's only about 10 feet away from where you're sitting...
>You're about to close the message and pretend you never got it, when you get another text. From Erika.
>"u gona just leave agirl on read"
>She sends two more:
>"i now u got thsi msg so com.eon and fuck me"
>"im wating 4 u<333"

>She knows you saw her message, and you have no clue how to respond.
>You decide to make an excuse.
>You tell her you would, but you're busy outside.
>"wat r u doin"
>Remembering what you were doing when you met Sandy, you tell her you're out in the cornfield.
>"im comin to getu"
>Oh shit.
>You get off the stool, leaving chips but grabbing your beer.
>You're going to need it.
>You take a large gulp of the beer, and set the empty bottle on a table.
>You move out of the kitchen, and look for a place to hide before the drunken Anthro leaves the bathroom.
>Unfortunately, you don't move quickly enough, and while you're looking around, you feel a familiar furred hand lay on your shoulder, and a flat chest bump against your back
>Erika rests her head on your other shoulder and whispers to you:
>"Awww... You came in here to find me..."
>"Come on, anon... I'm ready for you..."

>She stands back up straight and grabs your arm, leading you out the front door.
>"Hurry Anon... We're, uh, going to the cornfield..."
>You step out into the night, the rat girl leading you.
>She must have managed to sober up a tiny bit, because there's a fire in her eyes when she looks back at you.
>Unfortunately, it looks like you're the only thing that can quench them.
>Still holding your arm, she leads you into the cornfield, leaves and corn thumping against you as she takes you deep inside the field.
>When you get far enough that you can barely hear the party in the distance, she suddenly turns with a smile, and hugs you tight, squeezing you against her.
>"I've wanted this for sooo long... I've always wanted to be bred by a REAL human... Fingers just weren't cutting it anymore..."
>You couldn't believe it.
>You were about to fuck a rat.
>And confusingly enough, you were okay with this.
>She lays her head on your shoulder and starts to pant.
>"L... Lay down for me... Come on..."
>You comply, sitting down on the dirt.
>"Now... Let's uh... See what kind of package the mailman has for me..."
>You hope she got to work soon before her bad jokes killed your boner
>She reaches for your pants and tugs them down, along with your boxers
>Upon seeing your member, she practically drools at it
>"No spikes... No knots... No flares..."
>She leans down and licks it from base to tip, drawing a grunt out of you
>"It's perfect..."

>She thrusts her mouth down on your dick, wrapping her tongue around it
>She begins bobbing her head up and down, your cock scraping the top of her mouth.
>She starts to moan around your dick, and looking down at her, you can see her violently fingering herself with one of her hands.
>You place a hand on her head, and play with her ears while she feverishly sucks you off.
>She makes what you think is an appreciative noise, and she assaults your dick with all she has.
>Holy SHIT.
>As you start to get close, you warn her.
>She grips your leg to show she understands you, but makes no effort to slow down.
>You can only hold on one more minute before you release into her mouth
>She swallows every drop of your seed, downing it all in a single gulp
>She finishes herself off immediately afterwards, and you see her tail curl around her leg.
>She sighs deeply, a content grin on her face.
>"Anon... That was-"

>The two of you are interrupted by a loud ringing.
>The grin disappears from her face, and she pulls a phone out of an inner pocket from her wrinkled suit
>She answers it, and you can hear someone yelling into the phone on the other side.
>"Erika! Where the fuck are you!? We've been waiting at the car for like 10 minutes! We told you we were leaving at 10!"
>She drunkenly responds.
>"Shut up... Ugh, fine... I'll be right there..."
>If the person on the other end has anything else to say, you don't find out, as Erika hangs up on them.
>She looks at you with a sad look.
>"Well... Sorry I can't stick around... I hope you enjoyed yourself at least..."
>She smiles again, saying:
>"I know I did..."
>"That guy... What's his name... Jake? Or John? It might have started with a G..."
>"Your friend... He told me that we both live in the same city, so maybe you can breed with me properly some other time... I'll text you..."
>She yawns, and stands up.
>"Ugh... Which way is the house..." 
>Still laying in the dirt, you point a thumb behind you.
>She smiles once more at you, blows an exaggerated kiss at you. And with that, she leaves.

>After a couple minutes, you get up.
>Looking down at yourself, you can see you got some dirt on your uniform.
>Lucky for you, it would seem that your rodent partner had sucked up any juices on your skin, and hadn't let any get on your clothes.
>You pull your pants up and buckle them.
>The events of the past 10 minutes suddenly rush through your mind as you walk back towards the farmhouse.
>Holy shit, you just got blown by an Anthro.

>Stumbling out of the cornfield, you wander back into the backyard.
>George and Kate must have gone inside, as there's only a few Anthros sitting by the fire, and he isn't anywhere else in sight.
>You sit at a vacant seat near the fire, and stare into the flames
>So you just got blown by a rat in a cornfield. Time to cross that one off the bucket list.
>Looking around the fire, you look at the other Anthros sitting by you.
>To your surprise, one is staring at you.
>After a moment, you recognize it as Samantha.
>You wave at her, and she moves to sit closer to you, picking her chair up and plopping it down right next to you.
>"Hello, Anon. How are you?"
>You say you're fine.
>"I'd like to... Apologize. For what I said earlier. I was just frustrated. I don't know many people at this party, so I was upset when you ignored me when I tried talking to you."
>"I shouldn't have called George a fool. I mean, he does act like a fool, but he really isn't one."
>"Okay, he might be a bit of a fool, but anyways... Sorry."
>You tell her it's fine. You were a bit upset with George tonight anyways. There had been a severe lack of communication with you about this party, and you were going to make it a point to tell him this.
>Not tonight though, it seemed like he was having fun with his girlfriend, and you didn't want to ruin it for him.

>Samantha seems relieved, and then she looks at your uniform.
>"Anon, why is there dirt all over your pants?"
>Oh shit
>You stammer out that you were walking around the cornfield for a bit, and this answer seems to satisfy her.
>"The corn? What's so special about some corn?"
>You tell her you didn't go out into the country much, and it had interested you.
>"You're a strange human, Anon."
>"Well, that's really all I wanted to say. I just wanted to apologize to you before I left. I don't like leaving bad impressions on people."
>"I just get frustrated sometimes. I have a pretty stressful job, and once in awhile it just bubbles out of me."
>You nod, and tell her you feel the same way.
>She nods back, and then gets up.
>"Well, I'm leaving. If you see Kate, tell her I left."
>"And tell her not to call me "Sammy"."
>You chuckle, and tell her that you can do that.
>She doesn't respond, and walks around the house to the front. A couple minutes later you hear a car start, and she pulls away into the inky night.

>There's a cooler sitting near the fire, and you get up to go over to it.
>Inside, you pull out a bottle of water and start drinking, finding yourself suddenly really thirsty.
>Your feel a bit peckish too, and remember the bag of chips you left in the kitchen.
>You wipe the dirt off of your pants the best you can, and head inside.
>The party is still raging inside despite the time, and you duck into the kitchen.
>You smile at seeing the small bag of chips sitting there, and you pop them open.
>Damn, you really wish there was more Chili left.
>Heading back into the living room, you see George and Kate sitting together on a couch, but something seems wrong.
>He looks smashed.
>For a second the sight is amusing, but then you realize something:
>Shit, he was supposed to be your ride home.
>You knew how to drive, but you didn't have your license on you, and you didn't want to risk getting picked up at a drunk driving checkpoint without it.
>You didn't even know where you were in the country, or what direction you had come from.
>Worse still, Kate didn't even know how to drive, so she was no help.
>Walking up to them, you see George is only half-conscious.

>Kate has her head leaning on top of his, and she straightens up to talk to you.
>"Oh, Anon! You should have seen it around 20 minutes ago! George was in a drinking contest."
>Looking at his slumped over form, you ask if he won
>Kate chuckles before answering
>"Nope. He made a good effort, though."
>You ask her how you were going to get home with him being drunker than an Irishman on Saint Patrick's Day, and she perks up a bit.
>"Oh shi-, uh, Darn! I didn't think of that."
>She looks down at him and frowns, before looking back at you.
>"It's safe to say he's in no condition to drive."
>She gets up a bit, and George slumps over on the couch, leaning on the armrest.
>I'm going to go talk to the guy who owns the place, and see if he can let us stay the night, maybe.
>You wait there awkwardly, and Kate returns after a couple minutes, frowning.
>"Well... I have good news and bad news."
>That's not good.
>"Sooo... Apparently this happened with a few other people too."
>"About a dozen, to be more precise."
>"The owner says he doesn't want a ton of drunks sleeping off their hangovers in his house, so he's only letting a few people stay for the night."
>"The good news is that he's going to let George and I stay."
>"The bad news... Is that he said you were on your own."
>Fucking Anthros, man.
>She cringes a bit, upon seeing your reaction upon your face, and she quickly says:
>"I'm sorry Anon! Maybe you could catch a ride with someone to get home?"
>She looks like she suddenly realizes something, and continues:
>"Oh! Sammy! You could get Sammy to take you home! I saw her sitting out by the bonfire in the backyard."
>Frowning, you tell her that Samantha had left about 7 or 8 minutes ago.
>You also tell her that Samantha had asked her to stop calling her Sammy.
>"She did? I'm sorry, Anon. You could always sleep in the car I guess..."
>There was no way you were sleeping in that car.
>It smelled like sauerkraut and cigarettes.
>She shrugs and tells you:
>"Well, I don't know what else to tell you."
>You tell her you'll figure something out, and you walk off towards the sitting room.

>You reach the sitting room, and in there is Rylee, talking to a small group of people. 
>She sees you enter the room, and waves you over.
>You move near where she is, and sit in a chair facing her.
>Rylee gets the groups attention, and introduces you.
>"Girls, this is Anon! He's the human I was telling you about."
>"Anon, these are my friends!"
>She introduces them to you one by one.
>There's Mary, a Human woman dressed up as the girl from The Ring,
>Lauren, a Doe dressed up as a Native American,
>And Harriet, a Bat dressed up as who else, but Bat-Girl.
>She also mentions that her other friend was here, but must have left awhile earlier.
>When she says her name was Sandra, you tell Rylee that you had met her already.
>"Haha, did you like her costume?"
>You give a genuine smile, and tell her that you did.

>You settle into the chair, and are absorbed into the conversation with Rylee and her friends.
>It's overall a pretty comfy situation.
>You don't have many friends other than George who live nearby, so you don't get to hang out with people like this usually.
>They talk about a variety of subjects, from farming, to politics, and eventually you end up on the topic of the civil climate between Humans and Anthros.
>Humans didn't exist in this world until around 40 or so years ago, when small numbers of humans started just randomly disappearing from the "Human World", and appearing in the "Anthro World".
>Nobody knows why, but it's really picked up in recent years.
>You're pretty sure you remember reading out how an entire fucking mountain suddenly appeared one day.
>It turns out that many people who were assumed dead in the Human World were actually alive and well in the Anthro World
>It's known from people who had appeared recently in the Anthro World that many of the people currently living in the Anthro World were even the subject of conspiracies.
>Nobody was safe from being transported to the Anthro world, as a couple notable people living in the Anthro World were apparently huge celebrities back in the human world. Elvis and Michael Jackson.
>Apparently Elvis's disappearance had been covered up, and Michael Jackson had been outright replaced by a body double.
>Apparently, almost everyone who disappeared from the Human world were considered dead by the Human world, as they had no knowledge of the Anthro world.
>You were born in the Anthro World, being the son of two Humans who had appeared in the Anthro World one day.
>There was still a lot of distrust between Humans and Anthros, but it had cooled down in recent years.
>Unfortunately, there was still a few hate groups. Some targeting Anthros, and some targeting Humans.

>As you all speak, Rylees friends begin to leave, citing the late time as an excuse.
>When the clock hits 11, It's just you and Rylee talking.
>She looks at the clock, then back at you.
>"Well Anon, are you thinking of heading home soon? It must have been a long drive here, and you don't want to be here TOO late."
>You frown and tell her about your situation with George.
>"Wait, he was your designated driver, and he got in a drinking contest? Why?!"
>You tell her you couldn't ask him, as he was currently passed out in the living room.
>"Can't you just drive home? You drive a mail truck, so you obviously have your license."
>You tell her you didn't bring it with you, and you weren't going to risk getting picked up by cops with no license after you had been drinking most of the night.
>She gives you a sympathetic look
>"Well... What are you going to do, Anon?"
>You tell her that you aren't sure, but if worse comes to worse, you might just sleep in the cornfield.
>She tilts her head at you, and gives you a disapproving look.
>"Anon, you aren't sleeping in a cornfield."
>You tell her that at this point, you're pretty much out of options.
>She looks to the side for a minute, as if contemplating something.
>She looks back at you with a hopeful look, before speaking.
>"You, uh... Could home and sleep at my place."
>She blurts out immediately afterwards:
>"B-but only if you wanted to! I don't want to force you to do anything."
>You consider your options for a moment.
>It's either Georges dirty ass car, a cornfield on a chilly october night, or a nice warm bed.
>You go with the bed.
>You tell her you're willing to go with her, and she smiles
>You can't help but notice her tail start to wag

>Moving out of the sitting room, you go back to where Kate is sitting.
>You notice that the Doberman who greeted you at the door when you got here is ushering some of the more sober people out of the house
>Looks like he owns the place.
>In any case, it seems like the party is ending soon, so you better go tell her where you're going.
>Approaching Kate, you tell her you're going to sleep at a neighboring house
>"Oh, okay Anon. Call us in the morning, and we'll come pick you up."
>You nod, and head back to the sitting room.
>You walk over to where Rylee is sitting, watching you expectantly.
>You tell her you're ready to leave at any time.
>She stands up and says:
>"Well, it's after 11. I can hear people starting to leave, so it seems like we should go too."
>You agree with her, not wanting to annoy the large Doberman. You've seen what they can do in boxing matches.
>She takes your arm, and leads you out the backdoor.

>The bonfire is burned out, and wouldn't be able to see anything out here at all, if it weren't for light streaming from the windows of the house.
>The two of you walk around the house, and you look at the cornfield as you walk by it.
>You think about what you were doing in there just over an hour ago
>You smile, and Rylee notices.
>"You, uh, like corn, Anon?"
>You tell her you thought of something funny, and she shrugs
>"Well, come on. Let's go to my car."
>When you look at her car, you wonder if it'll even run
>It's a beat-up old sedan, and it has more rust than the titanic.
>She notices your look, and she says:
>"Aw, don't be like that, Anon. Believe me, it's a lot better than it looks. I only use it to go to town, or go to places like this."
>You nod, and get into the passenger seat of the car.
>She climbs into the driver seat and smiles at you, before putting the key in and turning it.
>To your surprise, it starts instantly.
>"See? I told you. The rust is just on the body. A couple months ago, I let one of my cousins tinker with the car, and he fixed pretty much every problem it had."
>She pulls out into the road, and the two of you pull out into the night, heading deeper into the countryside.

>About 10 minutes later, she turns onto a small dirt road surrounded on both sides by corn
>"We're here, Anon."
>You pull into a clearing, and a cozy looking house stands in front of you, along with a small barn on the side.
>"I own 50 acres. It can be tough working it all alone, but I couldn't bear to sell this place."
>You tell her you don't know much, if anything, about farming, but you think it looks nice.
>"Thanks, Anon. It's good to hear that."
>You pull up in front of the house, and you both get out.
>"Come on Anon, you must be freezing!"
>You tell her it's not that bad, and she frowns.
>"There's no way you could be warm out here. You're not wearing a jacket, and you don't even have any fur."
>You never got why Anthros always thought humans were constantly cold without fur.
>It is a pretty chilly night though, so you hurry inside after she unlocks the door.
>It's warmer in here, but a tiny bit colder than you prefer.
>She notices this when you cross your arms across your chest.
>"Oh, sorry Anon! I like to keep it cool in here... It gets hot sometimes having all this fur."
>You tell her it should be fine, and she seems to relax a bit.
>You take off your shoes, setting them down neatly by the door, and sit down in the small living room, on an old couch in front of the TV.
>Rylee sits down right next to you, her tail bumping you as it wags slowly.
>"So, you have two options for sleeping. You can take the couch..." 
>She leans a bit closer to you, and she says the next part of the sentence in a more hushed tone.
>"Or you could share a bed with me. I promise I wouldn't make it weird. We would just... Sleep."
>You hesitate before answering, and her tail stops wagging.
>"Y-you could sleep on the couch if you really wanted to..."

>You tell her you don't mind sharing a bed. It is pretty cold in here after all.
>Suddenly, her tail starts wagging again, bumping your leg every second.
>She notices, and grabs it in a panic.
>"Sorry! It's just- I Don't- It has a mind of it's own!"
>You tell her it's alright and that you don't mind.
>She smiles, and stands up.
>"Follow me, Anon. My room is this way. I'd let you sleep in my parents old room, but it's full of boxes and other junk."
>She leads you through a small hallway, and opens a door at the end of it.
>Her room looks nice, if a bit small.
>To the right of the door, there's a small desk and a chair, with a laptop sitting on the desk plugged in.
>What really catches your eye though is the bed sitting in the far right corner.
>It's pretty small. It looks to be somewhere in between a Twin and Queen sized bed.
>Your thoughts are interrupted as Rylee reaches to your head and plucks your hat off, setting it on top of her computer.
>You give her a curious look and she replies quickly:
>"Uh... Just trying to make you more comfortable."
>You nod, and take the mailbag off of your shoulder, setting it on the doorknob of her closet.
>You mention the size of the bed to her, and she stands there looking at you, but not making eye contact.
>"We just have to... Uh... Sleep close, I guess."
>If Anthros could blush through under their fur, you bet she would be redder than an overripe tomato right now.
>You aren't faring much better. Alcohol had kept your nerves down while you were at the party, but now you were running dry and it was starting to get to you.
>You ask her where the bathroom is, and she points in the hallway
>"First door on your left... I'm going to get ready for bed, so take as much time as you need."
>You nod, and enter the hallway. You open the first door on your left, and step inside.

>Her bathroom looks pretty normal. Theres a lot of Anthro specific products laying around though.
>Bottles of fur soap, a type of hair dryer specially designed to work on thick fur, and claw trimmers.
>You pull out your phone to check the time, and you see it's almost midnight.
>You also notice you got another text from Erika.
>You open the text and see it's another picture of her nethers, along with a message.
>You give a small smile at the picture, but before you can read the message your phone turns off all of a sudden.
>For a terrifying second, you think your phone is broken, but then you realize that it must have just run out of battery.
>Did rat pussy just kill your phone?
>You put the dead phone back in your pocket, and unzip your pants.
>You've had to piss for the last 30 minutes, and it feels good when you finally relieve yourself.
>You flush and wash your hands, before heading back into the bedroom.
>Rylee is sitting under the covers, and she smiles when she sees you.
>Her costume is lying crumpled on the floor near the foot of the bed.
>You guess she must have already put on her pajamas.
>You walk over to the bed, but Rylee gives you a strange look when you start trying to get into it.
>"Anon, you can't just sleep in your work clothes. That can't be comfortable."
>"Plus they're dirty, and I don't want to get any of it on my sheets. I just washed them yesterday."
>You tell her you didn't have anything else to wear, and that it was cold.
>She gives you a small smile before continuing.
>"Don't worry about the cold... I've been keeping the bed warm for you."
>"And don't worry about the clothes either. I can wash them for you in the morning."
>Damn. You didn't have a way to counter that argument, so you concede.
>You tell her to look away while you strip, and she cocks her head at you.
>"What do you mean, Anon? You're going to be sleeping next to me, so why does it matter if I see you in your underwear?"
>You weren't embarrassed of your body. Maybe you hadn't hit the gym in awhile, but at worst you were just skinnyfat.
>You sigh, and begin to take off your clothes. You unbutton your shirt and hang it over the chair.
>As you take off your dirt speckled pants, you can't help but notice Rylee staring at you.
>"Um... Socks too, Anon."
>You sit on the edge of the bed and take off your socks, tossing them in the direction of your shirt and pants.
>Rylee leans over and pulls back the cover for you, and you slip in.

>Rylee wasn't lying when she said she was keeping it warm.
>You lay on the very edge of the bed, afraid of somehow offending her if you scooch closer.
>Rylee is laying on her side, facing you.
>She seems confused at the way you're laying down, and she speaks up:
>"Anon, you're going to fall on your face if you try to sleep like that. Come a bit closer..."
>She tugs at your upper arm a bit, and you slide closer to her.
>You start to become a bit nervous, and you lay stiff as a board on your back, about half a foot away from Rylee, who is still lying on her side.
>"You alright, Anon? You seem a bit stressed."
>You mumble an excuse about being cold, and she pops up a bit.
>"Sorry, Anon! I can turn up the heat if you want!"
>Wow, that might have been the wrong thing to say. She seems really concerned about you being cold.
>You roll over to look at her to say that it's fine, and you'll manage.
>She looks at you for a moment, before her arms grab your shoulders and she pulls you close.
>She whispers in your ear:
>"I don't want you to be cold, Anon..."
>Oh shit. She isn't wearing pajamas at all. Against your chest you can feel just a simple cotton bra and panties pressing against your skin.
>You can feel her fur pressing against your exposed body, and you can't help but relax a bit in her grasp.
>She's really warm, and her fur is even softer than the blankets surrounding the two of you.
>"Just relax, Anon..."
>She wraps her arms around you; one hand sliding in between your shoulder and neck, and the other reaching over you and settling on your back.
>Your face is pressing into her fur, and you can smell her scent.
>She smells like ivory soap with a hint of dried straw.
>You also get a nice whiff of her natural musk.
>You have achieved maximum comfy, and you think that this is how Buddhist monks must feel.

>Slowly, Rylee begins tracing your back with her hand, before rubbing it gently.
>Her other hand cradles the back of your head, easing it gently into the crook of your neck.
>"You can put your arm over me, Anon... I want you to be comfortable..."
>When you don't, she instead stops rubbing you and gently grasps your hand, before placing it around her back.
>You move your hand a bit, the edge of her bra itching your hand.
>She notices this, and pulls back a bit.
>"Hold on, Anon... Let me just take this off..."
>From under the covers, she takes her bra off and flings it over your head onto the floor.
>You can't see her chest, but you can certainly feel it when she pulls you close to her again.
>Her C cup tits compress against your chest as she wraps her arms around your back once more, moving back into the same position you were in before.
>As your face is pressed back into her neck, you can feel her muzzle nuzzle around in your hair.
>She gently sniffs you, and you hear and feel a satisfied noise come from her chest.
>Suddenly, she lefts one of her legs and hooks it around you.
>You're pulled so close that every part of you is touching her fur.
>EVERY part of you.
>You try to pull away a bit before she notices your stiffening manhood, but she has you trapped in her firm grasp.
>She had to notice your boner poking her, but she doesn't show it, instead making small content noises, gently sniffing you, and rubbing her hand up and down your back.

>Suddenly, she speaks in a low voice:
>"Anon... Can you do something for me?"
>You don't know if it's the intense comfort you're feeling or something more, But in that moment, you feel like you would do anything for her.
>You let her know this, her fur muffling your voice.
>She pulls your head out of her neck, and her muzzle rests an inch from your face.
>"K-kiss me, Anon..."
>You do.
>It's a bit awkward at first, but the two of you make it work.
>Her tongue digs roughly into your mouth.
>She lets out a needy whine, and pushes you onto your back.
>She's on top of you now; her claws digging into your back as she rubs her body against yours.
>At this point you're rock hard, and you feel yourself start to throb in your thin boxers.
>When she breaks away, the both of you are panting, and looking each other in the eyes.
>She speaks:
>"Anon... I need you. I need you now, and I need you bad..."
>She throws the cover off of the two of you, and you can see her tits.
>She stares at your member with wide eyes, before practically ripping off her panties, throwing them across the room.
>She flips over onto her back next to you, and pulls at your arms, trying to get you on top of her.
>You don't her to ask twice, and you shuck off your boxers, before plunging into her waiting arms.
>You kiss her again, this time being a bit more dominant, pushing your tongue as deep into her mouth as you can get it.
>She lets out a small moan, and her arms claw at your back.
>You can feel her steaming hot, wet slit pressing against your crotch.
>You take a moment to align yourself with her, then gently press into her while looking at her through half-lidded eyes.

>She lets out a yip when you press into her, before it quickly degenerates into a moan.
>When you bottom out against her, your hips bumping, she locks her legs around your waist, holding you deep inside her.
>She rubs her arms over your back and wiggles her body against you, and you remember what she said earlier about Canines rubbing their scents on their mates.
>You smile and begin to thrust into her.
>One of her hands shoot up to the back of your head, and she practically slams your face in the floof of her neck.
>Her muzzle digs into your neck, and she starts sniffing you like crazy.
>She moans for you to go faster, and you oblige.
>You quickly ease into a fast rhythm, your hips slamming into her with every loving thrust.
>Suddenly, she throws back her head and howls, her arms and legs tightening around you.
>Her pussy constricts down around your dick so hard it feels like it's being strangled, and you love every second of it.
>She's practically convulsing from pleasure, but you show her no mercy.
>You slam into her like your life depends on it, and she starts to yell your name, begging you to go even harder.
>It takes every ounce of your strength, but you can't disappoint her. You wildly pump into her with so much force you're pretty sure you're going to bruise yourself.
>After what seems like an eternity of fucking the moaning she-dog, you begin to feel yourself getting ready to blow your load.
>You warn her, and try to pull out, but she tightens her legs around you, and moans in your ear:
>"Nnnnooo... I want it all inside... Give it to me, Anon... I want it all..."
>You pump into her as hard as you can, and you suddenly release yourself deep inside her.
>It sends her over the edge once more, and she screams your name at the top of your lungs while you bury your face into her furred tits.
>Your climax hits you so hard you nearly black out, and you collapse on top of her, your dong still buried deep inside her boiling snatch.
>You can feel her hot tongue licking at your face, and when you open your mouth to protest, she slips it inside.
>You kiss for a minute before pulling away, gasping for breath; exhausted from your passionate sex with her.

>She rolls onto her side, still holding on tight to you.
>You lay there side by side, holding each other like true lovers.
>You try to pull out of her again, and she responds:
>"No, Anon... Leave it in... I want to fall asleep like this..."
>You don't protest, and instead press your face into her sweaty coat of fur.
>"I-i love you, Anon..."
>You tell her you love her too through the thick fur of her neck.
>She nuzzles against you, and settles in for sleep.
>Sleep hits you like a brick the second you close your eyes, and the last thing you hear is her content pants before you pass out.

>When you wake up, the first thing you notice is the lack of a certain Border Collie next to you.
>For a second you panic, but then you smell the familiar scent of something cooking.
>She must be making you breakfast.
>You climb out of bed, and your legs feel like jelly.
>You wobble a bit before steadying yourself. You must hard fucked harder than you thought.
>Looking around, you don't see any of your clothes where you left them last night.
>Even worse, they're nowhere to be found.
>You sit back on the bed, when suddenly the door opens, and a familiar face pokes through the door.
>It's Rylee, holding your neatly folded clothes.
>"Good morning, Anon. I washed your clothes for you while you were sleeping..."
>She sniffs the clean clothes, before putting them next to you on the bed.
>"I liked how they smelled like you, but I thought you would appreciate not having to put on wrinkled clothes when you woke up."
>You smile at her and thank her.
>She smiles back and leans in for a kiss.
>She gives you a pick peck on the lips then pulls back, a light giggle coming from her.
>"Come on out after you get dressed, Anon... Breakfast is almost ready."
>You nod, and she leaves the room, shutting the door gently.
>You quickly pull on your clothes, and button your shirt.
>Before you walk out, you notice your phone is sitting on her table, and you pocket it.
>She must have taken it out before she washed your pants.
>You step out into the hallway, leaving the door open behind you.
>As you walk into the small kitchen, she's dishing out your food onto a plate, along with a tall glass of juice.

>She notices as you sit down, and sets down the plate in front of you.
>"I-i hope you like grapefruit juice, I didn't have orange so I-"
>You cut her off, and tell her everything wonderful, and that grapefruit is your favorite.
>She grins ear to ear at you, pulls you into a quick hug.
>She fixes her own plate, and you both sit across from each other.
>Looking down, you can see she made you a big plate of corned beef hash, potatoes, and some slices of toast.
>You've never seen a more appetizing breakfast.
>The two of you dig in, and before you know it, it's all gone.
>The two of you talk a bit, and then you notice the clock
>Oh shit, it's past noon
>George definitely left you behind.
>Somehow though, it doesn't seem so bad.
>There's got to be worse situations than the one you're in right now.
>You offer to help her wash dishes, but she refuses, saying you've done more than enough for her.
>You ask if you can use her phone, and she points into the house phone sitting in the living room.

>You quickly punch in George's number, and he answers after a few rings.
>"Hello? Who's this?"
>You greet George, and he says:
>"Anon! Dude, why the hell wouldn't you answer your phone this morning? We had to leave without you before that bigass Doberman kicked us out!
>You tell him a heavily edited version of your situation, telling him your phone died and you slept in at a neighboring house.
>You also tell him this would never have happened if he hadn't gotten wasted like a moron.
>"I couldn't help it Anon, the guy challenged me to a drinking contest and I couldn't look like some pussy faggot!"
>You chuckle, and George responds:
>"Woah, you're actually in a good mood for once. You get hit in the head or something, Anon?"
>You respond that you just had the best damn breakfast of your life, and that your host was being very pleasant.
>"Well, that's good to hear and all, but how are you gonna get home? I'm sorry, but I can't drive all the way back out there. I'm still really hungover, and there's no way I'm going out to drive again today.
>You tell him you'll figure something out, and he responds:
>"Well... I guess I'll see you around then, Anon."
>You tell him goodbye, then hang up.

>You turn around, and Rylee is standing in the doorway.
>And oh shit, she looks sad
>"Are... Are you leaving now, Anon?"
>You rush over to her and pull her into a hug, smelling her fur.
>Her arms wrap around you, and she rests her head on your shoulder.
>You tell her you can stay as long as she wants.
>She pulls away from you suddenly, and with an uncertain look in her eyes she asks you:
>"Anon, will you be my boyfriend?"
>With no hesitation, you tell her that of course you will be.
>She pulls you back into another hug, and you return it.

	EPILOGUE - 8 Months later
>Life was great.
>You had moved in with Rylee a month ago, and you had settled in nicely.
>It was the middle of March, and you were waiting for Rylee to get home from the market in town.
>Living in the country was a change you didn't even know you wanted.
>You had never really liked the city anyways. It was always loud, and the people unfriendly.
>Out here in the country, it was always nice and quiet, and all your neighbors treated you like family.
>As she was a friend of Rylee, you kept in touch with Sandy, but only as friends. She had backed off on you when Rylee told her and her other friends that the two of you were dating now.
>Erika had pretty much dropped out of your life after the party, but you didn't mind. You had someone much better in your life now.
>George was surprised when you told him you were dating an Anthro, and even more surprised when you moved in with her, but he didn't mind. He was happy that you had finally found someone.
>Him and Kate were still going steady, and looked like they would continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
>Not you, though. You had bigger plans for Rylee.

>When Rylee walks through the doors, you rush to help her with the bags, and she smiles thankfully at you.
>"Thanks, Anon. Wait 'til you hear what it was like at the store today. I swear."
>You and Rylee had been madly in love since that cold October night 8 months ago, and tonight you intended to cement your connection forever.
>Feeling the small box in your pocket, you listen to her talk as you help put away cans and various other goods.
>Pretty soon, Rylee sits down on the couch. You tell her you have a surprise for her.
>"Oh? And what would that be, Mr. Mailman?"
>You smile. When you moved out into the country, you had managed to keep your job as a postman, now delivering mail to all the homes throughout the countryside where you lived.
>You pull a couple nice sized steaks out of the fridge, and she looks at you shocked
>"Woah, Anon! How could you afford something like that?!"
>You tell her you had been saving up, and you were intending to show her a nice night.
>She smiles at you and says:
>"Anon, Every day with you by my side is a nice one."
>Your heart couldn't take it, and you pulled her into a hug which she happily returned.

>A couple hours later, you're sitting outside cooking a couple steaks and baked potatoes over a charcoal grill.
>Rylee had taught you how to cook, and you were confident you could cook her a nice meal.
>Pretty soon, the meal is ready and you bring it inside.
>Rylee had cooked the vegetables, and you both set your plates.
>As you both dig in, she tells you the steaks are cooked to perfection.
>You tell her the only perfect thing here is her, and she smiles.
>Pretty soon, you both finish, and you offer to do the dishes for her.
>She smiles, and you set the plates next to the sink.
>You tell her before you wash the dishes, you have a quick question.
>She cocks her head and smiles, asking:
>"What is it Anon? You need me to do something?"
>You get down on one knee, pulling the box out of your pocket.
>Her eyes go wide as you open the box revealing a small ring.
>You ask her to be your wife.
>She looks speechless.
>Just as you start to worry she might say no, she tears up and gives you the biggest smile you've ever seen.
>She says yes.
>You put the ring on her finger, and she traps you in a loving embrace, kissing you everywhere she can get her lips on.
>Yep. Life was looking good.
