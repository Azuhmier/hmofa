>You jolt awake
>You've woken up where they left you, locked in a metal cell, on a metal ship, some millions upon millions of miles from home
>Fucking aliens
>They had snatched you right off the highway when your car blew a tire
>Not greys, or even reptilians, but porcine things, just about human size, but stouter, and meaner looking
>It's been a couple weeks, at random intervals you pass out only to awaken on surgery tables being poked and prodded
>It hurts every time
>This time all the pain is in your legs, it feels like you can't stand
>You shiver, the plain jumpsuit they clad you in providing poor insulation
>You hear voices outside your door, the guttural tone of your captors
>But it sounded different, the words were rushed, angered
>Heavy footsteps sounded outside your door
>You push off the floor and stumble toward it, if only to hear things better
>A loud clatter startles you, and you swing around to see a metal ceiling panel has fallen right where you were
>You stare, first at the paneling, and then at the figure that drops in from the room
>It's small, maybe a bit more than half your size
>It's green, a head covered in bright green scales, the rest covered in a black and grey uniform of some sort
>And it's a girl, with decidedly feminine hips, and a petite bust
>You stare at each other a moment, equally shocked to see the other, before she raises a finger to her lips to silence anything you might say
>You nod slowly as she runs across the small room, and presses herself up against the wall beside the door
>The moment she does, it slides open, and a pig tromps in, right past her to bark at you
>You don't have a chance to respond before he has spotted the damaged panel, and swung his fist into your face
>Your wobbly legs give out, and you're on the ground
>The pig produces a baton, the end crackling with electricity, and jabs it into your side, sending you into painful convulsions
>The lizard stares at you, and you stare
>You can see her look to the open door behind her, and then back to you
>You manage one word
Please
>With that, she springs, throwing herself from the ground to latch onto the pig's head, raking it with claws
>The pig stumbles back, dropping its weapon in surprise
>The pair struggle several moments while you struggle to you feet
>You finally stand up in time to see the pig gain the upper hand, grabbing the lizard, and throwing her against the far wall
>It approaches, malice radiating as it leers down at the lizard
>The pig brings his boot down on the lizard's chest
>This time she catches your gaze, in need
>Damn it
>You scrabble, first for the pig's baton, but whatever you do, you can't get it to spark to life
>Then you grab the metal plating, just heavy enough to do some damage
>You approach from the pig from behind
>Don't notice, don't notice, please god don't notice
>You raise your shaky arms
WHAM
>The pig falls back, and you barely dodge out of the way
>It collapses in a heap on the floor
>You reach a hand to help the lizard up, which she takes
>Back on her feet, she doesn't hesitate, stepping around you to rifle through the pig's jumpsuit, scoring a set of keycards
>You watch as she takes the baton from the floor, collapsing it and dropping it in a pouch on her belt
>The lizard moves to the open doorway, motioning for you to follow
>Seeing no better options, you do so, peering out
>At one end of the hallway is another pig
>You immediately duck your head back in your cell
There's another down there.
>The lizard cocks her head, clearly not understanding you
>Sighing, you point to the pig on the ground, and then out the door
>She nods, crouching low to the ground and slinking out of the room
>You hear a slight struggle, before the harsh crackle of electricity, and another body hitting the floor
>Looking out, the pig is down, with the lizard tapping her foot expectantly
>You move to follow, legs still weak
>The pair of you move as quietly as you can through the hallways of the ship
>The lizard seems almost as lost as you are
>Still, she leads you to a small side room, filled with clutter
>Once there, she climbs to the back, revealing another hole in the paneling, leading into the internals of the ship
>She motions for you to climb in first, and you oblige
>It's cramped, just enough room for you to crouch down, and quickly narrowing to a dead end
>The lizard follows, and finally speaks
>Her voice is soft, and quietly hisses where you'd expect it to
>It's pleasant, but you can't understand a word of it
>She seems to want you to stay here, consistently pointing at you, and then down at the ground
>You sit down, curling your knees into your chest
>The lizard follows suit, sitting in the tiny crawlspace
>She quickly begins emptying out her many pockets and pouches, first producing a small stick that lights up at the press of a button, then a variety of tools and what looks like weapons
>You stare into the plating in front of you, unsure of your future now
>Time crawls along as you ponder your next move
>You probably wanted to stick with her, she seemed to know what she was doing
>After a few moments, she speaks up again
>"Karissa."
>You look up at her.
"Huh?"
>"Karissa." 
>She jabs a thumb at herself, repeating the word, and then points at you, clearly expecting a response
"Anon."
>"Ah. Anon." She points at you.
>"Karissa."
