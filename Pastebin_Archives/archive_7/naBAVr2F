Hair of the Dog: Monsters and Mistletoe [Wolf; Christmas Special, Comfy]: Volfa's favorite holiday has always been Halloween, but her father seems to have an interest in bringing Christmas to the monster world. It's up to Anon to be Volfa's support while she begrudgingly gives another holiday a fair chance.

>December has arrived
>The cold and snow are quick to follow
>Heralded in by preparations for the holidays
>At least in the human world
>No matter where you go, it’s difficult to ignore how festive people are getting even weeks in advance
>You can’t walk down the street without seeing some kind of decoration or merry face
>Usually you don’t have to go far to see the latter, since your mate almost always has a wide grin on her muzzle
>Where everyone else sees a dark-haired human girl walking beside you, you see the large wolfess for who she really is
>Volfa
>It’s no surprise she prefers her monster world to your human one, but she’ll go anywhere to be with you
>To be with her love
>Her Little Red
>Recently, you can’t help but notice an uncharacteristic frown on her face as you walk hand-in-paw through the city
>”You humans really have no respect for Halloween,” she grumbles. “Couldn’t even bask in the afterglow of the greatest holiday on the planet for a SINGLE day before all the trees and shit went up.”
>It’s hard to argue with that
>Both worlds seem to have very different views on Halloween
>Even now her monster home of Gulchgut still has orange lights and jack-o-lanterns decorated everywhere
>That’s par for the course, though
>It’s essentially a year-round celebration for them
>Meanwhile, you and Volfa woke up on the first of November in the human world to the sound of caroling on the radio
>That radio is beyond repair now
>The two of you had to flee to the monster world for the sake of Volfa’s sanity
>Today, you’re sitting around dim candlelight in her favorite watering hole
>Throwing back glasses of pumpkin liquor
>Her mood returns as a goofy look spreads across her face
>”Aaahhh, much better,” Volfa says, draping an arm around your shoulder
>You get a taste of every drink she has with ever kiss she gives
>Halloween definitely doesn’t end in the monster world, but the hearty crowd in the bar still seems bummed out that the big night is over
>The monsters welcomed you like an old friend, as they do whenever you show up with the wolfess by your side
>She wants to be in every aspect of your life, but you know it’s hard for her to be taken out of her element for very long
>And with how accustomed to the monster world you’ve become, you can’t really blame her for preferring it
>Still, you wanted to celebrate Christmas proper with her, if only just once
>”We don’t really do that here,” she says when you first mention it
>Of course
>Monsters probably don’t mesh well with a lot of religious stuff
>”Nah, it’s not even that. Nobody wants to give up spooks for some snow. Well, except for old man Krampy. He loves all of it.”
>So the holiday is just ignored altogether?
>”Well, no. We still put up with it a little bit, but it’s mostly because...well....”
>The wolfess gives you a weak smile
>”It’s mostly because of my old man. He’s the biggest one into Christmas here, and he tries to get everyone to play along every year.”
>The massive, law-upholding, no-bullshit, three-headed wolf of a creature...
>Really that much into Christmas?
>Volfa rolls her glass around the table quietly for a while
>”It was my mother’s favorite time of the year. Her and my old man had some pretty memorable years together from what I’ve heard. No doubt he keeps the tradition going in her honor. He might actually like it more than Halloween himself, since it’s not as much work getting all the monsters to behave out there.”
>A monster liking Christmas more than Halloween?
>Blasphemous
>She downs a few more drinks before hoisting you to your feet
>”But I never stick around for all the sappiness. Usually just drop a gift or two off and then it’s back to planning for next year’s Halloween.”
>It makes more sense now
>Volfa has spent winter with you in the past, even though she’s had little interest in celebrating non-Halloween holidays
>So this whole time she was just running away from the monster world?
>Running away from her dad?
>Volfa’s always had a distant sort of relationship with her father
>In a way, you’ve been helping her bond a little more with the cerberus just by being a part of her life
>It’s hard not to feel a little bit of sympathy for the big dog
>Volfa doesn’t have much of a retort at first when you bring it up
>None of that snark or sass you often get from her, especially when it comes to family
>”I suppose I owe it to him to stick around at least once, huh? I mean he DID bend a few rules to keep us together....”
>You take the wolfess’ paw in your hand
>She breaks into a confident smirk
>”Alright, fine. I’ll tough it out and celebrate your little Christmas holiday this year.”
>Volfa lifts up your hand as though getting ready to arm wrestle
>”I still think it can’t hold a candle to Halloween, not by a longshot! But I’ll give it a fair chance—all my energy—and at the end of it you’ll see how much better MY favorite time of the year really is!”
>You weren’t exactly challenging the wolfess or anything
>Especially since you’d agree with her
>Ever since you met Volfa and her love of Halloween she’s made it your favorite holiday as well
>But whatever it takes to get her in the mood
>She’ll be making her father happy more than anyone else

>Christmas is rapidly approaching
>Volfa hasn’t done much to decorate her den here in Gulchgut
>Either she’s going to blow the whole thing off, or she’s a last-minute kind of planner
>You hold out hope for the wolfess, though
>If she was able to throw together a second whole Halloween for you when you first came to the monster world, you don’t doubt she has the motivation in her when she wants to show it
>Then again, Christmas is no Halloween...
>You’re pleasantly surprised when she returns from an errand carrying a (pretty sloppily) wrapped gift box
>Tiny bells jingle from her jeweled choker, her collar poofs out with extra fluff, and a pair of little antlers juts out from her head
>Where they’re connected, you honestly have no clue
>”Got you a little something for you a little early, Little Red!” Volfa says with a smile and a candy cane sticking out of her muzzle
>Her tail wags as she waits for you to open the gift box
>Maybe she’s going to start making that earnest effort to enjoy the holiday after all
>What’s inside the box doesn’t surprise you in the slightest
>A new crimson robe
>This one has all the soft white trimming you’d expect from a Santa outfit
>”I better see you wearing that. I’m not doing this all alone!”
>You’re not given much of a choice
>Volfa forcibly dresses you one arm at a time
>She brushes you down and then pulls you in for a tight hug
>Probably should have done that the other way around to avoid all the stray hairs...
>”Just let me know if it isn’t warm enough,” she whispers in your ear. “I have more than enough fur to keep us both nice and toasty.”
>No warmth is ever too much from Volfa
>Even if you were sitting inside a volcano wrapped up in her arms it’d still be the right amount of comfort
>And considering the type of environments that exist in the monster world, you’ve come extremely close to doing just that
>The two of you leave to visit her dad’s Licensing and Customs office after a quick breakfast
>Her muzzle is practically attached to your face the whole trip
>Giving you kisses and rubbing her snout on your cheek
>You notice a small sprig of mistletoe tied to one of her antlers
>Thanks to her height, you’re always going to be underneath it
>”So you finally noticed it, huh?” she says coyly between kisses
>It’s cute, but you’re still wondering about the antlers
>Volfa gives them a flick
>”Medafet’s doing. Temporary transformation effect. At least it BETTER be fuckin’ temporary.”
>Wonder how her father would react if it were permanent?
>”I dunno. He stopped me from pretty much everything else I tried doing to my body when I was a pup—from dyes to arcane tattoos—but he’d probably think this was adorable or something.” 
>Volfa gives her antlers a few gingerly tugs
>”I don’t want to look like some bastard child of a werewolf and a dryad.”
>She brushes off her worries, and then it’s back to slathering you with love
>The affection certainly puts some smiles on monsters’ faces as you’re paraded toward the station
>It’s a good thing you know the way by heart, because Volfa is spending far more time hanging onto you than being a leader
>It makes the journey much slower as well
>She never shies away from proving her infatuation to you, but she seems especially aggressive about it now
>She might have gotten Christmas mixed up with Valentine’s Day...
>When you finally get to the station you see the Christmas atmosphere already underway
>Though rather than ornaments replacing the typical Halloween décor, the two seasons fight for the same real estate
>Bats are perched on the insides of wreaths
>Trees are covered in cobwebs rather than tinsel
>Giant pumpkins are hallowed out to put snow globes inside of
>It kind of gives the place its own holiday character
>There are a lot more people near the Licensing and Customs office than you’ve ever seen before
>Most of them are holding an immaculately wrapped gift box of their own
>Some of the monsters pull or gnaw at the ribbons, but the presents don’t open
>Volfa doesn’t say a word as you go to stand at the back of a line
>A line leading up to the cerberus’ office
>Every few minutes the line creeps forward, and a monster leaves the office with one of the presents
>You have no idea what to expect, but it makes you nervous all the same
>Finally it’s time for Volfa to enter
>”This won’t take long,” she laughs
>Indeed it doesn’t
>After about two minutes of waiting, Volfa comes out
>Instead of a present, however, she’s holding a lump of coal
>She has a smile greater than someone holding coal should ever have
>”Same as every year,” she says with a shake of the head. “Alright, you’re up next!”
>Oh joy
>Back in his office once again
>Everything here feels even more colossal than usual
>The towering tree by the desk, the bowling ball sized holly, the forest of poinsettia...
>And then there’s the giant wolf himself
>It should be intimidating, but you have to stifle a chuckle
>The cerberus’ two side heads each have a Santa hat on, one red and one green
>The middle head has a rope of garland around his neck like a scarf
>They’re all busy flipping through stacks of papers
>At least until they see you
>The side heads look to massive scrolls of parchment flanking the desk
>[Nice List] one says, followed by what looks like hundreds of monster names
>The other is [Naughty List], with only a handful of names
>One in particular stands out immediately
>Volfa
>”Anon,” the middle head addresses you professionally
>He straightens his garland-scarf and interlocks his fingers on the desk
>”Though this is the first time you’ve formally joined us for Christmas, I’m sure you can surmise our process given the context.”
>His heads regard both lists again, all of them giving the “Naughty List” disappointed sighs
>”I present each of the citizens of our world a single gift, both out of charity as well as to encourage others to continue the gesture of their own volition. This gift is, of course, only if I deem them worthy based on their conduct over the past year. Now then....”
>The cerberus grabs a stack of papers and affixes a pince-nez to his muzzle
>”I trust you understand that although you are effectively a son-in-law to me, I cannot allow bias to influence a positive evaluation of you. On the contrary, I should remind you that your circumstances for living in our world are extraordinary, and you continue to be held to higher standards that many others do not have to be concerned with.”
>The side heads look unblinking at you while the middle one gives his lecture
>”In addition, I believe your relationship with Volfa can actually negatively affect your standing here. By failing to keep her from performing troublesome antics, you are effectively reinforcing undesirable behavior. You take a great risk by escorting her to your human world, and there have been several instances of your visits that demanded intervention from me or my associates.”
>He picks up one of his dagger-like pens and scratches away at one of the papers
>”You and Volfa share powerful bonds, whether for better or worse. You are in many ways opposites, but also equals. You act as individuals, but you make choices in synchronization. Volfa has already received her judgment for a year’s worth of misdeeds and regrettable tomfoolery.”
>The cerberus opens a drawer in his desk
>It rumbles loudly with its sturdy wood
>”With that said....”
>The cerberus looms over you
>All three pairs of eyes stare you down
>He reaches toward you with an outstretched paw
>Dangling from the tips of his claws is a small present, which he drops into your waiting arms
>”You’ve done a satisfactory job adhering to our way of life. Please keep up the good work.”
>He returns to his seat and continues to write on the papers
>As he does so, your name shows up on the “Nice List”
>Hurray?
>You leave the office to rejoin Volfa, who looks impressed by your present
>”Huh. Half expected the old man to punish you or something. You did good!”
>You try to open the gift up, but the ribbon doesn’t come undone no matter how hard you try
>”Don’t bother,” Volfa chuckles. “It’s magically sealed. You’re not getting in there until Christmas Day!”
>You look to the wolfess’ sad lump of coal in her paw
>You were hoping to give the cerberus the benefit of the doubt, but giving his only daughter the ultimate Christmas symbol of shame seems a little cruel
>”Ah, don’t worry,” Volfa says, pocketing the coal so she can use both arms to squeeze you. “He does that every year, but ends up giving me some real gifts anyway.”
>She clicks her tongue in pity
>”You know, I sometimes wish he wouldn’t. Just stick to his guns, right? It kind of makes me feel worse because of it. I know I disappoint him a lot, and I shouldn’t be rewarded for it. But....”
>Volfa looks a little guilty
>”I think he does it for her...to have that generous and forgiving spirit on her behalf.”
>When Volfa sighs, it’s practically enough to blow a gust of wind
>”Dammit. Now you know why I try to get away from it all. He’s always such a wreck around this time. It’s hard to see him like this when he’s such a hard-ass usually.”
>The two of you head back toward Volfa’s place
>She’s determined to keep things from getting too dower
>Even if it means giving you multiple playful punches
>But she follows up by rubbing the spot soothingly and then chewing on your face
>Once in the heart of Gulchgut, you’re intercepted by a familiar spore mother
>”Oh, Volfa hon, would you do us a favor?” she says
>The monsters are trying to make things look festive without masking their Halloween soul
>There’s a spot in the center of the village completely barren
>”We still haven’t gotten a nice tree to decorate yet. Would you please find one for us?”
>”Not a problem!” Volfa says with a clap
>The wolfess grabs you by the hand and soon you’re tearing off out of the village
>Sprinting behind her tail never gets old, even though you’re often flailing about just to keep your footing
>Whether it’s the running or having something important to do, Volfa has a wild look on her face
>”Least we won’t have to do any of the decorating!” she laughs

>The monster world has nearly every biome imaginable in its patchwork landscape
>You’ve never been up to the snow-capped mountains, and their beauty makes you wonder why you never have before
>”Eh, not a lot to do up here,” Volfa says. “There’s a few friendly folk to say hi to, but that’s about it.”
>She waves off in the distance to a family of yeti, who wave back with guttural cheers
>There are hundreds of wondrous trees up here, but none of them catch the wolfess’ eye
>She stops the hunt every so often to roll up a snowball and pelt you with it
>No matter how far you escape, she manages to hit you
>And her dodging is too quick for you to strike back
>The best you can do is charge at her to close the gap
>The wolfess prepares a wrestling pose, but when you tackle her she goes down easily
>You’re rolling around in the powdery snow with Volfa in your arms
>And you in hers
>Just as she said, her fur keeps you nice and toasty
>You lie together for a while, enjoying the contrast of the cool mounds with her warm body
>A mattress of winter itself
>It’s almost enough to fall asleep in
>But you’re lifted to your feet and patted down after a few minutes
>”Can’t have you getting too chilled,” Volfa says
>She’s one to talk; her dark fur is completely covered in snow chunks
>You continue the search for the perfect tree
>With how enormous they all are, it’s nearly impossible to gauge which one could possibly be considered the biggest
>Not an issue for Volfa
>She finally stops at the trunk of one seemingly in its own clearing
>Her tail wags excitedly
>”Here we are! Let’s bring this bad boy down!”
>It probably should have dawned on you sooner that neither of you brought an axe or anything along
>Just a coil of rope
>Again, not an issue for Volfa
>She cracks her knuckles and gives the tree a few testing raps with her paws
>She inhales deeply
>Then her yell echoes through the mountains
>”NNNNNNYYYAAAHHHH!”
>Volfa repeatedly punches the tree, taking out huge cuts with every strike
>Every hit evokes a powerful, resounding bark from her
>And every hit makes you flinch a little bit
>Whether it’s from imagining the damage being done to her knuckles, or imagining the tree as someone on the receiving end of the blows
>If half the stories she tells are true, Volfa has the strength of her father in a body the fraction of his size
>It isn’t long before she gets far enough in to make the whole thing creak ominously
>”Stand back, Little Red!”
>The wolfess runs around the back and gives the tree the final push it needs
>It snaps free and crashes to the ground with thunderous grace
>Powder billows up from the impact and glistens in the sun
>The sound echoes through the hills
>Then everything goes quiet
>The serene landscape like a painting; silent and still
>At least until Volfa whoops with satisfaction
>”Alright! Time to take this puppy back to the village!”
>You’re hoisted up before you even realize what’s happening
>”And we’ll take the tree with us as well! Ha!”
>You’re thrown up onto the fallen pine, landing on the cushiony branches
>You sink into the green needles quite a bit, but it’s not a bad spot to lie
>Volfa takes the rope she brought along and makes a few quick loops around the tree
>Then she ties the rest around herself like a harness before giving you the thumbs-up
>”Just say the word, and we’ll be off!”
>The wolfess crouches into a running stance and looks at you expectantly
>Waiting for the right word
>Mush?
>And she’s off
>The tree lurches forward as Volfa pulls it along at breakneck speeds
>You’re gliding along on top of the massive pine, hanging on to any branch you can grip
>The tree is your sleigh with Volfa as an entire team of reindeer
>She glances back at you every so often with a proud smile
>Sometimes to check you’re still up there, but mostly to see if you’re enjoying yourself as much as she is
>When the hills get steeper and her harness slacks, she falls back and rides along with you
>Hopping over to your spot and reclining in the needles with her arm around you
>It’s a sled ride meant for two; unguided but sliding exactly where I needs to go
>It’s saddening to see Gulchgut waiting off in the distance so soon
>The tree eventually loses momentum, and Volfa has to drag it the rest of the way
>Still completely uninhibited by its size
>It requires several monsters just to take it off her paws when the delivery is made
>”Oh, thank you, Volfa!” the spore mother says excitedly. “This is wonderful!”
>”Don’t mention it. Anon picked it out himself!”
>You did no such thing
>But it makes Volfa happy to share the victory
>The monsters begin to decorate the wintery trophy as the spore mother bounces in anticipation
>”So, Volfa,” she says, “Can we expect to see you at your father’s Christmas Eve party this year?”
>None of the physical obstacles or challenges fazed the wolfess the entire trip
>Yet all it takes to make her look just she got punched in the gut is that one question
>”It would really mean a lot to him, you know...” the spore mother continues, sensing Volfa’s hesitation
>”I’ll...think about it,” the wolfess says
>There’s far less spring to her step as the two of you head back to her den for the evening
>She seems really conflicted about this party thing
>Regardless of how she feels about her father, you’d never imagine Volfa to pass up a party like that
>Unless it was because she had a better plan in mind for the two of you
>But this sounds like Volfa was never a fan of Christmas parties even before she met you
>”You had to have picked up on that, right?” Volfa says. “I have a reputation for skipping the old man’s little gatherings.”
>She scratches the back of her neck vigorously
>”And at this point I think it’s too late to start. They’d just make a big deal about it.”
>All the monsters in Gulchgut have been exceptionally nice once you’ve gotten to know them
>Would they really make Volfa feel so ashamed of herself?
>You don’t want to believe they would
>It could all just be in Volfa’s head, after all
>She’s one-of-a-kind for sure, even in her faults
>When it comes to perceptions, she wants nothing more than to look like an unwavering icon of fearlessness in your eyes
>And yet, she always tells you you’re her better half
>Just giving her a squeeze of the paw or an unexpected hug is enough to make her feel like a giant
>She buries you in the fluff of her neck—both collar and natural fur—and pats you on the back
>Does she have the will now to go through with this?
>Her chest heaves before a long sigh
>”I’ll think about it,” she says, this time with a little more confidence

>There’s a certain coziness to bars and taverns around Halloween
>Coming in from a chilly night to have a few drinks and warm up with lively company
>Even in the monster world, it’s perhaps even cozier with it being Christmas Eve
>Spirits are high and there’s a raucous amount of liveliness in the bar
>Most of the noise surrounds your table, where Volfa and several burly orcs are in the midst of a drinking contest
>Eggnog, no less
>It isn’t even the first contest the wolfess has been in since arriving here
>She’s practically gone through an entire barrel by herself
>The chants of “chug chug chug!” coming from spectators get louder as orcs start tapping out one by one
>Some even pass out entirely
>The last one sputters into his stein as Volfa slams hers down in victory
>With how much she’s consumed, you’d expect her belly to be swelled out to look like an actual barrel
>Or at least have the smallest of bumps
>But she’s in the same shape as when she started
>That girl has to have an extra-dimensional space for a stomach
>Even still, it’s clear the feat has taken its toll on her
>Volfa pats herself groggily as the cheers peter out and the cleanup begins
>”Little Red...I’m going to need your help with this, ha....”
>You help the wolfess massage her belly
>She pays you back by massaging your head
>Running her paws on your neck and gliding her nails over your scalp
>There’s a glow to her golden eyes as she hums with a satisfied look on her face
>No doubt feeling a little buzz
>Her tipsy state is testament to the sheer volume she drank, as the monsters didn’t add much alcohol to the eggnog in order to mass-produce it
>You realize just how empty the bar starts getting as the two of you caress each other
>Luckily it wasn’t from your display of affection
>It’s enough to make Volfa a tiny bit self-conscious though
>”Hey, uh, think we can grab a few more drinks?” Volfa says
>The request is partially to you and partially to the barkeeper
>”Actually Volfa,” the skeletal barkeep responds, “I was kind of hoping to close up early and get to your father’s party.”
>”Oh...right,” Volfa says, ears drooping a bit. “We’ll head out then.”
>The barkeep takes off his vest and pops a Santa hat over his pearly skull
>”See you there!” he rattles, locking the place up with a skeleton key
>You and Volfa stand outside for a while
>Every so often she glances off to where the mausoleum is
>”So...you want to head back to my place and get comfy?”
>You can hear the hesitance in her voice
>And the smell of eggnog
>Even though Volfa’s relationship with her father is strained, you earnestly think she has more care for him than anyone else
>But right now you feel pretty bad for the cerberus
>Something about large, imposing figures showing their sorrow and disappointment doesn’t really sit right with you
>The three-headed dog is probably holding out hope his only child shows up for what’s supposed to be one of the closest times of the year for families
>You don’t really want to guilt Volfa, though
>Fortunately, she makes the choice herself
>”Alright, I guess there’s no avoiding it”
>She pats you on the back as though you’re the one being praised for making the right choice
>”Thanks, Little Red.”
>That’s Volfa for you...
>”There’s just one stop I need to make first. Gotta pick something up.”
>She leads you through the village
>It’s completely empty
>Gulchgut never scared you much, but the lack of activity makes things kind of eerie
>Now you’re looking at a very familiar apothecary
>Medafet’s shop
>It’s more than a little surprising when Volfa pushes open the unlocked door
>”She always leaves it like this,” the wolfess says. “Who’s going to dare steal something from her?”
>Well, depends on what the two of you are doing here now...
>The trinkets and curios in the shop change every time you’ve been in it
>Even Medafet’s inventory takes on a sort of Christmas vibe
>A gruesome vibe, but festive nonetheless
>Reindeer bones, ribbons that hiss and slither, bells that chime on their own with an otherworldly ring...
>Volfa hones in on a present resting conspicuously on the countertop
>”There you are!” she says, snatching it up
>You inhale sharply, expecting it to be some kind of trap
>Nothing
>Guess even Medafet’s love of messing with people takes a break around the holidays
>But there’s a message waiting under the box
>[Thank you for making this a special day for your father.]
>”Pfft, whatever,” Volfa says, as if the cat were here
>The two of you leave the shop with the gift
>A jingle of soft music starts up as you cross the threshold
>The living shop begins its own little celebration in your wake
>”Just remember my number one rule of parties,” Volfa says
>She licks your face, then dries it off with her furry cheeks
>Do what you want until someone stops having fun?
>”Bingo. We’ll hang around for a little while to be polite, but just say the word and we’ll head home. I wouldn’t mind spending a little more alone time with my Little Red tonight.”
 
>The mausoleum is packed with monsters
>Whereas everyone’s off doing their own thing for Halloween, the gathering of choice for Christmas is here
>Dozens of monsters look at Volfa with surprise as the two of you wander through the halls
>Clearly nobody was expecting her to actually show up this year
>It’s enough to make the wolfess a little embarrassed
>Especially when they applaud her
>”You’re gonna have to keep me from bolting, Little Red,” she whispers
>She grabs you tightly around the shoulder
>Again, she’s sort of the one in control here
 >You get the sense her wandering is mostly just stalling
>The monsters are quick to let Volfa know where her father is currently hanging out
>Far in the back of the mausoleum is one of the few rooms able to fit the cerberus comfortably
>How he even managed to get down here is a mystery
>He’s chatting with Medafet, who looks like she might have had to duck just to get into a few rooms herself
>The wrinkly yellow cat spots you and Volfa
>She gives you that Cheshire smile of hers before excusing herself from the cerberus’ company
>The whole room goes quiet
>Volfa and her father stare at each other in silence
>Just the slightest nudge is all she needs to step forward, albeit at a snail’s pace
>”Volfa...” the cerberus says
>”Yeah?” Volfa replies
>Her father swirls his glass of eggnog around
>The sight of it is a little nauseating after Volfa’s binge
>”I’m...happy you decided to come,” the big wolf says. “It truly means a lot to me.”
>Volfa doesn’t say anything as she holds out her gift
>The cerberus sets down his glass to daintily pick up the gift
>Then sets it aside as well
>”Thank you, Volfa, but you’ve given me a great deal already. I couldn’t ask for anything more than to see you here. It’s all I wanted tonight.”
 >Volfa swallows a lump in her throat and gives a sheepish smile
>”So, that’s all it took?” she chuckles weakly. “Your greatest gift is just me showing up?”
>The cerberus inhales deeply
>”No gift can ever compare to the one your mother gave me...the day you were born. That will always be my greatest gift.”
>Volfa’s face scrunches up and she flicks at the wetness of her nose quickly
>Trying to be discreet in a room full of monsters
>The wolfess closes in at a faster pace, and the cerberus kneels down to scoop her up
>He pulls her to his chest as his three heads try to fit around her lovingly
>For how big Volfa is compared to you, she’s still just a pup in her father’s arms
>”I love you, Volfa,” the cerberus rumbles
>”I love you too, pops,” Volfa sniffs
>The two share an embrace that even the sweetest Christmas photo can’t compare to
>The smiles on their faces alone bring warmth to the whole mausoleum
>The room full of monsters doesn’t exist anymore as father and daughter take their time with their bonding
>Eventually the two part with their smiles still intact
>At least until the cerberus speaks up again
>”That is quite the adorable look,” he says, pointing to Volfa’s antlers
>”Don’t ruin the moment,” Volfa scoffs, wiping her snout with the back of her paw
>The party’s merriment escalates as the fuzzy feelings spill out to the rest of the partiers
>When word gets out that the wolves have reconciled, everyone wants to be in the nexus of their happiness
>Volfa has much less urgency to leave the party now
>She still drags you around the rest of the mausoleum to take part in the festivities, but she checks in with her father every so often
>And every time he continues beaming with pride
>It’s a look you’ve never seen on the cerberus
>It’s one you might not even see much of again after tonight
>Volfa and her dad are just naturally the type who butt heads with one another regularly
>But you’re confident they’ve made some important progress together
>Near the end of the night the bands stop playing
>A hush fills the mausoleum
>Then caroling sweeps through the halls
>With Volfa’s dad as the front man
>The cerberus already has an incredible set of lungs capable of belting out Christmas songs
>But when you have your own pair of backup vocals as well, the sound is hauntingly beautiful
>It’s powerful enough to reverberate through your whole body
>As Volfa hugs you close, however, you can feel a vibration coming from her as well
>She’s humming along to her dad’s songs, rocking you gently
>It’s obvious she plans on staying for the whole performance
>”Hope you don’t mind,” she murmurs into your ear
>You can’t object
>The caroling puts a feeling of bliss within you
>It must with Volfa as well
>By the time the night comes to a close, she looks ready for a peaceful, heavenly sleep
>The village fills back up with monsters, all of whom exude cheer from the party
>You carry the spirit with you all the way to Volfa’s den
>Even though it’s sparsely decorated, her room suddenly has a lot more Christmas soul to it
>You and Volfa crawl under the covers, still locked in each other’s hold
>It remains the most comfortable, toasty place to be
>Just resting against the fur of your lupine lover
>Her humming continues, lulling the two of you to sleep

>The morning comes with you waking up to the sight of Volfa’s golden eyes
>”Merry Christmas, Little Red,” she says
>A kiss from her starts off the day
>A small pile of presents found their way into the room
>When you pick one up, Volfa snatches it out of your hands playfully
>”Not yet, Champ,” she laughs. “Can’t skip the tradition. We’re taking these out to open with our family.”
>She doesn’t just mean her dad, either
>When the wolfess says “family”, it’s unmistakably the entire village she’s talking about
>The two of you head out to the village center, where there’s a sea of monsters sitting around exchanging gifts
>Medafet is looming overhead passing some around
>Meanwhile, Volfa’s dad watches the whole scene with pride
>Wearing the ugliest three-headed sweater he could find
>You already have his gift to you in your arms, but you collect another few from some of the monsters along the way up to the cerberus
>”A little something from all of us,” the spore mother says cordially, puffing herself out with a giggle
>You’re walking along with a sizeable number of gifts, and Volfa tosses another on top
>”I wasn’t going to forget about you!” she says, slapping you on the back almost hard enough to make you drop the whole stack
>The two of you find a spot next to the cerberus, who has Volfa’s gift resting in his paw
>”You could have opened it already, old man,” Volfa says with the shake of her head
“Of course not,” he responds. “It’s only courteous to open them when all the recipients are accounted for.”
>”Alright, fine. You go ahead and start us off, then.”
 >The cerberus pinches the ribbon with the tips of his massive claws and tugs the gift open
>Inside is a hefty glass paperweight in the shape of a three-headed pup
>Its mouths have spaces to slide pens into, as though the little creature is chewing on them like bones
>”I love it!” he says with a boom. “Thank you, Volfa.”
>Never far from his work, the cerberus takes a hidden pen from his sweater and pops it into one of the pup’s mouths
>His three sets of eyes turn to you, patiently watching
>”Why don’t you go next, Anon?”
>Sure
>Would probably be polite to open his gift while he’s right here
>The magical seal on the present pops with a sparkle of light as you unwrap the box
>Inside looks like some kind of clothing patch, with an intricate design of swirls and runic symbols sewn in
>As you examine the patch a corner sticks to your coat sleeve securely
>”It’s a glamour patch,” the cerberus says. “Often used by monsters to tailor clothing to their unique body shapes. More relevant to you, however, is its ability to magically dye outfits to any shade you choose. You seem to have a penchant for wearing red clothing....”
>He doesn’t get it, does he?
>Well, not many know about Volfa’s nickname for you
>Not far off in the corner of your eye, you see Medafet and her stretched grin looking your direction
>The gift exchange goes on for a while
>Volfa gets a bunch of new spiked bracelets and a sharp new jacket from her father
>”Figures he’d give us clothes for Christmas,” she snickers into your ear
>”She’s very easy to shop for,” the cerberus says to you shortly after in your other ear
>Everyone rotates who opens the next one
>You see a lot of really unusual tools and unidentifiable containers, though they always make the receiver happy
>A lot of your own gifts need to be explained
>The one from Medafet’s shop, not so much
>As you hold the tiny jar of liquid, Volfa’s expression goes from embarrassment to amusement to...salaciousness?
>She grabs your hand and guides the jar into your coat pocket before anyone else can see it
>”Oh, I bet that’s going to feel amazing...” the wolfess says with a hushed voice and a sultry look
>There’s probably a “Christmas is coming” joke in there somewhere
>At last is Volfa’s gift to you
>She managed to keep it hidden from you for the whole month, while she never left you alone long enough to pick her gift in secrecy
>”Don’t sweat it.” 
>Volfa sticks out her chest and lifts her chin
>“I couldn’t ask for anything more,” she says in a deep voice, poking fun at her father
>She pulls you into another full embrace and holds your head to her body
>”That’s no joke, either. You mean everything to me, Anon. That’s really the greatest gift I could ever get. And I didn’t even have to wait for Christmas!”
>Volfa lets you go so you can finally open her present
>Her tail wags furiously the whole time you spend opening it
>Inside is what appears to be a miniature diorama
>All handmade from bits and pieces of materials and scavenged supplies
>A little yarn Anon and yarn Volfa sit together in a tiny cart, rolling from a haunted house to a recreation of some familiar catacombs
>It’s a little crude, but as they always say it’s the thought that counts
>”I put it together piece by piece every night when you were asleep,” Volfa says. “I hated being out of bed and out of your reach, but I wanted to do something special for you.”
>She pushes the cart back and forth between the two scenes
>”I know I said I was going to give Christmas a fair chance, but I just couldn’t stop thinking of Halloween—thinking of what changed my life forever. I didn’t really make this as a reminder of that night. Heh, like I’d EVER forget it.”
>Volfa looks fondly at her creation, then to you with insurmountable adoration
>”Think of it like a goal. That was such an incredible night, but we can do even better. I know we can! We have our whole lives for adventure, and every time we look at this little symbol of our first meeting I want us to go out there and do something even better!”
>It’s a bold challenge...
>...For anyone other than Volfa
>You don’t believe for one second she won’t deliver on her promise
>Every experience you’ve had with her so far has been nothing short of extraordinary
>And the eagerness to see what the next day has in store is matched only by the desire to stay frozen in any given moment with her
>”I love you, Little Red,” Volfa says just loud enough for only you to hear
>She gives you a lick on the cheek; a hint at things to come
>”Well, let’s get all this stuff back home for now. We got a full day of relaxing ahead of us!”
>A relaxing day it is indeed
>After dropping off all the gifts back at Volfa’s, the two of you enjoy the remainder of Christmas Day
>Sharing the company of the other monsters, and gathering together for a feast later in the day
>You promised some of your own friends and family you’d swing by and give your wishes, but then it’s right back to the monster world
>By this point late at night Volfa’s pretty tired of sharing you with others
>The two of you turn in for the day, lying together in bed
>A light dusting of snow visits Gulchgut
>Just enough to make Volfa’s den even cozier
>You’re reclined against the wolfess and her soft fur, while she strokes your chest and rubs her muzzle all over you
>”I guess it wasn’t so bad after all,” she says between kisses. “But I’m never giving up on Halloween, alright?”
>You give Volfa a pat on the head, and she squeezes you tightly
>”While you’re up there, would you mind?”
>You pinch the antlers and pop them off easily
>Unconnected, they dissolve into tiny ice crystals
>”That’s more like it...”
>She nuzzles you with the top of her head right where the antlers were
>Then she grabs the last of her candy canes and gnaws on it for a while
>Poking you in the cheek with the end and getting you to share it with her
>”You know,” she says, crunching the last little bit, “maybe we can give New Year’s a chance, too.”
>Volfa’s open-mindedness is getting impressive
>”This was nice and all, but there wasn’t enough...debauchery.”
>She slips you out of your clothes, and soon you’re lying against the wolfess’ uncovered fur
>While wearing less, her warmth is even greater
>All the more reason to stay inside
>She turns off the light, and the two of you settle down for sleep
>Volfa’s calm breathing leads to a content sigh
>”So let’s get all the comfy out of this while we can, okay? ‘Cause we’re gonna party hard enough to last us until next Halloween!”
>When you open your mouth to speak, Volfa puts her paw over it while she finishes a yawn
>”Shh, comfy...alright?”
>Volfa takes her paw off your mouth just to plant her lips on it
>”Merry Christmas, Little Red,” she says again after the kiss
>The wolfess quietly hums her father’s songs as you gaze out at the gentle flakes outside
>Then your eyes wander to the Anon and Volfa yarn figures sitting in the diorama
>Sharing a moment together, just the same as you and the real wolfess right now
>Just the same as whenever you walk through the city together
>Just the same as you hope every day will be like
>You and Volfa
>And her whole family
