>Be anon
>Noxian, though not by birth or choice
>your village got annexed by Noxian forces when you were a child
>the deal then was join, or get killed
>your parents understandably took the former option
>it wasn't as bad as some people made it out to be, or at least as it was with how High Command was running shit
>if you were good at what you did, people gave you leeway
>if you were the best at it, you'd get a crazy amount of respect and everyone would know about it
>you were alright at what you did; legitimate healing magic, and not the disgusting necromancy that was rampant around Noxus
>it was enough to get you by, but not enough to stop the bigger fish from pushing the thumbscrews in on you
>you had considered defecting to Demacia at one point, but they hate mages, so that was a no-go
>Bilgewater was too rough and tumble for you, Bandle City was full of midgets, you weren't smart enough for Piltover and Zaun didn't sound so great
>fuck the Freljord forever
>Ionia might be nice, but it'd be a massive pain to even get there, and you really didn't think they'd be too happy with a Noxian after the shit they had been through
>so you were sorta stuck here
>being the medic of a squad of equally mediocre soldiers, getting thrown into yet another skirmish against Demacian forces in the middle of nowhere 
>mostly because the Grand General had a massive hate boner for the Demacian Prince
>at least you weren't escorting (and eventually getting killed by) Sion
>you were in the middle of a forest when the battle started
>it wasn't so much of an ambush by the Demacians as it was your company stumbling over a ridge, each side catching sight of the other, and the Demacians doing their usual thing of charging straight the fuck at you
>they were pretty direct in that way
>you were sprinting from body to body, using other soldiers and the fog to cover yourself from harm despite being in the thick of it
>you saw that fucker that beat you up the other week, sprinting right towards you
>and away from the fucking battle
>"The fuck are you running from you pussy!?" you yelled at him, despite not having any real way to stop him. "The battle's tha-"
>something collided with his back as he neared you, and he fell head over heels
>and clung to his neck, it's fangs buried deep inside his flesh, was a giant, dark-purple shade in the form of some canine sporting a rounded white mask
>your heart stopped for a second as both the corpse of the bully and the wolf slammed into the ground at your feet
>you knew exactly what the fuck that was
>and you knew better than to interrupt it from its meal
>guess that answered your previous question
>wide-eyed and shaken, you turned away and began to wander towards the shouting and screaming
>maybe you could hide in some bigger guy's pocket and feed him as many heals as you could, you might live to see tomorrow
>you regrouped with a couple of younger squires, moving towards the treeline
>you came across a small clearing with soldiers of both sides battling with one another
>and every single one of them had the same mark hovering over their heads
>and as you looked to your newfound compatriots, so did they
>and they definitely knew it
>their faces went pale, and they turned on their heels and ran
>turning back to the battlefield, now obscured by the now thicker, heavier fog, you saw that wolf again
>it's giant maw hovering right in front of you
>well, there goes the idea of living
>you stand there, somewhat dumbstruck and hopeless
>the wolf barks out a laugh in a guttural voice
>"Hah! This one is no fun, but all his friends are!"
>and it bounds past you, leaving you alone and alive
>well, that was an experience
>fuck this, you were done
>if you read the map right, the coast should be nearby
>at least you can die with a view
>you turned away from the sounds of battle, and traipse off through the woods
>did it count as running if you walked away?
>probably. you'd know about it sooner or later
>after a few minutes of walking, you came to a small cliff, the sparkling blue sea laying calm beneath it
>you heard what sounded like the sound of something large and metal hit something hollow
>the scream that followed was distant, but that only underlined how loud and protracted it was
>"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOXUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUS"
>Sion had joined the battle apparently
>you took a seat on a nearby rock, and looked out to the sky
>everyone had that mark of death haunting them, so you only guessed that you'd have it too
>you couldn't see it
>maybe you got lucky?
>probably not. you were never lucky
>something moved in your peripheral, and you turned your head 
>out of the woods stepped a short figure, maybe 5 foot at best
>you'd never seen a white so pure and unfettered as it's fur
>graceful, steady steps on hooved feet, a thick mantle of fur that seemed to explode out from beneath a dark, navy blue pointed mask, in the visage of a wolf
>and a curved, intricately carved bow
>that would be the counterpart to the creature from earlier
>the lamb to the wolf
>she was humming a sweet tune to herself as she pranced along towards you at an angle, her eyes, a roiling pink and blue light, set on you
>you know what she is. what she represented, and what she was most likely here to do
>and despite all that, you couldn't stop yourself from staring at her wide hips, thick thighs, and shapely rump
>with a cute little tail to top it all off
>she stopped a few metres in front of you, pausing for a moment before speaking
>"You saw our marks, and thought better to deny their end," she said, her voice making you tremble and your skin erupt into goosebumps. "An uncommon action from one who wears your colours."
>she fell silent, as if she was waiting for an answer
>you felt their air leave your lungs; this was it
>the end
>...actually, you know what
>fuck it all
>let's get stupid
>"...If you're here to kill me, I have a request," you began tentatively
>she tilted her head
>"We do not kn-"
>"Please sit on my face."
>the silence that followed was incredibly awkward
>"...Excuse me?"
>was she seriously asking you to repeat yourself?
>"Uh..."
>After another awkward pause where you attempted to recover the courage to say that stupid shit again, Lamb looks off to the side
>"...Wolf will be hunting for a while. No more seem willing to face their deaths peacefully."
>She turned her face back to you, unreadable as it was, and brought a hand to her just in front of where you thought her mouth would be
>"...I suppose I have time to indulge your... perversions"
>what
>she stepped forward, her bow fading into the air, placing her hand delicately around the collar of your armor and gently pulling you away from the rock
>"Lie down."
>WHAT
>following her guiding hand, you settle yourself underneath rock, placing your head against the grass
>you felt her hand glide down your chest, and all you saw was the blue sky
>before it was obscured by a giant, white, furry ass
>holy fucking shit
>this was absolute madman territory
>you barely had time to even smile before she had placed one hand against your forehead to steady herself, and pushed her hips down
>as her cheeks collided into your own, you were pleasantly surprised
>they were as soft as they looked
>two hands pressed down into your chest, and her thighs settled firmly around the sides of your head
>it was harder to breathe, and all you could smell was a rather nostalgic scent
>the smell of a meadow in the early morning
>deciding to press your already incredible luck, you pushed your face upwards and your tongue outward
>Lamb flinched away slgihtly as you explored through her fur and found your mark, before pushing herself down harder on your face
>your dick instantly went to full mast
>"So this was your intention..." she murmured, wiggling her hips from side to side, her hand gliding down your stomach and towards your groin. 
>with almost no effort, your felt your imprisoning pants loosen and a set of furred fingers wrap around your cock
>"How... lecherous."
>there was a particular tone to that second word that made you shudder with excitement
>you felt something velvety and wet against your tongue, that elicited an encouraging squeeze of her thighs every time you brushed against it
>drunk with arousal, you lapped away at her pussy with eagerness
>you attempted to draw the alphabet with your tongue, girls apparently liked that
>you gave up after C, and just went with whatever felt right, reaching your arms up to wrap around her plump thighs and dug in deep
>Lamb was appreciative either way
>she squeezed your cock, pulling upward and stroking your head with her thumb, before plunging back down to your groin
>slowly and tortuously, she repeated the soft jerking motions
>eventually, you felt an opening, and dove straight in, shoving your tongue into the fold
>that brought a sufficient moan from Lamb, who immediately shoved her ass harder onto your face, almost pushing you into the dirt
>whether that was to incite or to punish you, you weren't sure
>it was significantly harder to breathe now
>especially with her juices beginning to fill in for little air there was
>undaunted by the concept of suffocating to death, you instead double down on your cunnilingus, while she reciprocated by increasing the pace of her stroking and squeezing
>her other hand left your chest, sliding up and down your thigh before curling around your balls
>she kneaded her fingers into your sack, leaning her slender body forward to press down against yours
>you began to feel a warm rumbling in your gut, and started thrusting into her soft hand
>her grip tightened on both your cock and your head
>between the mounting pressure on your skull, the building puddle of fem-cum, her perculiar musk filling your nostrils, and your own arousal, you felt yourself become dizzy and lightheaded
>and to top it all off, you felt warm breath and a wet tongue glide across the head of your penis
>overwhelmed by the oppressive sensations, you let out a muffled groan of pleasure and released inside her mouth
>despite the sudden orgams, Lamb continued to squeeze and pump away, making your legs spasm uncontrollably
>finally spent, your vision went black

>you awoke to the same blue sky you gazed upon earlier
>and the faint scent of a warm, womanly scent that made you grin sheepishly despite being too groggy to have a clue what it was, or which young lass left it-
>oh
>OH
>you raised your head to examine your body
>your pants had been mercifully pulled back up, but there was dried fluids splattered everwhere
>some of it yours, and some of it not
>and a single, pure white arrow planted in the ground beside you
>you let your head drop back to the ground in disbelief
>...did you seriously just perform reciprocal oral sex on the avatar of death itself?
