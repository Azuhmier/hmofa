I REMEMBER YOU

>Be Anon
>You were 26, standing at a height of 6'1".
>The year was 1800, and you were an American frontiersman, doing your best to settle the rugged, unsettled Western Territories.
>It's been 3 months since you've stoke your claim at the foot of the mighty Appalachian mountains.
>Since then, you've managed to build yourself a small cabin (with the help of some laborers, of course!), and you were just starting to grow some basic crops.
>You had been spurred to settle out in the wilds by your dear old Dad (Before he died of Consumption), who had told you it was your duty as a free American citizen.
>He had fought off those damned Redcoats in the Revolutionary War, and you wanted to follow in his footsteps at claiming glory for the young Nation.
>And what better way that to settle the savage, untamed lands West of the original 13 Colonies?
>It had been a rough trip, but well-worth it.
>Unlike your Father, you now owned your very own parcel of land, and with it you were free to whatever you pleased.

>Currently, you were beside your makeshift home, chopping some firewood. You had to stay warm somehow!
>Inside your home, you had some potatoes and rabbit meat stewing in your trusty cast iron pot. You were never much of a cook like your Mother was, but hopefully it would taste halfway decent.
>With a sigh, you bury your axe into the stump you used to cut smaller bits of wood on, reaching up to wipe the sweat from your brow.
>Damn, it was hot out today!
>You had done the smart thing and settled here right after Winter ended, so you had plenty of time to prepare before the snow came back.
>Although you enjoyed the sense of freedom you got from living out here on your own, it had been pretty tough going at it alone.
>Back in Boston, you had always had friends who were willing to help you with whatever you were working on.
>Out here in the wilderness though, you were alone. Other than some squirrels and deer, you had no company, and it got pretty lonely sometimes.
>It also made getting the stuff you needed a lot more difficult! You were about ready to kill someone for a taste of salt.
>On the bright side, nobody could tell you what do out here. It's not like any taxman was willing to hike all the way out here to collect on taxes.
>As far as anyone back home was concerned, until the frontier caught up with you, you were pretty much dead to everyone back home.
>Sure, it may not be much fun living in a constant state of isolation, but you knew that this was your purpose in life.
>And you were determined to make a go of it as best as you could.

>With a huff, you set down the heavy bundle of wood next to the stone hearth in your cabin.
>Tossing in a couple pieces to feed the fire, you sit on your bed, rubbing your aching muscles.
>Your father had been a giant of a man, but you had a long way to go before you could match his strength. Constantly chopping and carrying around wood was a great way to build up your strength, but it left you wiped at the end of each day.
>You sigh, as the smell of the potato and rabbit stew reaches your nostrils.
>At least you had this meal all to yourself!
>Back when you were young and living in Boston, you always had to share with your several brothers and sisters. Out here though, everything you saw belonged to you, and you alone. Everyone else be damned!
>You pull the lid off of the pot containing the stew, and smile.
>It smelled good! Better than you thought it would!
>You pull your ladle off of the hook, and try a taste of the simmering liquid.
>Hot hot hot!
>Nursing your burned tongue, you spoon out another small portion of the stew.
>This time though, you make the decision to wait for it to cool before jamming it in your mouth.
>From what you can taste, it seems pretty acceptable.
>Not the best thing you've ever made, but by far not the worst thing.
>Ladling some of it into a bowl, you begin to chow down.
>It was a good way to end the day.
>Eventually, you finish your stew, leaving some in the pot over the dying embers of the fire. You would have the meager remainder for breakfast when you woke.
>Peering out the window, you can see the skies darkening.
>You shudder a bit as your cabin is slowly cast into darkness.
>You weren't afraid of the dark, but lately you had been hearing noises at night near the door and windows.
>It was probably just those damned coons trying to get into your home again, but it sounded... different.
>While raccoons made loud noises and weird yips, the sounds you were hearing outside were quieter... Almost like whatever was making them was being intentionally quiet.
>It was probably just your paranoia speaking, but you had taken to sleeping with your musket at your bedside, loaded, just in case something was out there...
>Eventually, it gets dark enough to merit going to sleep.
>It's not like you could work when you couldn't see, and you didn't want to waste your candles.
>You undress from your day-clothes, and put on your long johns.
>You slide into bed, the wool blanket scratching at your exposed skin. It may not be comfortable, but it was undeniably warm.
>Eventually, you manage to drift off to sleep, dreaming of the Ocean where you once lived.

>You wake up with a start, your eyes blinking open.
>You're momentarily confused, as you can't see anything.
>It isn't long before you realize that it's just dark.
>You sit up in bed, rubbing your face.
>That's when you hear it.
>A scratching noise, coming from the window near your bed.
>You jump out of bed in surprise, landing on your feet.
>You move over to where you think your table is, and feel around for a candle.
>Although you're at first unable to find it, your hand eventually closes around the candle.
>Feeling around for your tinderbox, you're eventually able to start a small flame for your candle.
>It's time to see whatever on God's green Earth is making these awful noises.
>You approach the window where the noises are coming from, and hold the candle up to it so that you can get a better look at what you're dealing with.
>Bad idea.
>Staring at you with inhuman eyes from the other side of the thin glass is what look likes a wolf, but standing upright on a humanoid frame.
>You scream, dropping the candle. As it hits the floor, the flame is extinguished.
>From outside, you can hear a yip, and the scampering of feet away from your cabin.
>You lay on the floor, trying to control your breathing.
>FUCK FUCK FUCK.
>Okay, calm down!
>You crawl over to your bed, and grab your musket, causing it to clatter to the floor.
>If it got your father through nearly 10 years of conflict with the British, it can get you through this!
>You sit up, your back against the bed.
>You shoulder the long rifle, pointing it at your door.
>You're pretty certain that you heard it run away, but you aren't taking any chances.
>No way are you going to get eaten by some furred monstrosity!

>When dawn finally breaks, you're still sitting there, rifle sitting in your lap as you lazily stare at your door with one eye.
>You had managed to stay awake the whole night, and you were paying for it dearly.
>Working hard and then not sleeping sure takes its toll.
>You yawn, working up the nerve to stand.
>Still clutching the rifle tightly, you stumble over to the door.
>It doesn't lock, and so you just push it open.
>Craning your head around, you can't see anything lurking around in the immediate area.
>Looks can be deceiving though...
>Taking an uneasy breath of fresh air, you head outside.
>First thing's first. Check the perimeter of your cabin.
>You walk around the cabin, but nothing seems out of order.
>Except for the window where the beast was standing last night.
>On the ground, you can see the faint impressions of large, clawed feet. It looks like tracks a dog or wolf might make, except much larger in size.
>Jesus Christ, how horrifying!
>You take the next few minutes to survey the rest of the immediate area.
>Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, except for some tracks leading into the forest.
>How long has this... This THING been stalking you? You've only been hearing noises for maybe a week or so, but that's only because it had been close to the cabin...
>Was it watching you from the trees yesterday when you were cutting the firewood? Was it watching you even now?
>Your eyes scan the surrounding forest, fingers unconsciously clenching around the wooden musket.
>Jesus...
>You don't see anything, but for some reason, it only makes your anxiety grow.
>Well... For now you suppose you should just continue with your usual work...
>After all, what else could you do? There was no way you were charging through the woods, bayonet at the ready, hunting your quarry like some crazy mountain-man.

>You spend the rest of the day driving stakes into the ground.
>You had been putting off erecting a fence, but now seemed like a better time than ever to get it done.
>It would take maybe a week to complete though, as you still had to clear some land and dig holes for the posts. The stakes were just there temporarily to mark out the locations.
>Surprisingly, the day goes without any problems or sightings of the Creature.
>Still though, you couldn’t help but feel like you were being watched… After all, these woods were the Creature’s home. You think.
>It probably wants revenge for you encroaching on its territory, like some sort of savage!
>No way were you going to let it near you though. Not with the protection of your Father’s musket!
>One of your earliest memories was that of your father shooting a Redcoat in the chest. The bullet had created a hole the size of a fist in the Brit’s chest.
>You were fairly certain that it would do the same to the Creature. It better.
>Eventually, when the sun begins to creep down to the horizon, you quickly retreat to the inside of your home.
>Your door doesn’t lock, so you instead choose to push a table against it. It was better than nothing.
>After a quick dinner consisting of just some quickly roasted vegetables and some smoked rabbit meat, you climb into bed.
>You were tired after not getting any sleep the previous day, and you thought that maybe the creature would stay back for tonight. Yesterday night you seemed to have spooked it, so maybe it would think twice about coming back.
>It was probably just wishful thinking, but in your sleep-addled mind it made perfect sense.
>Just in case though, you keep your musket next to your bed again, still loaded and ready to go.
>You also elect to place a candle and the tinderbox on the floor near the musket. This time you wouldn’t have to fumble around looking for the two things.
>Yep. You’re ready for anything.
>As your head hits the pillow, the last rays of sunshine disappear.
>You’re too tired to be afraid, though… 
>It was a bit cool, but you didn’t bother getting under the sheets. You wanted to be unconstrained if anything suddenly happened.
>Satisfied with your current situation, you drift off into a deep sleep.

>You yawn, your eyes opening.
>Ugh, and you were having such a pleasant dream…
>Wait. What in God’s name is making that noise?
>You sit up a bit, swinging a leg onto the cold floor.
>You hear a strange noise, like something grinding against something hard... 
>It isn’t coming from the window at least. No, the noise it coming from near the front of your cabin.
>You stand up off of the bed, reaching down for the candle and tinderbox.
>You strike a flame, lighting the candle.
>Your heart drops into your stomach as you see the source of the news.
>Something’s at the door.
>Panic seethes through you as you watch the current situation unfold.
>Every few seconds, something slams against your door, the table being inched further away from the door with each impact.
>You struggle to hold in a scream as you see a clawed hand reach through the gap in-between the door and its frame.
>You fail miserably, letting out a fearful cry.
>For just a moment, the pounding stops.
>Just as you think you maybe scared it off, the pounding resumes, this time more forceful.
>Sweat beads on your forehead as a muzzle pushes its way through the door.
>You can hear it sniffing loudly, a smile on the Creature’s muzzle.
>It isn’t long before the door is flung open, the Beast stepping into the light of your candle.
>Oh. God.
>It stands at a monstrous 6’5”, even taller than your Father had been.
>The Creature has the appearance of a wolf, with dark grey fur and triangular ears.
>Shockingly, the creature is wearing simple clothing. A leather loincloth, along with a few bead necklaces and bracelets. Similar to what a tribal woman would wear.
>Most startling of all though, is the appearance of breasts on the Wolf.
>Good lord, It’s- SHE’S a female!

>Staring at you right in the eyes, the Wolfess smiles, her white teeth glinting in the flickering candlelight.
>Damn, you forgot all about your musket!
>You take a few steps back, reaching for the long wooden rifle.
>As your hand closes around it, you see the Wolfess’s head tilt, a curious smile on her muzzle.
>You hold up the musket as the Wolfess slowly advances towards you.
>Not taking the couple seconds it would have taken to aim, you squeeze the trigger, firing the 25 year old weapon.
>Of course, the shot goes wild, blasting a chunk out of the wall.
>Damnit!
>The Wolfess jumps a bit as she lets out a surprised yip, her eyes going wide.
>She looks at you with concern, her arms reaching out towards you as she quickly moves over to you.
>She was going to fucking murder you.
>You let the musket clatter to the floor as her clawed hands settle on your shoulders.
>To your surprise, she doesn’t immediately eviscerate you.
>Instead, she leans down a bit, sticking her muzzle into your hair.
>She sniffs deeply, inhaling your scent.
>She lets out a loud sigh, her tongue flopping out of her mouth.
>Oh God, She’s going to eat you!
>As if to confirm your fears, she gently holds your cheek, angling your face to look at her.
>Her tongue slides over your face, leaving a thin and sticky trail of her saliva.
>She pants like an excited dog, her tail shaking behind her.
>Good God, what is happening right now!?
>Her arms wrap around you, and she pulls you close, your face being pushed into her ample breasts.
>The hug seems to last forever, her wet nose poking and sniffing at your hair.
>You try to wiggle out of her grip, but it’s no use. The more you struggle, the tighter her hold on you gets.
>Eventually, she lets go of you.
>She lets out a strange noise, a twinkle in her eye.
>Her hands fall from your back, one of them loosely gripping your hand, intertwining her fingers with yours.
>She lifts her muzzle up, sniffing around at the room.
>Her eyes settle on the bed, and she gives you another toothy smile.
>Oh no.
>She walks over to your bed, dragging you along with her. The musket is left lying on the floor.

>With a soft *pomf*, she flops down onto your bed.
>You end up getting pulled into the bed next to her, face to face with the Wolfess.
>She pants in your face, her warm breath washing over your face.
>Her breath smells vaguely sweet, as if she had been eating berries recently.
>You try to pull away, but she throws one of her arms over you, pulling you against her soft body.
>She lifts one of your legs and locks it around you, effectively sandwiching you against her torso.
>Happily panting, the Wolfess rubs her head against you, her scent beginning to coat your body.
>She begins to alternate begin rubbing against you and licking your face, prompting you to try and escape her warm embrace.
>It’s no use though. Just like when you were standing up, whenever you try to wriggle away, the Wolfess only holds onto you tighter.
>Whether you like it or not, it looks like this is your life right now.
>You breathe a frustrated sigh as you stop struggling.
>The Wolfess lets out a happy whine as she realizes that you’ve stopped fighting her.
>She snuggles up close to you before she closes her eyes.
>Well… At least she didn’t try and kill you?
>Unless she’s just saving you for breakfast…
>Yeah, that would make for a fairly terrible morning.
>For now, you think the best course of action would to just play along with the Wolfess. At least until she falls asleep.
>If she wanted to sleep in your bed with you, then that’s what’s going to happen.
>You spend the next 10 or so minutes awkwardly laying there, trying to relax in her grip.
>It was just a -tiny- bit too tight to get comfortable… She must be really worried about you trying to leave.
>And she was right. The second she relaxes, you’re going to try and book it into the woods. No way are you sticking around here.
>Eventually, the candle finally burns out.
>Damn it! That was one of your last candles… They were pretty difficult to come by out here.
>Even worse, you’re fairly certain the Wolfess is asleep now, but her grip has not loosened at all.
>The darkness, warmth, and softness is beginning to take its toll on you too…
>You’re starting to get tired again.
>You try to do your best to fight off sleep, but it’s no use.
>Despite your best efforts, your eyes close and you don’t open them back up.
>Within minutes, you’re fast asleep, trapped in the caring embrace of the Wolfess.

>You’re woken up by something shaking you.
>By God, what the Hell!?
>Your eyes pop open, only to be met by the smug, amber eyes of the Wolfess.
>There’s a smile on her face as she sniffs the air around you.
>She's still holding you, preventing your movement.
>She leans in close to your ear, and whispers softly.
>You have no clue what in the world she's saying, but it doesn't sound threatening.
>The Wolfess wiggles against you, letting out a happy whine.
>After maybe 10 minutes of laying like that, she sits up.
>She let's go of you in order to stand up, but before you can even think of running, she reaches back down to hold your hand again.
>Your fingers become intertwined with her fuzz-covered digits, warming better than any pair of gloves could.
>The Wolfess gently pulls you to your feet, and out the door.
>Upon getting outside, she walks over to a firepit you had set up outside.
>She points one finger at you, and another at the fire. Does she want something?
>A flash of sadness comes across her face, and she pulls you in for another full-body hug, whining softly the whole time.
>A wet tongue drags across your forehead and cheek, before being dried by the Wolfess as she rubs her head against you.
>Reluctantly, she pulls away from you.
>Once more, she points to you and then to the fire. 
>She looks at you in the eyes as she backs away a bit, before turning her back entirely as she heads back into the woods. 

>You stand in your cabin, pacing around the wide room as you debate your next move.
>So, it was pretty obvious at this point that the Wolfess wasn't hostile towards you.
>In fact, she seemed almost motherly in the way that she paid attention to you.
>You had elected to put away your musket for now. You had already wasted the shot and powder with one missed shot, and you couldn't bring yourself to harm an intelligent creature that had shown you some degree of kindness.
>You still didn't know what exactly she wanted, but it was clear that she had no malicious intent. Or maybe she was just trying to lower your defenses…
>Either way, you had a choice to make.
>Make her leave, or let her keep doing what she's been doing?
>For now, maybe your best choice would just be to wait.
>It isn't long before you hear something stirring outside.
>A quiet whine followed by a loud bark.
>The muzzle of the Wolfess pokes through the door, and lets out a relieved sigh when she sees you standing there.
>She pushes the door open fully. Looking at her, you can see her holding something.
>In her clawed hands, you can see her holding a small cloth bundle.
>She gestures for you to follow her as she leaves the doorway.
>Curiosity filling your mind, you follow her outside. She’s squatting near the firepit, inspecting it.
>She points at you with an upset expression, before pointing back at the pile of half-burnt wood and ashes.
>Oh! She wanted you to light it! But why?
>You turn back to the door of your cabin, ignoring the confused bark the Wolfess lets out at you.
>After a few seconds, you return with your tinderbox.
>You take a couple small logs and toss them onto the cold ashes.
>She watches with great interest as you strike sparks onto the kindling, eventually succeeding in starting a fire.
>You sit down on an old log you used as a bench, while the Wolfess continues to squat across from you. Her tail wags behind her as the two of you watch the fire grow.
>The Wolfess alternates between watching the fire and watching you. She has a satisfied look on her face the entire time.
>When the fire grows large enough that you don't have to worry about it going out, the Wolfess turns to you with a toothy grin.
>She holds the cloth bundle out to you, shaking it a bit when you don't immediately take it.
>A bit hesitant, you hold out your hands.
 >With a reassuring smile, the Wolfess gently places the sack in your waiting grasp. It's heavier than you thought it would be.
>It's held together by a small length of jute string. You pull at the knot, untying the bundle.
>You unfold the cloth on your lap, getting a look at the gift the Wolfess has brought you.
>It's food!
>Inside the cloth lays a decent portion of meat that you recognize as version, a few pears, and several unshelled nuts. She brought you breakfast!
>You give her a warm smile, one she returns by excitedly panting and wagging her tail. It seems you've made her happy by accepting her gift to you.
>She abruptly stands up, rushing into the woods, only to return a minute or two later.
>She’s carrying a few long sticks, still green from the trees.
>Instead of sitting across from you like before, she plops down on the log right next to you.
>She pulls a small flint knife off of her waist, and starts to whittle the sticks into points.
>Reaching to your lap, she quickly grabs the venison and skewers it.
>With a smile, she hands a stick to you, keeping one for herself.
>You had never attended school, but it didn’t take a smart man to figure out what she wanted you to do next.
>Following her lead, you hold the sticks above the fire, watching the savory meat as it slowly roasted.

>Soon enough, the meat is adequately cooked. Well, at least enough to eat. The Wolfess seems to like hers a bit on the rare side. Though, what else would you expect from a Wolf?
>She doesn’t waste any time, raising the skewered meat to her mouth and chewing it off of the stick.
>You follow her lead, tasting the red meat.
>It tastes… Pretty alright. You haven’t had deer in a long time, and it tastes about the same as you remember.
>She did a good enough job of trimming the fat off, so there isn’t very much of a gamey taste.
>Along with the handfuls of berries and nuts, it make a decent breakfast. One of the best you’ve had in months if you’re being honest.
>Sadly, as pleasant as the meal is, it seems to disappear within minutes. At least it was nice and filling.
>You watch the Wolfess lick her fingers clean as she pops the last of her food into her mouth.
>She turns to you with a smile as you brush off your lap, standing up.
>Following your lead, she stands up next to you.
>Before you can say anything, she quickly pulls you into another strong hug, nearly crushing the air from your lungs.
>She gets really into it, even picking you up off the ground a bit as she sniffs at your hair and rubs her muzzle against your head.
>You try to voice your displeasure as she licks at your face, only for it to be muffled by her fluffy chest.
>You’re pretty much forced to inhale her exotic scent… Not that you mind much though. It smells… Comforting in a weird sort of way.
>After you let out a groan, the Wolfess seems to get the idea. She gently sets you back on the ground, giving you a chaste kiss on the forehead.
>As you try your best to rub the saliva off of your face, you notice the Wolfess turn on her heels and start to walk back into the forest, her tail wagging the entire time.
>She’s leaving?
>You try to call out to her, only to receive a small smile from her.
>She doesn't stop walking until she’s out of sight.
>You look back to where she was sitting with you.
>She left the cloth…

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>With a grunt, you drive your weathered axe into a log, cleaving it in two. Looking up at the sky, you can see the Sun starting to head towards the horizon.
>You lean the well-used axe against a stump, pausing to stroke your scraggly beard.
>After re-affixing your rabbit-skin hat, you pick up the split wood, eager to get it inside.
>It was a pretty cold day out, the ground still brushed with frost leftover from the morning.
>It’s been around nine months since you moved out to the Wilderness. Currently, it was mid-November
>Since then, you’ve made a lot of nice progress. You’ve got a decent cabin, a simple fence surrounding most of your claim, an outhouse, a cleared space for growing crops, and you’ve even cleared a small path to a small lake where you often found yourself fishing.
>Most important of all though, you’ve established a strong friendship with the local tribe of Wolves.
>Unbeknownst to you, your claim was on the very edge of their territory.
>At first, the only one to contact you had been a single Wolfess, but you later found out that she was only a “scout” of sorts, there to find out exactly what and who you were.
>After a few weeks of silently monitoring you, she had made the decision to greet you face-to-face.
>Although it began in confusion and fear, it ended the next day with a pleasant meal.
>She had told the rest of her tribe that you were a peaceful person, and a strong potential friend.
>You had decided to never inform her that you tried to shoot her only seconds after meeting her. Somehow you think that would be a conversation that wouldn’t go very smoothly.
>Since then, you’ve been sort of “welcomed” into their tribe. You weren’t an official member or anything, but you might as well be at this point. You see the wolves at least once a week now, and you’ve even managed to teach them some of your language, and they’ve taught you some of theirs’. It’s made communication a lot easier.
>You’re apparently a very popular person among them. Before you, they had never even seen a Human, let alone a creature that had no fur.
>The Wolf you see the most however, is that same Wolfess that you first met. The one who had cuddled with you against your will, and then shared a meal with you the following morning.
>You had learned that her name was Onatah.
>It seemed like she was at your cabin almost every other day, always eager to rub up against you and give you a few strong hugs.
>Lately though, Onatah had been… Distant.
>She hadn’t been around in over a week, which was pretty uncharacteristic of her.
>Well, the best you could hope for was her return. Maybe she was just feeling a bit ill…
>Next time you saw a Wolf, you would be sure to ask about her.

>You quickly close the door behind you, attempting to banish the chill from your hands by rubbing them together.
>Stepping over to the hearth, you feed the fire with a couple pieces of wood.
>Sitting on the hearth, you had some pemmican thawing. A gift from the Wolves. From Onatah to be specific. She had a habit of always bringing you bits of food.
>You pull over a chair to the fireplace, and take a seat.
>You had gotten a lot of work done today, and all you wanted to do right now was rest…
>Based on the sky and the humidity, you had a sneaking suspicion that it may rain tomorrow. If it was true, then you would have to stay inside all day. You didn’t want to risk getting sick.
>You knew that the Wolves had their own medicines that they could probably give you, but you didn’t want to take any chances.
>Besides. Having a day to relax would be good for you. It’s been a long year, and you deserved a bit of time to laze around.
>Picking up a warm chunk of pemmican off of the hearth, you bite into it.
>Not the best taste in the world, but it sure beats nothing.
>Yep. Things were looking good right about now.

>Soon enough, it gets dark enough outside to merit heading to sleep.
>With a sigh, you get into your sleepwear.
>Climbing into your bed, it was significantly warmer than it used to be.
>The Wolves had gifted you some large pelts last month, and they made a better blanket than anything else you had ever used. Wool be damned!
>Still, though... Something’s missing.
>Onatah would sometimes “accidentally” stay late into the night talking with you, and would then ask if she could spend the night.
>You could never say no to those cute amber eyes of hers.
>Whenever she held you tight as the two of you slept, everything just felt… Right.
>You don’t know what it is about her presence that’s so overwhelmingly soothing.
>You never felt as good as you did when she was around.
>Lying in bed, you remember all the times she would roll on top of you in her sleep, nearly suffocating her with her soft fur.
>Since it started getting colder, she had grown her winter coat.
>If you thought she was soft before, now it seemed like she was more fur than she was wolfess!
>At first, Onatah had seemed a bit shy about her level of fur, but after she realized you liked it, she was even more cuddly than usual. For the past month, almost every minute with her was spent held in her strong arms.
>If only she was here right now...
>You toss and turn around on your chaff mattress, trying to find a comfortable position to sleep in.
>Eventually, you manage to get comfortable.
>Without these pelts, you swear you wouldn’t get a lick of sleep. You don’t know how you managed it before.
>Closing your eyes, you do your best to try to fall asleep.
>You fall into a deep slumber, dreaming of a certain Wolfess…

>When you wake up the next morning, It’s to the familiar sound of rain bouncing off of your roof.
>Yep, it was raining alright.
>You get up with a groan, your feet landing on the cold wooden floor. The fireplace burned out overnight, and the rain had chilled the whole room.
>At least it was dry in here. You had that going for you.
>You quickly pull on some warm clothing made from pelts. Another gift from Onatah.
>Going over to the fire, you don’t waste any time lighting it.
>Almost instantly, you can feel the warmth filling the cabin.
>You’re pulling on your shoes when you realize you don’t have to do anything outside today.
>With a smile, you return to your bed, putting your sleepwear back on.
>If you were going to be stuck inside all day, you were going to be comfy, damnit!
>You make sure to keep one of the pelts on. It may be a -bit- warm, but it was better than the alternative of being just a -bit- cold.
>You sit at your table, and retrieve some jerky.
>It was a bit cold and hard, but that was all part of the fun.
>As you gnaw at the strip of meat, you gaze out of the fogged-up windows.
>You can’t help but wonder what Onatah was up to.
>Hunting, maybe? The tribe had a lot of mouths to feed…
>Maybe she was doing the same thing you were doing. Just sitting inside doing nothing.
>Maybe she was even wondering the same thing about you.
>The thought makes you smile.
>Kicking your feet up onto the table, you lean back in your chair, the wood creaking in protest.
>You turn to look at the fireplace, and gaze at the dancing flames, trying your best to pass the time.

>You’re in the middle of a daydream when a loud series of knocks interrupts you, nearly sending you toppling out of your seat.
>Before you can call out to whatever’s making the noise, the door flies open.
>Through your door trudges a soaked wolf.
>It’s thick gray fur is absolutely drenched, streams of moisture pouring down onto your floor.
>You’re not sure what to say until those familiar amber eyes stare right back into yours.
>It’s Onatah!
>Nearly falling out of your chair, you quickly stand up and walk over to her, offering her a pelt to help dry herself off.
>She’s shaking a bit, presumably from the cold. Did she walk all the way to your cabin through the rain?
>She gratefully takes the pelt, giving your forehead a lick in a classic tribal greeting.
>Breaking eye contact, she quickly shuffles over to the fireplace, sitting down on the floor in a pitiful, wet heap.
>She takes off her loincloth, setting on the floor next to her. Like usual, her nipples and loins were hidden behind her fur. Not that you were looking, or anything.
>It would be a bit sad if it weren’t so cute.
>She looks over at you with a whine, outstretching an arm at you.
>”Anon, sit with me?”
>She’s still shivering…
>With a warm smile, you walk over to her, giving her a couple pats.
>Her eyes close and a smile forms on her face.
>”T-thank you....”
>Taking the pelt, she tries her best to dry off her thick fur.
>It’s not much help, though… All she manages to do is get the pelt as wet as she is.
>You throw a couple more logs on the fire. That’ll help dry her off…
>You sit near her, asking her why she was here. You would’ve thought she wouldn’t be out in this weather.
>”Wanted to, ah, see you… Missed you.”
>Aw… That’s sweet.
>In response, you give her a few good scritches behind her large ears.
>She leans in your direction, tilting her head at you to give you better access.
>”Yeeesss… Keep scratching… Please...”
>Her tail thumps loudly against the floor, sending moisture flying in all directions. Under normal circumstances you’d be a bit upset about her getting your stuff wet, but you’ll let it slide in this case.
>Poor thing was soaked to the bone, and the last thing you wanted to do was make her uncomfortable!


>The two of you chat for awhile, catching up with each other.
>Suspiciously though, when you try to ask her why she hasn’t been up to see you, she dodges the question.
>You decide to drop it for now, but your curiosity is starting to gnaw at you…
>When she feels that she’s dried off enough, she asks for you to sit with her, patting the floor next to her.
>Sliding against her, you can feel that her fur’s still a bit damp… Just a bit, though.
>You lean against her, making her tail beat against the floor again.
>Her tail was dry now, if only because she wouldn’t stop wagging it.
>She grabs you with one of her hands, pulling you into her fuzzy lap.
>She leans forward, her arms wrapping around you and her muzzle resting on your shoulder.
>Her eyes close and she gently rocks back and forth.
>Occasionally, her tongue will dart out to lick your neck, but for now, she seems content with just cuddling.
>You sit on the floor with her, just silently relaxing by the crackling fire, listening to fat raindrops bounce off the cabin. You feel a remarkable sense of peace and comfort.
>It’s a good way to pass the time as she dries off.
>As she dries off more and more, you notice something strange…
>Her lap is surprisingly warm, and you don’t think It’s from the fire or from her fur…
>That and there’s a weird, unrecognizable smell in the air.
>It’s not a bad smell, just… Distinctly foreign.
>You break the silence, asking Onatah if she smelled anything.
>She just whines in response. Poor puppy!
>You reach up to pat her head, making her press her muzzle against you even tighter, her cold nose poking at your neck.
>Her hands close around your shirt, gently squeezing the fabric.
>She lets out another needy whine, prompting you to pet her again.
>Maybe some more ear scratches would do her some good.
>When you reach up and begin scratching at them though, It’s like setting a bomb off inside of her.
>”Ah~!”
>Her arms squeeze -tight- around you, nearly crushing you.
>She lets out a loud, happy whine, roughly licking your neck.
>She abruptly stands up, still holding you.
>You try to ask her what she’s doing, but It’s like she doesn’t even hear you.
>She eases you down into your bed, tightly gripping your shoulders so that you can’t get back up.
>An excited look on her face, she straddles you, her weight pinning you to the bed.
>She leans in close, dragging her long tongue all over your face and neck.
>When you open your mouth in protest, she wastes no time in dipping her tongue in to taste you.
>Within seconds, your lips are locked, her flat tongue filling your mouth as she passionately kisses you.
>Eventually, she has to pull away for air, your lips linked by a string of her thick saliva.
>She heavily pants, blowing warm air over you.
>You lay there in partial shock, not too sure what to think.
>Sure, you’ve thought of her in -this- way before, but you never thought to act on them…
>Unsure of what to do, you just lay there, staring into her eyes.
>Catching your gaze, she looks down at you with half-lidded eyes and a loving smile.
>”I, ah… Anon...  Love you… Love you, Anon…”
>She loves you?
>Onatah leans down to kiss you again, planting a kiss on your forehead.
>She doesn’t rise back up, instead settling the rest of her body on top of you.
>It’s weird… She feels way warmer than usual, even with her new winter coat… Is she sick or something? Is that why she’s acting like this?
>You manage to ask her if she's feeling alright, but she only whines at you. 
>”In heat… Wanted you…”
>Her head dips down, nestling against your shoulder as she whines. 
>”Please… Be mine? Be my mate?”
>What.
>Onatah continues to softly whine, her tongue occasionally darting out to lick and nibble at your ear.
>Her groin is pressed against yours, her warmth radiating into you.
>Even though there's a layer of cloth separating you from her, it's still enough to arouse you. You've never actually been with anyone before, and it immediately makes you nervous.
>You manage to free an arm, using it to gently pat her muzzle.
>The moment you touch her, she tenses up, letting out a quiet whimper.
>”Mmpf… Please? Please love me… Need your love, Anon… Only you…”
>Why does that make you hard?
>She must notice it too, as she starts to slowly grind against you, leaving a trail of moisture on your clothes.
>You pat her on the back, making sure to give her a couple scritches. You ask her to get up a bit.
>Slowly, she gets up on her knees, still straddling you but no longer pinning you down.
>She gives you that same look a dog that knows it's in trouble will give. It's pretty cute, and you can't help but give her a small smile.
>You let out a resigned sigh, telling her that you would try your best to help her out with her “heat” problem. You just ask her what she needed you to do. You already knew what her response would be though.
>She gives you a loving gaze as her tail thumps against the bed behind her. She leans in close to you once more, whispering.
>”I… I take the lead? Yes?”
>You nod to her, telling her you’ve never actually done this before.
>The second the words leave your mouth it’s like you’ve lit a fire inside of her. Her tail is practically pounding against the bed as her eyes light up with lust.
>”Anon... Neither have I…”
>Her hands rest on your chest, weakly trying to get your clothes off of you.
>”Please. Need you… Now.”
>Eventually she succeeds in pulling your clothes off, having you lay naked under her.
>There’s no need for her to do any prep work. She was already sopping wet, and her grinding against you got the job done.
>She unceremoniously drops her hips against yours, hilting you inside of her.
>The sensation hits you like lead shot, your eyes nearly popping out of their sockets.
>Shit!
>She was -really- warm, almost to the point where you were worried she might burn you in a sensitive area.
>And the tightness! Jesus! Her puffy triangular folds hugged your rod tight, almost like they were trying to squeeze the life out of you.
>Well, she was trying to squeeze something out of you, at least.
>She wastes no time, settling into a torturous pace, slamming against you with each thrust.
>Her eyes seem glazed over as she pulverizes your hips into the chaff mattress. Thank God you have those pelts covering the bed, or otherwise you don’t think you would’ve survived the current situation.
>If someone were watching, they would probably think Onatah was trying to murder you with how she’s acting.
>She loudly grunts with every slam of her hips, her face having an expression of absolute bliss.
>It isn’t long before she hits her limit, throwing back her head and loudly howling as her folds contract around you.
>The feeling is enough to send you over the edge as well, closing your eye and holding on to her fur for dear life as you pump directly into the deepest parts of her steaming cunt.
>Onatah nearly passes out on top of you, huffing loudly as she leans over you.
>She wraps her arms around you, pressing her body against yours.
>Instead of falling asleep though, she grins and winks at you.
>Before you even know what’s happening, she flips you over, with her on her back and you on top.
>She wraps her legs around your waist, smiling.
>”Ah~… Your turn, Anon~.”
>You look down at her, lust burning in your mind.
>Yeah. This was happening.
>She gives you a pleasured bark as you slowly begin to pump back into her.
>Her tail slapping against the bed under her, she pulls a pelt over the two of her, trapping your combined warmths under a warm shroud.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>You stack firewood in a cord, listening to your Wife splitting logs behind you.
>It's been over a year since you first made love to her.
>Since then, she's never left your homestead. After she proclaimed you her Mate, she refused to be separated from you.
>It caused some confusion among her tribe, but they eventually came to accept the fact that the two of you were together, linked together until the day you return to dust.
>Onatah wasn't like a normal housewife, not like a Human one would be.
>She insisted on helping you with work, wanting to do as the heavy lifting. You were happy to let her, as she was the stronger one between the two of you.
>Every night in bed you cuddled with her, sometimes brushing her fur, and sometimes just laying in her arms as she blew warm air over your hair. Either way, you were always comfortable.
>You stack up a particularly strange-shaped log, cursing when you get a splinter.
>Your Wolfess Wife immediately drops the axe, rushing over to you as you gently shake your injured digit.
>”Anon hurt?! Needs help!?”
>She gently holds your wrist, whining as she looks at the small injury.
>You smile. She had always been a bit overprotective of you. You thought it was cute.
>She lets out a loud cry, tears forming in her eyes as you pull the splinter out, a small drop of blood falling out of the wound.
>Onatah quickly grabs your hand, holding it up to her mouth. She does her best to lick the wound clean, much to your protest.
>When she’s satisfied with her work, she pulls you in for a tight hug, her warmth and scent permeating your body nicely.
>You lean your head against Onatah as she hugs you, eliciting another whine from her.
>You felt happy.
>Yep. Things had turned out alright for you.
>And that was all you had ever hoped for.
