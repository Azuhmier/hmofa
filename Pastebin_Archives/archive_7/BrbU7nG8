>The current pushes you gently as you swim upstream in the amazon.
>Piranhas and piranha anthros swim past you in thick schools, looking for an easy meal as you wave to them.
>Your rebreather bubbles softly as you swim quietly downstream, looking around and getting the occasional playful nip from a few of the local anthro gals who want attention.
>But you have other things to do here.
>You are Anon; Biology student extraordinaire, on a mission to capture a certain number of a freshwater stingrays
>the stingray in question has a venom that is known to help with a few nerve diseases.
>This expedition was one that was expedited and was "High priority" because some politicians' cousins started to suffer from one of the nerve diseases that the rays might help with.
>As such, you are swimming in one of the deepest parts of the amazon, linked to the modern world by nothing other than a Satellite phone that is solar powered.
>A few more "wild" anthros swim past you, eyeing you with innocent curiosity.
>It always did fascinate you how some Anthros could evolve similar to their more civilized cousins.
>In fact, the whole anthro-Animal evolution path was amazing!
>Somehow every species of animal diverged to have humanlike counterparts.
>Maybe evolution saw what humanity was doing and evolved a shortcut?
>But even then, seeing "feral" Anthros that choose to live wild and free was amazing!
>Like humans on that one island...What's its name?
>You shake your head and focus back on the clear water around you.
>A huge Arapaima Anthro lazily swims past you as you stop to tap on the screen of a waterproof tablet attached to your arm, then you show it to a few of the surrounding anthros.
>These anthros might be "feral" but if you show them a picture of what you're looking for, most happily point a direction out.
>The arapaima ignores you completely, however more than a few piranha anthros, a catfish anthro and even a VERY angry bull shark anthro point you in one direction.
>You smile under your rebreathers mask, nod and wave a few times to the local populace and swim in the direction they indicated.
>Things are going well, if you do say so yourself.
>It has been 3 months on the river and you've captured 25 males and 23 females.
>To have a full diverse population of animals you need 25 of both male and female.
>Of course, you could just quit and head back, phoning in your success in capturing "enough" stingrays.
>But no one got famous and funded with just "enough".
>As you swim slowly towards your final goal, hoping to find the last 2 female specimens you hear a loud shout that makes your heart drop.
>"CANNONBALL BITCHESSS!"
>Before you can react, an explosion of air bubbles and sound hits the surface of the water.
>Every anthro and aquatic creature scatters like a roach exposed to light, leaving you alone.
>Alone except you and your project partner.
>Chelsea Driftwood.
>She's been following you since her freshman year, always tagging along with you no matter WHAT you do.
>She's a Harbor seal anthro with little to no interest in anything you were doing here.
>Bubbles clear around her body,  curled up in a cannonball to reveal a toned, sleek body; covered in shallow rippling muscles from swimming her whole life.
>And of course she's topless, letting go of any sense of civilization, as per usual.
>As if totally unaware of her sudden cannonball she spins around quickly left and right, looking for anthros or any other creature to speak with.
>She has some kinda way to talk to aquatic anthros that makes you annoyed; because IF she used it to help you out, you would be totally set and back in civilization.
>Instead, she used all of her 4'8 self to annoy you; To throw wet towels and seaweed at you, scare off anthros, and eat all the food.
>As she spins around she spots you and smiles, revealing a predator's teeth.
>"HEYA ANON!" she yells into her communicator, waving enthusiastically in the clear water.
>You both have communicators to coordinate underwater, it was supposed to be to coordinate to catch the rays faster; instead she used it to bother you while you swam, oftentimes talking nonstop about a show she had been watching.
>Seriously, she talked you through an entire show called... ozark? osmith?...bismuth?
>You just wanted to catch these rays so you could continue researching them.
>Research is your best skill, but you NEED field hours for your degree.
>Incidentally, so did Chelsea; that's why she was stuck with you.
>The deal was you catch them, she keeps them alive, then you both get research grants.
>But she seemed more interested in sunbathing, swimming around topless, and smacking you with wet towels.
>None of the captured rays had died though; in fact most were getting bigger...
>Almost as soon as she spots you, she swims right into your face, a big grin on her muzzle.
>"Whatcha doin swimming around alone? You've been down here all day!" she happily chirps through the comms, a large smile on her muzzle, showing her large canines.
>"I "was" getting directions to the next stingray" you grumble through the mic in your facemask, pointing in a certain direction.
>Chelsea swirls around as graceful as a ballet dancer.
>"Directions from who? It's just me and you here" she asks, swirling around with her arms outstretched.
>Multi colored ribbons of fabric drift in the water behind her forearms, making her look like a cyclone of color.
>She says the ribbons help her with currents and movements of things in the water.
>"They totally help me sense sharks" she said once while drunk.
>You think she wears them to make herself look cool.
>"You scared everyone off with your cannonball Chelsea" you respond with an exasperated sigh "Again".
>Of course, She just laughs and swims around you; making you feel like a toddler learning to walk next to Usain Bolt.
>Her skill and grace in the water would have made her such a useful partner, if she just took it seriously.
>With a sigh, you surface and grab a railing on your boat, ignoring the dark shadow that is Chelsea.
>With Chelsea in the water, it would be tough to find one of your coveted stingrays.
>She was too loud, too noisy and too hyper.
>But... there was something to be said about her enthusiasm.
>Not once had she doubted that the goal would be reached.
>She hadn't let a captured ray die.
>And she didn't complain when partnered with you; unlike the others in your class.
>It turns out in a world of anthros, marine biology is a small field.
>They can just swim around.
>You pull yourself onto the boat that has been your home for the past few months, thinking about Chelsea as your wet fins slap against the boat deck.
>The amazonian air hits you as you pull off your rebreather, inhaling the fresh air deep.
>Nothing of civilization fills your lungs, just the purest air you've ever experienced in your life.
>You aren't surprised as you breathe deep and feel your boats slow engine chug along.
>On this kind of expedition, having a fast boat was not needed; so your boat has a slow engine that you could speed up as needed.
>As you take off your diving gear, a "reverse splash" of water plumes out of the river, followed by Chelsea flipping onto the deck of the boat with 2 large fish.
>"Anon! I caught dinner!" she yells boastfully as she pulls the two fish along behind her.
>"Yea you caught dinner" you respond looking at the red bellied fish she dragged up from the river, "but are they poisonous?"
>Chelsea's face goes from one of absolute triumph to one of unsure confusion as she looks at the still flopping fish on the deck of the boat.
>She looks at you and gives a very half hearted smile.
>"Yes mayyyyybeee?" she responds, grabbing the still flopping fish with a small paw.
>You walk across the deck of the boat, sure of your footing after months of wet slipperiness.
>"Yes you dork" you finally respond as you gently hold Chelsea's chin "These aren't poisonous"
>A large smile break's across Chelsea's muzzle as she smiles, looking up at you.
>After years of studying together in the states; and finally alone on the amazon, you and Chelsea had formed an unlikely relationship.
>YOU; the introverted, book smart guy.
>And HER; the social butterfly who just wanted to have fun.
>Doesn't matter now after months alone together in the jungle.
>She darts away as you grab the still wriggling fish to gut them and cook them.
>Fresh fish everyday beats rations, although sometimes you trade with the locals.
>"Looky! I learned!" Chelsea boasts and she dances along the deck of the boat.
>As you look up, a wet towel slaps onto your face with enough force to not be painful; but to be annoying.
>"Chelsea, if you want a good dinner, I can't have you pranking me now" you grumble as she dives back into the river with that same serene grace.
>Chelsea's head bobs above the waterline for a moment, looking at you with a guilty grin.
>"I got you" she states triumphantly.
>"You hit me with a towel while I started making dinner" you correct, holding up a half filleted fish "Guess you don't want me to finish cooking" you say, faking dropping the fish into the river.
>Chelsea darts forwards in the water to catch the fish, only to bonk her snout on the hull.
>For a moment, she spins in the water, holding her snout in her paws.
>"Owie! You Meanie! I donked my snoot" She whines as you continue gutting the fish, tossing the innards into the river.
>"You did it to yourself" you chastise as you put the fish onto a firewood grill.
>Yea, you might be on an expedition, but you aren't NOT going to cook the natural way.
>You had even traded for spices and herbs from locals along the river.
>The flesh of the fish hisses as it hits the grill, while you carefully monitor it.
>Out of the corner of your eye, you see Chelsea trying to be sneaky, quietly sneaking onto the deck of the boat
>One of her little habits is to try and spook you.
>It usually doesn't work, you swear!
>She just startled you...
>But this time you see her just out of the corner of your eyes.
>The wet ribbons drag behind her as she tries to tip-toe up behind you, her paws walking on the slick deck of the boat like it was dry concrete.
>Just as she pounces, you whip around and catch the tiny seal anthro in your arms pulling her close as she protests.
>She struggles weakly as you kiss her snout.
>"No! Ack Lemme Go! No More kisses" she protests weakly; trying to push you away from her.
>Her snout is her weak point you learned by accident.
>"Gonna sneak up but can't deal with the punishment for being caught" you chastise, holding the soaking wet seal as she squirms against you.
>"You...Weren't...Supposed to catch me" Chelsea grunts as she squirms against your grip.
>"Grab us both some towels, I can't make a good dinner all wet" you respond letting the little seal anthro go.
>"HAHA FREE" She yells as she darts out of sight below deck, water dripping behind her.
>As you flip the fish on the boat's grill,Chelsea emerges from below deck carrying several towels.
>"Got em!" Chelsea states triumphantly, lobbing a dry towel at you.
>You catch it with ease, and begin drying yourself around your wetsuit.
>Of course, you need to dry everywhere, even under the wetsuit.
>Do you dare leave Chelsea in charge of the cooking fish?
>A glance at her reminds you of something as she strips to dry her fur.
>You're in the middle of nowhere,surrounded by hundreds of miles of uninhabited jungles.
>The only ones who would see you are Chelsea; who had seen you naked dozens , and a few "feral" anthros.
>"When in Rome" you mumble, unzipping and sliding out of your wetsuit and draping it on the railing of the boat.
>You take a moment to relax, naked and let the golden sunlight rain upon your body.
>As you do, you hear a loud whistle from somewhere.
>You jump slightly and search for the culprit, only to spot a group of olinguito Anthro females hanging in a tree.
>Olinguito's are small, raccoon-like tree dwellers.
>At this point though, you don't care; Who are they gonna tell?
>Unfortunately though, Chelsea has also noticed the attention you're receiving.
>"HEY HEY MINE" She shouts to the female anthros, waving a towel frantically at them; only for them to move back slightly.
>"MINE!" they all mimic as she gets angrier at the crowd.
>You can see her visibly trembling in anger as she turns to you.
>"Fix this!" she yells at you motioning to the olinguito's who keep mimicking "MINE"
>In response, you walk up to her and bend down to kiss her gently, a hand gently gliding down to slide her wetsuit pants off of her.
>She breaks the kiss with a slight pant and a moan of "W-wha are you doing?"
>Your right hand snakes down her body, feeling every curve.
>"Fixing it" you respond as you kiss her once more.
>Chelsea's tongue darts into your mouth as you fight it with your own, her paws grabbing the side of your face.
>Your own hands slide up and down her naked body, cupping her grapefruit sized breasts and squeezing her thicc ass.
>Who would have thought that years of swimming would tone her body to look like one of the best models out there; although a bit shorter.
>All 4'8 of her body presses against you, melting into your arms as you kiss her.
>She breaks away from the kiss with her tongue partly out, panting "n-not fair"
>You hands grip her firm ass and you lift her up, letting her strong legs and tail wrap around you, settling against your growing member.
>"Totally fair" you respond, squeezing her ass and thighs gently, situating your shaft between her exposed folds.
>Chelsea wraps her arms around your neck, leaning forwards and pressing her breasts against your chest
>You smile, holding Chelsea close. 
>Once more you kiss her as she slides herself against you and uses one hand to position your now rock hard erection into her.
>She gasps into your ear, wrapping her arm around you once more as your thick member slides into her wetness.
>Her wet fur sticks to you as you kiss her and hold her up, gently thrusting into her.
>The two of you had never done it like this.
>Out in the open letting anyone who dared to see it, see it.
>"Sooooo big" Chelsea moans, as she pulls you into a kiss.
>You grip her thick ass and guide it as you thrust deep into her.
>Once more, she kisses you as you hear a "oooooh from outside the boat that you ignore, focusing on your love.
>Your hands hold her toned ass and guide it like she was just a thing to get you off.
>But She is so much more than that.
>You feel her heat, her want to get off, and her desire to satisfy you as your rock hard member buries itself deep into her silken folds.
>As you hold her up and kiss her, you feel her soft tongue in contrast to her teeth that can crush bone.
>Her deep moans into you, her desire to just BE with you.
>you continue supporting her body, thrusting hard into her as she wiggles a bit to free her chest.
>"S-suck on one " She half demands half begs; lifting herself slightly so her generous chest is pressed to your face
>You oblige, working your face to the nearest nipple and biting it gently between your teeth and you shove your member into her.
>Chelsea gasps hard as you do, pulling you closer to her as you gently bite and suck on her breasts.
>Her wetness envelops you, tightening with each thrust as you set her ass on the railing of the boat.
>Free from having to hold herself up, Chelsea's legs instead wrap around your midsection.
>Chelsea's paws wrap around the back of your head as you focus on one of her breasts, sucking and teasing her nipple.
>You hold her thick body against yours, thrusting into her heat as she moans happily into your ear.
>A sudden spasm of tightness from her makes you gasp in want, feeling her tightness around your member suddenly double.
>"A-anon I- i'm gonna c-c-cum" Chelsea moans as you continue nibbling her soft nipple and thrusting into her sopping wetness.
>"N-No slow down! I'M g-gonna" she pleads as you speed up, forcing yourself deeper into her.
>"A-Anon I'm CUUUUU-" Chelsea cries as a gush of fluid spray against you, drenching your thighs and running down your legs.
>You don't stop or slow down, feeling spurred on by her spontaneous climax
>Her legs lock around your back as you keep thrusting into her.
>"Chelsea i'm c-close" you grunt through clenched teeth.
>"Y-yes Love, fill me p-please" She begs as you thrust your rock hard member into her, her arms wrapped around your head.
>With a sharp thrust into her, and her tightening her legs around you, you fill your beloved with your love,
>You release her nipple with a slight pant, feeling a bit out of breath from thrusting and sucking.
>Chelsea leans back on the boat railing, her leg spread wide.
>"G-geez anon if I wasn't on the pill you would’ve knocked me up" she gasps.
>As you go to give her another kiss, a loud cheering is heard.
>You look around to see several tribe of feral anthro cheering on your love making
>"NO! no no no no!" Chelsea yells before disappearing below deck, trying to cover herself, leaving you with the still cheering crowd.
>Why feel embarrassed?
>You instead bow to your audience, earning a louder out cry.
>You don't know why they are cheering.
>All you know is after all that, this river is wild.
