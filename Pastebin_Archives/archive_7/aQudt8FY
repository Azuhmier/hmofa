GET READY

>Be Anon
>You were 17, standing at a height of 5'9".
>Tfw no gf
>You were a straight B- student, currently in your 3rd year of High School.
>Your teacher was right in the middle of a lecture on cell biology, but you weren’t paying attention right now. That (literal) old goat wouldn’t notice anyways.
>Currently, you had other things on your mind.
>For example, Prom was in a few weeks and you still had no idea what you were going to do.
>You had never been to a school dance, but your parents were really pressuring you into going.
>The problem was that you didn’t have a girlfriend. Hell, you couldn’t even make eye contact with another girl without getting embarrassed, let alone ask one out.
>You didn’t even know any girls that might say “yes” to you if you asked them out. You were a bit of an oddity, being one of the few Human students in a mostly Anthro district.
>You really didn’t like your chances of getting a date when most of the females in the immediate area weren’t the same species as you.
>You sigh, tapping your pencil against your chin.
>It could be worse, though. At least you had friends.
>Speaking of which…
>You glance behind you, looking at the Wolf woman seated behind you in the next row over.
>She notices you looking at her, and gives you a small smile.
>That was Ruby, your best buddy. You had known each other since you were little. You lived on the same block, and had been the best of the friends since even before the two of you could talk.
>She was one year older than you, putting her in her senior year.
>Initially, you had debated asking her to the Prom. But in the end, you had decided against it.
>After all, she had always been your friend, and you didn’t want to make things weird between the two of you by injecting romance into your friendship.
>She mouths the words “What?” to you, but you just shrug and turn back around.
>You were going to head back to your place with her after school and hang around. Maybe play some vidya.
>Maybe you would talk to her about Prom later. Maybe.

>Be Ruby.
>You were an Anthro Wolf with light gray fur with little patches of white on your face and belly.
>You were 18, and stood at a height of 6’2”.
>You were Anon’s best friend in the whole world, and you knew it.
>You… want him as more than a friend, though.
>Ever since your body started going through “changes”, you’ve always sort of had the hots for him.
>God, it was just EVERYTHING about him that -really- got to you… His face, that way he always smiles at you, and most of all, his scent…
>You may or may not have stolen one of his shirts a few months ago. You couldn’t help it. His scent was so nice, that you HAD to have it next to you when you slept… You couldn’t get to sleep any other way. Hopefully someday you’ll have the real thing next to you when you sleep, and not just some old shirt of his.
>You gently bite your pencil as thoughts about Anon swirl through your head.
>Damn… Too bad Anon was oblivious to your feelings towards him. Either that or he was really good at hiding his thoughts.
>He had turned back to look at you, but didn’t say anything.
>Did that mean anything? Did he like you? Did he hate you?
>Damn. You didn’t even know if he liked Anthros or not.
>He had never even mentioned girls that he liked to you, come to think of it…
>Fuck! What if he’s gay or something!?
>You close your eyes, doing your best to dispel the thoughts.
>No… You were pretty certain he liked women. You would never forget the time you had taken a peek at his internet history one time when you were at his house.
>Anon really needed to learn to use incognito mode. Or at the very least, just delete his browser history.
>Sadly, it seemed he was a fan of 3D Human women. What a degenerate.
>Still though, there was a chance for you two!
>Prom was coming up, and you were just waiting for him to ask you to it… He would pull through and ask you out. Right? Damn! If only you weren’t so shy… Then you would ask him out in a heartbeat.
>You’re just afraid of what would happen if he refused your advances. The last thing you would ever want was for your friendship to be broken up.
>Suddenly, the bell rings out, startling you.
>It catches you so off guard, you actually bite your pencil in half.
>Well… Unlike Anon, pencils can be replaced.
>You grab your books, and stand up, rushing over to the door where Anon is waiting for you.
>He gives you one of those heart-melting smiles as the two of you walk together to your next class.
>Yeah… You were going to be together forever. Even if he didn’t know it yet.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>Be Anon
>Currently, you were getting your ass kicked in Street Fighter by Ruby.
>You had accused her of button-mashing, but she only laughed, saying you needed to “get good”.
>After she gets a few perfect matches against you in a row, you set down the controller in frustration.
>She smiles, giving you a playful nudge.
>”Hey… Don’t worry, Anon. None of my brothers can beat me either. I guess fighting is just in my blood, you know? Even if it is virtual.”
>She points your claws at you in a mock threat, growing through an uncontrolled smile.
>You can’t help but smile back as she busts up into laughter. You could never stay mad at her…
>The two of you decide to take a break from the vidya, instead settling to just chat about school for awhile.
>After all, what teen didn’t take every opportunity to shit-talk his peers and teachers in private? It was just normal Human nature. Maybe not Anthro nature though, because you can’t help but notice that Ruby seems a bit distracted.
>She’s staring right at you as you talk, but It’s like she’s not listening…
>She seems to snap out of it though when you tap her on the paw though, making her flinch and let out a small yip.
>She can only give you a sheepish smile.
>”Um, sorry Anon… Just, ah, a bit distracted I guess.”
>You raise an eyebrow, asking her what was on her mind.
>”Oh, you know… Just… School stuff. Like Prom and stuff.”
>”Um… By the way…”
>She gives you a blank look, her face unreadable.
>”What are your, um, plans for Prom? You got any idea of who you’re going to ask to go with you?”
>You frown as you let out a deep sigh.
>To be honest, you didn’t think you were planning on even going… You had no clue of who you were going to ask out, and you didn’t want to be one of those guys who just uncomfortably walks around the room while everyone else has a girl on their arm.
>You didn’t know. Maybe it just wasn’t for you.

>One thing’s for certain though. Ruby looks pretty unsatisfied with your answer, her ears flat against her head while she frowns.
>”Well… It’s your choice I guess…”
>”There’s… Nobody you think that would say “yes” to going out with you?”
>Hm. There were certainly a couple people who you think would accept your offer.
>One of the Bunny sisters for sure, but that’s only because they were all sluts.
>Maybe that one Panther girl that you’ve caught looking at you a couple times?
>Nah… She was a damn psycho based on what you’ve heard about her.
>Overall, you can’t think of anyone you could ask that you would enjoy spending time with. You wish you were better with women.
>Internally, you always thought of asking out Ruby, but there was no telling how she would react.
>Maybe she would say yes, but what if she said no!? What if she laughed at you?!
>Yeah, it was best to play that one safe…

>Be Ruby.
>God fucking DAMMIT.
>First you had upset Anon by creaming him at Street Fighter, and then you had spaced out while he was trying to talk to you!
>Shit, it wasn’t your fault that the couch smelled so much like him! Sometimes you just got lost in the feeling of inhaling his scent…
>Even worse, no matter how much you hinted at him asking you out, he just wouldn’t go for it…
>Was he really that oblivious, or did he just flat out not like you?
>Fuck…
>Either way, it was making you a bit misty-eyed.
>You look away from Anon for a short moment and blink rapidly, preventing any real tears from forming.
>You couldn’t let this get you down! You didn’t want Anon to see your tears.
>If Anon thought you were weak, he wouldn’t take you as a mate!
>You didn’t know how it worked in Human cultures, but that’s certainly how it works among your fellow wolves.
>It was best to be careful, just in case.

>You stand up, stretching a bit.
>”Anon, you mind if I grab something out of your kitchen? I’m starving…”
>Maybe a quick bite to eat would take your mind off of things. Anon’s parents always had some tasty shit in their house.
>Anon smiles (yes yes yes!), and tells you to feel free to take whatever looks good.
>You just grab some half-stale pretzels, munching on them.
>Anon follows you to the kitchen, and stands next to you.
>You make sure to “accidentally” make your tail brush up against him.
>You had to make sure that your scent was on him. Not enough to be very noticeable, but subtle enough that other Anthros would back off. Anon was YOURS and ONLY yours.
>Seeing him standing right next to you, It’s just too much. You can’t help but try and talk to him some more.
>Well, you might as well go all in on this next one…
>”So, uh, Anon.”
>He looks attentively at you, clearly waiting for you to continue.
>”You, um, like anyone at school?”
>He shrugs, telling you there weren’t even any Human women enrolled in the school. At least none that he liked.
>Ouch.
>”What about… Anthros? You, uh, ever thought about broadening your horizons?”
>The second the sentence leaves your mouth, you regret it
>While you're busy sweating bullets, Anon seems to be pondering the question.
>You’re thankful that Anthros can’t visibly blush, because you’d be more red than an over-cooked lobster right about now. Fuck, why did he have to smell so -GOOD-?
>After an awkward moment of silence spent pondering whether or not to throw yourself out a window, Anon answers the question.
>He says that while he thinks Anthros are pretty okay, and some even look pretty good, he’s never given it any serious thought.
>He continues, saying that he would basically accept any affection regardless of what species it came from. Anon says that he pretty much only has two standards when it comes to women: They have to be a woman, and they have to be alive. Other than that he says, everything is fair game.
>You can’t stop your tail from wagging.
>Sure, you were a bit sad that he hadn’t taken the hint (again!), but this had opened the door to a new discussion…
>You just hoped he wouldn’t take it the wrong way. Or the right way. Okay, this was probably a bad idea, but you’ve come this far so why not?
>”Well… You didn’t hear this from me, but from what I’ve heard, most Human men seem to actually prefer Anthros to Human women.”
>He raises an eyebrow at you, asking you why that was.
>IT’SHAPPENING.jpg
>”Um… Well, for one thing, we have fur. Nice to touch, I suppose.”
>”We’re usually more loyal… Unlike most Humans, many Anthro species mate for life. For a lot of us, we permanently bond to the first person we’re intimate with.”
>”Oh! And I’ve also read that we smell nice? To Humans, I mean. Something about the natural oils in our fur or something…”
>Anon seems to stop and mull over your words, staring off into space.
>While he thinks, you close your eyes for a moment, happy that he hadn’t realized the extent of your power-levels.
>It was also good to know that he hadn’t discounted Anthros as not being suitable for dating.
>If he hasn’t thought about it seriously, then that means there was still a chance for the two of you.
>And a chance was all you needed.


>Be Anon
>Currently, you were thinking about the things Ruby had just told you.
>In truth, you had never given Anthros much thought as being romanceable.
>You’ve never had much (or any) luck with women… Maybe the problem was the species you were going after? If what Ruby said was true, then Anthros made a pretty good case for dating material.
>You turn back to watch Ruby as she stood in your kitchen, munching on some old pretzels.
>She was smiling, her tail brushing against your leg as it wagged.
>She turned to you, still grinning.
>”Well… I guess you just never know, huh Anon?”
>She shifts, setting the bag of pretzels down and walking with you back out to the living room.
>As she plops down onto the couch, you sit down next to her, still watching her as she continues to speak.
>”This was… Fun. It’s always nice hangin’ out with you, Anon.”
>She sighs, leaning back in her seat and putting her hands behind her head as she relaxes.
>She takes a quick peek at you, before shutting her eyes and facing the ceiling.
>Ruby yawns, her tongue curling in classic canine fashion.
>”Hm. I think I might head home soon… I’m getting kinda tired. Gotta study for that test tomorrow, too.”
>Shit, you’d forgotten about that test…
>With a groan, she begrudgingly stands up, stretching as she walks to the door.
>She looks back at you with a gentle expression, a smile on her face.
>”Text me or something if you wanna talk later, alright Anon? Anything to get out of doing homework, heh.”
>You assure her you would. You might have some questions about studying later on. She had always been smarter than you, and she understood the material in class a bit better than you did.
>She raises an eyebrow at you, before leaning in for a quick hug, patting you on the back a couple times.
>”Well, I’ll see you later Anon!”
>As she walks to her car, she turns her head around, giving you one last wave.
>You shut the door as you hear her car’s engine start, moving over to the window.
>As you watched her pull out of the driveway and drive off, you frowned.
>You hoped she was feeling okay. She had seemed a bit… Unfocused. Like she was thinking about some stressful, horrible thing.
>You try to forget about it for now, going back and sitting on the couch.
>Ruby had left some of her fur on the couch. You sigh, knowing that your parents were going to make you clean it up.
>For now though, you just wanted to relax.
>That and maybe check out what all the fuss about Anthros was really about…
>You knew a couple less than kid-friendly websites that might give you an insight or two.

>Be Ruby
>The whole time you were driving back to your home Anon had been on your mind.
>Your heart was pumping fast, and you were exhilarated that Anon had seemed to finally show some degree of interest in Anthros.
>When you got home, you had ignored the calls of your parents, instead rushing up to your room and locking the door.
>You immediately logged onto your laptop, frantically opening up 4chan and navigating to your favored /BRED/ thread.
>There were the usual >tfw no human bf posts, along with those of a dog girl frantically asking about dealing with her heat when she around her Human friend. Someone had also posted a video of a Great Dane getting mated by a Human. You may just save that video… For “research” purposes, of course.
>For now though, you just wanted to “satisfy” your urges.
>You had just come off of your heat last week, and you were still a bit antsy.
>To be more specific, you still had the urge in the back of your mind to jump Anon every time you caught a decent whiff of his scent.
>You lay back in your bed, laptop by your side.
>You close your eyes, and think of Anon while your hand drifts below the blanket…
>You were 18 now, and your parents were already pressuring you to meet a nice boy, as was traditional in most wolves when they came of age.
>Fuck that, though! You didn’t want some retarded furboi! You wanted Anon!
>And by God, no matter what happens, you were going to have him!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>Be Anon.
>It’s been a few months since you started college, your plan to major in Geology going well.
>It was Sunday, and you didn’t have any classes today.
>Neither did your best friend, so she decided to go ahead and spend the day with you in your dorm room.
>You had picked out some shitty Rom-Com to watch, one of your favorite activities being to critique and joke around about bad movies.
>This one was no exception. Why they had decided to try and make a romantic spinoff movie of Slaughter-Sphere, you would never know...
 >There’s a loud snort from next to you as a particularly bad line is delivered.
>”Heheheh! Who the hell wrote the script for this garbage? I’ve seen fanfiction with better plot than this!”
>You turn to look at her.
>Ruby was in her normal attire, some worn-out jeans she’s been wearing for the past several years, and some generic video-game t-shirt.
>Lucky for the two of you, both of you had ended up going to the same college.
>Even luckier, the on-campus dorms were co-ed.
>Luckiest of all, her room happened to be right next to yours, allowing you to hang out almost every time the two of you didn’t have class at the same time.
>All in all, it was a pretty sweet setup. 
>Ruby turned to face you, a smile on her face.
>She had been so worried the year she went off to college while you were still a senior, worried that the two of you would fall out of contact.
>If anything though, it just made your bond even stronger when you finally got to meet up again.
>You smile back, before the two of you focus back on the movie.
>Life felt good right now. Regardless of everything going on in your life, what with the hectic schedule of college life, the stress of having to find a job, and the just weird feeling of being an adult now, you felt genuinely relaxed for a change.

>As the movie drags on, you lay back against the small sofa the two of you were sharing, not much room to spare between the two of you.
>Ruby’s ear flicks as she turns to look at you.
>”Gettin’ tired, Anon?”
>Before you can respond, she leans back too, her shoulder rubbing against you.
>”Me too. This flick sure is dragging on, huh? But don’t fall asleep just yet! There was, uh, some more stuff I wanted to do with you...
>The two of you had spent most of the day hanging out, with the movie being a way to cap everything off. Too bad it was boring as hell when the awkward dialogue wasn’t making you laugh.
>You look at Ruby, asking her what else she wanted to do. It’s not like you could get up to much in here other than watch movies, look up stupid shit on your crappy laptop, or talk shit about other people in your dorm (some things never change).
>She seems to ponder the question for a few moments, a blank look on her face as she stares off into space.
>Just as you’re about to give her a quick nudge, her head snaps to look at you, an excited look on her face.
>”I know! The one thing every group of retarded kids in college movies do. Truth… Or Dare!”
>You groan, letting her know that it didn’t seem like the most fun idea. Especially when you were half-asleep and hungry.
>She frowned a bit, before giving you those puppy dog eyes that every canine seemed to always do when they didn’t get their way.
>”Aw, come on, Anon… Please?”
>She completes the act by folding her ears back, and even quivering her lip a bit.
>Dammit, why did it have to be so effective!?
>You close your eyes for a moment, letting out a sigh.
>You tell her that fine, you’ll play along. Only for a couple rounds though. You wanted to get some studying in tomorrow and you didn’t want to stay up too late.
>In an instant, her frown disappears, and her hands audibly clap together. Ruby shifts a bit, sitting on her knees as she faces you on the couch. Her tail swishes behind her, rubbing against the cheap sofa fabric.
>”Great! Do you mind if I start us off?”
>She stares at you with an eager expression, making it impossible for you to say no. You tell her that it’s fine.
>”Okay… So. Truth or Dare, Anon?”
>You decide to start off easy. Truth.
>She smiles at you, seeming to consider your answer.
>”Hmmm… Alright! We’ll start easy.”
>”So! Anon. Who’s your best friend in the whole world~?”
>You roll your eyes, pointing at Ruby as she stares at you.
>She lets out a small chuckle.
>”Heh. You’re goddamn right, Anon. Okay, my turn!”
>You slowly as her Truth or Dare, to which she replies “Dare.” before you even finish the phrase.
>Mulling over a few ideas, you decide to be lenient. It -is- only the first round, after all.
>You give her a simple task, daring her to go grab you a Dr Pepper™ out of her mini-fridge back in her room.
>She looks at you with a slightly annoyed expression, letting out a huff of warm air through her nose.
>”That's… That's not really much of a dare, Anon.”
>Shrugging, you tell her that you were thirsty. The only thing that could quench your thirst was the classic taste of an ice cold Dr Pepper™, the tastiest beverage known to mankind.
>”Well, if you’re going to make me go get you a drink, do you mind coming with me?”
>In response, you stand up, the only answer she needs.
>As the two of you exit your dorm room, you lock it behind you, before walking the whole 10 feet journey to her room just next to yours.
>When she opens the door and the two of you walk in, you’re met with the familiar scent of her fur. It was a smell that evoked good feelings, like that of a childhood blanket or stuffed animal. Either way, it just made you feel comfy.
>You take a seat on her bed, Ruby being too cheap to shell out money for a sofa. Ruby reaches into the small mini-fridge (which probably cost more than most of your cheap ikea furniture combined), and pulls out a small metal can of the precious liquid.

>Be Ruby.
>Holy shit, holy shit, holy SHIT!
>You were in a situation that you’ve only dreamed of before today.
>You had Anon. In your room. On your bed. Playing Truth or Dare.
>True, in your fantasies he was usually wearing less clothing right now, but this was good enough for now.
>As he sips on his pop, you ask him if he wants to tell a truth, or do a dare next.
>Like before, he says “Truth.”
>Your tail starts to uncontrollably wag once more as you think of all the potential things you could ask him, ranging anywhere from pure and clean, to lewd and degenerate.
>You decide to go for the middle ground, asking something that (hopefully) he wouldn’t misconstrue.
>”So… You, uh, got an eye for any girls on the campus?”
>He stares at you for a couple seconds, making your heart quicken.
>Sadly, he doesn’t give some heartfelt confession like he always did in your dreams and fantasies.
>No, he only says that he hasn’t really focused on dating anyone, or even making an attempt to meet anyone. For now he says, he’s fine with you being his best (and only) friend on campus.
>It’s enough to make your heart sting, knowing that you were his only real friend…
>On a lighter side, it’s not like there was anyone to steal him away from you. It might be a little mean to think that way, but fuck it. Anon was YOURS, and anyone who thought otherwise could talk to your fists and claws.

>Be Anon.
>Ruby had reacted a bit strangely to your answer, her tail going limp and her expression hardening a bit.
>You hope you didn’t upset her… She always did seem a bit concerned about your personal well-being, even more so than your family at times.
>Not wanting her to dwell on your answer for too long, you get right into it, asking her if she wanted to tell a truth or do a dare.
>”Dare. Just please don’t make me get you another soda… Gimme something good!”
>Well, alright…
>You ask her the first thing that comes to mind.
>You dare her to howl.
>Immediately, Ruby tenses, looking a bit embarrassed or unsure.
>”W-Wait, you want me to howl? Right now…?”
>You smile, telling her to just do it out of the window or something. 
>”O-okay, Anon.”
>Ruby slowly moves to the window, pulling it open. She looks back at you for a moment, then sticks her head out of the window.
>She starts out with a low cry, before working her way up to a genuine, melodic howl.
>In the distance, you can hear other canines replying to the call, the still evening air being filled with the harmonization of around a dozen wolves. It's quite pleasant. You wish you would have recorded it.
>After a few minutes the noise dies down, and Ruby silently shuts the window, before sitting next to you on the bed.
>You tell her that you thought the howling sounded beautiful.
>Ruby shyly looks away from you, but she can't hide her wide smile.
>”O-oh, it was nothing… I don't howl a lot, so I was a bit rusty…”
>You give her a reassuring pat on the back, causing her to let out a satisfied sigh.
>”Ah… Truth or Dare, Anon?”
>You pick “Dare” this time.
>Ruby looks at you with a mischievous grin, rubbing her hands together.
>Oh no. You knew that look.
>”I dare you to pet me!”

>What.
>Ruby gives you a sly look, presenting the top of her fluffy head to you.
>”Come on, Anon… Just go ahead and dig your fingers in there.”
>This was… Different. You had expected her to dare you to do something dumb, like pour water on your head.
>Ruby notices your hesitation, raising her head to look at you with a warm smile.
“Aw, don't worry Anon… It's just a bit of petting. Come on, it'll be nice. You get to touch my soft fur, and I get to feel those hands scratch at my head.”
>”I know you Humans don't really have a reaction to head scratches, but let me tell you. You're missing out big time.”
>She gently grasps one of your hands, slowly moving it up until it rests on her fuzzy head.
>Soft!
>Ruby looks at you with a small smile, encouraging you to start moving your hand around.
>As you start to give her the GOOD pets and scritches, she practically melts, one of her hands gripping your shoulder to support herself.
>She lets out a pleased groan as your fingers work your way into her fur, rubbing and scratching everywhere you could reach.
>When you hit her ears however, she flips out, sitting up as straight as a board before melting over you, laying her head on your shoulder and mumbling words of praise to you.
>Just when you’re about ready to stop though, something sparks inside of her.
>Ruby pulls her head back a bit, a glint in her eye.
>”A-Anon… I changed my mind. I want you to do a Truth.”
>You don’t really think you have a choice in this matter, so you just nod.
>”Why… Why have we never gotten together?”

>Fuck. That was a question you weren't prepared for…
>Ruby uncomfortably wrings her hands, staring at you as she waits for an answer. 
>Too bad you can't give her one…
>Seeing your hesitation, she speaks up.
>”Come on, Anon… I know you've never dated anyone. Neither have I…”
>As she talks, she scooches closer to you, putting an arm around your shoulders as her muzzle rests to your chin.
>”I like you, Anon. I like you a lot… And I know you like me. I think. So why aren't we together?”
>You can only sigh in response, patting your best friend on the back. You tell her that you've honestly thought about it in the past, but never asked her out of fear that you would end up souring your friendship.
>Ruby lets out a quiet growl, laying back in her bed. She doesn't let go of you, and so you're dragged down with her.
>Laying side by side, she turns her muzzle to look at you in the eyes. Then she gives you a quick smooch on the lips.
>Almost immediately, she freaks out, frantically apologizing and saying she got carried away.
>She curls up into a miserable ball of floof, covering her eyes as she whines.
>You only smile, patting her on the head again.
>In an instant, she perks up again, rolling over so that she's laying on top of you, a salacious look in her eyes.
>Once more, she loses all confidence, burying her muzzle into the crook of your neck.
>As she lays there, she whispers softly into your ear.
>”Please, Anon… Can we? I… I want my first time to be with you.”
>You keep petting her, running your fingers through her luxurious coat.
>You whisper back, telling her that if she really wanted, you were willing to go all the way with her. You warned her though, telling her that you were a bit… Inexperienced.”
>Ruby perks up yet again, sitting up with a smile on her face.
>”Really?! Oh, thankyouthankyouthankyou Anon!”
>Before you can reply, she dives back down, meeting you with a kiss. 
>You gasp in surprise, only for her tongue to dig inside of you, exploring every part of your mouth she can reach.
>Her eyes close, her hands cupping your head as she passionately kisses you. 
>When she pulls away, it's only to breathe, taking in a big gasp of air before plunging back in.
>Around 10 or 15 minutes later, after a make-out session that's made you harder than a horny toad, Ruby starts to slowly pull her clothing off, staring intensely into your eyes.
>”Don't worry, Anon… I'll take the lead… I've done a lot of, um, research…”
>You try to shuck off your own clothing, only for Ruby to stop you.
>”N-No! Uh… I, um, want to do it. I'll take them off for you…”
>True to her word, she slowly peels you out of your clothes, barely being able to keep herself from drooling as she exposes more and more of your skin.

>When she finally pulls off your boxers, your dick now bobbing freely around, she can't help but give it a quick sniff.
>You let out a small yelp as you feel her cold nose press against your balls, Ruby letting out a pleasured groan as she takes in your scent straight from the source.
>The attention is really getting to you, and when her tongue darts out to lick at your shaft, it's almost enough to make you pop, your shaft twitching. 
>Ruby must notice this, as her expression softens. She looks up at you with a reassuring smile.
>”Don't worry, Anon… I'll be gentle. Most of the time.”
>And with that, she immediately shoves her muzzle down into your groin, your throbbing cock disappearing down her throat.
>OH FUCK, NOT GENTLE! NOT GENTLE!
>Ruby runs her tongue all around your shaft, drool leaking out from around her lips.
>You try to pull away, but it's too late.
>Your eyes close, letting out a loud groan as you fill her cheeks with your cum.
>Ruby’s tail happily swishes behind her as she swallows every last drop, gently licking at your tip to coax out every last drop.
>When she's finished, your refractory period beginning, Ruby sits back up and stares at you as you lay there, an intense look of passion in her eyes.
>As you look into each others’ eyes, Ruby suddenly gets a mischievous smile, straddling you.
>You warn her that you're going to need a bit of time before you're ready again, but she shakes her head at you, her smile becoming sinister. 
>”Oh, don't worry… I've got something we can do in the meantime. You said you were hungry earlier, right?”
>Confused, you tell her that you recall saying that, yes.
>As she slowly scooches up your body, you begin to get the idea.
>”Well, I've got something you can snack on~!”
>Soon enough, her burning hot slit is hanging right above you, her juices dribbling down and rolling off of your face.
>Ever so slowly, she eases her hips down until she's fully rested on top of you, your face buried in wolf cunny and fur.
>Ruby snickers above you, wiggling her hips around.
>”Well? You said you were hungry, Anon.”
>She gently holds your hair, holding you close to her sex.
>”So… Eat up, Anon~!”

>You stare directly at Ruby’s slit, slick with her juices as it hovers right in front of you.
>Ruby lets out a quiet whine, wiggling her hips at you.
>”W-Well? Don't just stare at it…”
>That's really all the motivation you need.
>You press your lips against her, your tongue darting out to rub at her folds.
>You’d never really done this before, but like Ruby, you had done a lot of “research”.
>As you make contact with her sex, Ruby lets out a quiet gasp, her whole body shivering. 
>She eases a bit more of her weight down onto you, trapping you in-between the sheets and her hot gash. In this moment though, there's nowhere you'd rather be.
>You slowly ease into a rhythm, teasing at her outer lips before tracing right up the middle. It was doing a decent job of reducing the wolfess to a trembling mess, her juices dripping down and ruining her sheets.
>Ruby can't seem to help herself, slowly grinding her hips against your face as if trying to fuck it.
>When you bring up a finger, prodding at her sex and slipping it inside of her, it's enough to make her yelp, her loins tightening around it.
>As you tease at her folds with your tongue and feel around inside of her with a single digit, Ruby’s quiet moans start to become gentle growls. By now you were hard again, and eager to please your partner.
>She starts to get a bit rougher, firmly grasping the back of your head as she presses you against her. Her hips grind against you at a steady pace, smothering you with her juices.
>You feel her start to twitch a bit, starting to reach her precipice. You decide to pick up the pace, wanting her finish to be as pleasurable for her as possible.
>She growls as she happily rides your face, one of her hands holding your head in place, and the other squeezing at her breast. She gazes at you with a hungry, almost feral, gaze.
>Just as you're about to bring her to completion, she surprises you by suddenly getting up, quickly moving her hips back down to yours.
>Before you even know what's happening, she unceremoniously drops her hips, her steaming cunt swallowing your dick in its tight embrace.
>Ruby growls loudly, throwing her head back and belting out the loudest howl you've ever heard as she cums around your dick, her internal muscles clenching around you so hard you're afraid she might crush it.
>As she rides out her orgasm, she flops forward and lays on top of you, being careful to keep you inside of her.
>She pants heavily, her eyes having a glazed look to them.
>After a minute or so, she slowly raises her head to look at you in the eyes. She still has that burning gaze of want she gave you earlier.
>Ruby rests her hands on your wrists, pinning you to the bed as she finds her voice again, beginning to speak. 
>”Anon… Gonna… Gonna show you… Gonna show you what it means to be WOLFED. Gonna ruin you for Human women… This dick belongs to ME now!”

>You have no clue where the old Ruby went, but you've gotta say. This dominant side to her wasn't entirely unwelcome.
>She leans forward to give you another kiss, her tongue filling your mouth as she greedily makes out with you.
>When she needs air, she only pulls away for a few seconds, just long enough for the two of you to get a breathe before she plunges back in, wrestling with your tongue as she lets out a combination of quiet moans and growls.
>Her hips wiggle as she lays on top of you, teasing your cock as it lay buried deep inside of her.
>The stimulation is quickly forcing you to your limit, and you're using everything in your power to not try and cum inside of her this early.
>Ruby doesn't seem to mind though, refusing to break eye contact as she smooches and teases you.
>Eventually, she seems to have enough of kissing you for now, a thick strand of saliva linking you together as she pulls away, the two of you panting.
>You twitch inside of her, teetering right on the edge of a massive orgasm. You've never been much into edging, but you could honestly see the appeal right now.
>Ruby must notice it too, as she gives you a smug smile, laying on top of you and keeping you helplessly pinned. 
>”You better cum inside of me, Anon… I need you to fill me. You're my mate now, so you need to do your duty and fill me up with pups…”
>Oh. FUCK.
>Her words were enough to send you over the edge, your balls clenching as you shot a huge load of sticky cum inside of her, a lot of it shooting right up against her cervix and oozing into her womb.
>Ruby happily growls, rolling her hips as she feels you pump her full of the hot fluid.
>She leans forward to whisper in your ear as your cum begins to seep out around your cock, soiling the soft bedsheets even further.
>”My mate… My sweet, wonderful husband… I love you…”
>Ruby seems to have mellowed out now, returning back to her usual self now that she's gotten what she wanted so badly.
>Your eyelids twitch as you begin to recover from the massive orgasm, your pole still rock hard inside of Ruby.
>Her arms wrap around you sweetly, tugging you as she rolls over, the two of you now laying on your sides as you face each other.
>She gives your face a few quick, loving licks as she cuddles with you, her soft coat brushing against your nude form.
>Ruby looks at you with big puppy dog eyes as she whispers to you.
>”Can we go again? Please…? I need you… I need you so bad, Anon…”
>You don't hesitate, immediately saying yes to her. You wanted nothing other than to make her happy. She was the only person you mattered to you right now.
>Ruby smiles warmly at you, kissing you on the lips before letting go of you and rolling on her back, her legs spreading for you.
>Your cock twitches as you see her splayed out on the bee just for you, your juice-soaked dick longing to bury itself back in its new proper home.
>”Take me, Anon… I'm all yours now.”
>You hesitate for a moment, asking her if you should grab a condom.
>She only chuckles, spreading her slit with a couple fingers. A thin dribble of your cum leaks out, sticking to her fur.
>”Look at me, Anon… I think the damage is already done. Don't worry though. I won't be having your kids just yet… I'm only really fertile when I'm in heat.”
>Her eyes narrow, her smile widening as she continues.
>”And even then, I would -never- use a condom with you. You're my mate now… It's your duty to give me a litter or two now.”
>She smiles at your confused expression, letting out another pleased growl.
>”Betcha didn't know we wolves mated for life. That's right Anon… In the eyes of me and my species, we're as good as husband and wife now. So why don't you get over here and consummate our marriage~?”

>You didn't need any more encouragement.
>Ruby’s tongue darts out to lick her lips as she sees you crawl in-between her thighs, stopping as you come face-to-face with each other.
>Her hands reach for you, but instead of trying to pin you this time, she intertwines her fingers with yours as she tightly holds your hands.
>You can see small tears of happiness form in her eyes as she gazes up at you.
>Her tail loudly beats against the bed as she lays there, unable to hide her joy.
>”My husband… Love me… Please?”
>Always.
>You slowly bring your hips forward, the Ruby letting out a small gasp as your tip pops back into her hot slit, already well lubricated from your previous romp.
>The two of you let out small groans of pleasure as you slowly fill her back up, not stopping until you bottom out against her, your hips meeting hers.
>Ruby starts to lovingly lick and kiss as your face as you begin to slowly thrust in and out of her, her hands squeezing yours.
>You take her like a husband would take his wife, Ruby letting out yips of pleasure each time your balls slap against her clit.
>The session must last at least a half-hour, your normal stamina being extended greatly due to the two previous orgasms you've had.
>Feeling the two of you begin to reach your limit, you speed up, Rubys’ legs lifting to lock around your waist.
>”Inside, Anon! Please!”
>How could you refuse?
>You release inside of her the next time you bottom out, filling her womb for a second time. The quantity you release may not be as impressive this time, but the pleasure is just as intense.
>Ruby lets out another howl as she reaches her own climax, not as loud as the last one, but still enough to wake up the entire damn dorm.
>You flop forward into her chest as her cunt milks you for every last drop of the warm reproductive fluid.
>Once more, Ruby hugs the two of you as she flops onto her side, the two of you tight in each others grasp.
>She reaches behind her, grabbing a pillow and tossing it at the light-switch. Good aim!
>With the lights now off, Ruby pulls a blanket over the two if you, smothering you with her fluff and warmth. 
>”Here Anon, try this… I've heard that Humans really like this.”
>Her hand gently presses your face into the tuft of floof above her breasts, her scent filling your body.
>You sigh happily, snuggling as close to her as possible, your limbs tangled together in a loving heap.
>You aren't sure who falls asleep first, but you do know that this is the most comfortable you've felt in a long time.

>”Anon! Wake up, my sweet mate...”
>You're gently awoken by Ruby the next morning, still laying in her protective grasp.
>You groan, immediately shutting your eyes and pressing your nose back into her tuft of fur as the sunlight filtering in through her window assaults your eyes.
>Ruby only giggles, stroking your head as her tail thumps against the bed behind her.
>”Come on, Anon… Time to get up. Let's go out and grab some breakfast. My treat, okay?”
>Yeah… Breakfast sounds nice. Especially breakfast with your new “mate” or “wife” or whatever she was to you now. Either way, you knew that every moment you spent with her from now on would be a good one.
>Ruby sniffs you once, then sits up.
>”First though, we could both use a shower… Don't wanna walk around smelling like a horny wolf, do you?”
>She hugs you as the two of you get up, guiding you to the small shower in her attached bathroom.
>”Of course, I'll have to shower with you… Don't want you washing off ALL of my scent. People have gotta know you're mine now, right?”
>You only smile as the two of you step into the shower, Ruby shutting the glass door behind you.
>You turn the water on, the two of you jumping a bit as you're assaulted by a blast of cold water. Within seconds though, the water turns into a more acceptable temperature.
>”Here, help me clean my fur, my mate…’
>Ruby squeezes out a generous amount of gel into her hands, before rubbing it onto her fur and generating a decent amount of suds.
>You press your fingers against her body, digging your fingers into her wet fur as you gently scrub away the remainders of last night.
>Ruby smiles warmly at you as you focus on getting her coat cleaned.
>”Hey, um, sorry for getting a little rough with you last night.”
>She sheepishly smiles, rubbing a bit of soap onto your shoulders.
>”It's… A Wolf thing. I guess we get a bit, uh, “excited” when we claim a mate for ourselves. I'm sure you understand, right?
>Of course you understand. To tell the truth, you kind of liked it…
>Ruby shivers as the words leave your mouth, her eyes filled with longing as she presses against you, wrapping you in a hug as she massages the soap against your shoulders and back.
>Unfortunately, you don't really have time for another romp right now. You're hungry, thirsty, and have a strong desire to just sit somewhere with your new “mate” and relax.
>When the shower is finally finished, all traces of last night's fun washed down the drain, the two of you take your time drying off, Ruby making sure to rub against you to stick some her scent back on your skin.
>Soon enough, the two of you are fully dressed and are heading out the door. 
>Outside, a disgruntled shortstack Otter stands, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes.
>When she sees the two of you, she lets out an annoyed sigh.
>”Ruby? Was that you last night? Fuck, you must have kept the entire damn building up last night…”
>Ruby only giggles, much to the Otter lady’s annoyance.
>As the two of you walk down the stairs and out the doors, Ruby holds your hand, and you know that she's never going to let go.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>Be Ruby
>You were 24 now, with your husband Anon being 23.
>Currently, you were alone on your porch, sitting in a porch swing as you watched the road, impatiently waiting for your mate to return from work.
>After finishing college and getting his degree in Geology, Anon had found a decent job out in the country.
>His new career had brought the two of you into the rural hills outside of town, and the two of you loved it here.
>Your new home was maybe a bit small, but it had all the amenities you needed. And with Anon by your side, it was comfy as could be.
>You idly stroked your rounded stomach, a smile on your muzzle.
>During your last heat, Anon had finally gotten you pregnant. According to your doctor, you had a nice and healthy litter of pups on the way.
>Your parents had been a bit upset at first when they found out you were marrying a human, but they had mellowed out a bit when they saw how much you loved one another. Giving them a few grandkids didn't hurt either…
>To your surprise, they had even showed up to your wedding!
>Usually among wolves, marriages weren't necessary, but Anon had insisted that you make things official. Human traditions can be so strange… It was nice though.
>Your ears perk up as you hear a car approaching, and you stand up out of the seat as you see a familiar car pull into the gravel driveway.
>The very second Anon gets out of the vehicle, you pull him into a hug, loving painting his face with licks and kisses.
>He laughs, petting your head and giving you a few smooches back. You hold his arm as he leads the two of you back inside your home.
>Yeah… Things were great. The only thing you were sad about is not acting sooner with Anon.
>Well, you couldn't change the past though… Only look forward. 
>And looking forward? Well, things looked pretty bright.
