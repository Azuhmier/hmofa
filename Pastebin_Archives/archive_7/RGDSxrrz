>Be Staff Sergeant Anon
>Wait no, Just Anon now
>The service said they no longer needed you after the Lazing incident
>Fucking insurgents and their god damned Laser pointers burned out your right retina
>You can see out of your right eye but not was well as before
>So now you are just Anon, College student
>And you already hated it
>Turns out you don't actually use algebra in real life and having not used it in nearly 10 years means you totally forgot it
>So here you are in College Algebra, the most basic math course the college offers.
>Of course you're in class 15 minutes early
>Slowly others begin to show up
>Anthros and humans.
>You never had much experience with Anthros in the service, not many signed up
>They slowly start filling in seats away from you, you guess your scowl scared them off
>Eventually the only seat left is the one next to you, you don't care either way but you wish you didn't need this class for your degree
>An Anthro comes in and looks around, She looks like a snow leopard but you're not totally sure
>She looks to be a head shorter than you, but that's not saying much as you are 6'5 and nearly everyone is shorter than you, she's wearing a black hoodie that says "school" in white lettering as well as loose fitting jeans and black rimmed glasses 
>She looks chubby-ish but it's hard to tell because of all the loose fitting clothing
>She frowns slightly when she sees the only seat available is the one next to you
>Iuch your ego says
>Still she takes the seat and fiddles nervously with her bag, when you notice somethings about her bag that doesn't shock you but intrigues you
>Its covered in various video game pins that you recognize and play
>Bioshock, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, various Pokemon pins and a few of the badges and a few you don't recognize
>She might be a bigger nerd than you are and that's saying something
> "I like all the pins you've collected" you say to her "Bloodborne was one of my favorite games"
>She jumps slightly and says "huh?" 
>She looks confused, like she never expected anyone to talk to her
>"Your Pins" you point at her bag "Those are a bunch of games I've played and even streamed" 
>She looks at you for a moment, like shes re-assessing you, you guess she didn't think you were a gamer.  "You're a streamer?" she asks in a non believing manner.
>"I'm not popular or anything but yes I play and stream games in my free time" you reply "Why? is it really that hard to believe I play video games?" 
>You raise an eyebrow at her questioningly
>"W-well no" she answers looking a little flustered that "I just would expect you to be the football game or COD bro type of guy, you look the part anyway"
>She's got a point, you are wearing a "Check Meowt" tank with a cat on the front.
>"Well I guess you can't quite judge a book by its cover now can you" you say to her "I'm Anon by the way"
>You extend your hand to her
>She shakes it briefly "Clara"
>Looks like Class is starting but you're already feeling a bit better about it

~~~~~~~~

After class
>"Well that was a waste of time" you say out loud to yourself as people start packing up.
>Clara Snickers at that
>"How long has it been since you took any college?" she asks you
>"Never did" you reply "I joined the military right after high school"
>"You were in the military?" She asks a bit surprised
>She looks like shes re-assessing you again
>"Yea, I served and deployed a few times" you reply as you stand up
>She's gawking at you from her seat, her mouth slightly open
>"What?" you ask confusedly
>"You're TALL" She says as she stand up
>You were right you are about a foot taller than her
>"How observant of you" you say jokingly
>She's still looking up and down you
>"I've just never seen a Human this tall in real life" she says looking up at you, beaming
>She did have a point, you were tall for a human and she probably grew up around giraffe or elephant anthros; to see a tall human clearly amazes her
>You blow air out your nose in a short laugh "well, here I am" you say raising your arms and spinning around for her to see
>A difficult task with all the desks in the way
>"Anyway whens your next class?" you ask her "Wanna grab lunch? I don't have class for another 2 hours"
>Her eye widen slightly at the question
>"M-me? Lunch? W-with you?" She stammers out looking somewhat bewildered
>"Uhh yes?" you ask questioningly "Is that a problem? I mean I would rather have company while eating and have some good conversation"
>"Uhm it's just that.." she pauses unsure of what to say next "Humans and Anthros don't usually commingle, a bunch of humans still hate Us, and some states are trying to outlaw interspecies relationships all together"
>"Fuck em" you say bluntly "I served to protect their right to say whatever, but I don't have to agree with them, besides I asked you to go to lunch, not a romantic candlelit dinner"
>She laughs at that last part "Ok ok I see your point" she relents "I don't have another class for a little while"
>"Alright then let's get moving" you say as you bow like an usher motioning towards the classroom door "I have just the place in mind"
>"Oh really?" She looks at you questioningly "What were you thinking?"
>"I know this awesome sushi joint with all you can eat lunch specials for military and veterans" you respond, walking to the parking lot where you parked your jeep
>"I'm not a veteran though" she says dejectedly "It's all you can eat for you but not for me" 
>She looks disappointed
>"I know you aren't a veteran" you laugh "That's why it's my treat. They still have all you can eat for non military folk but it's a little more expensive"
>Her ears perk up at this "You don't have to do that"
>"Yea but I want to, I'm the one who asked you to lunch after all" you say confidently as you unlock the jeep
>You get in as she climbs into the jeep and you start it up, it gives a slight roar that causes Clara to jump slightly
>"Sorry, I should have warned you about that. I've been working on this jeep as a hobby" you say apologetically
>"Don't be sorry" she says with a laugh as she puts her pin covered bag in the back seat "It Just surprised me that's all, and more to my point of you don't seem like a hardcore gaming kind of guy"
>You raise your eyebrow questioningly as you pull out of the parking lot
>"I mean, you were military, you fix cars, and you dress like a total Bro, if you excuse the term, next thing you'll say is you lift weights everyday"
>"Actually....." you start so say
>She cuts you off "You do lift weights?!?" She laughs, "You're either a total liar or the most contradictory nerd I've ever met. you aren't one of those "Do you even lift" guys are you?"
>"I'm more one of those "doth thou even Hoist guys"" you respond with a laugh "I like what I like, and here" you hand her your phone "You can see all the videos on my youtube channel" 
>She spends the rest of the ride Criticizing your techniques in Bloodborne and dark souls
~At the restaurant~
>She's staring at you amazed
>"I can't believe you ate all that" she says as she motions to the Stack of 15 small sushi Plates
>"I'm a big guy" you respond trying to sound hurt "Besides the portions are small"
>"But that" she motions again with her arms wide "That's ridiculous"
>She looks at her five plates, she had only eaten 4 and a half technically. You finished the rest of it.
>"Are all humans bottomless pits?" she asks you, eyes wide as though she's made a stunning revelation
>"Naw, just the ones who need the protein for gains" you almost laugh as you say that because you flex when you say Gains
>This lunch was awesome for you, you had great company and got to eat a ton of your favorite food
>There were some odd Stares but a sharp look from you put an end to that
>You still got that command presence down
>She's Laughing at your flexing and a few tables look over
>You see an elderly couple to your left frown at you, then bury their face in their Menus
>You casually glance to you right and see a couple of lion Anthros giving you the evil eye.
>"I guess I see what you mean" you say at a low volume
>"What do you mean?" she says
>You do a quick head nod in the lions direction
>She looks over none to subtly and looks back at you then sighs
>"Haven't you seen this stuff before?" she asks flatly "It's a little odd to see a Human eating with a Snow leopard" 
>Aha She is a snow leopard, that would have been an awkward question
>You push that thought aside "No I can't say I have, I didn't run into Anthros in the service and before then I was just a dumb teen and never noticed I guess" 
>"Does it bother you at all? I mean the Humans over there must think so low of you, and the Lions are probably saying i'm a traitor" she says all that so matter-of-fact you give pause
>"Fuck em" you say again 
>She stares at you dumbfounded
>"Who cares what people think? they've been fighting about who can be with who since the fucking civil war" you state bluntly
>She looks dumbfounded still, like a deer in the headlights
>"As long as you're happy with the person you're with, who cares" you say shrugging
>She still dumbfounded but then looks questioningly at you, while scratching her chin, Her tail flicking softly behind her
>"I hadn't thought about it like that." she says finally
>You grin at her
>"Anyway back to what matters, let's get back to campus, you still have your class and I have mine in like 20 minutes" you say
>You already paid the check and didn't let her see how much it was, your food was only $10 and hers was about $20, still you didn't want her to feel guilty about it
>You move out of the booth and help her out as well 
>"So gentlemanly" she mocks you playfully
>So in proper accordance you Also hold open the restaurant door and open the jeep door for her
>She's trying not to laugh at it all
>You drive back to campus, talking about random shit
>You drop her off in front of the building her class is in
>"Thank you for a wonderful lunch Anon" she says as she hands you a piece of paper
>"Whats this" you ask as you look at the paper, only then noticing its a phone number
GOT DEM DIGITS YO
>"My Phone Number and my PawsApp address" she says as she looks a bit flustered
>You swear you can see her blushing through her fur
>You smile at her
>"Well I guess that means I get to see more of you then" you say with a smile
>You can definitely see her blushing now
>"Yes" she says loudly trying to look mean, but instead looking cute. "Now go to your class and don't be late!" 
>You throw up a mock Salute at her "YES MA'AM" you shout
>She facepaws and and turns and walks away, turning about halfway to the building to give you a beautiful smile and a wave.
>You start driving to your next class.
>Maybe college won't be so bad after all


>It's been about 2 weeks since you and Clara first spoke and had lunch together
>Every time you have a class break together (which is fairly often even though you only share one class, the college sets up times like that) you sit and chat or go get lunch
>You learn a lot about her
>She's going to school to become a nurse
>Her parents immigrated from Mongolia but she was born in the US
>Not that you would care, you aren't all "THEY TUK OR JERBS"
>Your time with her is awesome and a thing you look forward too
>Speaking of which shes sitting next to you at a small burger joint
>"So Anon, what do you think of this place" She asks smugly "Better than the one you suggested last week huh?"
>You've been trying to outdo each other with the best food places
>You sigh in defeat "Yes, you win this round" 
>She flicks her ears and her tail flicks against you
>"By the way, isn't today the day you usually have class longer than me" she asks
>You think a moment. It's Thursday which means you have your two 3 hours classes while she only has a 3 hour class followed by her 1.5 hour class
>"Yea why?" you finally respond, raising an eyebrow questioningly
>She knew that already why would she ask that ?
>"I want to run home and then when you get out can you come pick me up? I wanna make us dinner" She says practically bouncing in excitement
>"Uh sure, that's kinda sudden though, not that i mind, what's the occasion?"
>"My mom taught me a new recipe from Mongolia and I want to try to make it!" she says so excitedly she literally is bouncing now, her paws on her cheeks as she talks.
>You smile at that. she always does that when she gets super excited about something
>Like when you showed her the shiny promotional Aegislash on pokemon Y 
>You snap back to focusing on her, she's so excited about this, its adorable
>"I don't know if I'll have the ingredients for Mongolian food though" You say, rubbing your chin
>Stubble, you haven't shaved in 2 weeks except tidying up
>Years in the military meant you had not been able to grow any proper facial hair besides an 80's pornstar mustache
>She waves a paw at you dismissively, "I'll pick up what I need at the asian food market near my place"
>"It's a date then" you say and you watch her ears flutter and look away from you nervously
>By now her reservations about being seen with you have disappeared, but you can still get those shy responses if you push the right buttons
>"Good" she says looking back at you with a snap, her tail swishing side to side
>You check your watch and see it's about time to head back to class
~~~~~~
During class
>You're in your Humanities class trying to take notes
>It's something about gender relations between Anthros and Humans
>One of the male wolf anthros in the class is ranting about how many female Anthros are choosing to date humans
>It's basically the "black men be stealing our wimminz" rant you've heard a thousand times online
>Your mind drifts to Clara
>It's not totally unexpected that she wants to come to your place, it's just the reason threw you off
>She never once has told you she likes cooking, nor has she ever told you she likes Mongolian food
>You shouldn't be surprised though, her parents are from Mongolia
>You snap back to reality, wolf boy is still ranting 
>"And even my sister came home with a human!" he snaps angrily at almost a yell "She finds a Human roommate near her college, lives with him for like 2 weeks than comes home during holiday saying her and him are a couple"
>You can't hold your tongue as you say "Why do you care? Are you trying to date your sister?" 
>Snickers from the crowd
>He turns to you "Yea its super funny for you human, but some of us don't like Interspecies relationships" he snaps
>"I seem to recall Nazis not liking Mixed race relationships either" you say calmly "You don't choose who you love"
>He looks mad but doesn't say anything
>You smirk and go back to typing notes from the powerpoint slide.

After class
>Your phone bings at you as you walk out of the building
>PawsApp says you have a new message from Clara
>It's her Address
>It's in the Arthro District unsurprisingly
>What does surprise you is her next Message
>"Park a few blocks away down the corner" it says
>You frown slightly, unsure what to make of it but you type the message "Ok I'll see you there" while walking to your jeep
>Walking and texting, walking while eating or drinking. These are new to you again.
>In the service you have it ingrained into you that you walk to walk, if you need to use the phone you stop walking.
>You hop into the jeep and rev it up, then pull out of your parking spot thinking about all the things you missed while being in the service 
>You're so deep in thought that you barely notice that you're already by her house
>You open up PawsApp and type "Hey, I'm where you wanted me to be" 
>You get a response almost instantly
>"Great! See you in a minute"
>You smile and wait
>After about a minute or so, you see her carrying a few bags, and you're almost shocked
>Not because of bags, but whats shes wearing
>She usually wears baggy clothes that hide her features but not now
>She's wearing a red t shirt that is tight on her breasts that says "Come to the dark side we have bacon" with Darth Vader on it
>Vaders face is stretched out by Her grapefruit sized breasts, which you hadn't been able to full appreciate the size of until now
>She's also wearing some jean shorts, or are they capris? You never did know the difference but you can see her hips are perfect in every way.
>You stare mouth slightly agape until you snap yourself out of it, get out of the jeep and walk over to meet her
>"Well hello there" you say in a playful voice as you take the bags from her and start walking her back to the jeep
>"Oh shut up you" she says as she climbs in, 
>You throw the bags in the back and start the jeep up
>She doesn't jump anymore when you start it
>You pull away from the curb and start to drive 
>You notice people and Anthros staring
>Most seem a little confused, like they don't quite understand what they are seeing
>A few smile
>Some look downright angry
>You smile at that 
>Their tears are delicious 
>"Hey, can we make a quick pit stop?" Clara asks nervously
>You look over at her and see her tail swishing side to side 
>"Yea sure, but you gotta tell me what that was all about" you say sternly
>"What what was about" she says without looking at you, her ears flat
>"The whole park 2 blocks away and around the corner deal" you say flatly, 
>You want to look at her, but god dammit you also don't want to crash
>Not crashing is more important
>Clara is more interesting though
>"My...Dad..." she pauses for a few seconds, trying to figure out what to say in the best way "He doesn't like humans much, still doesn't forgive them, after all they are the reason he and mom fled Mongolia"
>You remember reading about how bad it was for anthros in some other countries, some still having segregation
>You sneak a peek at her out of the corner of your eye
>She's looking at her paws, ears as flat as they could go.
>"Hey hey hey" you say in a comforting tone, reaching over and rubbing the ear you could reach "It's not big deal, I was just curious"
>She perks up a bit at that
>"Now about that pit stop you wanted, I thought you got everything at that asian store?" you ask
>"Oh well, uhm, yea I did but I wanted to go to.." she trails off, her tail flicking adorably like it always does what she's embarrassed
>"Go to ..." you lead her on, rolling your hand at her to continue 
>She Buries her face in her paws "Fue winnkaer sttoww" she says through her Paws, tail still flicking.
>"What?" you ask "I can't hear you through your paws. Come on, I'm not gonna make you feel bad about it so spit it out"
>She brings her face out of her paws and says sternly "The Liquor Store"
>Hm she never really talked about drinking before, your stories of your old unit having a bar built into the HQ must've rubbed off.
>"Sure I know of one by my place" you say 
>She looks at you in a questioning way
>"What?? Come on, I can get drinks when I want! I'm an adult!" you say defensively
>She laughs and flicks her tail at you gently
>"I know you're an adult, I just didn't think you drank THAT often" she says playfully
>"One of my streamed series is Drunk Dark souls" you say to her, shooing her tail away from your face
>"That sounds like an excuse to get drunk and play video games" she laughs,
>"That's exactly what it is" you say with a smile
>It isn't very long before you pull into the Parking lot of the liquor
>You park and get out of the jeep then walk over to the front door and hold it open for Clara
>"Anon, How are you Brother!" a camel Anthro with a thick accent waves to you
>"Not bad Ali, how are you" you say as you fist bump him
>Fist hoove?
>Whatever
>"Who is your lovely friend?" he says looking at Clara
>"She's a friend from college" you say to him
>Ali looks at you questioningly 
>"Mhmmm" he says smugly at you
>You look at him sternly and he turns around wearing a big stupid smug smirk
>You walk over to Clara who is looking at the shelves of Liquors
>She looks overwhelmed
>"What? Do you not know what to get?" you ask as you grab a bottle of Kraken rum
>"I.. Uh. No. I don't drink much and usually, it's because my friends offer me some spiked punch" she says, her tails flicking slightly "I'll just have some of what you have there"
>That seems like a bad idea 
>"Uhm, I think it may be a little strong for you" you say looking down at her
>She angrily pouts at you
>"What do you suggest then?" she says crossing her arms, her tail is swishing like she's annoyed by that comment
>You grab a bottle of pineapple rum
>"You like pineapples right?" you ask as you walk to the counter
>You knew she did, she told you it was her favorite fruit
>"Yes!" she says with a giddy bounce 
> Ali rings it up
>"I got the drinks since you bought stuff to make dinner" you say bluntly
>"Fair enough" she replies
>Ali is still smirking at you as you swipe your card.
>He bags up your bottles, give you another fist bump and and says "Have a nice night my friend"
>"Thanks you too" you say over your shoulder as you leave the shop
>Clara is already by the jeep, doing her excited bounce "This is going to be great" she says 
>You hop into the jeep, turn it on and start driving to your house
>"So Ali owns that shop?" Clara asks you "I didn't expect any Anthros outside the district"
>"Yea, he and his brother own the store" you say as you drive "No one says Anthros have to live in the district, he chose to open a liquor store because even if someone is a speciest they still want their booze"
>"Smart" She says "Everyone loves booze"
>You laugh "Anyway we're getting close"
>You pull down a road and pull into your driveway
>She gawks at your house
>"What? Is something wrong" you look at her 
>She's still sitting in the Jeep, she looks at your Old El Camino parked next to the Jeep, your house and your yard
>"You Live here?!?" She asks looking amazed like the first time you met
>You're slightly taken aback
>"Ummm...yes?" you don't really know how to respond
>Your house is just a basic single story 3 bedroom house you bought when you were in the service. hooray VA home loans
>"You Live in a house?! By yourself? A FULL stand alone house?" she's getting out of the house and gawking at you and the house
>"Is that bad?" you ask, still confused
>"No! It's just I expected you to live in an apartment or something, not rent a house by yourself" she seems to have snapped out of the trance she was in 
>"Oh... Well I don't rent it. I own it" you say, unlocking the door as you talk
>She follows you in and looks around
>She still looks shocked but her tail is swishing in curiosity
>You take the food to the Kitchen and put it in the fridge, no need to unbag it since she's going to take it all out
>"You want a tour?" you call out
>You wait for a reply, but get none
>You turn around and find...Nothing
>Where is she?
>You decide to look for her and go room to room
>Main room? Nope
>Game room? Nope
>Office? Nope
>Bathroom light is off
>Bedroom? Check....
>She's laying on your bed, her face smashed into your pillow sniffing deeply
>"Clara?" 
>You walk up and put a hand on her back and she jumps slightly
>"Wha? Uh...Sorry" her ears go flat and her tail flicks "It smells good."
>Not what you expected, but not a bad thing
>You bend down and lift her from the bed
>"Come on I'll give you a tour"
~~~
Later that Night
>Clara is bouncing around your kitchen with her apron on, cooking whatever she decided to make
>you didn't even know she brought an apron
>She's had quite a bit to drink too. 
>She asked to mix a rum and coke and then another.. Then another and another.
>She tried your rum too 
>Her fur and tail all puffed out in disgust
>You guess it was too strong for her even if her reaction was adorable
>But she loves the pineapple rum
>A bit much too much though as she mixes herself another rum and coke while cooking
>She has you sitting in your main room playing games while she cooks, so she can watch you and you her
>Still she's happily bouncing around your kitchen.
>The smells from the kitchen are.....Interesting
>She finally brings out a plate of....Something
>"Eat up" She says, slurring her words 
>She's smiling and proud of herself for making....Whatever this is
>"Uhm Clara what is this?" you ask her poking the...Whatever it is she made
>"It's Chanasan Makh!" she stumbles a bit and falls onto the couch
>You're concerned now.
>"Hey Clara, I think you might have had a bit much to drink babe" you say as you stand up
>You go over to her
>She lays on the couch and has wiggled out of her apron 
>Her shirt has creeped up, exposing her tummy with is only slightly chubby but it just the right amount of chub
>You reach down to help her up
>"Come on, let's get you to bed" you say
>You gently but firmly grab her arm and start to help her up
>She has other plans
>She pulls you down instead
>You may be bigger than her but you weren't expecting this and your center of gravity was totally off 
>You fall over and she's on top of you in a flash
>"You called me babbbeee" she says in a singsong voice; wobbling a little as she straddles you
>She pulls off the red star wars shirt revealing a black bra and those wonderful grapefruit sized breasts
>"This isn't right, shes drunk" you think to yourself
>She falls forward onto you and kisses you
>Well she tries, she puts her lips over your nose and upper lips, her fangs give a slight cut to the side of your nose
>"C-Clara! Stop come on" You gasp out "You're drunk and this isn't right"
>"Kitty wants what she wants" she growls gently
>She's trying to kiss down your neck
>You're wondering what you should do when the answer is presented to you
>Painfully
>She collapses on top of you and starts snoring softly
>You're relieved, but her full weight surprised you and knocked the wind out of you
>Well ok, you have a passed out half naked, drunk Snow leopard on top of you.
>That's the strangest sentence you're ever had to think
>Well could be worse
>You roll over, careful to support Clara's head and you place her on the couch
>She's going to hate the morning
>You scoop her up with little effort and carry her to the bedroom
>Has her fur always been this soft? 
>You tuck her into one side of your extra long king size bed (your feet hang off the edge on anything smaller and it's hard to find extra long twins)
>She's still snoring softly as you leave the room to check the damage from her "cooking"
>The kitchen looks like a mess, but most of it is throw away scraps of whatever meat this is
>Is this tripe? Are those gizzards? What was she making?
>You clean up and grab 4 water bottles out of your fridge and chug one down as you walk to the bedroom
>Hangovers happen because your body loses too much water and gets dehydrated 
>You had some alcohol but still are buzzed, and would rather avoid a stinging headache in the morning because you're going to have to nurse Clara back to health
>You set the 3 remaining water bottles on a bedside table near her
>You go back to the kitchen, make a sandwich and munch on it slowly, thinking about what happened
>She came onto you strong, you can tell she never drank like that before
>Did she take the term liquid courage too literally?
>Your head is buzzing with questions as you lay down next to her in the bed

The next morning

>You awake at 7 am like always
>Even without an alarm you still get up at 7, habits die hard 
>Clara is still sleeping but it looks like she drank one of the 3 water bottles in her sleep
>You know it won't be enough
>You get up throw on a Muscle shirt (it says "show me your Kitties", you got it just to show Clara) and some shorts
>You go get water bottle from the fridge and start to drink from it
>You open the front door and make sure the screen is locked and open the back door to get a cool breeze through the house
>Gotta get that smell from whatever Clara tried to make out of the house
>"Uuuuugggghhhh" you hear a moan from the bedroom
>Welp it's time
>You go back into the bedroom
>Clara is awake 
>Barely
>"A-anon?"
>"Yes Clara?" you answer her moan, shes cute even when shes hungover
>"What happened last night? Did we.......Did we do it?" she groans "Ugh the room is spinning"
>"Here" you move her leg softly so that one paw is flat on the ground
the room spinning is your body trying to center itself or something, but if you place a foot flat on the floor the spinning will stop
>Soft fur
>She sits up quickly
>"Bathroom!" She yelps
>You point it out, and she's out of the bed running to it
>You hear her dry heave a few times then start puking up whatever is in her stomach
>You go and hold her hair and rub her back gently
>She's still just wearing her jeans and bra
>Soft fur
>"Ughh, I made a fool out of myself last night, didn't I?" she moans
>She still has her face down in the toilet
>"Yea a bit" you say bluntly
>No need to sugar coat it

>You rub your right hand on your face and keep the left one rubbing Clara's back
>"Clara, the key is a bit, not drink to the point where you blackout, besides you don't want your first time to be a night you don't even remember"
>She winces slightly at your words, her ears are flat and her tail is flicking slightly
>"Who told you I was a virgin?" she says looking up from the toilet before immediately going face down into it and puking more
>"What? I meant first time with someone that isn't a one night stand. You're a virgin?" you say in a confused tone
>She nods into the toilet
>That explains that
>"The human guys at my school were either total jocks or creepy neckbeards and the Anthros liked to stick to their own species" she seemed to want to justify why, but you didn't care why
>You had a virgin Snow leopard here who wanted you but was scared of it all
>You sigh
>"Clara"
>"Hmmm?" she moans from the toilet
>"Don't force yourself to do anything until you're ready, and for the moment to be right" you say as you rub her back with both hands >"I care about you too much to just want sex"
>She's quiet for a moment

>"Does this mean we're....?"she whispers
>"Yes" you answer as you wrap your arms around her "Now get some more sleep. I know just what you need to get past this hangover"
>She lets go and so do you, although you didn't want to
>"Ok anon" she whispers before falling back to sleep
>You finish tucking her in

>Sounds like a weird chipotle order
>You leave her in the room and throw on some flip-flops, grab your keys and wallet, then head out of the house
>You hop into the El camino, you like to drive it for local adventures because it only gets 13 miles to the gallon and takes premium gas.
>You've done a ton of work on this muscle car

>They never even stood a chance

>But shows aren't what you're looking for
>Forums
>There a few forums you frequent and one has a thread you've been to frequently
>A Human-Anthro thread

>"Almost 10" 
>She rubs her face and muzzle then looks up at you
>"Thanks anon"
>You're surprised
>"For what?"
>"I don't think most guys would have had that much self restraint" she says looking away from you, her ears going flat
>"You made it easier for me, you passed out after trying to kiss me" you point the to cut on your nose
>She puts her face into her paws and Moans "ohhhh noooo"
>You laugh

>"You gotta stay to his left" you say as you hand her your drink 
>You sit next to her
>"I WAS going left!
>"Not go left! His left! Your right! I thought you beat this game!" you tickle her side gently

>You shake your head in mock disappointment
>"To think my girlfriend would stoop so low as to summon" you say in mock sadness
>"SHUT UP!" she hits you with a pillow
>The chat is going mad with things ranging from "CUTEEEE *u*" to "PRAISE THE SUN \[T]/" to "only quitters summon!"
>She gives you the controller "You do it then"
>You accept the controller and go to swap weapons "Why are you using an Ultra Greatsword? The things are so fucking slow" you say as you swap the black knight greatsword for your irithyll straight sword

At the party

>You can hear the music as you park in the street in front of the house, 
>It's pop music, but you aren't going to go into a party expecting your usual rock music
>Still it's nice to get out of the house and go somewhere besides the college
>Hell, you might even make a friend
>Clara leads you to the door and she rings the doorbell
>A Tigress Opens the door and her eyes light up "CLARA! YOU MADE IT" she hugs Clara
>"Hey Emi, I told you I would" she says as she breaks from the hug

>You half smile and wave "Hi"
>"Oh Uhm Hi HELLO!" she finally snap out of it and hugs you in term
>oh, she's a hugger
>You walk in and feel all eyes on you
>You're the only human here....
>You should have figured that Clara's nursing program was for Nursing Anthros after all their biology is different.
>You don't let it bother you as you walk in 
>Clara is going around introducing you to everyone
>Usually she's so reserved around people, but you guess since she knows everyone she's relaxed
>You mingle for a while with Clara and hang out talking to the Anthros
>Most are cool with you there and just ask questions about "human Stuff"

>This goes on for a while then you excuse yourself 
>Clara is in a corner talking to an Anthro dog girl
>You smile and wave to her as you walk onto the back porch
>You are a huge Introvert and you needed a quick break
>After about 10 minutes, you walk into the house only to see Clara cornered by 2 Lions
>One is easily 6'10 and the other is probably 6'8
>Clara catches you looking and shoots you a pleading look
>You walk over and hear the taller one talking
>"Hey pretty little thing, let's get out of here" he says
>"We can show you a real good time" the other says
>He tries to touch her arm and she reels back only to be stopped by the corner
>You walk up behind them both
>"Excuse me, I think she doesn't want you touching her and I think you should leave" you say calmly
>You are Livid but you know to stay calm
>The taller lion looks at you and laughs 
>"Fuck off you little Cuck, we can do what we want and we want to have a good time"
>"Yea fuck off before we fuck you up" the shorter one chimes in
The key to commands isn't just barking them outright, First ask politely,then demand, and if that doesn't work, enforce 
>You knew how to make your voice commanding without raising it
>Years of practice ordering soldiers
>Your voice is cold as ice as you say "Leave now before you do something you regret"
>The room is silent, even the music seems to have stopped, all eyes on you, the lone human standing up to 2 lions
>"We warned you" the shorter one says "Now we're gonna fuck you up and then fuck this girl here"
>The taller one reaches over and grabs Clara by the breast 
>"There ain't shit you can about it" the tall one says
>The short one is swinging at you, claws Extended
>You're back on the Battlefield
>The insurgent in front of you is swinging at you
the key to a fight isn't brute strength alone you need technique
>This insurgent has neither
>He's swinging his arm wide, fully extended
>You step in and give an uppercut straight into his stomach
>He retches and pukes out whatever he had in him 
>He doubles over exposing his back
>You smash an elbow into his kidney, sending him straight down into his sick
>The other insurgent looks stunned, but pulls a knife out and swings it at you
the correct way to hold a knife is actually like the movie Psycho, punch like normal then swing, the knife is not the weapon it's a tool, you are the weapon
>He swings wide,you step to his left and send a right hook into his jaw
the correct way to punch is to put you full body into it and use your index and middle finger knuckles to hit with, they are reinforced by your arm
>The force of your punch sends him spinning to your left.
>You catch his throat in the crook of your left elbow
>A quick kick to the back of his knee with your foot and you force him down
>He manages to catch himself from going all the way down by putting his hand to the floor 
>The hand is still holding the knife
you can't have that
>You stomp full force with your heel on the hand with a sickening crunch
imagine holding a knife and having someone slam a sledgehammer onto your hand 
>But you aren't a sledgehammer
>You're 240 lbs of bone muscle and anger
>You don't need to check but most of the bones in that hand are broken
>You Slam your right arm behind his head getting him into a chokehold
the chokehold is technically called the carotid restraint, you're not choking them to cut the supply of air but cut the supply of blood to the brain
>You're flexing your left and and pushing down on his neck with your right
>You were Angry
>Angry that you were in this battlefield 
>Angry that you didn't have a weapon
>Angry that they ever dared to touch her
>Her???
>HER!
>In the immortal words of Eminem "Snap back to reality"
>You aren't on a battlefield, you're in a living room at a party
>You look up at Clara
>Her eyes are wide and one paw is over her mouth
>You have the taller lion in the carotid still
>You loosen up and say softly "I told you not to do something you would regret, didn't I?"
>No answer 
>You shake him 
>"DIDN'T I?"
>"Y-yes" he gasps out
>"You won't do that again will you?"
>"N-no"
>"Now you're going to apologize to the nice Leopard aren't you"
>"S-sorry" he gasps
>"Good, now get your friend and fuck off" you say as you let go
>His right paw is broken, his friend is groaning face down a puddle of his own vomit
>You watch as he collects his friend and they saunter out the front door
>You see someone was recording the whole thing on a phone
>You look at Emi "Sorry about that" you say "Let me help clean this puke up"

>You could smell his adrenaline and his musk
>He was so Angry
>Angry for you, because they touched you 
>Angry because they dared to even hint at doing anything to you
>You had heard some of his stories, his fights, his battles
>But that was a different Anon
>Now that Anon was in front of you, and when he looked up you saw the fire in his eyes
>It scared you
>It Aroused you
>And as soon as he saw you, the fire died
>Your Anon was back 
~~~~~~
>Be anon
>Clara is still wide eyed and has both her paws to her mouth now
>Shit did you go overboard?
>"Sorry babe" you say 
>Sorry? that's all you can think of? seriously?
>Suddenly She's on you and pulling you into a Deep kiss ,arms and tail wrapping around you
>A kiss that blasted away every other kiss and was everything you never even knew you wanted
>Her tongue is coiling around yours  
>You can feel each of her sharp teeth
>You taste every corner of her mouth and never want to separate
>But you also need air
>You break away and breathe deeply, savoring her smell

>You smile and nod
>"Let's go"
>You look around

>Clara is practically pulling you to the jeep
>You get in and start it up
>"GO!" She pants
>You've never seen her like this.
>She's panting and squirming
>She grabs your hand and guides it into her crotch and uses your hand to rub her through her pants
>Breathe
>You're driving with your left hand and rubbing Clara through her pants with your right 
>Shes panting and grinding against your hand 
>You recall something from the Human Anthro forum
>A dude named Cheetah_anon told a story of how he got a Chubby cheetah to call him master, fucked the mom, and then got a BJ from the sister
>You don't know if that was all true, but one thing is sticking out in your mind
>Cats are used to quick mating sessions he said
>They won't feel true satisfaction until they feel semen in their womb
>Judging by the way Clara is moaning, you cant discount his words
>She unzips her pants and you gently rub her outer lips
>you're glad you have long arms, so you don't have to lean too far
>It's hard to focus on driving 
>You slip a finger between her lips and rub up and down gently
>Slowly
>Her insides are so hot and you love it
>She's grinding and moaning softly
>You pause at her clit and rub in a slow circle on it making her gasp
>God shes wet, her panties are soaked through and so are her jeans

>You Feel her grinding into your hand and shudder and throws her head back
>God dam, the speed limit made this ride so much slower

>You don't even bother about parking in the driveway. Garage door up
>Pull in
>As the garage door closes, Clara is already out of her seat 
>Her soaked seat
Iaintevenmad.jpg
>You get out and go around the car and shes on you, arms and tail wrapped around you as you kiss again
>"I told you the right moment would come and would be worth it" you whisper to her

>Well she's not looking at the boxer briefs but what's beneath them
>You take the lead and move with her to the bedroom

>It also makes some damn good mood lighting
>You turn to her, she's biting her lip gently and you see her ears flicking nervously
>You wrap her in her arms, pick her up gently and kiss her, getting a squeak of surprise into your mouth

>She shudders and moans and purrs loader, fueling your licks to go longer and slower over her clit
>You do long licks up her pussy and slow down to focus a slow circle on her clit
>"Oh..g-god Anon I-I-I -c-can't" she moans before a violent shudder
>A wave of warm liquid Sprays out of her onto your face
>You keep going kissing and licking, your hands rubbing the outsides of her thighs
>A-a-anon I-I-I" is all she stammer out between shudders before another wave hits your face
>You look up at her mouth still on her clit

>You look at her, she's still staring
>"Is it what you expected?" you ask her calmly
>"It's...Bigger than I thought...... Plus there are no spikes...."
>Your mind reels for a second. You recall a video where a housecat screams because of its mates Spiny dick
>You rub her thighs "You ready Love?" you say 
>You're in position
>If you wanted to you could simply shove it in and go to town
>But she deserves better than that, she deserves love and tenderness

>Her claws are out slightly and etching across your back and you start to go faster
>Her walls clamping on you, inviting everything you have to give her
>"O-ohhhh f-fuck" she moans into your mouth
>And splash of liquid sprays out of her pussy and her walls contract sharply
>You've lost track of how many orgasms she has had and you're so close
>Suddenly a thought hits you
>You weren't wearing a condom and females determine the species of the offspring

>That's all you needed, you pushed harder and harder into her pussy

>You're so close.
>So close to her
>"C-clara I-I’m" is all you manage to choke out
>Dd-do it" she whispers
>You push deep into her and explode into her pussy.
>Your seed trying to find the furthest reaches of her 
>You stay pushed deep into her, her claws in your back, your body ridged against her, your face kissing hers, your fingers buried into the fur of her back, her tail wrapped around you
>Bliss
>You pull out slowly
>She's soaked this side of bed with her squirting. You kiss her deeply and play with her tongue as she plays with yours.

>You're both basking in the afterglow when suddenly she whacks you gently with a paw
>"Get me a towel to clean up you dingus, you came like a gallon in me" she says in a mock angry voice "And get me a gatorade or 2, Jesus you look like you were swimming"

>You go back to the room and set the gatorades down 
>You then grab a towel and wipe upwards on Claras pussy , getting a few shudders out of her

>"Why aren't you more excited about this?" she asks as she walks over and wraps her arms around your waist, her tail swishing side to side slowly
>"I didn't do it for fame" 
>She huffs 
>"I know that, it's just usually viral videos are of stupid people doing stupid things" she says looking up at you "Like that one video of the girl whos drugged up talking about choking on a big black dick"
>You laugh as you pull her omelette off the stove and put in on a plate "True" you say as you put 5 pieces of bacon next to the stupidly cheesy omelette
>"And it's exciting to see people responding so positively to it" she says as she scrolls the comments
>"Youtube would ban anything too nasty" you point out

in front of Clara's House
>"So what are their names again?"
>"John and Stacy"
>"I thought they were from mongolia!"
>"They are they took American names when they immigrated"
>Well, that keeps things easy and explains why Clara has an American name
>John and Stacy Zaya
>You're walking up the pathway that leads to her house, a basic 2 story house
>The Door opens as you and Clara approach
>In the doorway to greet you is Clara's mother
>She basically looks like an older version of Clara but a bit thinner and taller
>You smile as you approach
>"Clara, you did not say he was so tall" she says with a hint of an accent
>"Mom you saw the video! You knew he was tall" Clara says as she hugs her mom
>"The video did not do it justice" 
>You extend your hand to her
>"Hello Mrs.Zaya, I'm Anon" 
>"Oh please just call me Stacy" She says with a smile

>He looks up and quickly hides the tablet, then stands to greet you
>He's shorter than Stacy but much stockier
>"Nice to meet you Mr.Zaya" you say extending a hand
>"Likewise Mr. Anon" he takes you hand in his paw and shakes it
>He also as an accent but stronger than Stacy's
>You assume he's trying to squeeze your hand, but its not working at all

>"B-but I Forbid- !" he starts
>You cut him off
> "I don't care" you say in the same polite tone "I care too much about Clara to just bow down and say Ok. I have literally fought lions off of her"
>"You let one touch her!" 
>"And then I shattered the bones in his paw" you're polite, years of dealing with officers who just showed up and thought they knew how to run things taught you how to politely say fuck you and have them not be insulted
>"B-but we will cut off her funds then! You will be to blame for her having to dropout of college!" 
>He's trying you convince you by threatening her? What a cheap trick. But it's a trick that won't work.
>"Fine"
>His mouth is agape 
>"What do you mean FINE?!" he's starting to shout
>"Dear" Says Stacy
>"I can handle all her expenses" Stay calm and polite, let him lose his temper

>"I don't-" you start
>"YOU DON'T EVE HAVE A JOB AND YOU PROPOSE TO HANDLE HER MONEY!?
>You clear your throat loudly and intentionally
>"I don't need to work"
>This catches his attention
>"What? You don't need to work? What madness is this" he says half to you, half to himself
>Stacy looks confused too
>You look at Clara and give her paw a quick squeeze
>"No, I have enough set aside to last a long time due to good investments"
>You had never talked to Clara about you Financial status and she never asked
>"Plus I get disability Pay from the military thanks to this" you point to your right eye "And this" you point to your back
>He's looking at you differently
>"You were military?" he asks wide eyed "You fought in the war?"

>He motions at you and Clara
>Clara goes to stop you but you squeeze her paw, She knows family is a touchy subject
>"It's ok" you tell her
>"They're dead"
>Stacy and John Freeze 
>"W-wha" John is stuttering, 
>"Oh no, Anon I'm so sorry" Stacy has her paws over her heart
>"Don't be, it was a car crash. They didn't feel a thing, left me with property that I rent out or sold outright then I joined the military" 
>You Shrug
>"Good investing"
>He's looking at you in a different light
>you're no longer the human come to steal his daughter but the Man come to court her
>At least, that's what you hope
>"Look sir, I know Humans must have done awful things to you to make you flee mongolia, But that was before I was born"
>"Just give me a chance" you say you're still using a polite tone but a more friendly one
>"Besides I love your daughter" you say as you look into Clara's eyes
>Her ear flick at you and you feel her tail starting to wrap around you
>"Ohhhhhhh My little Girl" Stacy has her paws over Her mouth and looks on the verge of tears
>"John" She says, Whacking him on the Shoulder "Stop letting your grudge get in the way of our daughters happiness!"
>Oh god she's using the wife tone
>"I-I-I-I....Very well. But mark my words Mr.Anon you better not hurt her" he says relenting to his wife

>"I'm glad you were able to convince Da to let me stay with you" she says, looking up and you and nuzzling your chin
>"I had back up from you and your mom" you admit "I think he thought I was just going to bow down and leave" 
>You kiss her forehead and hug her tight
