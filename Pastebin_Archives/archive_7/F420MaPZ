>Be Kris
>Be mute
>Well… sort of
>More like so-socially-inept-you’d-rather-not-speak kind of mute
>Talking is a thing you can do, but you don’t want to
>Unless the situation demands
>Like the time you had to issue orders to your friends back in the Da-
>Nope, no
>Now’s not the time to think about that, you can think about it after the school
>Anyway, you have just arrived at the school you study and-
*sigh*
>The school your mom works for
>And that’s how you find yourself walking hand in hand with her
>You love your mom but by now she should realize how awkward it looks for her teenage son to be hand held by his mother
>…
>Guess that’s your punishment for being late and needing a ride
>At least you’re not so late that the classes started without you
>But the downside is that the other students are now staring at you holding hands with your mom
>And you can see the end of each lip, beak, snout, or whatever their mouths are, tilting upward
>Especially that bird guy, whatever his name is
>He’s got the smuggest grin
>As the main hallway door closes behind you two you let go of your mom’s fuzzy hands and with a quick and quite ‘bye’, you make a beeline toward your classroom
>”Kris”
>You flinch and freeze on your tracks; right foot paused right before it touched the floor
>”Aren’t you forgetting something?”
>Slowly turning your head back, you see your mom leaning down just slightly with her head turned, eyes closed and a puffed out cheek
>Hmmmmm…
>You purse your lips in displeasure
>Looking left and right nets you more barely held back laughs and jokes from your classmates and other students
>You could just ignore her and go to class, but…
>God dammit, you’re not this cruel
>With a deep sigh, you fully turn around and walk back to your waiting mom before leaning on the tip of your feet and pecking her on the cheek
>Deed done, she giggles and tussles your long hair, rewarding her with a pout from you
>Mom always liked messing with your hair
>Maybe you should cut it?
>Nah
>You like it the way it is
>Besides, SHE likes it long too
>Giving a final wave to your mom, you finally make your way to the classroom for real this time
>Ignoring all the looks, chuckles, giggles, and trying to hide your head inside your body like a turtle as much as you can
>Dammit Kris, why don’t you go sleep early so you wake your ass up early? All of this could be avoided if you didn’t spend all your night playing video games
>…
>Wait a minute…
>But you do go sleep early
>You just go to bed, and next thing you know you wake up, exhausted as hell, with your heart pounding and your chest hurting
>Your mom have taken you to the hospital when you were younger but the doctor said there was nothing wrong with you
>Hmm
>Your hand unconsciously cups your chin as your other grabs the handle to your classroom door and opens it
>Questions for later, you guess
>”Ah, K-Kris!”
>Your teacher, Ms. Alphys, all but shouts your name
>”You fina-*cough* you’re early, how wonderful”
>She claps her hands once and gives you a nervous smile, her eyes and corners of her mouth twitching
>A deadpan stare is all you’ll get out of this human teach
>Ignoring her entirely for now, you weave around the class for any free desk
>Finding one, you sit down and sigh
>Another boring day at school
>Picking your bag from your back, you place it on your desk and slam your head on it while you wait for the class to start for real
>Around you are the bird guy, the deer chick, the snake dude, and Tem
>You should really start learning their names
>Anyway
>Class’s kinda empty
>Did you really come this early?
>Looking at the clock over the blackboard, you see it still ten minutes left until classes start
>Oh wow, you really are early
>Maybe you can even take a nap?
>This bag sure is comfy
>Mom doesn’t like when she’s notified of your bad behavior in class, but right now you’re too sleepy to care
>Covering your yawn with a hand, you get more comfortable on your bag and start dozing off
>…
>…
*SLAM*
>A loud sound of wood slamming into something and half a dozen cries in surprise and fear wake you from your nap
>Blinking your eyes rapidly, you close them again and sit straight to stretch your back and arms, ignoring whatever’s going on for the time being
>Those joints aren’t gonna pop themselves
>Besides, you already have an idea of who is the cause of such ruckus
>A sigh of satisfaction leaves your mouth as your arms, back and fingers pop one by one
>Opening your eyes reveal what you already expected to see
>Susie
>Like always, she makes her grand entrance by not just being the last student, but coming super late
>Like
>Nearly an hour into the class
>And by slamming the door so hard it shakes the entire building
>…
>Okay, maybe not the building, but the classroom definitely
>Staring down at not just the cowering students, but the cowering teacher as well, she stands imposingly by the doorframe, like a statue, or a guardian
>Seriously, with her size and strength she could make a good buck as a bouncer
>No one would dare cross her path
>Especially with those sharp ass teeth of hers
>Like, once she threatened to bite your face off and you’re pretty sure she’s damn well capable of it
>Not just your face but the whole front of your skull along with it
>Susie’s crazy strong
>And she’s also the school’s delinquent, that’s why no one messes with her, not even the teachers
>Everyone just crap their pants if she as much as looks their way
>A thump and quick sound of iron dragging ever so slightly through the floor brings you out of your musings
>Susie has sat on the desk right by your side
>Leaning back, she crosses her feet over the desk; and her arms behind her head
>The thick bangs of her massive hair hides her eyes, and you can’t see whether she’s awake or asleep
>If you were to guess, it took probably around five minutes for class to process Susie’s appearance before the teacher restarts her lesson
>Blah, blah blah
>Lots of things you care little for
>You should be listening to the teacher, but the stuff she teaches is so boring
>It’s gonna bite in the ass in the future for sure, but you just don’t give a damn about any of this
>Sometimes you wish you were Mr. Perfect like your brother Asriel just so people would stop looking at you like you’re some kind of creep
>But then you’d have a bunch of non-genuine kiss asses wanting to be on your good graces
>For a second time in this day your musings are cut short when something hits you in the head
>Turning to the direction where the physical assault came from, you see Susie holding a half ripped eraser in the tip of her claws
>She just stares at you from behind her thick hair bangs before she gives you a smirk and a nod before going back to her previous position
>A smirk and a nod
>She had done it enough times that you know exactly what she means, and you can barely hold back your own smirk
>Suddenly your day won’t be entirely boring anymore
>You just gotta wait for the bell to ring
>And it does
>Ten minutes later, the bell rings signalizing recess
>It’s show time
>You wait for everyone to leave the classroom before you do
>Susie, as expected, makes her way out by shoving everyone out of her way
>Once the room is clear, with only the teacher, who didn’t even notice you were still there, behind, you stand up and make your way out
>You’re not even comment on the stuff she was watching on her phone when you caught a glimpse
>It was a quick glimpse, but you already wish you had some bleach to wipe your eyes and brain
>Hallways, now this is where the magic with begin
>Packed with students of multiple ages and races
>Well, just two, humans and monsters
>But monsters are so varied they might as well have a gazillion sub-races or species or something;
>Anyway, what you’re looking for is a specific monster
>Eyes wandering left and right, it doesn’t take long for your target to be acquired
>It’s easy to spot because the other students go around her by two feet or so
>It almost looks like she has some sort of protective barrier
>Susie is right there in the middle of the mob of students, with a soda can on her hand, just standing, chilling
>Waiting for you
>And off you go, avoiding the students, you try to look as natural as possible as you do this
>Reaching Susies’s bubble, you keep walking and bump shoulders with the taller girl
>When the can falls and spills its contents out, the entire hallway freezes
>Eying your surroundings, everyone is looking at you like a dead man walking
>And, well, they have every reason to think that
>You then feel a big clawed hand grab you by your sweater, heft you up and shove your back against the locker
>Hard
>You involuntarily let out a yelp of pain
>And see in front of you a furious looking Susie
>”What the hell is your problem, creep!? Are you blind as well as mute!?”
>You try explaining to her it was just an accident
>”Just an accident?”
>She leans her head to the side, an eyebrow raised, not that you could see it, but you can feel it
>She turns her head to the crowd that formed around you both and huffs, as if telling them ‘can you believe this guy?”
>”Accident my ass!”
>She punches the locker right by the side of my head, denting the blue painted steel inwards like it was made of cardboard
>”You had plenty of space to avoid bumping into me, and you did it anyways!”
>She brings her free hand to join the one holding your sweater and bringing you close to her face
>”Just so you know that cost me money, so you better pay up!”
>She pushes you against the locker and you slide down the floor
>”Or else”
>Looking at her you can only see the dragon girl cracking her fists and baring those terrifyingly sharp teeth
>Gulping a lump in your throat, you hastily shove your hands on your pockets in hopes of seeing if you have any spare money
>When you realize they’re empty, you gulp again, and slowly raise your head to meet the concealed eyes of your aggressor
>With a nervous, twitching smile, you shrug your shoulders
>Her response to your own is to somehow manage to crack her fists again, reach for your sweater’s collar, hoist you up again and start walking to… well, someplace
>You try to escape her hold, but she’s just too strong, and all you can do is struggle in her iron grip
>The crowd, too coward to do anything, are also too curious to not follow, so they go after to wherever Susie is taking you
>A few moments later and the two of you are in front of the abandoned classroom
>She opens the door, and literally throws your ass into the room
>”I’m going to enjoy this”
>She growls out, getting the crowd behind her to murmur and even make bets on whether I’ll survive or not, before entering the room herself and closing the door
>She picks a stray chair a little ways from the door and places it under the door handle, preventing anyone from entering
>”Now…”
>She speaks lowly, the grow still there
>”It’s payback time, freak”
>Susie states loud enough for anyone on the outside to hear before she turns around to face you
>Slowly stalking to you, she squats down over your legs and grabs the collar of your sweater again, before pulling your face towards her
>”Finally”
>Giving you a surprisingly soft kiss
>Well
>Not surprising to you, though
>You reciprocate her actions and bring your hands up, gently rubbing the scales of her face and her unruly hair
>Your touch makes her shiver in your hands
>”Haa, I needed this”
>She says between your pauses for breath
>”I missed you, you idiot”
>She says between kisses
>And so did you
>There was a problem with the gas pipes in the school so it was issued for all students and staff to be home for the duration of the fixing
>It took quite a few days to not just find the source of the problem but fix it
>So you couldn’t see Susie for quite some time
>You tell her that you two could see each other outside of school without the need to wait for school
>But she doesn’t give in, she never does
>She doesn’t even says where she lives
>”I have a reputation Kris, I can’t just go on a date in broad daylight”
>Resting her forearms on her knees, Susie huffs and blows your hair from your eyes for a moment
>”What will people think of me”
>You tell her that you already think she’s an almost-NEET who can barely handle a little bit of socializing
>And she pinches your cheeks really hard
>”You better watch that tongue of yours”
>She says between her teeth while you tap out
>”For someone who talk so little, you sure got a smart mouth”
>She lets go with a frown, but soon smirks while you rub your cheeks off the pain
>”Heh, you should be using it for something better instead”
>Grabbing your shoulders and lifting you up, she shoves you against a the wall, with her hands soon meeting the wall beside your head, as well her lips finding your own
>This time instead of small pecks, she kisses you deeper, nibbling your lips
>Meanwhile your hands travel all across her body
>Toned and rippling with defined muscles
>You don’t know whether she works out or not, but what you do know is that she’s hot under all those baggy clothes
>And you also know just much she loves having her scales caressed
>With the tip of your fingers, she flinches and moans in your mouth when you start outlining her muscly back under her shirt
>Not wanting to be outplayed, Susie shoves her long dragon tongue into your mouth and licks it all up
>Your teeth, the ceiling of your mouth, your tongue
>You try in vain to battle it out, but she completely dominates the insides of your mouth, and the outside too, as soon she start’s licking your face and neck, carefully dragging her sharp fangs on the fragile skin of your neck
>The fact that she could easily rip you apart in one move is both a scary and an arousing thought
>Is Ms. Alphys rubbing off on you somehow?
>Maybe, you don’t care, what you care is the girl in front of you
>As she continues to mark you all over, you decide to go one step further and start pulling out her clothes
>First, her long tattered jacket that’s too big for her
>Removing it reveals her sleeveless shirt underneath; as well her defined arms
>No boobs though, she’s a lizard after all, so Susie’s completely flat up there
>But what she lacks in breasts she makes up for something else 
>Next, with a deliberate grope to her behind, making her jump and yelp, you remove her belt and let her ripped jeans fall, revealing a pair of clean white panties
>This is what you’re talking about
>Wide, still developing hips, and an ass that should be considered illegal
>The kissing stops and Susie licks her lips before looking at you with another smirk
>”C’mon, you’re not done yet with that mouth, I did say you should use it, didn’t I?”
>She switches places with you and leans her back against the wall, spreading her legs ever so slightly, and the pulling her panty to the side, allowing you full eye contact with her slit
>She might look different from humans down there, from what you heard, but it doesn’t look any less enticing
>Kneeling down, you grab her thick, muscular thighs and pull your face to her entrance
>One lick makes her entire body shiver, her thick muscles clenching and hardening for a moment before they relax
>With deliberately slow movements, you drag your tongue up and down her slit, savoring the wetness of her womanhood
>Susie’s breathing hitches every time your tongue slightly invades her snatch, as if expecting you to commit, but you don’t, reveling on her cute moans and light breathing
>Letting go of one of her thighs, you pull your hand and press the base of her entrance without penetration while your tongue work on the top
>Her breathing hitches once more, her fingers curling as you pleasure her from two spots at the same time
>As you continue to tease her, however, her hands soon find themselves intertwined behind your hand, and pull you closer to her slit
>”S-stop with the teasing already, I told you to use that mouth, didn’t I?”
>Shoving our face deeper, you oblige and stick your tongue inside her pussy, hearing a breath intake from above
>”O-oh, god d-damn”
>You feel the shivers down her spine
>Her insides get violently ravished by your attack, every little bump and crevice of her pussy gets thoroughly explored, making the purple dragon tremble and moan under your ministration
>Soon you bring your hand and use two fingers and use them to open her slit wide and shove another two inside, pumping them in and out
>Up above you can hear something making a scratching sound, and turning your eyes up you see her with a dopey smile on her face, clawing the wall behind her, and giving it a nice set of slash marks
>Seeing her reaction fills you with determination
>You lick and suck her pussy with more vigor; fingers helping her reach the climax she so much desires
>Her entire body starts trembling, and you know that soon she’ll give in to the sweet release
>But surprisingly
>”N-no, wait!”
>She yelps, crouching down, not letting you finish your job
>”I- hah- I don’t want to finish like this”
>She gives you a tooth smile, before grabbing your shoulders and shoving you onto the ground
>Before you can ask what the hell she’s doing, she undoes your belt and with one pull, she removes your pants as well as your underwear, leaving you in just your sweater
>”It’d be a shame- hah- to end like that”
>She climbs up your waist and sits down on your hip
>Her round hot buns already hot dogging your diamond of a meat
>One doesn’t just get hard after all that
>”Now it’s my turn”
>Licking her lips, she raises her ass and pulls your dick down, before grinding her entrance against your length
>You let out a breath you didn’t know you were even holding as she continues to pleasure you cock
>Back and forth grinding, rotations, and of course, a good old hand job after your dick is properly lubed
>Her palms are rough and calloused from how much she fights, but during the time you were together, she learned how to be gentle and to not rip your dick off
>Slowly, she pumps your shaft up and down
>Reaching the head, she gives it a light squeeze and a lap around it before going down all the way to the base before she repeats the process
>Her other hand snakes behind and with careful movements, she massages your balls
>Gently squeezing them, while slowly dragging her claws down your scrotum, sending shivers down YOUR spine
>Your toes curl and you do your best not to moan out loud while Susie keeps pumping your cock
>Letting go of your balls, she pulls your sweater off and leans down to lick your face, before slowly going down along your neck and then stopping on your chest, where she begins teasing your nipples
>Her licks turn into kisses, and going the way back, she begins trailing small kisses from your pec, up your neck, and finally ending in your lips
>Sensing that your time is coming, you tap Susie on her thighs to get her to stop, and so she does
>Letting go of your lips, she sits up straight, and raises a little to align your cock up to her entrance
>”Had enough foreplay, huh?”
>You can see her foggy breathing coming from her nostrils and mouth, and all you do is nod
>Placing both of her hands on your chest, she slowly descend on your dick
>The inside of her pussy is tight and hot,
>Finally, she bottoms out, letting out a holding breath and a loud moan that she quickly stops with a hand to her mouth, opting instead to roll her eyes up
>She stays like that for what feels like hours, twitching in place, muscles tensing and relaxing all over
>Not long after, she replaces her hands on your chest and begins grinding her hips
>Cute little moans that betray her usual voice tone escape her mouth as she pleasures herself on your dick
>Not one to feel left out; you reach ddown and grab her hips, helping Susie with her grinding, before your hands slide down to her plump ass, where you give it a good squeeze
>”Hnnngh”
>She groans, biting her lower lip
>”Squeeze harder”
>And squeeze harder you do, flexing your fingers, you grab a handful of scaly ass and grope is as hard as you can
>”Hnnnngn, yes… j-just like that”
>Sher grinding comes to a stop before she starts bouncing on your dick
>Susie pulls herself from the entire length before letting gravity take place as she plops down on your cock with a wet slap
>Up and down, she bounces on your member, the hot sounds of flesh hitting flesh help in fueling your carnal desires for one another
>If anyone were to hear, you hope they’re dumb enough to think you’re getting smacked around
>With your hands still in her ass, you help her go faster by pulling her down as soon as she goes up, making her yelp and moan
>Her hand goes to her mouth again as you speed it up with thrusts of your own
>Susie falls chest to chest onto you, before she captures your lips again
>Her hot insides leak juices on the floor as you continue to thrust into her needy pussy
>With a heave, you throw your weight to the side and switch places
>Grabbing her hands and intertwining your fingers together, you thrust into folds her even faster and harder
>Her pussy tightens around your dick, making you grunt in pain and pleasure
>”O-oh shiiiiiii-hmmm“
>You give her a kiss to keep her quiet and continue to your onslaught
>Susie shoves her tongue into your mouth again and you kiss passionately during your love making
>You two feel it coming, however
>The twitches, the tightness, the heat
>It’s all coming together
>Susie locks her legs around your waist in a vice grip, nearly crushing you in half, and moans out in your mouth as she climaxes right before you
>Her legs hang in there before going slowly limp by your sides, small twitches harden her muscles for fractions seconds as she rides off a climax while still having you inside of her
>”I-ins-de”
>You don’t understand what she moans out, and you stop the kiss to listen better
>Taking her hands off of yours, she pulls your down touch foreheads, making you look into her eyes
>”I-I want you to cum inside”
>With a nod, you keep thrusting until you can’t possibly continue
>Snaking your arms around her back, she does the same and holds you around your head as your last thrusts shoots your seed deep into her, painting her insides with your cum
>Her back arches and her claws rip your skin, it hurts, but you don’t care
>You two pant breathlessly
>Both glistening with sweat
>The both of you look into each other eyes before sharing one last, quick, but passionate kiss
>Letting go, you drop your head onto her chest and recovers your breath
>A clawed hand touches your head and starts caressing your hair
>She always liked your long hair
>You’re so tired right now, you could just sleep here
>But recess will soon be over, and you have to go back to class unfortunately
>By soon, however, you mean ten minutes if the clock on that wall isn’t broken
>So you’ll stay here for now, on the company of the lovely delinquent dragon lady as she pets your head with surprising gentleness
>”That was… wow”
>She says breathlessly, and you give her a thumps up
>”Shouldn’t we, you know, get up”
>Five more minutes, you say
>She shrugs and smiles, before circling her arms around you again, holding you tight against her
>These five minutes, much to your charging, go by at the speed of light
>And you two find yourselves cleaning up as best as you can and putting your clothes on
>”Nice acting, by the way”
>You hear Susie call you out and smirk
>”You really sold that look and act of fear out there”
>Yeah, well, your acting skills has always been top notch
>You say, pulling the collar of your sweater forward as if you had a dress jacket
>”Yeah, sure, Christian Bale”
>If one were to try to hear really hard from outside they’d be hearing snickers all around
>Then, suddenly Susies’s laugh lowers and she continues to put on her clothes quietly
>”Hey Kris…. Sorry if I hurt you out there”
>You turn to see Susie finishing putting on her jacket
>”I don’t like that you have to put up with my act, but… I really appreciate it”
>She gives you a sincere smile, before she comes up to you and points at your face
>”And like I said before, keep use a secret as best as you can, or else”
>She makes the motion of breaking something in half
>And you gulp
>”Nah. Just joking”
>She circles an arm around your shoulders and pulls you close to her chest
>”If we get found out, I guess we’ll just have to live with it, but for now I don’t want other people knowing, alright?”
>She asks me with sincerity this time
>It’s clear that Susie doesn’t feel comfortable with the idea of other people knowing she’s in a relationship
>And given her infamy, it could probably not end up well for her
>So you give her a nod, a thumbs up, and the most sincere smile you can muster, which isn’t hard considering who you’re giving it to
>”Awesome”
>She pats your shoulder
>”Now I think we should be going back to class”
>Her eyes then turn to you
>”Or just you, I’m the delinquent, I can skip it and no one will care”
>She gives you a smirk, one of those that you really hate
>You wish you could skip class too, but if you do it your mom will be on your ass all day
>”Bye, Bye loser”
>She makes her way to the door before she freezes and face palms
“Ah, god dammit, everyone think I was beating you up, remember?”
>She turns back to you, then holding her chin
>”If you come out like this they’ll think I’m getting soft”
>You are getting soft, you say
>And your brilliant observation is rewarded with a light punch to the arm
>Coming from her it still hurts a lot, though no marks will be left
>Except the ones on your back
>You’re lucky today was kinda chilly and you came with a shirt underneath your sweater
>Anyway
>Looking around, you spot something that might help
>While she busies herself trying to think of something
>You grab a black marker on the floor
>It still has its lid, so hopefully it still works
>Puling the lid; you use the marker on the black board and voila, it still has ink in it
>A few seconds later you turn toward Susie and whistle just loud enough for her to hear in case there are still people on the outside
>Upon facing you, her eyes widen in confusion, and… is that worry?
>Waving the black marker in your hand, she finally gets what you did and sigh with a hand over her chest
>”For a moment I thought you got hurt or something”
>So you’re worried for me? You smirk
>”I-it’s not like that”
>The purple skin of her face gains a slight red tint before she turns around with her arms crossed
>”I-it’s just… you know”
>Walking up behind her, you surprise the dragon by circling your arms around her still developing waist and giving her a back hug
 >Susie flinches and becomes rigid for a moment before relaxing on your hold and just stands there, enjoying the contact
>Funny that she feels next to no embarrassment when it comes to sex, but things like holding hands, hugging and cuddling gets her all red faced and flustered
>You say there’s nothing wrong with her worrying for you
>It just shows that you have a girlfriend who really cares 
>At those words she turns around in your grip and circle her own arms around you
>”Don’t say things like that, idiot”
>She smiles softly, before letting go and going back to the door so she can leave
>As Susie removes the char holding the door back, you can’t help but say
“I love you”
>You say loud and clear
>Susie stops dead on her tracks, before she turns around and rushes in your direction, taking you in her arms for a nice, tight hug, a beaming smile on her face
>”I love you too”
