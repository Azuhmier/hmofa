Chapter 1

>Be anon
>God damn this stupid class today
>Some historical shit about weather it was ethical or not for the first generation anthros, or as they were called "Nubeasts", to be used for menial labor and for what amounted to slavery.
>It was so long ago that the last descendants of that first generation were long dead.
>All of the guys and girls around you were second and third generation. 
>Now fully integrated into the world around you seamlessly 
>You kept your hand on your chin
>Only barely able to stay awake through the monotone droning of your teacher
>The girl in front of you was at least kinda cute 
>Some tiny mouse from the band that you halfway recognized
>Her tail was swaying back and forth in her seat
>The words from the teacher soon being just background noise as you zoned in on the area in front of you
>Being a teenager in a world of cute fuzzy girls wasn't so bad maybe. 
>You wondered what she's look like naked?
>Always a vexing question when you went to a private academy
>All of you wore the same kind of outfit. 
>The boys wore a pair of blue or khaki slacks with either a polo or a oxford 
>And the girls in either a skirt with that same kind of polo shirt or oxford
>You were just a normal human.
>Your parents deciding that the gene therapy option during your development was either too risky or just not worth the potential benefits. 
>It kind of made you stand out here
>But your thoughts kept drifting back to that rump in front of you
>Only being snapped away from them by the ringing of the bell
>You simply ignored his instructions at the end of class
>You had accidentally did this assignment last night figuring they would both be due this week. 
>So you had the rest of the week all to yourself
>You and your little project that is. 
>You smiled as you grabbed your backpack
>Hefting it over your shoulders and standing up
>You walked though the halls of this place
>Some letter jacket wearing lion and the rest of his dick bag "squad" were hanging out looking over their data pads at the cars they were so keen to get a hold of when they graduated. 
>"Nah bro the Bugatti Trion is the only car I'd want if I could have it"
>You just kept to yourself
>Even though the school made every species with claws trim their claw's or horns to be blunted they could still in all likely hood kick the shit out of you
>So you kept walking towards the bus
>Eventually seeing the striped tail of a feline walk around the corner
>You picked up the pace slightly
>Holding your hand down at the ready palm up and open towards the swaying limb 
>And as you grabbed it you heard a short high pitched "Mew"
>You smiled as you rounded the corner after her
>"ANON you dick bag!"
>You couldn't help but smile. 
>"Ohh careful kitty. What will your mother think if she knew you talked like that?"
>You said with an absolute shit eating grin. 
>"Probably the same thing your dad would say if he caught you smoking shithead"
>You smiled and leaned back against the wall
>"Yeah yeah probably"
>The owner of that tail was a punky kind of girl named Alice
>You two had known each other for a long time now
>She being one of the first anthro's you'd met here that hadn't turned you away for being "just a human"
>Despite her appearance now she was punk at heart
>Loving showing off her piercings when she wasn't at school
>You had to go in with her to get her first
>She acted so tough right up until they put the little needle against her ear
>You had made fun of her for so long after that
>You still had a scar on your hand from when she bit down on it to keep from screaming
>Piercings were cool right up until the point when you realize cats have SUPER sensitive ears. 
>"So what are you getting up to tonight monkey boy"
>You shrugged and took out your data pad
>Thumbing through the stupid shit the school sent you
>Art's program is having a bake sale for a new pottery kiln!
>The Weight room is now open again after the recent damages incurred last week.
>And then you saw it
"Oh fuck yes!"
>She turned her head to face you her ears perked
>"What's up?"
"My intake manifold finally came in!"
>She looked at you deadpan
>"In english gearhead..."
>You turned the screen to face her
>A picture of perfect milled steel wrapped up in shrink wrap in a big box on the step to your house
>Well your parents house
>But what highschooler would ever phrase it that way?
"Its the last part of that antique car me and dad have been working on!"
>She was aloof about it still
>"Lot of effort to go though for some old gas burning piece of crap if you ask me."
>She looked in her backpack
>Fishing around in it for something you didn't quite see
"Oh fuck you. You know just how much ass that thing will kick when its done."
>You could see it now
>Those last few bolts turning before closing the door and turning the key
>It was a good thing your granddad had connections with all these old "NASCAR" guys
>Whoever the hell they were
>Some kind of racing league that had died out a while ago
>But all that didn't matter now
>Yours was a one track mind to get back home
"You want to help?"
>She wrinkled her nose at the offer
>Then after a few seconds relented 
>"Oh fine... Its better than listening to my mom try to girlify my clothes I guess."
>Then she pointed a clawed finger at you
>"But don't you go spilling gas on me again this time asshole!"
>she frowned and started walking with you
>"It took so long to wash that smell out of my fur!"
"Then next time don't go messing around with shit fuzzball"
>You quipped back quickly
>"I only messed with it because it was in an old looking can. How was I supposed to know you kept it in an old rusty piece of crap?"
>But the two of you kept walking towards your neighborhood
>The two of you making simple small talk and feeding the rumor mill while you watched those electric cars wizz by
>You could already see it
>That rumble 
>That vigor
>You were so excited that you unknowingly picked up the pace
>"Easy there killer"
>She said as you were now a few feet in front of her
>"Did you hear a single thing I just said?
>You gave an embarrassed shrug 
"Sorry I was in another world. I'm just so fuckin hyped!"
>She gave a short exhale and a smug as grin
>"Jesus anon no wonder you cant get any. You have to listen to girls when they talk to you"
>You could see the shadow of her tail give a flick as she caught up to you
>"So how long do you think this is going to take?"
>You thought it over in your head for a little bit
"The biggest pain is going to be the gasket. But after that. I already have everything plumbed and ready to go."
>She untucked her shirt and rolled her skirt regaining some of that punk look now that they were away from the school
>"Good. I want to see whats going on for concerts this weekend and the internet at your house sucks ass."
>You ignored that comment now that you were in sight of your goal. 
>A decent neighborhood
>Regular houses with regular people doing their ordinary things. 
>But that garage was now in sight
>Oh how you wanted to be in there right now
>The both of you walked up to the garage door
>You took a key up out of your pocket and stuck it in the old and sort of rusty padlock
>turning the key you too the thing off and undid the additional latch
>And with a heft you opened up the door
>What awaited you was to you a thing of beauty.
>A old outdated thing to nearly everyone else that should have been sent to the scrapheap ages ago 
>But you kept it alive
>That old American spirit
>It was a 1969 Chevrolet 1500.
>The paint on it just recently having been finished
>That deep glossy black looked so goo in the afternoon light.
>Alice strode right on past you and planted her ass in the creeper chair next to the workbench
>Whipping out her data pad and scrolling along. 
>"So where's the part?" She asked without looking up
>There was a new cardboard box on the bench A few stains from old oil and the smell of an old mechanic's shop covering it
"Its sitting right next to you dummy"
>You took a screwdriver off the counter and stuck it into the packing tape. 
Ripping into it like a child on Christmas
>But eventually it was revealed to you
>An Edlebrock
>This was the last piece you needed
>After a few hours of turning wrenches and your faithful compatriot getting some tools for you it was done
>That last bolt turning and tightening home
>It was done
>There was only one thing left to do
"Look at that thing."
>Your friend turned her gaze up from the glowing pad
>"Are you done?" 
>She was still only slightly interested
"Hopefully..."
>There was a bit of worry in your voice
>You stood next to the engine looking over every single component 
>The engine itself Gleaming silver and red 
>Those bright gleaming chrome valve covers shining with the exception of a few smudges from your fingers
"Only one way to find out I guess... Here goes"
>You walked over to the door and opened it 
>Sliding onto the bench seats and kicking up a tiny bit of dust when you sat down
>You slid the key into the ignition with an anticipation that could not be described with words
>You could feel your heartbeat in your fingers as you paused 
>Then your turned it hoping with all your heart that your efforts would be rewarded.
>Click
"What?"
>Your turned it again
>Click
>And with that your heart fell into your gut
"What the fuck did I do wrong?"
>You had hyped yourself up so much for this
>You had thought you checked over everything
>And this god damn thing didn't even sputter!
>You slammed your hand on the wheel
>Doing nothing but making your hand hurt
>"What happened? She leaned on the passenger window
>Her tail flicking back and firth behind her
"I don't fucking know... I checked over everything!"
>She looked around trying to help in a lukewarm way
>"Did you hook up the battery?"
>Your temper flared and you spat back at her
"Of course I fucking did!"
>She opened the door again and slammed it closed
"God fucking dammit!"
>You held your hands on your hips and looked over the gleaming jet black paperweight 
"I need to smoke..."
>You turned back towards the door and started to walk out Alice following close behind you
>You closed the garage door and walked towards your house without looking at her. 
"I'll meet you at our spot after I change"
>Even if you couldn't see it you should have felt it
>Her ears bent down against her skull as you slammed the door behind you
>Her tail limp as she turned back towards her house

Chapter 2

>You had met up a little bit later
>The two of you walking back through a long abandoned service road
>The return road to a drag strip that had been closed down many many years ago
>The two of you liked to smoke right be where the tree used to be mounted
>That long stretch of blacktop now cracked and ruined for racing
>Weeds and other greenery now growing back over the place
>It was kind of sad now
>You coughed on your cigarette 
>Alice gave you a light laugh
>"Whats the matter? First time smoking bitch lungs?"
>You gave her a groan as you kept on hacking
>Trying with some success to catch your cough
>You eventually settled
>Leaning against the bleachers that overlooked the track
"I just don't fucking get it"
>She gave you a sour look as she spoke again
>"Are you still obsessing over that thing? You just fucked something up somewhere. You'll figure it out."
>You were silent after her light chastisement
>You wanted to argue with her
>Tell her that it couldn't be your fault
>That it was one of the parts that must have been broken
>But after you got the wind taken out of your sails an hour ago you just couldn't bring yourself to bother with it
>So you simply lifted your cigarette to your mouth again
>Like a nerdy high school John Wayne
>There was a long silence Just enjoying the quiet between you two 
>There was a reason you two got along so well 
>The both of you didn't need to fill the air with pointless small talk 
>But it didn't last forever and you decided to ask her something
"So did Gauge pick up the hint?"
>Her eyes didn't move away from where she was looking
>"No..."
>She reached down and picked the cig from between your fingers 
>Lifting it to her lips and taking a drag before offering it back to you 
>"Dumb bastard can't take a hint. Starting to really piss me off too"
>You accepted it looking at it as the small cherry ever so slowly began to burn down.
>You looked up to say something but the words stuck in your mouth.
>You wanted to offer some kind of help
>She was your friend after all 
>Your best friend. 
>But nothing came to mind.
>You had a decent idea of how to ask a female out on a date. 
>What all to say, and how to act, and how to present yourself. 
>But you had no fucking clue on what a female should do to attract a man she likes
>Maybe one of the gay dudes at school could help her
>God knows there was enough of those closeted faggots on the sports teams
>There is no way in hell those dudes spend so much time in the weight room looking at other buff as fuck dudes grunting and sweating for the fun of it. 
>But your train of thought was way off track now
>You looked out on the track 
>Your minds eye clearing away the bushes and weeds 
>The track's staging lines full of rumbling snorting cars and trucks 
>The stands packed full of people as they watched two drives and their cars get ready to show down 
>The tree lighting up as they inched into the staging lights
>One then the other 
>Then a quick succession of three amber lights
>Then green 
>And like thunder both cars exploded forwards
>The sounds of the exhaust shaking the ground
>Each cylinder going off in those monsters punching you in the chest with the sheer show of unbridled horsepower. 
>And then it would all be over in a few seconds. 
>All to start over again. 
>She must have noticed your self induced trance and moved her tail about 
>"But what about you? Managed to find any lucky ladies that enjoy the stink of oil and grease gear-head?"
"Ha fuckin ha..."
>You wanted to come up with a clever comeback
>But she beat you to the punch again 
>"Don't worry I'm sure once you make that dinosaur run again those girls in the old folks home will be all over your dick."
>She laughed at her own joke and did her best impression of an elderly voice 
>"Oh wow sonny. This old pickemup truck reminds me of waaaay back when I got my first iPhone!"
>You smiled sideways at her jab 
>Taking one last drag of your cigarette And then snuffing the end out on the bleachers. 
"Lets get headed back. I got some homework to do tonight."
>You lied hoping she'd buy it
>She nodded in agreement 
>"Yeah. I have some chemistry to do before Mr. Hollowell has a fucking conniption fit."
>So you both stood up and you walked back along the trail
>She followed a bit closer to you than she normally did 
>Her tail swaying behind you 
>Every so often brushing up against your calf as you walked along the trail 
>Her's was a... Bare frame
>Her chest wasn't very significant 
>Not like some of her bigger classmates. 
>Some of those bovine chicks looked absolutely ridiculous
>And her slim waist wasn't going to be posted in playboy magazine anytime soon 
>But it all seemed like she was in good proportions. 
>Everything about her seemed to match
>You could see it all in her shadow as the sun set behind you. 
>But you kept on walking. 
>Keeping going until you were back in your back yard 
>You heading towards your back door while she walked towards hers. 
>"See ya tomorrow!"
>You waved and she did as well in return. Disappearing inside the house as you closed the screen door behind you. 
>You didn't waste any time with bullshiting with your buddies over your computer.
>Way too much mental effort had been expended today and you were dead tired
>Simply flopping forwards onto your halfway made bed and passing out right then and there. 
>The night passes with only a few flashes in your sleep. 
>A swaying tail 
>Grey stripes and the feeling of soft fur rubbing against you
>A rough tongue 
>Soft panting breaths
>Flashes of light of shadow dancing against your own body.
>And with a heaving breath you woke up 
>What kind of dream was that 
>You tried to collect the rapidly dissolving fragments of memory
>But the harder you grasped at them the further they slipped away 
>Well one way or another you were up now. 
>Looking down at the clock you saw you were up about an hour early. 
"Eh... fuck it"
>And with that you turned over and slip off the bed
>Groggily going down the stairs towards the pantry
>After slapping a pop-tart in the toaster you looked over at the door just outside the kitchen 
>Eh fuck it maybe you'll just throw the tarp over it before you go to school
>So you walked out into the stale air of the garage 
>The hood was still open.
>You reached up to grab at the glossy black metal and looked down one last time before you closed it. 
>But something caught your eye
>The battery...
>One of the terminals was bare...
"Son of a BITCH"
>You were going to have to apologize to Alice now.
>So with a frustrated sigh you went up to grab a simple pair of pliers. 
>Securing the wire in place and making sure both of the wires was correct. 
>You stepped over to the driver's side and pried open the door. 
>Turning the key and you heard it 
>The sputter
>The starter motor turning again and again and again
>Then it coughed
>And coughed again 
>And they you were finally rewarded. 
>That big V8 kicked over
>The rumble of the engine pounding in your ears as you smiled 
>You wanted to rev it 
>And as you pressed the gas it sputtered again 
>And then died 
"What the fuck?"
>You stared at the still lit up dash
>Wondering to yourself just what the hell had gone wrong this time 
>You could feel your temper rising again 
>Until your gaze wandered over the gas gauge...
>Empty 
>So after a few more moments you had the tank topped off.
>Gas was expensive but it was soooo worth it to make this thing run. 
>After you filled it up and topped off the other fluids you checked your watch 
"OH Fuck!" 
>Only 20 minuets until school started
>You sprinted upstairs to get changed into your school uniform
>Throwing on your pants and shirt in a rapid and almost panicked manner your shoes following quickly thereafter
>Running down the stairs you scooped up your backpack. And went out the door to hope to catch the bus. 
>Only to see the huge electric truck rounding the corner.
>Your heart fell out of your chest again 
>That sinking cold feeling that creeps into you when you know you've fucked up
>And then you remembered it 
>Those old shining keys in your pocket. 
>With a smile you turned around. 
>Throwing open the garage door and let that beast see sunlight for the first time in a long time.
>Hopping in you tossed your pack on the bench seat. 
>Turning the key you heard that engine turn over 
>The feeling of generations worth of untapped power coursed through your veins
>And as you put the thing into gear and stepped on the pedal you felt the thing plant you back in the seat. 
>Those fat rear tires screeched on the smooth cement.
>And you had to crank the wheel hard as you flew out into the street 
>A small cloud of blue smoke appearing behind you as you burned some oil that had pooled in the cylinders. 
>You heard the engine rev up as your foot pressed down on the gas
>Those horses finally being set free after so many years dormant. 
>The corner where the bus disappeared approached quickly 
>Slamming on the brakes was nothing like the learning vehicles the school had set up for them a few weekends ago 
>The tires locked right up 
>There were no electronic hand holders here 
>No ABS, no collision warning system, no traction control
>This thing was raw
>So carefully you turned the wheel and drove off towards school
>After a harrowing drive you pulled into the parking lot
>The sleek shapeless blobs that went for cars now littering the blacktop
>You pulled the truck into a parking spot and stepped out with shaking legs 
>A big stupid grin plastered across your face 
>Grabbing your bag you locked the doors of the truck 
>Slipping the keys into your pocket as you walked inside the school.

Chapter 3

>The whole day seemed to be brighter 
>Even if your mind kept wandering back to how your truck had felt on the way here 
>You wondered if anyone had seen you when you pulled in 
>Your imagination running wild with the possibilities 
>You were the first guy in your class to get a car 
>Not only that but it was yours and yours alone
>No payments to worry about
>This was awesome 
>You pulled out your keys as you walked through the halls towards your next class
>Your thumb rubbing over the tiny thing and admiring it 
>"Hey anon!"
>You looked up from your object of fixation 
>Two canines were standing off to the side of the hall next tot their lockers you assumed
>You didn't recognize either of them right off the bat
>They were way too cute to ever be seen hanging around your nerdy ass. 
>One of them a very shapely labrador retriever by the look of it
>Wearing a tacky as hell collar with her name on it
>Cally was apparently her name.  
>The other one a bit taller Doberman. 
>So while you wanted to respond with a quick quip telling them to fuck off your stupid teenage brain had better plans 
"H-hey whats up?"
>Smooth
>"We saw you got a car! Its super old isn't it?"
>You put the key back in your pocket
>You had to bite back the urge to unleash your autism 
>To not go on and on about the specifics of your baby 
"Yeah. Its a classic"
>In stereotypical canine enthusiasm their tails wagged behind them
>Looking to each other and smiling
>"You know anon you're the only guy in our class with a car."
>You knew damn well that was true 
>You wouldn't be in such a good mood if that wasn't the case. 
>So you responded again with a smile 
"Yep! Pretty proud of it too. I built most of it myself... With my dad's help for some parts of it"
>They just laughed
>these two couldn't be any more stereotypical if they tried
>It felt pretty good to have them approach you though
>But in the back of your mind something felt hollow 
>But your hormonal teenage mind swiftly pushed those negative thoughts into the dark recesses of your mind 
>"Do you think after class we could get a ride home from you?"
>The doberman spoke up right after her
>"After cheer practice that is."
>You nodded a little too quickly 
"Sure. She's got more than enough horsepower to haul around a little extra weight"
>Almost instantly your mind went cold 
>Well there it went
>Your chance at ever being accepted by anyone of the female gender
>Your chances of ever getting laid went away at the speed of sound with those words alone 
>At least they seemed to take it in stride 
>the doberman putting on a grin and getting a little closer to you
>"I'm sure its got plenty of horsepower."
>Was... Was that a flirt?
>You felt a blush coming on 
>Why the fuck were you like this?
>With Alice you weren't ever like this 
>With her you could talk like a normal person
>Not a blushing stuttering pasta spilling mess 
>So you pointed over your shoulder towards your next class 
"I have to head to class. I'll see you after school."
>Cally waved back at you 
>"See you later!"
>You turned back to walk down the hall
>If you weren't in a hell of a good mood before you sure as hell were now. 
>Despite the nearly astronomical failure you just experienced
>You didn't even care that the teacher in this class was as exciting as watching grass grow
>You had something to look forward to now
>And so the rest of the day went fast 
>Way faster than even you expected 
>And that bell rang out right on time 
>Once again you picked your back up off the back of your chair and hoisted it onto your back 
>You pushed open the door and stuck your hand in your packet to grab your keys 
>Walking out the door and you saw Alice
>She looked oddly nice today 
>Not that she didn't look good normally 
>But her hair was brushed a little better maybe 
>If it wasn't normally so disheveled your wouldn't have noticed. 
>You waved at her and smiled
"Wasup Alice!"
>She turned around and waved back with a smile on her face 
>You walked towards her only about halfway there remembering something 
>She was right yesterday about you forgetting something 
>So your ego about how well the day had gone deflated slightly 
>As soon as you were closer to her you spoke up 
"Sorry about last night... You were right."
>Her head tilted slightly 
>"What the hell are you talking about?"
>You hooked your thumb over your shoulder pointed at the pickup that sat in the parking lot
"You were right about me forgetting something... I forgot to attach the battery cables."
>You were glad that your mannerisms weren't as obvious as some of the anthros at this school 
>Otherwise your ears would be tucked against your skull right now with your tail between your legs
>But Alice quickly forgave you 
>Slapping you in the back with that cocky smile again 
>"No worries man! I'm just glad it was some small stupid thing, not a big deal right?"
>You kept fiddling with the keys in your hand
"Yeah... I still feel like a dickhead for yelling at you though."
>She just stood right next to you and smiled
>"No worries dude. Its alright. We all fuck up some times."
>She gave you a reassuring pat on the back waiting a few seconds to keep on talking 
>"So is it everything you hoped it would be?"
>You brightened right up after that 
"Oh fuck yes! That thing is everything I'd hoped it would be. I cant wait to get some more seat time. I only drove it for like 15 minuets."
>You looked over at the truck
>It was the most beautiful thing in the world to you right then and there
>Sitting in the evening sun 
>That gleaming black paint flawless like it just rolled off the factory floor
>If you were brave enough maybe you'd let someone else drive it just to be able to see it rolling by
>Then again fuck that. 
>She was your baby and anyone else would drive her over your dead body
>Alice scoffed and spoke again
>"Get yourself a man who looks at you like anon looks at his truck"
>You tore your eyes away from it to face her again 
"No girl here has lines like her"
>Her comeback was quick from that as well
>"No girl here weights two tons either."
>You both laughed at that one
>Keeping up talking about games and the normal conversations between you two 
>Eventually her datapad went off
>Reaching into her bag she pulled out the device and unlocked it
>"Oh fucking hell. Mom wants me home early to help her go shopping. You going back now?"
>You shook your head. 
"Nah. I've got something going on here in a bit. I'm hanging out here for a while"
>she gave you a little elbow jab. 
>"Ohhh Anon who's the lucky girl?" 
>She said with a wry attitude
"Nothing like that. Just some things I need to take care of"
>"Oh. Alright then."
>If you were paying more attention you would see her ears droop a little bit when you said that 
>She flicked her tail and began walking towards the sidewalk
>"I'll see you at home if you want to hang out later."
>You waved back to her and began walking back towards your vehicle
>Only about an hour later you saw the doors to the gym being pushed open
>The whole cheer squad walking out at nearly the same time
>Your eyes scanning the small group for your two potential dates. 
>And there they were. Splitting off from the rest of the group.
>They were still wearing their cheer uniforms 
>Holy
>Shit
>They made a "B" line straight for you
>You reached over and pulled up on the lock and let them slide inside 
>"Are you sure I can ride in the middle of this thing?"
>Her tail was brushing up against the leg of your jeans 
"Uh.. Sure yeah there's a belt in the middle"
>She reached down next to you and fished around for the clasp
>Finding it and pulling it over herself and sliding the metal clip into place 
>Her friend Cally sliding in after her 
>"Hey anon does this thing have bluetooth?"
>You shook your head 
"Nope. Just a radio. Though I might cash out for a better deck soon if I want it."
>She pouted a little bit and then slid her datapad back into her bag 
>"Awww I wanted to listen to my music"
>You were kind of thankful for your archaic vehicle right then and there
>Who knows what kind of drivel these two listened to 
>Cally gave her address to you and you punched it into your datapad before you set it in her friends lap
"Can you navigate?"
>She nodded her head 
"Cool."
>You slid the key into the ignition and with a loud rumble that caused both of them to yelp and jump slightly you pulled it into reverse and began to pull out of the lot. 
>Turning left you felt that big V8 start to pull 
>Quickly moving the car up and a little past the speed limit 
>You watched as Cally rolled down the window 
>Undid her seatbelt
>And stuck her head out the window 
>You almost slammed your foot on the brakes
>What the hell?
>Then you remembered
>Dogs 
>You smiled at her primal display
>Enjoying the view of her wagging tail swishing over her skirt as she kept her head in the breeze
>Letting her tongue lull out of her mouth as you cruised along
>You kind of felt used at this point.
>Now knowing what they wanted out of you 
>But when you were getting to cruise around town with two cheerleaders in your new, to you, truck
>It was a small price to pay
>Eventually the three of you pulled into her driveway by the doberman's directions 
>Cally slipping back down into her seat and opening the door. 
>Walking quickly to your side and tanking you 
>Then she gave you a teasing little lick
>Right across the cheek
>You felt your little friend downstairs spring to life 
>Your face flushing red as Cally gave you a wave and walked back towards her house
>Your passenger spoke up to break you out of your trance 
>"Its a dog thing. You'll get used to it"
"I don't think so..."
>She slid over in her seat and spoke again 
>"What was that?"
"Nothing!"
>You said quickly to divert the subject 
"Where's your house?"
>She quickly entered in the address and set it down on the seat between you two
>And so you were off again
>As soon as you got onto the main road she pulled the same routine as her friend
>But something was different this time 
>Maybe it was just her body shape or the fitment of her skirt 
>But every so often a gust of generous and blessed wind would blow through the cabin and push up her skirt slightly 
>And she was too enthralled with the breeze blowing over her face to care. 
>But you did
>And were it not for the fact that you were driving 
>You would take more than just a curious glance. 
>Every little slip of that panty line egged you on a little further. 
>Your best friend below doing nothing to restrain himself 
>It was everything you could do to keep your eyes on the road 
>Nearly missing a few stop signs along the way 
>But the two of you made it there in one piece 
>Her home was in a super nice area of town
>Having to pull through a gate to her house was something you'd never had to do before 
>That thrumming engine slowly pulling you two up the long driveway 
>But eventually it got the both of you up there 
>Her butt slipping down and resting on the seat for a second before she leaned over towards you and picked up your datapad from your backpack 
>You wanted to ask her what she was doing before she typed in a few things and set it back on your lap
>Where your very obvious bulge sat 
>You were shell shocked to say the least 
>"Call me tomorrow after school if you want to give me another ride."
>And with a little pat on the device she slid back the other way and out of your truck 
>Closing the door gently on her way out 
>You watched her go all the way to her house 
>Disappearing behind the large glass decorated door and out of your line of sight. 
>You looked down at the wheel of your truck and patted it with the biggest shit eating grin of your life
>Revved the engine once and put it into reverse to get back home 
>As you pulled into the driveway of your house a you saw Alice standing by the garage
>You pulled right up next to her and shut the engine down 
>The light plinking sounds of hot metal cooling down filling the air for a second before she spoke 
>"The hell took you so long? Did ya get lost?"
>With that same wry grin smeared on your face you responded
"Just had a few things to drop off"
>You stood up and got out of the truck 
>Her ears standing straight up and her eyes going wide as you closed the door 
>"Christ anon you like driving it that much?"
>And to your horror
>You realized what she was talking about 
>You said nothing 
>You reached in for your backpack and covered your shame 
>She began to laugh lightly
>Then harder
>Way harder 
>Your blush could be seen from outer space at this point 
"Oh fucking Christ I'm sorry"
>She kept laughing a hearty laugh
>"I knew you loved this thing but I didn't know you wanted to stick your dick in her tailpipe Anon!"
>And she just kept laughing 
>Eventually you readjusted yourself to be presentable and her raucous laughter died off 
>"C'mon. I jacked my brother's pack. Lets head out"
>And with a look of utter humiliation still fresh on your face you nodded 
>Throwing your backpack over your shoulder and following her down the wooded trail to the old track.
