>there might have been some merit to the whole thing
>for months before the salt and dirt was scattered around there was weird occurences around your house
>it started as chairs tipping and moving
>then it got so bad that a standing lamp flew across the room at you
>but once that mix was put down, nothing
>no weird stuff
>just... life
>maybe you should get some and it might keep Asha out
>chuckle while you go up a flight of the stairs
>"Something funny?"
>she looked back at you from a few stairs higher than you
>mumble something about graveyard dirt and salt
>her eyes noticably narrow
>"You know, I heard that it helps against curses. I'm not *exactly* sure though. That's not the kind of thing I'm into."
>if you weren't scared shitless of supernatural hoodoo things, you'd call bullshit
>hell, if you did call BS then she'd probably do something to curse your bloodline forever
>maybe even give all your children crab claw hands like that one dude that was a circus freak turned murderer
>what
>find yourself staring at the doorway to your apartment
>no door
>that's several feet into the living room
>glance at Asha then the doorway
>was it really that weak to begin with?
>go to the kitchen and take out your screwdriver and extra screws
>start pulling the door toward before Asha helps out
>"S-Sorry. I didn't want to wait any longer. It'll be fixed tomorrow anyway won't it?"
>nod your head and start screwing it back into the doorway
>it might be fixed tomorrow, but you don't trust your neighbors with anything
>this isn't exactly the best place to live
>"Yeah, it isn't. I didn't expect *you* to be living here of all places. Not with how well you were doing in your classes."
>ask her if intelligence is dictated by someone's monetary status
>"I don't... I don't understand."
>get a little angrier
>ask the question a second time
>"N-no."
>she's probably just saying what you want to hear
>mentally wave it off while screwing in another screw
>it'll only be a quick fix
>at least until the next today
>sigh, place the screwdriver on the coffee table, and fall back into your shitty couch
>try to ignore Asha being there
>it doesn't work
>not with her staring right at you
>ask her why she's staring
>"I'm not staring! I'm just, uh, looking at you.
>somewhat creepy, what with that black skull-like pattern on her face
>stand to go grab your laptop from your room
>Asha follows like a lost dog
>when you turn away from her, she belly flops on your bed
>"Ugh, where'd you get this mattress? It's one of the worst I've ever laid on."
>say it was the only one you could afford with your meager earnings
>"What happened to you Anon?"
>she looks up from the pillow her muzzle was in and right at you
>sit at the edge of the bed
>begin to tell her what happened in the last few weeks of your Junior year at NBU
>about the party you went to when a "friend" convinced you to go
>the friend talking all sorts of shit behind your back
>the drinking
>and the false allegations brought against you afterwards
>it got you kicked out of college, even with several witnesses backing you up
>these things came and went though
>you were a social outcast
>the disenfranchised
>your life and dreams ended when you were kicked out
>no other schools would take you
>everyone from NBU thought you were a horrible person
>your mother all but disowning you
>and there wasn't anything you could do
>so you settled for a soul crushing job and moved into a horrible apartment that you could barely afford while working 70 hours a week without a day off
>rock bottom had come and went
>now you're a step below and contemplating unspeakable things twenty times before noon
>push off the edge of the bed and look right at her
>"And this time loop is just the icing on the shit cake, Asha."
>grab the laptop again and take it to the living room
>open in and put on some old shows from Adult Swim
>8 oz. Rat and then Butty McRee
>too early for all this shit

>noon came around earlier than it should have
>Asha seemed fine with sticking around and watching the shows too
>while you should be worried about having her that close to any vital organs, it was fun
>keep telling yourself Stockholm Syndrome isn't real
>a rumbling came from your stomach when it realizes you haven't had anything to eat today
>your company noticed the sound and motioned towards the door
>"Do you want to go and get something to eat? There's a place a few blocks down with great coffee and sandwichs."
>tell her you'll go
>"Alright, Let's go!"

>it took a few minutes to walk down the street and get to the place she was talking about
>Renee's
>Asha walks through the door and you soon follow
>get in line right behind her
>there were a few people ahead of you two, but they got their orders fast enough
>the canine gets to the frong and starts looking at the menu
>"Alright. I'll have a medium vanilla latte and a cheese danish. Anon, what do you want?"
>she steps back for a moment so you can see the menu
>you don't look at that though
>your eyes lock onto the person working behind the counter
>a white haired bunny anthro with her head fur spiked and dyed in a myriad of colors
>boxy black rimmed glasses
>green shortsleeve shirt and brown apron over her front
>this, Anon, was the person that got you kicked out of NBU
>the rage from years ago didn't come right away
>a look of pure hatred overtook your bored, placid demeanor
>fire burning behind your eyes
>move in front of Asha and slam your hands on the counter
>nearly spit in the bunny's face
>"*YOU* go on living like nothing happened. You're a horrible person. Your parents go to bed at night wishing the doctor had succeeded at aborting you."
>spit on her apron and walk out of the coffee shop
>back to your apartment
>and back to bottling up your feelings
>only shaming yourself in the basement of your apartment complex by getting drunk off tiny wines
>get through your door and lay down on the couch
>it felt good to get it off your chest though
>Asha comes back a few minutes later with her danish in hand
>sits down on the arm rest near your head
>"So... that was the girl that ruined your life?"
>close your eyes and nod
>she sighs
>"It sucks that she won't remember it tomorrow. *mumble*"
>ask her what she said at the end
>"I didn't say anything."
>sit up and look at her
>ask again
>Asha takes a bite of her danish and looks away
>shake your head and lay back down
>you can't deal with this shit right now
>fall asleep

>ugh
>why did you have to fall asleep on this couch?
>was your head propped up before you fell asleep anyways?
>look around the room and see a note on the table
>"Anon. Sorry about leaving while you were sleeping. We need to talk tomorrow so don't go hiding in the trash again."
>throw the pillow across the room and push back into the cushion
>you could always try snaking out before she gets here
>the clock on the kitchen table says 11:59
>what happens if you stay awake past midnight?
>can you even stay awake longer than that?
>stand up and go to walk over to the clock
>it sounds off
>an electronic chime
>12:00 AM
>feel yourself falling forwards
>the ground approached fast
>*SMACK*
>there went your head

>*KNOCK* *KNOCK* *KNOCK*
>you pull yourself up from the floor, nursing a large bump on your forehead
>stumble over to the door and unlock it
>come in already
>"Hey Anon. I got two gallons of w-"
>her bags drop and she rushes to you
>"What happened? Did you fall down?"
>Asha's paws push your hands aside, feeling the bump
>tell her that you woke up right before midnight and when the clock chimed, you fell down and passed out
>she picks up the bags and puts them on the coffee table nearby
>"Well, that means you need to lay down at night doesn't it?"
>sit down on the couch and shake your head
>it isn't about falling and cracking your egg on the ground
>it's about what that means
>it meant that wherever you were at 12:00 AM, you would wake up there the next day
>you could take trips if you really wanted
>the canine smiles at you
>"You saw my note didn't you? I needed to talk to you about something."
>she walks back to the open doorway and grabs another bag that was there
>"If we're ever going to find out who threw us in this loop, then it'd be better if I didn't have to ride across town just to talk. That, and I can keep an eye on you and make sure you don't have another episode like yesterday."
>Asha dropped the bag in front of you
>she's just trying to worm her way into everything
>think about the bag she brought
>wouldn't she need to have the bag touching her when she fell asleep in order to keep it all there?
>ask her about it
>"I put some graveyard dirt and salt in the bottom to keep the curse out. You mumbled about it yesterday didn't you?"
>nod lightly
>if that's all it took...
>wait
>hurriedly ask her if she has any left
>she nods and hands you the plastic baggies full of them
>go around the house scattering little bits of it everywhere, opening up windows and putting it on the windowsills, and opening doors and putting it under them
>tadah!
>curse proof house?
>she smiles again and chuckles
>"I didn't think about that. So, what do you say? I'll take the couch and you can have the bed."
>shake your head at her
>tell yourself internally that even if she's a hoodoo witch, that she's your guest (and a good looking one at that)
>you'll take the couch and she'll have the bed
>Asha pulls you into a tight hug
>can't breath well
>cough twice and she finally lets go
>"First thing tomorrow we're going to start finding out how to get out of here."
>you're 100% certain she already knows how to get out, but is still doing the "corrupt cop in charge of finding corruption" routine
>if hoodoo-voodoo witches are all this deceiving, shouldn't there be some sort of quality control?

>you and Asha are now roommates
>for better or for worse
>stuck with a hoodoo witch must have some bonuses shouldn't it?
>something about stabbing dolls and hurting people for real plays through your mind
>maybe that bunny rabbit down at the coffee shop could get what's coming to her
>"Anon."
>turn to the canine and give her your attention
>"Maybe we should do something about... *this*."
>she motioned all around the room
>at the peeling wallpaper
>at the broken tiles in the kitchen
>even at the carpet in the living room that had more coffee stains than actual color at this point
>agree with her and try to think of what you should do
>new furniture wouldn't be a bad idea
>definitely a new couch since you're now bedless and can't be damned to sleep on the old musty brown one stuck in the living room for longer than you have to
>think harder
>how would you even go about getting the furniture?
>with your apartment now curse proof, you wouldn't get that extra $30 a day from your second wallet
>the bank and the $102.57 isn't going to buy a new bed
>not unless there's a five to ten day waiting period you want to go through
>scrap that idea
>ask Asha how much money she has in her bank account
>"$1300 something. You don't have much?"
>tell her about your cash situation
>she chuckles and shakes her head
>"I forgot about that. Didn't you say something the first time I came over about a factory job?"
>no
>no you didn't
>"It doesn't matter anyways Anon. You cover the food and drinks, I'll pay for everything else."
>sounds like a good plan
>maybe you can still sock away some extra money to keep after you get out of this loop
>however that may be
>what did she want from you anyways?
>a kidney?
>you would have woken up in your tub yesterday night if that was the case
>your spleen?
>what did a spleen even do
>search it up on your phone
>it filters blood and helps fight infections
>Asha looks at the screen and jabs you in the shoulder
>"What are you doing? Looking to sell some spleens for quick cash?"
>shake yourself out of your thoughts and slide the phone back in your pocket
>was she behind your back that entire time?
>holy hell was she sneaky
>mental note
>don't let her get behind you at any point

>"How about this one? It's a nice wraparound couch isn't it?"
>shake your head
>wraparounds were for chumps
>everyone knows the best couches were chaise couches
>point out the crimson red chaise couch across from it
>"Really Anon?"
>nod
>chaise couch is best couch
>"What if I want the wraparound? I have the money!"
>get a little upset
>a new sofa is better than that brown one back home
>regardless of whether or not wraparounds suck
>agree halfheartedly

>bean bag chairs aren't supposed to be that big
>look at the large brown monstrosity in front of you
>it came up to your waist and sunk down with that average bean bag chair shape
>Asha jumped into it and curled up
>she's going to rope you into getting that too isn't she?
>fuck

>*KNOCK* *KNOCK*
>ah
>must be the movers with your new furniture
>open it and they bring the bean bag chair and couch in
>then they take the old stuff with them
>what are they going to do with it anyways?
>please, for the love of god, burn it all
>let nothing remain
>the new, white wraparound couch currently taking up a large space of your living room looked quite inviting
>look at the clock on the table
>7:00 PM
>sit down on it and sink in almost instantly
>oooooooh yeeeeeeeah
>this had your old one beat twenty thousand times over
>drift off to sleep almost immediately

>"What do you think about this table Anon? Too round?"
>Asha pointed at a table in the middle of the display area
>yes
>no table should be that round, not even the round table
>point out a nice rectangular one near you
>look at the label
>"Lancaster 82" Wood Top w/ Farmhouse Base  - Parchment"
>she comes over and starts inspecting it
>"This is a little big for your kitchen. I think that round one would work the best"
>damn it
>she was right
>conceed and go to get one of the furniture store salesmen

>bookcases
>she dragged you to go see different bookcases
>there had been a few books scattered around your apartment, sure, but there wasn't a need for a hunk of wood to hold them
>a few nice looking ones caught your eye though
>maybe you could repurpose them for other uses
>Asha picks one out and goes to find the salesman from earlier

>you're in a supermarket right now 
>picking up all manner of food and drinks
>some alcohol too, but that's for yourself
>for some reason you find yourself in the entertainment section looking at CDs
>mostly normie stuff
>of course it'd only be normie music
>this was a supermarket, not a record store
>see a case hiding behind most of the others
>"Grobot, Welcome To Skinny Town"
>grab it and put it in your cart
>ring it up and take the bags out to the bus stop

>get back to the apartment just as the moving people got there with today's haul
>a bookcase and a new table
>as soon as they put the table down your bags were dropped on it
>put the groceries away and toss Asha the CD
>"What's th-"
>she looks over it and smiles
>"I didn't have this one yet! Thanks Anon!"
>you're pulled into a hug almost immediately
>pat her back and wheeze
>holy hell did she have a strong grip
>Asha rushes to your bedroom and brings out a CD player
>holy shit
>they still made those?
>she plugs it in and puts the CD on
>the next 40 minutes were spent listening to it and trying to think what the band was
>it was a mix between rock and hard rock, that much was certain
>sit back and relax as she let's the album play over again
>fall asleep on the couch

>nearly two weeks had passed since you two got the couch
>almost every day was spent out getting new stuff for the apartment
>furniture
>appliances
>fucking COUNTER TOPS
>there was real marble on there now
>MARBLE
>at some point she had gotten a brand new bedframe and mattress for the bedroom
>don't really care
>it's not your room anymore
>each day had ended with another album Asha got from some record shop she frequented
>some were really weird
>Helmethead
>Grab, which was a hard rock band from Maryland
>even some Jumpkick McMurphys
>that brought you back
>made you feel like a teenager again

>think to yourself while Hannigan's Ball played on the CD player
>why was she being so nice to you?
>you had to have done something in the past that made her send you into this time loop
>spend a few minutes trying to think back to your time at NBU
>there wasn't even a single time you talked to her until a few weeks ago
>what had you done?
>though being stuck in this time loop had it's advantages
>stuck in the same day, taking the same money out of your account every day, and stockpiling it like a hoarder would help if anything happened in the future
>that was if you got out of the loop
>being stuck with Asha was getting worse for your mental state
>every day you wracked your brain trying to figure out why you're here
>any time you look at her, you find your face flush and your heart pumping
>it's Stockholm Syndrome Anon
>you're just being held hostage by a canine anthro that probably knows you're suspicious of her
>there isn't any real romantic feelings for her
>that's just Stockholm Syndrome
>if you don't go along with the ruse, then you'll either wake up missing half your organs or you won't wake up at all
>but she's also like a breath of fresh air
>bringing new feelings back into the shell that is you
>making you feel things you hadn't acknowledged existing for years
>Asha wormed her way into your apartment before refurnishing the place
>she can't be all that bad
>"She put you in this loop!"
>the voice from your right side shouted at you
>"She wouldn't be this nice if she was just using him!"
>a second voice came from the left
>they continued bickering while the music kept playing in the background
>after a few minutes they came to a consensus
>if she isn't as bad as your voices say, then she'd accept that you know about her and the hoodoo-voodoo time loop that she caused
>you can't go back to the factory Anon
>if Asha doesn't want anything from you and just stuck you in here, well, at least you'll have company
>there is no going back to the paycheck to paycheck life with nothing to show for it
>never
>try to get Asha's attention
>she isn't listening
>say it a little louder
>nothing
>place your hands on her shoulders and turn her
>she snaps out of her trance and looks right into your eyes
>"Asha, listen to me! I know you're the person that put me in here."
