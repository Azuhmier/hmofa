"Cry Wolf" part 2: You are here

>October 31st
>The big day
>Or it would be if you could go out and participate
>Instead, you’ll be spending the night with your white wolfess lover
>Honestly not a bad tradeoff
>Vupel is a little broken up about it, but she reminds herself she won’t be spending it alone this year
>It’s late afternoon, and you check up on the wolfess to see how she’s holding up
>She’s in the cafeteria, wrangling all the rats and tying little orange and black party hats to their heads
>”Hold still, you little bastards!” she barks at them. “This is your punishment for spying on me and my Hunter. Now you get to spend the whole night with us!”
>Vupel is still oblivious to her “new” collar and its gold studs
>At least until she catches you staring at her
>”What’s up, Anon? I don’t think I’ve given you a reason to be gawking at me just yet.”
>You cover’s blown, so maybe now it’s time to confess
>You tell her about the collar, and she instinctively touches it
>”Wait, WHAT?”
>She rushes to a mirror in the cafeteria kitchen and tugs at it
>”When did this happen?”
>Well…
>The wolfess grits her teeth
>”Let me guess, another gift from Medafet?”
>This time is was from a “Vee”, but maybe it’s just better to shrug your shoulders considering how Vupel’s been reacting so far
>She looks ready to rip the collar off, but relents
>”You know, I used to think she was being spiteful, like guilting me for relying on her food and gifts. Maybe she’s just being a caretaker after all. An obnoxious one, yeah, but still looking out for me.”
>She taps on the studs, waiting for something to happen
>”Guess it’s just jewelry. Great.”
>That’s when you actually look at her reflection
>Vupel looks like a cheap costume in the mirror
>Her eyes are goofy and spaced, and her tongue is sticking out
>Her body is covered in felt and cheap fake fur
>It doesn’t have any definite curves either, just lumps where joints would be
>It’s shocking, but also a little humorous
>”Alright, what’s so funny, bub?”
>The true wolfess is exactly as she should be
>You explain what you see, and Vupel looks flustered
>”Damn that shriveled cat. Leave it to her to put an ugly glamour on me
>Then an epiphany strikes her
>”Wait, if humans see me as a costume…I could run around in their world!”
>But does it only work in reflections?
>The wolfess cycles through several different expressions
>First disappointment, then stern calculation, then embarrassment
>”I, uh, think you may be an exception. You’ll see the real me everywhere but in mirrors and cameras. I’ll have to explain it later….”
>She’s back to disappointment again
>”But all this means jack shit if I can’t leave the building.”
>Wouldn’t hurt to try again, right?
>”You’re going to get my hopes up just to break my heart, huh? Fine, let’s do it. Grab your things just in case.”
>There’s a little hope in her eyes
>You head back to her room for your jacket and other belongings
>Vupel returns wearing her torn dress and bandages
>”Might as well go all out!”
>Seems risky to be wearing what she uses to scare intruders
>Speaking of which, isn’t she afraid of anyone breaking in while the place is empty?
>”Call it a hunch,” she scowls, “but I think my ‘caretaker’ will stop them. After all, you were the last one to bother…uh, visit me. You’d think others would have shown up by now.”
>If she says so
>”By the way, I grabbed some stuff from around the place for you.”
>She hands you a pile of clothes and props
>There’s a sleek hat, leather gloves, and thick scarf that all go with your jacket
>An antiquated (and fake) pistol
>Some kind of baroque axe or sword; it’s too overdesigned to tell the difference
>”If you’re gonna be my Hunter, you need to look the part.”
>You make your way to the front doors, and Vupel flings them open
>The twilight sun is out there waiting
>When she tries to leave, the barrier stops her again
>”Fuck! All that hope for nothing!”
>Her eyes get misty
>No, you can’t let her miss this night
>You have to try SOMETHING…
>You walk through where the barrier would be, pausing when you hear Vupel whine
>You reach out a hand and grab her paw
>Ready?
>She closes her eyes as you pull her through
>No resistance, no pain, no terrible sounds
>It’s a little anticlimactic
>But she did it
>She’s outside
>The wolfess opens her crimson eyes to the fiery sunset
>”I don’t believe it. This has to be a prank, right?”
>You give her some space to take in the fresh air as though it were her first time breathing it
>She doesn’t need to take too long for it, though
>”You’re good luck, Hunter. Stick close, because I’m gonna need a good wingman tonight!”

>You hop into your car with the wolfess
>She’s a little cramped, but couldn’t care less
>She’s fidgeting restlessly in her seat
>Now that you’re out of the glaring sun, you notice the gold studs on her collar are still glowing
>It’s weird, but at worst it’ll look like some kind of costume effect
>The once quiet little nearby town has been transformed by the holiday festivities
>”SiniStreet”
>The roads are already filled with eager souls milling about
>Orange lights connect the buildings like telephone wires
>Jack-o-lanterns and little rubber bats can be seen at all times, no matter where you look
>Almost nobody is without costume
>You find a parking spot and Vupel shoots out like a dog at the park
>It already feels better than any Halloween you can remember
>And yet there’s a brief thought of cynicism that crosses your mind
>Vupel DID say she would have taken the first human she could, and even though she’s fallen for you specifically you can’t shake the feeling of being upstaged by some of the other human men here
>However, it’s a fear that’s entirely unwarranted
>The wolfess has you in a headlock as you walk down the main street
>”So many happy people…I want to show them all who’s having the BEST time! Where do we start first?”
>This is HER night
>Whatever she wants is what you’ll do
>She releases your head so she can take your hand instead
>The two of you go tearing through the crowd joyfully
>The crisp autumn air is exhilarating as you race through it
>You get some amused looks from other people, but none of them know they’re watching an actual wolf run past
>Guess that collar really works
>But was one of the studs always dull looking?
>”Anon, haunted house!”
>What? She lives in one!
>”This is different! I don’t get to experience it from an outsider’s eyes!
>A trailer truck had pulled in a mobile, janky looking haunted house for SiniStreet
>It’s cheaply made and not scary in the slightest, but it still manages to get a couple of screams out of other partygoers
>Vupel is completely unfazed by the spooks, but she fakes a yell to fit in with the others
>Pretty soon you’re laughing at her forced reactions and ignoring the entire haunted house
>Next is the midway with games and carnies galore
>You expected to lose all your money on rigged games, but Vupel’s impressive strength overcomes everything from bottle toppling to bell ringing
>Of all the prizes she could win, she chooses a small stuffed dog with little soft horns and a spade tail
>”Bork bork barf barf nom,” she says, bopping you on the cheek repeatedly with the toy hellhound like it’s eating your face
>She must be dropping a hint, because you’re getting pretty hungry yourself
>Pizzas, corn dogs, fries loaded with all kinds of junk, pies…
>Vupel demonstrates her insatiable appetite to other diners by devouring it all
>Though the sheer volume isn’t what draws most of the attention to her
>To them it probably looks like some girl is stuffing her costume with food, shoving it down the mouth hole
>You wipe some errant sauce off her lips, but she grabs your fingers and licks it off
>”I wasn’t finished with that!” she laughs
>Her childlike sense of wonder is intoxicating, but then you’re hit with a sobering sight
>Three of the studs are no longer glowing as they were when you first left Freak Factory
>You check the time, knowing you won’t like what you see
>It’s been three hours since she’s broken out of her cage
>”You better not be thinking of leaving soon,” Vupel says as she pulls you in for a crushing hug
>No, you tell her
>She can take as much time as she wants
>As you pass some portable toilets she elbows you in the ribs
>”Nature calls. Heh, brought my own toilet paper, too. Be right back.”
>You hang around some nearby vendor huts in the meantime
>One of them looks almost deserted, and everyone on the streets is completely ignoring it
>But the silk tapestries hanging inside are magnificent, and you feel their incredible weave
>Even one that’s fairly plain, just a solid blood-red, catches your eye
>”See anything that intrigues you, dear?”
>One of the tapestries moves
>It’s actually a robe
>Worn by a towering figure that can barely fit in the stall, looming over you
>She has a face of a cat, hairless and sickly yellow, with nails just as long as the fingers they extend from
>In spite of her appearance she has a wide, friendly grin
>”It’s so good to meet you face-to-face at last, Anon.”
>No, not creepy in the slightest
>But does that mean?
>M?
>”’M’ for mmmm-Medafet, yes,” the cat lady purrs
>Her unsettling aura is one thing, but Vupel probably wouldn’t want to see you around the woman she’s been bitter about all this time….
>”I know, sadly,” Medafet sighs when you express your concerns.
>“She can be an angry child, but I can see where it is warranted. I take the brunt of her ire so that she spares her parents the same treatment. I’ve watched her family grow, perhaps a little distant at times, and I don’t want to see it fractured because of a little bad blood.”
>The cat moves her massive claws all around you, as though divining a crystal ball
>”I don’t have much time before she returns, but I needed to see this love of hers for myself. A blessing, frankly.”
>And you got it?
>Medafet’s lips pull back too far for her head to be possible in a Cheshire smile
>”Indeed.” 
>You thank the cat woman tentatively, worried she’s just setting you up for some kind of trap
>”Oh, and Anon? Please remember to have the girl home by a respectable time.”
>”Anon!”
>Vupel is running toward you
>The thought of her running into Medafet here makes you brace yourself, but when you turn back around the cat is gone
>So are all the tapestries
>”What’s with you and exploring abandoned places?” the wolfess says
>She gives you a punch to the arm playfully
>Another collar stud winks out

>Vupel’s desire to sample everything the party has to offer soon leads to you exhausting the whole place
>So, it’s to be expected that she wants to make another lap around the streets to take in what she missed the first time
>You’re bouncing between food stalls when the wolfess stops cold
>”Hey, see that guy up on the stage?” she whispers
>Vupel’s pointing to a man surveying the crowds while the band sets up behind him
>He is richly dressed, though his black locks of hair are tied into multiple tendril-like braids
>”One of those freaky eldritch types,” she continues, wiggling her fingers under her mouth like tentacles
>Vupel steers you off the main street and into a side alley
>”Probably just runs the party, but hell if I’m going out there if he knows I’m supposed to be in exile.”
>Would he really still care a year later?
>”Pfft. Monsters share a pretty tight bond. They look out for their own, but they’re not afraid of a little ‘discipline’, especially if it’s done to keep everyone hidden from the humans. If this really is HIS event, he knows there’s a wolf nearby supposed to be locked up.”
>The two of you keep to the crowds but away from the heaviest, congested foot traffic
>”Hey, Anon! Photo booth!”
>She tosses you inside and shuts the door
>”Nice, some extra privacy if you want to share a moment…or screw. Ha! Up to you!”
>She plants a kiss on your cheek, then nips at your neck
>Aren’t the pictures going to come out with the glamour still on?
>”Yeah, I guess so. Or maybe it’s just a temporary illusion, I don’t know. But we have the memories, and it’d be funny to show your friends the goofy-looking costume your girlfriend has on, right?”
>Can’t argue with that
>”Let’s start with a nice one, then we’ll get creative.”
>The first couple are sweet poses, just you and your wolfess making lovey-dovey eyes and smiling warmly
>Though if the pictures come out the way you think, it’ll be a little weird to see you making out with a costume
>Then you do a couple of saucy ones
>Like one where she has both paws up your shirt and around your neck, or another where her dress is hiked up shoving her furry rump right in your face
>Then you try whatever spur-of-the-moment style you can think of
>One where she’s wearing your hat and you’re gagged with her extra bandages
>One where you’ve “slain the nightmare” and have her slumped over in your lap
>One where the perspective makes it look like she’s about to eat you whole
>One where it looks like you’re both dead tired after a night of debauchery
>…Guess she wants to do another like that
>You pretend to poke her, like you’re disturbing a slumbering beast
>…Another one?
>Vupel?
>That’s when you notice the last glowing collar stud fade away
>”Anon,” she mewls. “So…tired.”
>You have to catch her from slumping over onto her face
>”Feels like…I’m being pulled. Anon…I want to go back.”
>She’s whining softly, as though on the verge of tears
>The wolfess is heavy, but with worry-filled adrenaline you manage to carry her out of the booth
>”Anon…so sorry…ruined the night.”
>She’s shivering and sobbing softly
>You whisper reassuring words to her as you try to move as fast as you can back to your car
>Onlookers stare at you, but they probably assume she’s just another wasted party animal
>Their eyes follow you down the street, but suddenly they all act like the two of you don’t exist anymore
>They’re all so still, blocking your path
>You turn around in a panic, only to come face-to-face with the “eldritch man”
>You expected to see anger or something maddening if he caught you tonight, but he only looks to you with pity
>”I think it’s time you took her home,” he rumbles
>You nod
>The world wavers, and you’re at the turnstiles of Freak Factory once more
>Every step closer to the building seems to give Vupel some peace
>Once you’re through the front doors she calms down entirely
>You didn’t think you would have the strength to make it back to your car (which is probably still back in town), but you can at least take her to her room
>You lay her gently on a beanbag chair and carefully remove some bandages from her costume for comfort
>”Thank you, Hunter,” she chuckles weakly
>You give her a kiss on the muzzle and curl up beside her
>Vupel burrows into your jacket as much as she can
>Your eyes wander as you wait for the adrenaline to subside
>The last thing you focus on before drifting to sleep is the ripped picture of the dark wolf and red-covered human

>Vupel is awake before you, knees pulled to her chest and playing with her dress
>”Mornin’,” she says dejectedly. “Really cocked it up last night, didn’t I?”
>Actually, you had a great time
>Didn’t she?
>”Well, yeah, it was amazing. Maybe too much so. Now I have a taste of what it’s like again, and I’ll probably never be allowed to go out ever after getting caught.”
>Her eyes close and her teeth are bared
>”Now I wish we never went. I’m never going to have a Halloween as good as that again!”
>Does she mean it?
>Does she really want to take that all back?
>You pull out the photo booth strips and the little toy hellhound you had strapped to your jacket pocket for safekeeping
>Surprisingly you see Vupel’s real form in them now
>”…No, you’re right. I want those memories for life.”
>She takes the strip and tears off the ones at the end, where she’s no longer having fun
>”’Cept for these. We can forget these.”
>The wolfess looks like her usual self in more ways than one
>And even though the studs on her collar are no longer glowing, you definitely think she looks better in gold than silver
>”Bet this was all Medafet’s fault. She probably knew if the night ended on a shitty note I wouldn’t want to go out again.”
>Vupel’s sour look dissolves into shame
>”No,” she sighs. “It’s not her fault. It never was, and I’ve been an unfair bitch to keep blaming her. She’s done nothing but help me through this. I don’t deserve her support. I don’t…I don’t deserve YOU, Anon.”
>When you approach for a hug, she backs away
>You take off your jacket, never taking your eyes off her
>”What are you—“
>You lunge at Vupel and wrap her into the jacket, then into a tight squeeze
>”N-no, Anon. I don’t deserve—“
>You put a finger on her snout
>No more tears
>Her laughs are strained, but full of happiness
>”You’re right. Heh, you’re right, Anon. Thank you. I couldn’t have asked for a better mate.”
>It makes your day just to hear that word coming from her
>She rubs the sleeves of your jacket
>”It’s nice, but I’d like to wear the one you gave me.”
>You hand her your older one, and she looks to her costume
>”Might need a wash first, but I think we should wear these later just for one more night, huh? We still have that pumpkin liquor, and I don’t think the rats managed to get their little party hats off yet.”
>She slips out of her dress and puts it neatly in the corner, then zips herself into her jacket
>You’re tugged to your feet as the wolfess dusts you off
>”Breakfast?”

>It’s actually lunchtime when the two of you reach the cafeteria
>Just like Vupel said, the rats are still running around in their cone hats, jousting with each other
>”Might need to start drinking early,” she says, turning the bottle around in her paws. “Then again, maybe we should hold off for a little while. I’d like to talk about…well, us.”
>The wolfess looks at you sheepishly
>”I was hoping I could talk you into staying with me. You know, moving in. We got everything you could need here, as long as Medafet’s footing the bill. And we’re not too far from your friends and family, right?”
>Living in a haunted mansion attraction?
>A little weird, but it’s not like it scares you
>And you can’t imagine leaving Vupel all alone anymore
>Come to think of it, you haven’t even tried to leave the house since last night
>She smiles; first warily, then confidently
>”Hey, I’ll take care of you, don’t worry. Gotta pay my Hunter back after last night.”
>There’s a serious look on her face
>”No, not just last night. You saved my hide in so many ways. I was going to be a nasty, self-destructive mutt if you hadn’t come along. Thanks, Anon.”
>She flips the bottle in her paw a few times
>So anything you want I’ll see what I can do. This is your home too, and I want you to feel like it is. We’ll make it wo—“
>BANG
>The sound of the front doors blasting open reaches all the way to the cafeteria
>”WHERE’S MY LITTLE GIRL HIDING?”
>Vupel freezes up
>The bottle falls to the ground and the neck snaps off
>Pumpkin liquor pours onto the floor, and a cluster of rats comes to drink it up
>”Mom?” Vupel says breathlessly
>She takes off toward the entrance, with you lagging at her heels
>When you reach the foyer, there’s someone waiting
>Another wolfess
>The one from the photograph in Vupel’s room
>Dark fur, ripped jeans, a leather jacket with a plush collar, a spiked bracelet, and a gorgeous jeweled chocker
>She carries herself with intensity and a devilish grin, but there’s also tenderness to her presence
>Her body is built with muscle, but there’s notable softness to her wide hips and voluminous breasts
>A byproduct of a fruitful motherhood, likely
>The resemblance to Vupel is uncanny
>”There she is!” the dark wolfess laughs
>Vupel leaps into her arms, eyes welling up
>The white wolfess buries her face into her mother’s chest, whining and mumbling incomprehensibly
>”Shhh, I know you are, kiddo. I already chewed your gramps out for letting you do this in the first place. Almost ripped one of his heads off.”
>More mumbling from Vupel, this time with higher inflection
>”Of course! That’s why I’m here! I think you’ve had to struggle alone here long enough.”
>She pulls the white wolfess out of her bosom
>”And I gotta apologize right back, kiddo. You were ready to come home a long time ago, but I persuaded Aunt Meddy to keep you here just a bit longer.”
>Vupel’s eyes go wide
>”W-what?” she says
>”Yeah,” the dark wolfess sighs. “It’s my fault. I can’t let the ol’ cat take the heat for this, even if she did it willingly. She just wanted to be the scapegoat and keep us from being angry at each other, but we’re tough dogs, right?”
>The mother wolfess strokes the top of her daughter’s head
>”I guess I was hoping you could get a nice date in time for Halloween, like how I met your father. If you hadn’t, I would have come get you so you wouldn’t miss the big night. I swear it.”
>The dark wolfess turns to you
>”And this must be Anon. Boy, I’ve heard a LOT about you in just a few short days!”
>She extends a paw for a handshake
>”Volfa.”
>You take her paw, and you’re pulled into her pillowy chest
>”Good taste must run in the family. If I were my little girl’s age and hadn’t met her father yet….”
>”Mother, please,” Vupel groans
>Volfa just laughs some more
>”That’s what moms do! They mess with their little girls! And I have to make up for lost time, don’t I?”
>You’re given a chance to breathe as Volfa holds both of you around the neck
>”You’re part of the family now, Anon. From what I hear, the two of you had a pretty good time last night, huh?”
>”Yeah, it was amazing,” Vupel says, staring into your eyes
>”Glad to hear it! You probably had it better than your brothers and sisters. They had to organize their own entertainment, since your father and I wanted to get away for a little…‘private’ night of our own.”
>”Mom, stop!”
>”Don’t worry, kiddo. We didn’t do anything to expand the family just yet.”
>She gives a strong slap to her belly, hitting the steel of her abs with a loud clap
>If wolves could blush, Vupel would probably be as red as her eyes by now
>Speaking of which, Volfa pulls a crimson bandana from her own jacket and tucks it under her daughter’s collar
>Gold embroidery spells out “Vupel” near one of the corners
>”A little something from your father. Really brings out your eyes.”
>It really does
>Volfa gives the place a look around and whistles
>”Not bad. Might have to convince the old man to bring Halloween here next year. There’s enough space for everyone.”
>Volfa gives her daughter a pat on the back and a gentle shove forward
>”Why don’t you start packing your stuff up. We’ll be there in a minute to help out.”
>”O-okay,” Vupel says
>You imagine her raunchy posters will be the first things she tries to hide
>When it’s just you and Volfa, the dark wolfess gives you a merry grin
>”Thanks, Anon, for taking care of my little girl. Didn’t want to embarrass her TOO much, but I know she has a thing for humans. Takes after her mother, that one. So since she’s so smitten with you, I’d like to ask you something.”
>She walks you forward, the two of you slowly making your way to Vupel’s bedroom
>”Want to live with us in the monster world? I’m sure my hubby would like to have another human to talk to now and then, and you can always come back to visit when you want.”
>A whole world of monsters
>Well, after being used to all the fake ones in Freak Factory, very little will probably spook you now
>Volfa pats you on the shoulder
>”That’s what I like to hear!”

>Waiting out in front of Freak Factory this evening is the old man who gave you a lift back home the first night you met Vupel
>Only this time, the saggy skin on the man’s face has been taken off to show the ghoulish tissue underneath
>Guess monsters need to air themselves out once in a while
>Him and Volfa are busy stuffing the white wolfess’ stuff into his car
>You and Vupel are sitting on the front steps watching the sunset
>Despite being locked up for so long in the building, this is exactly where she wants to be with you right now
>”Would you believe me if I said I’m going to miss this place?” she says
>You shrug
>Suppose it’s only natural to grow attached to places you’re stuck in for so long
>”Well, you shouldn’t. Ha! I’m ready to leave this dump behind. It was YOU who made it special, after all, and you’re coming with us!”
>Vupel pulls you into a hug
>Every time the old man and Volfa turn their backs, the white wolfess gives you a lick on the cheek, like a game
>Pretty soon, you’re suspicious Volfa is doing this on purpose for her daughter’s sake
>”Gotta say, old habits die hard,” Vupel says. “I really don’t think I can stay satisfied just coming out here once per year. Really want to see more of the human world, but I can’t get you in trouble, too.”
>Volfa slams the trunk with a deafening bang, jolting the two of you out of your conversation
>The dark wolfess leans against the car and folds her arms
>”Well I didn’t think your time away was going to change that,” she chuckles. “Gee, if only there were some way you could freely walk around with the humans like you were one of them….”
>She raps a claw on her jeweled chocker, staring at Vupel’s own studded collar
>”Maybe if SOMEONE acts reaaally nice for Aunt Meddy, she can hook them up with something more permanent to help with that, hmm?”
>Vupel lets out an exasperated moan
>”I knew it! She’s going to guilt me into this, isn’t she?”
>Volfa roars with laughter, opening the door for you and your wolfess
>”She definitely stays a step ahead of the curve, trust me,” the motherly wolfess says. “It’s how she teaches her lessons. Just be glad it’s not your gramps you have to apologize to. He’d make you grovel in front of each of his heads, then STILL put you on a curfew.”
>The passenger seat remains empty as Volfa squeezes between the two of you in the back, putting her arms back behind both your heads
>You can sense a little jealousy in Vupel’s eyes, as though she plans on showing you who REALLY deserves to have you at her side later on
>Maybe Volfa’s just as keen on staying one step ahead?
>”Well, I’m sure she thinks you’ve done your time as well,” Volfa says. “And if you have to be cooped up for a while in the human world, I know of a nice little hideaway your father and I used to use.”
>She pulls you both under her bosom once more
>”Just be sure to knock first, in case we’re still in there! Haha!”
>”Mom…” Vupel grumbles
>With the two of you so close under the dark wolfess’ chest, you sneak a quick kiss
>Vupel gives you a wink and mouths silently
>”Happy Halloween, Hunter.”
