>It's been a week and Lulu is still in the hospital
>the doctors said that she's not healing as quickly as she should due to her poor eating habits
>namely that she doesn't eat at all if she doesn't see you
>regardless you visit her every day
>she's looking better, she can sit up and she doesn't need a machine to help her breathe anymore
>the bullet that hit her pierced one of her lungs, the doctors say that she would have died on the street if you didn't help her
>that's a small comfort 
>as soon as she's well enough to leave she'll just end up back on the street
>next time she'll likely end up in the morgue instead of the hospital
>that just makes you angry
>you want to do something for her, but you don't know what
>you walk in to Lulu's room
>she looks at you and smiles
"Hey. How are you feeling?"
"Better"
>you sit down next to her bed and think
>you've never felt this way about anyone before
>you want to do everything you can to make her happy and keep her safe
>when you saw her hit the ground it was like someone tore out your heart
>is this what love feels like?
>as you stew in your thoughts it finally hits you
>you have no idea why you didn't do this in the first place
"Lulu?"
"Yeah"
"When you get out of the hospital, do you want to come live with me?"
>the silence lasts only a few seconds, but it feels like an eternity
>her eyes widen and glisten with tears 
>she wipes her eyes 
"Do you really want me to?"
>you don't hesitate to answer
"I love you. I have since the day I met you. All I want is for you to be happy. I don't have much, but I promise I'll do everything I can to give you the life you deserve."
>this time she doesn't try to stop her tears
"Okay"
>you hug her tighter than you ever have
"I've got to get some things ready, but I'll be back. I promise."
>you leave her room in a state of elation
>now that this is happening, you have some people to call
>it's not a call you're looking forward to

--

>you haven't spoken to your parents in years
>the last time you saw them they made it clear they didn't want to see you again
>if not for the present circumstances you'd never even think of calling them
>no better time to tear off this band-aid 
>an older sounding man picks up on the other end
"Hello?"
"Hey dad, it's Anon."
>there's a short pause
"Hello?"
"I don't want to talk to you"
"I know. I wouldn't call if it wasn't important."
"Let me guess, you need two thousand dollars or they're going to break your legs. I'm not giving you any more money just so it can go up your nose."
>you groan. It's not surprising at all that he still holds that against you
"I don't do that anymore. Look, I need money for my kid."
>you hear something break over the phone
"What?"
>you explain to him everything that's happened so far
"I see. that certainly is an interesting story."
"So will you wire me some money?"
"I'll send you the money, if only to ensure that child turns out better than you did."
>your father wasn't one to mince words
>but money is money
"Thanks"
>that's one hurdle cleared
>now you need to take care of something else 
>you haven't shown up for work in three days, so you've almost certainly been fired
>which means you need to find a new job
>putting that in the back of your mind you decide to head home
>you crawl into bed, the day's events still replaying in your head
>when you wake up, you'll be a father
>you still can't wrap your head around that

--

>you spend the entire day getting things ready
>you buy clothes, food, toys, a bed, anything you think she would need
>once you've got it all in your apartment you go back to the hospital
>Lulu is finally well enough to leave
>she runs up to you and hugs you
"Let's go home"
>once you're back home you cook dinner 
>it's the first time in a while you've cooked with something other than a microwave
>still, it turns out better than expected
"How is it?"
>she takes a bite, her face lights up
"So good. This is the best meal I've ever had."
>even though that isn't a high bar to clear you still feel proud
"Alright. It's about time for bed."
>you take her to her room
>she flops down on the bed
"It's so soft."
"Glad you like it. Goodnight."
>you go to your room and go to bed
>a few hours later you're woken up by someone walking your room
>Lulu silently crawls into your bed 
"Bad dream?"
>she nods 
"Don't worry, I'm right here."
>she falls asleep, the whole time she doesn't stop shaking
>you're not surprised, most grown adults were never the same after something like that happened to them
>you couldn't imagine what she must be going through
>you pull her close and hold her
>she stops shaking and sleeps peacefully
"Don't worry, I've got you"
>that was the first night, the night you two became a family
>what started as a chance encounter between two strangers ended with their lives bound to one another 
>all the hardships the two of you endured were all worth it in the end
>neither of you would ever be alone again

--

>you can't believe this day has come
>so much time passed without you noticing
>this might be the happiest day of your life
"Okay Lulu, smile"
>Lulu looks incredibly embarrassed
"Come on, can't you be cool?"
"Nope. This is one of two times where I get to be as uncool as I want, you're just gonna have to deal with it."
>you snap picture after picture
>once you're done she groans and goes off to join her friends
>she only acts like this around them, but that doesn't bother you
>nothing could possibly bring you down today
>today's the day you get to see your little girl graduate high school
>it's amazing how she went from a low C student to graduating high school with honors
>she's already gotten a scholarship to a good college so you don't have to worry about tuition
>you take your seat in the stands, you're the only human attending
>after multiple speeches from the students and staff it was finally time to hand out the diplomas
>you wait for your chance
>finally it comes
>the principal calls out her name
"Lucille Mayberry"
>you jump up
"WOOOOOOO. THAT'S MY BABY!"
>you shout at the top of your lungs
>Lulu grabs her diploma and rushes off the stage
>the other parents are glaring at you, but you don't care
>once the ceremony is over you find Lulu outside and run to her
>ignoring her protests you wrap your arms around her and spin her around
"Lulu?"
"What is it?
"I'm so proud of you."
"Thanks, dad."

--

>it's been years now
>you're old and retired
>the city tore down the project years ago, but with the money you had saved up you were able to move to a nice, quiet suburb
>you're glad you're not in the ghetto anymore, but you find yourself aching for something to do
>you hear a knock at the door
>when you open it you see a group of dogs, a woman, a man, and two young boys
>you haven't seen them in years, but it feels like only yesterday
"Hello, it's good to see you all again"
>Lulu smiles at you
"Hi dad. Can we come in"
>you laugh
"My door's always open for you."
>the last time you saw her was the day she got married
>you've been keeping in contact with her, but this is the first time she's ever come to visit
>her two kids run to the backyard and play while Lulu and her husband join you in the living room
"So, how have you two been?"
"It's been wonderful. The new trauma center has already saved so many people."
>Lulu and her husband Ron were both doctors, they met in college
>things in the city never got any better, but at least with the new trauma center there's a chance more people can be saved
>Lulu's ears perk up and she gets an angry look on her face
"Those two better not be fighting again"
>she storms off to the backyard
>after she's gone Ron looks at you
"Can I ask you something?"
"What?"
"A human raising an anthro, how does that happen? I tried asking Lucille but she won't tell me anything."
>you sigh
"It's a long story, but what the hell?" 
>you tell him the long, sad story
>about the man who had given up on his future
>about the girl who had given up on living
>how they ended up coming together
>and how they saved each other
