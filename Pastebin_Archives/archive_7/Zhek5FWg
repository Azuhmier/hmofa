>"Alright, so, your name is Ezekiel, correct?"
>yup
>"What are you doing in the forest?"
>surviving day to day life, trying not to die
>"Why where you in the forest, to begin with?"
>to be honest, i cannot answer that, just know that id rather be home
>she freezes up
>"Home?"
>yes, im not from here, i come from a society with many humans
>"Where would that be?"
>id rather die than tell you
>"Uh, well, let's talk about something else. Do you know about our legends of humans?"
>not a single clue
>"Well, would you like to know?"
>sure, why not
>"Humans are an ancient myth, and with you, they are finally proven. They are a magical creature, capable of feats that we couldn't dream of. Humans hold immense power and can range in temperament. Some are very kind and just, while others are horrifically impulsive and evil. Is this true?"
>i was just given power on a silver platter
>yes, im surprised you know so much about us
>she starts breathing more heavily
>"So, would you tell us more about yourself?"
>oh this was perfect, make some shit up, and they'll all bow down
>i am Ezekiel, of the Altonston Domain, i am a defender of the realm, and i have important business here
>her eyes open wide
>ive seem to hit a nerve
------
>"A-Altonston?"
>yeah, why
>"Altonston is domain of the most powerful humans..."
>she is looking at me with complete fear in her eyes
>please, i dont plan on using it without good reason, relax yourself
>"Oh thank god, please, don't hurt anybody. We are kind, I beg of you."
>calm yourself, i have no qualms with you or your people
>now, i need to test something out
>she was talking about magic which sounds like bs, but weird shit is happening
>plus i got fucking teleported to this place, magic isnt far off in terms of wierdness
>reaching out to a candy bar a distance away, you suddenly pull your hand back
>the candy bar comes flying to you, and you catch in mid flight
>fucking awesome
>"Holy shit..."
>cool, isnt it
>"Yeah, it's just that I never thought that i'd see magic, real magic!"
>theres a first for everything
>"So, what are you going to do now?"
>now? no clue, maybe ill integrate into society
>"Wait, integrate?"
>what else am i going to do? you dont yet seem to be a threat to Altonston, so ill move into society, and kick back
>"Wow, that seems insane. A human moving into anthro society? That will be difficult."
>im an incredibly powerful magical creature, i dont really worry about what you anthros can do to me
>"Well then, back to questions I guess. Now, how old are you? I don't consider myself an expert, but due to your magical expertise, I'd guess that you'd be at least several thousand years old, not too far of from reaching eternal strength."
>shit, i have no clue what to go with, fuck, i gotta wing this
>seven thousand, two hundred, and eighty-one years old
>"Dear god."
>yup, all of that spent fighting for Altonston, but now, i can finally relax
>"Well, any topics that you would like to chat about?"
>yeah, hows the world doing
>"What?"
>hows the world doing, you got a international peacekeeping organization, or is it constant war
>"Well, it isn't perfect, but it's not too bad."
---------
>well, i wasnt in a dystopia, thank god
>alright, good
>"I guess that the world is going to be in shock about this..."
>getting up, i grab my stuff
>"Hey, where are you going?"
>to my hideout, if im going into society, i want to bring some momentos with me
>"Oh, could we see it?"
>sure, i dont give a fuck
>"Come on, follow him!"
>making my way to the hideout, i grab what belongings i have
>not just my homemade equipment, but the one reminder that i have of my old life
>its a picture of me and some friends, we'd just got out of a bar, completely fucking wasted
>why did it all have to go away?
>i quickly hide the picture, this is for my eyes only
>"Wow, you lived in this cave?"
>yup, its nice, aint it
>"Well, it wouldn't say it's the most cozy, but I've slept in worse."
>so have i, now lets go
>"To where?"
>to society
>"And do you know where that is?"
>no, but ill find it
>"Let me lead you."
>go take point
>as i am led by the wolfess and some staff back to the workers area, i feel less worried about them
>i suddenly have magic, im the powerful one here
>when they lead me to society, im taking the reins
-----
>i didnt know what i expected
>maybe it was hope for a sense of normalcy
>maybe is was homesickness
>but i wanted something like my old life
>a normal job, a normal life
>it was so far from being that
>it was magic and alternate worlds
>i dont know who sent me here, but i wanna knock em out
>as they bring me to a car, they open a back door for me
>im being treated like a god
>this feels real fucking nice
>driving off, i look at my surroundings
>you know, it almost looked like i was back in the states
>but that was gone
>i guess i should make the most out of what i got
>and as the car slows down, we pull in front of a large building, it looks governmental
>opening the door, i step out and check my surroundings
>many anthro soldiers and suited men are standing around
>fuck me
>but im the 'ancient magical creature' right?
>a bear in a white suit walks forwards, and kneels before me
>"Greetings, Ezekiel, I am glad to welcome you to the Empress's Palace."
>how gracious of you
>"May I lead you to her highness?"
>yes you may
>an empress? fucking hell this could be good
-----
>walking through the halls, i am accompanied by the bear, the soldiers staying a good distance away
>he leads me to a giant golden gate, which is guarded by anthros with fancy clothing, looks ceremonial
>"Gentlemen, please open the doors."
>with his command, they swing open
>i walk through without being told, my presence alone is electrifying
>as i continue into the giant room, i see a hyena on the throne
>she is clad with a purple silk dress, and a crown
>as i walk forwards, she rises, then kneels
>"Greetings, oh Ezekiel. I am Empress Morgaine, it is an honor to be in your presence."
>likewise my lady
>she stands as i approach her
>"What is it that you come to our realm for?"
>we must speak privately first on that
>"Very well, would you accompany me to the briefing room?"
>of course
>walking in, the difference is clear, it goes from a land of luxury to what seems like an office
>"My dear guest, would this be good enough?"
>yes, yes
>"Wonderful."
>now, i shall make this clear, i do not plan on any hostile acts, but i have my duties
>"What do you mean?"
>i was sent here to ensure that Altonston would not be threatened by this world
>i do not believe that we are even close to that, so i have no qualms here
>"Oh thank God, I was worried, not in what seemed to be thousands of years has a human graced us again."
>other humans? huh, i wonder if they were in the same situation
>yes, theres no need to worry, but i do have a request of you
>the Empress freezes up, slowly turning her head back towards me
>"W-What would that b-be?"
>i require lodging, proper clothing, food, and water
>"Of course! I can provide all of the best here, in my palace, if you would be so inclined."
>that sounds perfect
>it truly does

>There's a hyena group, they are looking over a body
>Time to get to work
>'Hey! I'm a doctor, make way!'
>I'm sprinting over, getting surprised looks and watching the crowd back off somewhat from the body
>The big hyena girl is hurt, but not dead
>She's been stabbed twice in the gut
>With some decent work, I make easy work patching up the wounds, and then I wrap her with bandages.
>She speaks up
>"Who... who are you?"
>'Vincent. I'm a wandering doctor, and I just saved your life. Don't move around too much, or your stiches will get all messed up.'
>She gives me a confused stare
>"You'd patch up people like me? For free?"
>'Hey, everybody deserves to get help, no matter what. That's why I'm a traveling doc.'
>I get up and start to walk away, lighting a cigarette

>"Wait, don't go!"
>Huh?
>'Why not?'
>A small hyena boy runs up to me

>"We're a scavenger group. Don't know why we got attacked, but we need to leave. Let's go."
>She is picked up by some other members, and we start to walk off, to find shelter, and safety.

>As we all travel through the streets, I spot out a good resting spot
>A building in decent condition
>We all head over, and make sure its clear
>Nice place
>We all set up camp here
>I sit next to the wounded boss, making sure her stitches are still intact
>"How's it look?"
>Everybody looks at me
>'Could be a lot worse. You'll be fine.'
>She sighs in relief
>"Good. I was worried that I'd be leaving the pack behind."
>I nod
>'So, since I'm gonna be with you all for awhile, why don't you give me some proper introductions?'
>The boss smiles
>"I'm Mylie. I make sure shit doesn't go wrong, and I keep everybody together."
>'Well Mylie, who are the other three?'
>"The small kid is Josh. He's a good kid, smart too. The girl with the rifle is Serina. She's headstrong, confident, and can be a prick at times."
>I make sure to remember that, don't want any problems.
>"Tal is our brains. She knows what she's doing. You could probably teach her all of your medical shit, and she'll figure it out."
>'Alright then. You get some rest, if your pain becomes too bad, I can give you some stuff to fix ya up.'
>Mylie only nods and lies her head down, the rest of the group sitting around a campfire
>I walk over and take a seat. Serina takes a look at me, she has a confused look on her face
>"What the fuck do you think you're getting out of this?"
>Ah, this must be the headstrong bullshit
>'I'm saving a life. That's good enough for me.'
>"Ok then, Mr. Charity man."
>'Hey, I'm the one saving lives. If you don't want me here, I'll go.'
>I stand up and walk towards my stuff
>She fully believes my bluff
>"Wait! Don't go, she needs you!"
>'Then don't act like a prick.'
>Serina nods
>Good, one less problem to deal with
-
>Not much is happening
>Until I hear some noise outside of the house
>Josh goes to check it out
>But something doesn't feel right
>The sound of yelling only confirms this
>I sprint around a corner to see some bandit bastard about to hit him with a club
>I run and slam into the fucker
>I slam a fist into his face
>He doesn't give up, and I don't notice that he pulled out a shiv
>It goes right into my left arm
>Unexpectedly, Josh slams the bandit in the head with the club, he's out cold
>"Vincent! You saved me, thank yo-"
>I pull the blade out of my arm
>'Fuck! Damn bastard...'
>Josh helps me up, and we walk back to the campfire
>Serina had run over to help us, but she was too late, the fight was already over
>"Josh, what happened?"
>He shudders
>"A bandit. He almost killed me, but Vincent saved me. He's hurt."
>'I have bandages, I'll be alright. You might want to finish the guy off, he's only unconscious.'
>Serina sighs and walks out of the house, while Josh helps me sit down
>Tal grabs the bandages
>"Hey bud, hold still. I'm no doc, but I know how to wrap bandages."
>She does just that, stopping the blood from flowing out of my arm
>"See, not bad."
>'Good enough.'
>A loud crack sounds off, and Serina walks in carrying some loot, a smile on her face
>"I got presents!"
>She lays out some supplies, it wasn't much too impressive, but it still was a nice haul
>I lay down, tired from today's events
>'If anything happens, wake me up. I'm gonna sleep.'
>The three nod, and I move over to the cloth bedding, laying down and sleeping
>But a familiar voice gets my attention
>"Vincent? Could you sleep next to me? I don't want to be alone when I sleep, because I'll move around a lot."
>That was Mylie, and she had a point, the last thing I needed was her stitches to come apart
>'Alright.'
>I get up and bring my bedding, laying down next to Mylie
>One of her arms wraps around me and pulls me close
>She falls asleep fast
>I do too
-
>Goddamn my arm is wet
>I fucking swear, if she drooled on me
>Nope, my arm is just bleeding profusely
>Alright, good
>Wait
>IT'S BLEEDING PROFUSELY
>I quickly wrap other bandages around the wound
>"Fucking goddamn these shitty bandages!"
>The blood flow out of my arm is stopped
>"Vincent?"
>I turn to see Mylie with a look of concern on her face
>"Yeah?
>"Are you alright?"
>I nod my head
>"Ok. I've gotten better, so let me help."
>Already? Damn, that was impressive
>"Shit, it's a bad cut. Guess we'll be the one taking care of you now."
>"I've had worse, I'll be fine."
>I stand up and walk to my belongings, packing them up
>I'm interrupted by Mylie grabbing my shoulders and turning me around
>"You saved my life. Whether you want it or not, we are going to repay you."
>"Uh, alright."
>I am let go, and I return to packing up my equipment
>"So, doc, where'ya going?"
>"I don't have a destination, I just travel."
>"In that case, we're gonna bring you along. You'd get hurt all on your lonesome."
>Wonderful, I just got Shanghai'd into a hyena group
>This is bullshit
>"Alright then. Lead the way."
>All of us have packed up our stuff, and we were heading back out into the wastes
>Josh is walking next to me, he's concerned about my wound
>I smile and let him know that everything is fine
>As the four of us walk down a street, I feel at ease
>Everything seemed to be going well
-
>A long walk this was
>But it didn't bother me one bit
>I was a wandering doctor after all
>Josh was getting tired
>He's a good kid, and it hurts to see him wheezing
>So I pick him up and put him on my back
>He's not too heavy, he's a little boy after all
>But it feels good to help
>The other girls smile, surprised by my kind act
>We keep on for some time, but we decide to make camp at an empty rest stop
>I let Josh down, and everybody works fast to set everything up
>I sit down, my belongings lying on the floor, well organized
>Mylie walks over to me and puts a paw on my back
>"Hey Doc, I need help. The bandages are getting all fucked up."
>"Alright. I'll fix them up."
>Mylie takes off her jacket and shirt
>Jesus Christ, there's no modesty here
>"Well, aren't you going to help?"
>Yeah yeah, maybe if you didn't swing your tits out I'd be more focused
>I slowy remove her bandages, the wounds aren't doing too bad
>Bleeding is gone, seems to be healing well
>No infection, it's healthy
>I wrap new bandages around her waist
>Good as new
>"There ya are. If you got any pain, just le-"
>"Vincent. Come here."
>Huh?
>I walk back over to Mylie, worried that something is wrong
>"What is it?"
>Mylie wraps her arms around me and pulls
>"I want to tell you this. You are a good man."
>"Yeah, I know that."
>"You saved my life, in exchange for nothing. You don't deserve that, so I'm gonna make sure that you'll always be safe."
>"Ok?"
>Mylie smirks and aims my head up
>"And things that I keep safe, are things that are mine."
>Oh no

ADHG too lazy to check number

>Life is good
>I was a prizefighter in an underground fighting ring
>I looked like just some random humie, but I was a brutal fighter
>Walking home from the fun, I feel confident
>Another victory, and more money wired to my offshore bank account
>The street is empty in the night, and I make my way to my house
>Something is off, I feel like someone is watching me
>I see it behind me, a gator girl is following me
>She's obviously undercover
>Feds don't care about the fighting rings, but when they found out a human was in it, they changed their attitude real fast
>But did they think you were a spectator or the fighter
>Nonetheless, I take a seat on a bench in a park, getting a phone call
>It was my agent suggesting that I retire
>'Sounds good to me. Keep in touch.'
>I hang up and chill in the park
>The gator girl is watching me, but keeping her distance
>She isn't very good at this, but it's funny to me
>I lie back on the bench and put on some earbuds
>The music calms me down, the rush of fighting subsiding
>I can hear her footsteps getting closer
>She taps my shoulder, and I pull out the earbuds
>'Can I help you?'
>"Hi, I just was wondering if you could help me with something."
>'And that would be?'
>"I'm not a local here, and I heard that there were these... fighting places. Would you know anything about them?"
>God, she was shit at this, but it was cute
>'Yeah, they have a huge place where these people beat each other up. I saw it once, it was fucked up, but besides that, I don't know much.'
>"Really? Wow. That sounds bad."
>'Yup, It was disgusting. I heard that there was a human fighter, but he just retired.'
>The gator girl's eyes burst open
>"Wait, really?"
>'Yeah, he got tired of it from what I've heard.'
>"Huh. Well, thanks for the help. Hey, buddy, mind if I walk you home?"
>She was a big girl, but also a kind one, I can't say no
>'Lead the way.'
-
>We walk down the street, and she is right by my side
>"So, how did you find out about all of this?"
>'Learned from a friend.'
>"Crazy. Glad you're staying away from that stuff."
>'Yup. Anyways, you seem like a nice person. What's your name?'
>"Oh, I'm Belladonna. What's yours?"
>'Call me Hector.'
>"Sounds nice."
>I only nod as I tap on her back
>'My house is just up here. Thanks for the chat, it was nice.'
>She smiles as I walk up the stairs, but she seems focused on something
>'Ah, here's my phone number. Call me if you want to hang out or something.'
>She nods, but there's still an uneasy look on her face
>'You good?'
>"Yeah, I'm fine. Could I come in with you, it's getting cold out, and I don't have anywhere else to stay."
>She was nice, and a cop, so she wouldn't hurt me, so I couldn't say no
>'Yeah, come in.'
>She follows me into the house, moving into the living room as I take off my jacket
>A sudden silence fills the room
>"Hey uh, are you okay?"
>'Yeah, why wouldn't I be?'
>As I turn around I see Bella with a horrified expression
>"You're covered in..."
>Bruises, bandages, and scars
>'Yup. Old work.'
>I nonchalantly hang up the jacket and go to grab a bottle of tequila
>"Hector, are you the..."
>The jig was up, so I nodded
>'Yessiree.'
>The silence is howling
