>*DING-DONG*
>Ugggh, great. The doorbell. Just what you needed right now...
>You were napping on the couch. You've been fighting a pretty bad flu for about a week now, and still feel like hell. The last thing you want is company. Maybe if you ignore it, they'll go away...?
>*DING-DONG DING-DONG*
>...that's a no, then. You groan and rise up off the couch. Rubbing your head and muttering swears under your breath, you make your way to the back door.
>As you approach the blue door, your visitor apparently starts losing their patience, beating on the door loudly. It feels like gunshots to your flu-ridden head.
>"ALRIGHT I'M COMING, KNOCK IT OFF!"
>As if taunting you, the guest rhythmically knocks out Shave and A Haircut, Two Bits.
>It's not until you unlock the door that you have a moment of sudden clarity.
>You don't have a doorbell. Or a back door, for that matter. You live in an apartment on the 10th floor.
>As soon as the lock clicks open, a woman you've never seen throws the door open dramatically.
>"HONEY, I'M HOO~OME! And boy are my feet tired. Long day today."
>She parades right past you, removing a coat and hat and hanging them on a blue coatrack by the door.
>You blink a few times and confront your guest.
>"Who are you supposed to-"
>You trail off when you get a good look at her. She looks to be some sort of... wolf-woman? Her entire body is covered in fur, and she grins widely with a snout full of fangs. A long tail playfully wraps itself around her body, and her ears twitch mischievously.
>She almost looks... painted. Her fur is a dull blue, with geometric patterns in red, white and black. Something about her is vaguely familiar...
>Something else strikes you: she's entirely nude. A rather modest bust sits at the perfect height for her to rest it atop your head effortlessly. Long, slender legs and a lean torso compliment this rack, giving her a fairly athletic build.
>She speaks, smile never wavering.

>"Who am I? Well, I've been called a lot of things! Lemme think. Chaos, Disorder, Mayhem, Mischief, Eris, Trouble, Discord, That Bitch, Whimsy..."
>...you can't help but notice she's counting all these on one hand. Eventually, she stops rattling off names and gestures with her hand, revealing FAR too many fingers. However, her hand quickly returns to normal.
>"...BUT, I prefer Coyote. You may have heard of me...?"
>She grins expectantly, tail bending to resemble a question mark.
>"...I... can't say that I have."
>For the first time since she's walked in, Coyote's smile falters.
>"Oh. Well, uh... if it helps, I'm THE Coyote. From the stories???"
>...you do vaguely remember some old folk tales your grandma read you ages ago.
>"...I thought Coyote was a guy? And not real?"
>She immediately regains her smile and guffaws.
>"Gah-hah-hah! No, no; I was a woman all along, and I'm very much real. See?"
>She suddenly grabs your hand and places it firmly on one of her perky breasts. Yep, she's real.
>"W-wait... aren't you like-"
>Her smile gets even wider, almost literally ear to ear at this point.
>"Like... a goddess? Yes."
>Okay, this is definitely a hallucination caused by your flu meds. But... why not humor this "Coyote?"
>"Alright, prove it."
>"With pleasure. How can I prove myself to you?"
>"Uh..."
>Suddenly, she seems to get an idea. At least, the lightbulb that appears above her head suggests as such.
>"Ooh! Ooh! I got it! Watch this."
>She spins around dramatically, then throws the blue door open, revealing...
>A vast, sprawling desert of blue sand.
>...okay, she may actually be legit.

>"...okay, uh... I think I believe you."
>She chuckles again.
>"Gah-hah, you THINK you believe? Alright, I'll take it. Got a name, eh?"
>"Yeah... Anonymous."
>Her grin becomes a bit strained.
>"A... Anonymymonous? Anymonymous? Amonynous? Anymanomanymus?"
>She tries increasingly incorrect variants on your name, and her tongue quite literally ties itself in knots. Eventually, she lets out a pitiful whine and shrugs, smile drooping into a little frown. She speaks perfectly coherently despite her, uh... condition.
>"I, uh... I'm not good with long words. They get me all tongue twisted. How about I just call you... Nonny?"
>You cringe at the ridiculous nickname, and immediately a mischievous glint appears in her eyes. Her smile returns as her tongue suddenly untangles itself.
>"Gah-hah! Nonny it is then."
>"...can't you call me Anon? My friends do."
>"Mmmmmmnope! Gah-hah! I picked this name and I'm sticking with it!"
>"...alright, fine. Whatever you want to call me."
>Seeing that it's legitimately bothering you, she puts on a more sympathetic smile.
>"...hey. If you don't want me to call you that, I won't. Anon works for me, just so long as I don't have to keep trying to say Anymonymous."
>"Uh... if you don't mind, I'd prefer Anon."
>Her grin immediately regains its manic energy.
>"It's settled; Anon it is then. Congrats on getting a name! Lemme just christen ya real quick."
>Before you can react, she shatters a blue champagne bottle over your head!
>...you barely feel an impact; it's more like she just tapped you on the head, really, despite the clearly broken bottle in her hand.

>You rub your head in confusion, and Coyote gives you an equally confused look. She glances down at the broken blue bottle.
>"...I didn't use the real glass, did I? Lemme just-"
>The bottle regenerates, then the goddess unflinchingly breaks it over her own head, her tongue comically dispensing from her mouth and her eyes temporarily becoming stars.
>She shakes her head violently, then grins.
>"Nah, you should be good!"
>You blink a few times, questions flooding your mind. Coyote sees your thoughtful expression, and her grin widens again.
>"Something on your mind?"
>"...why me? If you're really a goddess, why come to me?"
>She tilts her head thoughtfully, putting a hand to her chin.
>"...well, you just kinda seemed like you could use some company."
>She sees your unimpressed look and immediately throws her hands up in defense.
>"Now hang on, hang on! No need to look daggers at me just yet, gah-hah! I just wanted to brighten up your day a little bit, huh?"
>You shrug.
>"What's it like being a goddess?"
>Her smile seems to extend beyond her face almost.
>"Sooo much fun, Anon. Soooo much. You can't even begin to imagine how much I love my job, gah-hah!"
>"Good for you. Now, tell me: what is it that I can do for you?"
>She flinches, her smile vanishing for a moment in favor of a frown.
>"W- huh? I didn't say anything about needing anything from you. I'm just here for you!"
>Suuuure.
>Whatever. You're too sick for this shit.
>You silently walk away from the probable hallucination and head to your kitchen to heat up some soup.
>Coyote, confused, follows you, ears and tail drooping a bit.

>Grumbling and rubbing your aching head, you grab a can of cheap off-brand soup and start heating it up.
>The walking fever dream silently watches you with a small frown on her face.
>You sigh and mutter under your breath.
>"I wish I weren't so damn out of it. I'm imagining goddesses, talking to myself, answering doors that aren't there..."
>Coyote's frown becomes far more pronounced, and she lets out a sad whimper.
>"...I... I didn't realize you were sick. Sorry."
>You wave a hand at the hallucination with a false smile.
>"Not your fault. Want some soup? I've got extra."
>She blinks a few times in surprise, and a blue exclamation point appears over her head for a moment.
>"...you'd share your food with me? Even though I bothered you?"
>"Why not. Help yourself."
>Coyote's toothy grin returns as she quickly ladles two bowls of soup out. She gently sets yours down in front of you, then pats your head as she sits down across from you.
>"Thank you, Anon; that's very kind of you."
>"Mhm... hey, you're a goddess... can't you just cure me?"
>She frowns for a moment, spoonful of soup halfway to her mouth.
>"...sorry, not my department. I would if I could, though... ACTUALLY, WAIT."
>The mysterious woman jumps from her seat and bolts, leaving her spoon hovering in midair.
>She returns as fast as she left, practically shaking with excitement as she presents a vial full of a green liquid. She catches the spoon just as it begins to fall.
>"Gah-hah-hah, drink this!"
>...you'd rather not. It's glowing, and reeks of earth.
>You sigh.
>"No thanks. I'm sorry, I'm not gonna take a drink from something a hallucination is offering me. I'm too sick to trust my head right now."
>Immediately, her smile vanishes, replaced with a genuinely heartbroken frown.
>"You... you think I'm just an illusion...?"
>She hangs her head and whimpers sadly.

>Coyote looks at you sadly, and you can't help but feel a little guilty.
>But... she's not real, right? There's no way.
>You're just high on flu meds and a fever, and your brain's throwing up memories of Grandma's old Coyote stories.
>...you still feel it's only right to apologize to the mirage.
>"Look... I'm sorry. I'm on very strong medication right now, so you being a hallucination just makes sense to me. I don't mean to hurt your feelings or anything. It's just..."
>She continues to whimper quietly, but seems to be more concerned about you than her own sadness right now.
>"...I work a dead-end job, day in, day out. Every day's the same old story... why would a goddess just show up out of the blue one day? I'm pretty sure you're just my mind remembering those old, made-up stories."
>She momentarily brightens up and guffaws at your unintentional pun, then immediately droops again.
>She looks very... tired, now. Worryingly so, even.
>Coyote sighs deeply, her voice having lost its bright tone in favor of a rather somber one.
>"...I understand. It was a long shot to think anyone still cared about old Coyote. Sorry to have bothered you, and I hope you feel better..."
>She sighs again...
>...was she always a little transparent?
>As Coyote simply sits and sighs, your heart aches.
>Hell, if she's legit, she just wants to help. If she's not, there's no harm done.
>"...actually, let me try that drink, please."
>She smiles, a little more wearily than before, and hands you the vial.
>You hesitate, but drain the liquid...
>It tastes like grass, but you feel a little bit... better.
>You smile.
>"Hey... I feel kinda better. Thanks, uh, Coyote."
>At the sound of her name, she gasps and perks up, smiling.

>"Y'know what? I don't think you ARE a hallucination. That medicine or whatever did in a minute what my doctor couldn't in a week. ...I think you really are THE Coyote."
>Her wide grin returns, and she seems to look more... corporeal again.
>"Since it looks like you're legit... thank you for bringing mankind fire, among other things."
>She cackles wildly.
>"Gah-hah-hah! I knew people still appreticiate- attreciate... I knew people were still happy about that!"
>Before you can react, she dashes over and wraps her arms around you.
>Literally.
>She even somehow ties them into a little "ribbon" on your chest.
>Coyote smiles brilliantly at you, and you hug her back.
>"...thank you again. I actually feel a good bit better. Sorry for being a dick earlier."
>"It's fine! I shouldn't have come out swinging, gah-hah."
>A thought hits your addled mind.
>"...Coyote, did you know my Grandma? She told me stories about you."
>Her eyes widen.
>"YOU are the descendant of a story teller? Oh, I love stories, even moreso if they're about me; I made sure that I touched the life of every single person who ever shared my stories. It's the least I can do!"
>...you have a vague memory of a coyote tooth necklace Grandma loved...
>The goddess steps away, leaving you wrapped up in her arms somehow, then sits and laps up a bit of soup with a smile.
>Her arms simply stretch limitlessly, it seems.

>Coyote leaves you tangled in her arms until she finishes her soup, occasionally looking over and snickering at your predicament.
>You can't help but smile yourself. Her attitude is infectious.
>...but something bothers you.
>Why was she transparent earlier...?
>Was it... what you said?
>When you said you didn't believe in her...
>...
>"Coyote? I'm sorry I said I didn't believe in you. Is that why you turned transparent?"
>She flinches, and her smile becomes more forced.
>"...I didn't want to burden you with this, Anon, but... yes. To be honest with you, I need you."
>"For what?"
>"I need someone who believes in me. You see... I'm a dying goddess. Very few people alive still... still believe in Coyote. It's those few people even keeping me alive. When you said that, I-"
>She whines.
>"...I nearly lost my form. Sorry to put this on your shoulders..."
>You smile, and her whining stops as she returns the gesture.
>"Well, I believe in you. You've got your arms around me now... and besides, your tits sure felt real. In both ways."
>Despite her fur, she blushes wildly.
>"W-well... I thought that was an easy way to prove I was real!"
>"Heh, you came on pretty strong... sure you just need a believer, and not a lover?"
>She gasps as her blush intensifies.
>"...gah-hah-hah!"
>You wink at her.
>"Actually, I'm still a little out of it... maybe if I grabbed another handful of your chest it'd prove you were still real~?"
>She giggles again.
>"...l-let's maybe save that for later, huh?"
>For a goddess, she's pretty cute when she's flustered.

>Even though you feel better...
>You're still exhausted.
>You yawn and smile drowsily at your guest.
>"Thank you again, Coyote, but I need a nap."
>She stands and walks over to you, then retracts her arms. As soon as you're free, you hug her tightly.
>Her fur is soft, but she's mostly lean muscle beneath, it seems.
>She smiles warmly.
>"You're welcome, Anon. Thank you... for believing."
>"...could I... lay in your lap, maybe?"
>She blushes a little, but nods.
>"Sure thing. Let me just..."
>Before you know it, you're lying across a blue-blanketed bed, your head nestled comfortably in Coyote's lap.
>She gently runs a clawed hand through your hair with a smile.
>"Comfy?"
>You nod sleepily.
>"Yes, thanks... Coyote, I hope you know I'll be here for you when I wake up."
>Her eyes glimmer as another genuine smile spreads across her face.
>"...thank you. Sleep well!"
>The bed is the softest you've ever laid on... it contrasts interestingly with her toned legs and soft, smooth fur.
>Either way, you drift off to sleep quickly.
>As with every other night since this flu started, you don't dream...

>You wake up from a fantastic rest, and immediately notice that you feel tons better. Seems like the medicine helped a lot.
>You gently push yourself off the blue blankets of your bed...
>Wait, blue? You have white sheets on your bed.
>Confused, you rise up some more and look behind you.
>In place of a pillow is a furry blue lap...
>You suddenly remember what's happening as you look up to see Coyote still sitting as she was when you fell asleep.
>A toothy smile lingers on her face as she sleeps, her head resting on a hovering blue pillow.
>Abover her head, little blue sheep hop over a similarly-colored fence.
>She snores quietly, occasionally chuckling in her sleep.

>You remember more of what this woman did for you... giving you some miracle medicine, hugging you tightly, apparently giving you the sleep of a lifetime...
>You affectionately scratch the fur around her neck.
>Her smile widens a bit, and she giggles happily, but Coyote remains asleep.
>You reach your other hand up and scratch behind an ear. She practically vibrates in happiness, tail thrashing merrily and ears twitching madly.
>She chuckles again, and mutters in her sleep.
>"mm... the great coyote... slumbered for years... it seemed..."
>Seems like she's narrating her own dreams.
>...DO goddesses dream?
>Whatever the case, her little narrative continues quietly for a moment, then trails off as she snores again.
>The little sheep continue to hop their fence.
>...curious, you poke one roughly.
>The sheep lets off a loud, distressed bleat as it explodes violently into blue confetti.
>Coyote jolts awake with a gasp.
>"GUH! H-huh? Oh! Uh, good morning. Sleep well?"
>You nod, amused, and she smiles again.
>"Great! Glad to hear that."
>She surprises you with another hug, then she stands up...
>And the bed vanishes, dumping you in the floor roughly. Coyote snickers as she falls on her rump as well.
>"Whoops! Gah-hah!"
>You can't help but laugh a bit yourself.

>Smiling, you embrace the goddess to her apparent delight.
>"Thanks again for the medicine. You really helped me out big time."
>"Gah-hah, no problem, Nonny. Imean, Anon."
>"Now... I've gotta go to work today. You're welcome to tag along if you wanna take a different form."
>She guffaws loudly. She laughs so hard that her eyes water.
>"A different form? Gah-hah-hah-hah! What's the fun in that, Anon?"
>"...Coyote, you're blue, and a coyote woman. You're gonna draw attention."
>"Aaaaaand?"
>"...and you're naked."
>She scoffs and waves a hand dismissively.
>"Please. You humans are so uptight about stuff like that. I'll be fine, gah-hah!"
>"...alright, if you insist. Maybe after work we could set up a story telling session at the library or something?"
>She beams.
>"Oooh, that could be fun! ...and a convenient way to spread the word, gah-hah..."
>"Anything in town you wanna see in particular?"
>She scratches her chin thoughtfully, a question mark drifting above her head.
>"Mmmmmmm... I can't think of anything... but I'll admit I'm not too versed in modern day stuff. Soooooo I guess I'll just follow you, gah-hah!"
>"Fair enough."
>You glance at the clock...
>7:55.
>Shit, you have to be in at 8:15!
>You quickly begin getting ready for work...
>A process slightly hampered by your guest. A lock of your hair simply refuses to lay down, springing up with a faint blue blur to it every time you comb over it.
>Your toothpaste tube seems empty until you point it at your face to see if it's clogged... then it squirts a blast of blue paste right at you.
>Basically, everything you need to do is delayed by conspicuously blue tricks.
>You can hear Coyote snickering the whole time.
>After what feels like forever, you manage to get ready... at 8:10.
>You're screwed.
>Coyote whistles loudly, and gestures for you to follow her through a blue door.
>You do...
>And end up right outside your workplace.
>Phew.

>Ah, the office.
>You've been working in the tax office for years now.
>A job that admittedly makes your naturally bitter attitude a little worse.
>But, it pays well enough, and you've always had a knack for numbers. So, meh.
>You hug Coyote and thank her, much to the goddess's joy.
>"My pleasure, gah-hah!"
>You stroll into the office, where your desk awaits. A few wandering eyes widen when they see Coyote, who puts on her best shit-eating grin and waves mockingly.
>Thankfully, nobody dares say a word. Most of them audibly swear off caffeine and alcohol...
>At least one wonders aloud:
>"...the hell did I smoke last night?"
>You chuckle quietly as you boot up your PC.
>Coyote sits in a cushy blue chair next to you, already looking bored.
>You glance out the window...
>The window washer's already at it? Hm.
>Kind of a shame the old guy up and left. You used to hit the bar with him every now and then. Last time you spoke to him, he said something about... being watched?
>...eh, he was probably some paranoid jackass. Doesn't really matter, does it?
>You look back to your computer, then silently begin running the numbers, as usual.
>Coyote lets out a long, low, droning sigh of boredom.
>You apologize, and she grumbles and nods.
>Someone clears their throat, and your heart stops.
>You look up at your coworker, Jim... no, John...
>Ah, screw it, you never learned the guy's name. Whatever it is, he looks... out of it.
>He puts on a fake smile.
>"Hey, Anonymous... are you seeing the same thing I am?"
>He gestures towards Coyote, who grins as a faint blue spotlight shines on her.
>You put on your best poker face.
>"I have no idea what you're talking about. It's too early for this shit, man."
>"...y-yeah. Sorry to bother you."
>He awkwardly shuffles away... then trips over a blue bump in the carpet.
>Coyote does a little fist pump as he drops some papers.

>...a sneaky idea comes to mind. You lean over and whisper to Coyote.
>"hey... let's see how crazy we can make them feel. make them think there's been a gas leak. ...don't actually cause one please."
>She grins wickedly and nods, then begins wandering the office.
>She leans over some of your coworkers' shoulders as they talk at the water cooler, interrupting their chat.
>"Excuse me, do you have the time?"
>One man, confused, looks at his watch, only for a blue bird to burst from the tiny cuckoo clock now mounted on his wrist.
>He faints as Coyote snickers and walks away.
>At another desk, a woman shreds papers. Except...
>Coyote crouches beside her desk, pulling out each shredded up paper and licking it, somehow sticking it back together. She then replaces the newly-repaired paper atop the stack.
>Eventually, the woman catches on when she notices blue writing that gets increasingly mocking and goofy.
>Coyote heads off to prank one more person... when your manager steps out of his office.
>He's an entirely joyless, cold man, and always has been.
>He takes one look at Coyote and grumbles.
>"If yer gonna come to work in costume, at least be decent."
>Coyote frowns for a moment and glances down at her chest, where her nips playfully peek through her fur.
>She looks back up at the manager, with a grin.
>"I don't know what you mean, sir; I'm quite decent."
>He does a double take as a blue suit manifests on Coyote's body instantly. It fits her rather snugly, showing off her lithe figure well.
>She smiles and adjusts a pair of blue-framed glasses as the manager sputters angrily.
>"Harumph. Anyway. Mandatory meeting in 5, people. Conference Room 4."
>You make your way to the conference room, with the newly-suited Coyote joining you.
>"Gah-hah... he's gonna be a fun mark."
>Her smile becomes worryingly sinister, reminding you that she IS in fact a very powerful being.
>Once you sit down, Coyote yawns loudly as a PowerPoint begins.

>As expected, things go awry very quickly...
>But you're concerned to see Coyote look a bit confused. She sniffs the air, then chuckles under her breath.
>"of course!"
>The antics onscreen are definitely not Coyote's doing... they're an electric yellow rather than blue, for starters.
>A pie chart shows up, only for a blue-and-yellow, doglike head to appear and take a bite out of it. A staticky sort of... snickering sound tickles your ears.
>Coyote beams widely...
>Then her own face appears next to the mysterious one. The two exchange a smile, then vanish into electricity and blue confetti respectively.
>The manager makes no sign that he's seen anything, but your coworkers look shellshocked.
>You say nothing, but smile.
>A picture captioned "Best Assets of the Year" changes from a photo of the employees of the year...
>To Coyote and a strange... dog woman? The two are clad in bikinis and flaunting their chests with wide grins. The mystery woman is covered in fluffy blue and yellow fur that seems to stand on end; her eyes are a brilliant yellow.
>Though you can't help but chuckle, you also can't help but admire the picture.
>The actual Coyote elbows you with a snicker as the picture changes again...
>To your manager in a bikini.
>...brain bleach is gonna be needed.
>Someone on the back row retches and runs for the bathroom.
>Again, the boss refuses to acknowledge anything.
>But... his face grows bright red with embarrassment.
>Coyote and her friend continue to screw with the presentation, throwing pie charts back and forth like frisbees, moving the bars on bar graphs around randomly, waving at the audience...
>Eventually, though, it all comes to an end. The two supernatural women take a bow, then vanish from the screen.
>Coyote laughs out loud, and a few people awkwardly chuckle, much to the manager's fury.

>As the manager grumbles and hastily turns off the projector, everyone files out of the conference room.  Everyone that passes you pointedly glances at Coyote, some smiling, others looking horrified.
>Some actually speak to you.
>"...Anonymous, remind me to call my therapist after work today, please..."
>"Hey, uh... d-did you see two sexy dogs in bikinis too- ERR, I-I mean uh, two w-weird dogs?  WEIRD!"
>One particular individual stops and hugs Coyote tightly, snickering with a vaguely staticky voice...
>You blink in shock when you realize it's the same blue-and-yellow woman from the presentation shenanigans.  She winks and extends a blue tongue, then vanishes into lightning.
>You turn to Coyote, who's giggling as her fur stands on end.
>"...who was that?"
>"Mm?  Raiju!  Or, spark dogs, as some call them.  Love those gals, they know how to party, gah-hah!"
>Coyote winks and hugs you, sending a nasty static shock through your body.
>Both the goddess's hearty guffaw and that same fuzzy snicker echo in your ears.
>Your manager stomps by, huffing, and you can't resist poking the bear.
>"Sir, I think you should check for viruses before showing presentations like that."
>He sputters indignantly.
>"I suppose I shall!  Harrumph.  Immature hacker types these days..."
>He glances over at Coyote, the only sign he notices her being a very faint look of fear in his eyes, then shuffles back to his office.
>You pat the goddess on the back.
>"...that was amazing.  Thank you for making that meeting tolerable."
>She beams and hugs you again.
>"No problem!"

>...after a mostly uneventful shift, during which Coyote pointedly rested her head atop yours and fell asleep, you finally clock out for the day.
>She yawns as her suit and glasses vanish, leaving her once again clad in only her fur.
>"Dear gods, Anon, how do you put up with a job that dull?"
>You shrug.
>"It puts food on the table."
>She rolls her eyes and sticks her tongue out.
>"Bah.  I wouldn't last a day in there alone."
>You shrug again as more questions about the mysterious goddess hit you.
>"Say... what have you been doing all these years since you were more widely believed in?  I guess some people still believe if you're still alive, right?"
>She frowns a little.
>"I've done what I've always done: my job.  It's just... without people who believe in me, there's not much reason to pull big tricks like I used to..."
>She whimpers a bit, but catches herself.
>"...isn't it scary, knowing that you could vanish?"
>Coyote's bright attitude vanishes altogether, her blue fur even seeming to lose its hue in favor of a dull gray.  She looks utterly despaired.
>"...Anon.  I do not mince words when I say... it is a fear you cannot imagine."
>"...that bad?"
>She wordlessly presses her hands to your head...
>All you can fear is a visceral, existential terror beyond anything you've ever experienced.  A fear that grips every synapse in your brain and screams that the end times are coming, and it's far too late to prepare for them.  A fear that consumes every happy thought in your vast mind.
>You see your companion through a lens of nightmarish hysteria, with her no longer resembling anything more than a whirling mass of chaos.
>You begin to scream...
>And just as suddenly as the terror hit, it ends.  You are lying on the ground, head in Coyote's lap.
>She looks grim, but her blue hue has returned.
>"...that bad, Anon."
>Shuddering, you stand up and embrace her warmly.
>"Coyote, I will never let you be forgotten."
>Her smile slowly returns.

>"So what exactly counts as belief strong enough to support you?  Just, people acknowledging you?"
>She shakes her head with a little frown.
>"No, no... if it were that simple, I'd be much healthier.  No, they have to know and accept me as Coyote, the goddess.  Acknowledging the coyote woman pulling pranks isn't the same, unfortunately.  ...besides, I don't think people are even willing to do that much anymore.  It even took you a while to accept me..."
>She whimpers, terror slowly becoming visible in her eyes.
>You hug her tightly and scratch behind her ears in an attempt to comfort her.  It seems to help a bit, as she slowly loses her frightened look.
>"I want you to know that I'm here for you, Coyote.  I mean it.  Your stories were always the best things Grandma told."
>She beams, losing her grim look altogether, and surprises you with a kiss on the cheek.
>"Your grandmother was a wonderful woman, Anon."
>"You KNEW her?"
>"Of course!  I told you, I touched the lives of everyone who cared to share my tales.  She was so kind... and her take on my voice?  Wonderfully funny, gah-hah!  I loved her tellings so much that I gave her one of my teeth as a gift!"
>"So the necklace..."
>"That's right, she wore it every day."
>Coyote looks nostalgic as she hugs you tighter.
>"...say, what if we did a show for kids?  Are they a good source of belief?"
>"Err, sometimes.  Children are hard to predict.  Some'll latch onto anything they're told, others are skeptics in the making.  I... I spoke to one once who denied me so forcefully that I lost part of my snout for a while..."
>She suddenly shakes her head violently.
>"No, no.  I have self control, I refuse to get down and out.  I have you, and that's enough to keep me here."
>She puts on a determined smile and pats your head.
>"What if I typed up a collection of stories about you?  That might help."
>She chuckles warmly.
>"That's a great idea... but I get to dictate them to you, okay?"

>"I think I can manage that.  Any reason?"
>"Yes."
>Coyote's voice loses much of its whimsical tone in favor of a more even, almost motherly one.  Her voice echoes somewhat, and it seems the world falls silent, as if to avoid interrupting her.
>"Anon, I want people to know there's more to Coyote than a mere prankster.  I brought fire to mankind, among other things.  Though I admit I have a sense of humor... I don't want to be remembered as a mere joker.  That may be a fate worse than to be forgotten.  I want man to remember me... as Coyote."
>She smiles at you, a faint blue aura surrounding her.
>"Understand?"
>A little in awe of her, you nod.
>She speaks again in that tone you can only call... godly.
>"Thank you, Anon.  You are a good follower.  A good man.  Your grandmother would be so proud..."
>A few nostalgic tears come to your eye, and Coyote gently hands you a blue handkerchief with a caring look.
>...you have a lot of good memories of Grandma.  She certainly gave more of a shit about you than your parents.
>You can't help it.  Thinking about her just gets your waterworks going.
>Coyote smiles gently and embraces you, wiping your eyes with her tail.
>She coos in a comforting voice.
>"It's alright, Anon.  I promise."
>...it helps.

>Dammit.
>Now you just want to talk about her with someone else who loved her.
>"...she meant a lot to me.  My parents never cared about me.  Soon as Grandma was able, she got custody of me.  That woman raised me singlehandedly till I was old enough to move out.  Even though... even though she could barely walk herself."
>Coyote nods, hugging you tightly.
>Her normally soft fur feels even more plush now, almost pillowy.
>"She told me all kinds of stories... but yours were her favorite.  I remember... I remember her smile when she said a friend gave her that necklace..."
>You can't help but get choked up again.  Coyote pulls you even closer.
>You begin to worry that people may see your breakdown, but it soon hits you:
>You're no longer in the street.  
>You're in an expanse of blue sand, with a soothingly warm breeze tickling you.
>Coyote closes her eyes and rests her head atop yours.
>"Please, go on, Anon."
>And so you do.
>You spill your guts about everything that woman did for you.  You pour out your heart and soul, recalling when...
>When she got sick...
>...
>...
>Eventually, you can't go on.  You collapse into a tearful heap.  Coyote gently sits down, pulling you into her lap, and begins quietly humming a mystical-sounding song...
>...one you faintly remember Grandma humming as well.
>Tears in your eyes, you smile.
>"T-thanks... I will do anything you need, Coyote.  The world will remember you for you.  I swear it."
>She continues humming serenely, but somehow her voice echoes in your ears.
>"I know, Anon, and I thank you."
>You lay in her lap for a while, merely reminiscing as her music and the soft sands comfort you...

>You cuddle up close to the goddess, enjoying the heavenly softness of her fur as well as the reassuring warmth of her body.
>She keeps her eyes closed, a cozy, loving smile across her face.
>You begin to calm down, your sadness being slowly melted away.
>Coyote's song seems to echo along the blue dunes surrounding you, turning what should be one woman's humming into a full on chorus.
>She cracks an eye and glances down at you, then closes it again, apparently satisfied.
>You can't help but look upon your surroundings...
>The desert stretches on endlessly, the blue sands marked with patterns not unlike those decorating Coyote's own body.  A blue sun hangs overhead, giving off just enough heat to be comfortable.
>Despite a breeze blowing, not a grain of sand is disturbed unless you run your hands across the ground.
>You gently dig a hand into the sand, and Coyote stops humming for a second to giggle.
>A few birds fly overhead, their chirping harmonizing with the goddess's music.
>You could lie here forever and never feel uncomfortable.
>Her voice tickles your ears again.
>"Do you like it, Anon?  This is my home."
>You nod.
>"I love it.  It's beautiful, just like you."
>Her warm laughter echoes in your head.  
>"Thank you.  I rarely bring mortals here... I'm glad you like it."
>She strokes your hair lovingly as you melt into her lap.
>The stress and boredom of your job dissipates, as does your sorrow over Grandma.
>Instead, you feel a sort of... divine comfort.

>As she continues to hum, you ask Coyote something.
>"Why pick this desert for your home?  Where are we?"
>Another silvery chuckle rings in your head, not interrupting her serenade.
>"Is it not obvious, Anon?  I am this place, and it is me."
>For a split second, she vanishes.  You look around, and realize that you're no longer lying on sand...
>You're surrounded by blue fur.
>Somehow you know you're lying atop her stomach.  She chuckles again, and in an instant you're back on the sand, your head in her lap.
>"Could you... tell me a story?"
>"Of course... I'll even sing one for you."
>Coyote croons a tale of her own past in a beautiful voice.  The birds overhead adjust their tunes accordingly, and even the wind seems to harmonize.
>In the sky above, clouds illustrate the story.
>A massive buffalo pursues Coyote, only for the goddess to leap into a tree.  The song tells of her deal with the beast, promising to make him horns sharp enough to slay his usurper.
>With ease, she carves the perfect horns from a tree and sends the buffalo on his way.  He kills his rival with ease, repaying the goddess with a cow.
>Coyote can't help but snicker during her own song as she disobeys the buffalo's warning, ultimately losing the reward.
>Once she finishes the story, she hums along to her new melody for a while, prompting you to join in with her.
>There's a faint gasp as the whole desert seems to become more vivid than before... more lively.
>Coyote embraces you tightly, still humming her wonderful tune.
>Her tail gently coils around you lovingly, no tricks attached.

>You slowly sit up, and wrap your arms around Coyote, hugging her tightly.
>Her eyes glimmer with little tears of happiness as she returns the gesture, still humming her divine melody.
>Slowly, carefully, you gently take one of her hands into yours.  She interlocks her fingers with yours and smiles...
>Her blue irises become heart shaped as she resumes her song.
>Coyote rests her head on your shoulder with a contented sigh.
>You slowly lie down on the sand, with Coyote following.
>Once all the way down, you sigh happily.
>There, in the warm sand, you rest alongside a goddess- no, your goddess, holding her hand and enjoying her soft crooning.

>As you lie beside Coyote, relaxing, you idly reach over and scratch her belly.  The goddess snickers at first, then simply smiles appreciatively.
>She scoots closer to you and leans her head against yours with a contented sigh.
>"Anon, I could lie here with you for eternity..."
>...Anon, eh?
>"Coyote... if you want, you can call me Nonny.  I'm fine with that."
>She gasps and looks over at you, mouth agape.
>"Really?  Thank you, Nonny, I appreciate that.  I love giving nicknames, and it warms my heart when people accept them."
>She grins and nuzzles you affectionately.
>"So, what do you recommend we do to raise belief in you?"
>A few blue gears appear above her head, spinning wildly.
>"...maybe I could hand out some gifts?  I used to do that a lot.  One time, I even took over Easter and handed out gifts...!  But, that's another story, for another time."
>"That might work.  ...is there anything else you want to do, here or in my world?"
>She thinks for a moment, and nods.
>"Yes.  I want to... spend as much time with you as possible. That's all."
>Coyote embraces you with a smile.

>For a moment, Coyote perks up an ear and grins wider.  You have a short vision of being literally embraced by her smile, a band of glittering teeth wrapping around you lovingly...
>You shake your head to clear it of your strange musing.
>Instead, you decide to set a goal for yourself:
>Get Coyote to a level of recognition that rivals even Santa Claus.
>It won't be easy... but if she can help people out, that'll be a good boost to her belief.
>"Coyote, I will be here for this awareness quest till the very end. I hope you know that."
>She nods and hugs you again.
>"I know, Nonny.  I know you are a good man, and more importantly a good follower.  Thank you."
>"You're welcome.  Do you suppose that book of stories idea from before could help?"
>"It certainly wouldn't hurt anything.  Besides, I love telling Coyote stories, gah-hah!"
>"Well, if we do this, a whole new generation of people will know about you and your work.  That should boost your belief a good bit."
>She nods again and grins.
>"That's a great point.  See, this is why I need someone like you; you're good with practical problems!  Meanwhile, I'm just good at practical jokes."
>As if to demonstrate her point, she grabs your hand again, only for an electric shock to travel up your arm courtesy of a blue joy buzzer.
>As Coyote guffaws, you begin trying to think of a prank she might fall for...
>...but how do you trick someone with DIVINE prowess at tricks?
>Oh well.
>"...Coyote, how does time work here?"
>"Nonny, you could stay here a year, and step back into your world only a minute after you left it."
>"Great."
>You pull yourself as close as possible, then snuggle against Coyote.  She returns the favor, the two of you getting supernaturally cozy together.

>While continuing to snuggle against the goddess, some more questions come to you.  You can't help it; the fact that you're lying next to a goddess has your curiosity flaring up.
>"So, are there other deities watching my world?"
>"Yes, there are many, many of us watching.  Both big names and little ones, both almighty and barely clinging to life.  One in particular that springs to mind is Capra, the goat goddess of love and pleasure..."
>"That seems... oddly specific."
>She shrugs.
>"Almost every species has their own notion of love, and so their own love goddess.  Capra just happens to be one of the older ones still around."
>"...do you know anyone who's been lost?"
>"...yes.  But... Nonny, imagine knowing that you had a friend once, and that you lost them.  Now imagine that you cannot remember anything else about that friend beyond the fact that they existed once, and now they don't."
>"That sounds awful."
>"It is.  And because nobody remembers them... they cannot return to life.  Their only hope is for a mortal to stumble upon relics of their existence."
>"Well, I'll make sure you never end up forgotten.  You and I will write down your stories.  We'll even make new ones."
>"You'd make new stories with me?"
>"Of course."
>She beams and hugs you once more.
>"So... let's start off from the top.  How did you come to be, Coyote?"
>She settles into a more smooth tone of voice.
>"Ages and ages ago, a tribe of men were wandering the desert.  Their supplies had been ransacked and destroyed by wild animals, including a roving pack of coyotes.  Driven to their deaths by heat and dehydration, the tribe cried out to anyone who could help them.  The response?  A lone coyote, come to investigate the sound.  The priest of the group fell on his face, beseeching the coyote for help.  He led it to their last remaining food supply... and was promptly struck down by the leader.  This leader turned to the coyote and laughed.  Some god you are, he said.  If anything, you are but a god of tricksters, trying to rob us of our last morsels.  Begone!  And so, the beast left... and the tribe died, cursing the trickster god their leader had run off.  Their belief, however misguided, birthed a true goddess... The Great Coyote."

>"Before you go on, could you give me something to write this down with?"
>"Hm?  Oh, sure."
>A blue notebook appears in your lap; it quickly opens up as words begin appearing on its pages: Coyote's birth story.
>"There!  Should save you some writer's cramp, anyway."
>"Thank you.  So, what did you do after being born?"
>"After being fully born as a goddess, The Great Coyote found herself overwhelmed with her newfound existence.  All she knew was that she was a goddess of tricksters... so she set out to play tricks on someone.  Who?  She wasn't yet sure.  However, she saw something that caught her eye... a flame.  At that time, man had not yet discovered fire.  Those who had harnessed it hoarded it greedily, looking down upon man for their ignorance.  Coyote visited these firebearers, hoping to sleep by their flame and learn its secrets.  However, they looked down upon her as well.  This filled Coyote with anger.  How could they be so rude to a goddess?  So, she waited.  She waited for the firebearers to fall asleep.  Once they did, she snatched handfuls of their fire and fled, but not before flinging an ember into ther tent.  The firebearers, having grown accustomed to the heat, perished, refusing to leave the warmth of their tent.  In the meantime, Coyote realized something... fire was HOT!  It burnt and blackened her claws, and in her haste to take the fire to her home, she dropped several pieces of it.  Those pieces scorched several animals, burning them and their descendants for eternity.  As Coyote continued to run and drop the fire, she noticed something: mankind, eyeing the fire with need.  So... she bestowed upon man the fruits of her theft, and man gained fire."
>Coyote stands and bows, and you politely applaud.
>"...not to be rude, but how does this work when Prometheus brought fire to man?"
>"Mm?  Ah yes!  Coyote brought fire to man in her domain alone; Prometheus did the same for his domain."
>"I see.  What's your favorite story?"
>She gasps and chuckles.
>"Favorite?  Why, Nonny, you insult me!  That is like asking a mother who her favorite child is!"

>"C'mon, there must be a story you look back on fondly..."
>Coyote narrows her eyes and forces a frown...
>But soon cracks, laughing and grinning.
>"Okay, okay!  I'll share a recent one I look back on with a smile."
>You snicker and elbow her.
>"Coyote, you look on everything with a smile."
>"Gah-hah, that's true!"
>She clears her throat, then speaks in her "narrator" voice.
>"One day, The Great Coyote was watching the mortal world with interest, as she often did.  What she found was interesting: mortals had developed a fascination with bars.  It seemed that many of them whiled away their afternoons in the establishments, and this tickled Coyote greatly.  You see, mayhem often erupted when mortals and alcohol mixed, and so this arrangement proved very attractive to the goddess.  So... Coyote became a bartender in the mortal world.  She did a wonderful job, working in such places as a mob-run club, a smoky bar in a small town, and even a lounge atop a grand tower.  At each and every one, she made sure that her mischief shined through.  And shine it did!  Every bar that employed Coyote saw some of its most successful days ever, albeit after some chaos unlike any they'd seen before.  Coyote was happy... but after weeks of this, she grew tired.  The Great Coyote's feet began to ache from hours upon hours of standing behind her bar counters.  And so, after serving one final party of four at her favorite venue, she retired from her career.  Coyote left the lounge, and sought out a resting place.  However... in searching for one, she sensed something: a mortal in need of a brighter day.  So, Coyote ventured to his home.  That day... the goddess Coyote met her greatest follower, and the man she loved."
>"W-"
>Before you can say anything, she kisses you.

>Coyote ends her kiss and smiles lovingly, her blue irises going heart shaped.
>You stammer.
>"M-man you love?"
>"Of course, Nonny.  You still believe in me.  You're willing to help me regain followers.  You even let me play tricks on you and your boss.  I mean what I say.  I love you."
>...this seems rather sudden, but...
>You can't deny feeling the same way.
>It's odd, really.
>Thanks to Grandma's stories, Coyote always felt like a near and dear friend.  Even though at the time, the stories were vague on the trickster's gender, you've always felt an odd attraction to the character.
>At first you chalked it down to wanting to be like the wily Coyote.  But, as you grew older, certain... interests began to creep into your life.
>You'd be lying if you said you'd never imagined Coyote as a woman before.
>That said, seeing her in person trumps even your wildest fantasy.
>Hearing her stories firsthand... hearing how lovingly she speaks of Grandma... seeing how she obviously cares for you...
>There's only one thing you can say.
>"I love you too."
>The goddess smiles earnestly, no hint of her usual mischief, and hugs you close, incidentally burying your face in between her modest bosoms.
>"Thank you, Nonny."
>Again, the desert around you seems more vivid than before.  Seems that love is more powerful than mere belief.
>As you remain snuggled into her chest, you begin feeling a not entirely unwelcome sensation...
>You both do and don't want her to notice you quietly popping a boner during this tender moment.
>The goddess gives you another gentle kiss...
>Then suddenly sniffs the air, tilting her head.
>"...Nonny, is that you?"
>She releases her grip on you, then glances down with a gasp.
>"...you... you really think of me THAT way?"
>"Uh..."
>There's a pause as she blushes through her fur, looking uncharacteristically bashful.
>"...I see.  Well, ah, if that's how you feel..."
>Still sheepishly avoiding eye contact, she carefully lays on her back, spreading her legs.
>"...then I want you to show me."
>"W-what?"
>She smiles sheepishly, tail covering her nethers carefully.
>"...some followers provide offerings of p-physical love to their goddess.  I have never received such a gift... and I want you to show me your love."
>...you quickly yank off your clothes as the blushing Coyote eyes you up.

>Once you're fully undressed, you carefully approach her.  She glances at you, then is suddenly lifted up on a small dune of sand; she's at the perfect height for you to penetrate without needing to crouch.
>...wait.  Isn't this world...
>"Coyote, didn't you say that this desert IS you?"
>She smiles again.
>"I did.  And it is."
>"How will this work?"
>"Nonny, I'll be honest: I have no idea."
>...well, only one way to find out.
>She blushes again.
>"...I've never done this before.  Please be gentle..."
>You carefully lay down atop her, being sure not to rest your weight on the goddess.
>With one hand, you reach up and scratch her ears, feeling them twitch wildly at your touch.  A gentle smile spreads across her face, and you return the gesture.
>With the other hand, you rub her belly, feeling her soft fur and firm midsection beneath your fingers.  She closes her blue eyes, taking a deep breath before sighing in contentment.
>Birds fly overhead once more, singing quietly.
>You slowly allow your hand to climb up towards her chest, soon kneading one of her tits.  Her nipple quickly stiffens as she lets a moan escape her lips.
>A bashful smile again comes to her face.
>"...you're very gentle.  Thank you."
>Taking care not to push her too hard, you continue to massage her chest, now using both hands.  She quietly pants and moans, watching you with a blush.
>Eventually, she nods, trembling.
>"...I think... it's time, Nonny."
>You know exactly what she means.
>You carefully crawl off of the goddess, then stand up.  She stares with anticipation.
>Carefully grabbing a leg in each hand, you slowly plunge into Coyote's slit.  She lets out a long sigh as a hot breeze blows across your back.
>Coyote smiles lovingly at you, sand propping her head up.
>"Please, keep going."
>Enjoying the warm wind, you begin slowly, tenderly pumping in and out of the goddess.  She lets off quiet moans and sighs, each one punctuated by another warm desert breeze.
>The birds overhead lose their focus, ceasing their singing in favor of echoing their mistress's moans.
>As you slowly speed up your thrusts, Coyote allows the sand beneath her head to dissolve, causing her to lay back flat, no longer watching you.
>She sighs in satisfaction, and begins singing another mystical melody, the wordless tune giving you a rhythm to match.
>Sweat begins to pour down your body as the desert sun slowly grows more intense.
>Coyote's singing becomes more and more strained, notes breaking and giving way to moans and whines.
>Her long tail snakes around you, squeezing your middle lovingly.  She shakingly reaches up and cups one of her own breasts in a hand, gently kneading it as you spread her legs farther.
>Soon, she can no longer carry a tune.  The goddess devolves into merely panting, repeating your name in a reverent tone when she catches her breath.
>"Nonny... my follower... my love..."
>With a sudden, loud howl of bliss, Coyote comes to her climax, her walls clamping down on you tightly and bringing you to the edge.
>You unload within the goddess, feeling her warmth increase, then fall forwards, landing on her lean stomach.
>It begins to rain gently, with cool drops tickling your bare skin.  Despite the weather, you feel perfectly dry.
>Coyote's soft fur gently brushes against you as you lie atop her, exhausted.
>She wraps her arms around you lovingly as the blue birds begin singing again.  Coyote kisses you lovingly, tears of happiness running down her snout.
>She looks more colorful, more vibrant...
>More alive than ever.

>...of course.  Love is more powerful than mere belief, and as she said, sex is a legitimate expression of your love.
>This may actually be a valid way to devote yourself to her.
>You make a mental note to try this if she gets particularly weak in the future.  Certainly wouldn't hurt.
>You wrap your own arms around the panting goddess, running your fingers through her smooth fur.
>Coyote sighs happily and kisses you once more.
>"Thank you, Nonny.  For your love... and for taking it easy on me."
>You nod and rest your head on her, hugging her closer.
>"Of course.  Anything for you."
>More tears of joy drip down her face.
>"You are truly the best follower I've ever had."
>...you can't help yourself.
>"In more ways than one?"
>She suddenly guffaws loudly, her usual goofy smile returning, then abruptly snaps back to her adoring gaze.
>You simply lie there atop the goddess for a while, enjoying her warmth and softness.  Eventually, your stomach growls.
>"Mm?  Hungry, Nonny?  Let's step back into the mortal world, maybe grab a bite to eat."
>A door suddenly appears beneath your partner.  By the time you figure out what's coming, the door flies open.
>Coyote embraces you tighter as the two of you fall through the open passage...
>With a loud OOF, the two of you land on your bed, back in your apartment.
>She giggles and kisses you again as you sigh in relief.

>The two of you lie on your bed comfily, with you simply resting atop her, enjoying her softness.
>While relaxing, you smile lovingly at her, with the goddess returning your gesture.
>A thought comes to your mind...
>"Say... since you're here, does this mean that my apartment is like a shrine to you now?"
>She thinks for a moment, blue gears spinning above her head, then grins.
>"I hadn't thought of that, actually, but I suppose it counts, gah-hah!  Imagine: a Shrine of Coyote, in this modern day and age.  Almost brings a tear to my eye..."
>Before your eyes, your apartment is bathed in a faint blue light.  Coyote again looks more vibrant and lively, her smile widening and tail wagging happily.
>A small stone statue of the goddess appears atop your dresser, a broad grin plastered on its face.  Coyote snickers at her handiwork.
>"Hope you don't mine me sprucing this place up a bit?"
>"Of course not.  Go right ahead."
>She hugs you tightly as more and more bits of blue decor appear.
>A framed painting of Coyote hugging you.  A jar of blue sand with NONNY written in it with black sand.  A blue bird in a cage.
>Before long, her influence couldn't be more obvious.
>...and truth be told, you don't mind in the slightest.
>What you DO mind, however, is your grumbling stomach.  Coyote gasps and grins sheepishly.
>"Oh yeah, you're hungry.  Sorry, I almost forgot!  Where to?"
>"...how about the pizza place down the road?"
>"Sounds great to me; wanna walk or take the fun way?"
>"Uh, how about we w-"
>"TIME'S UP, FUN WAY IT IS!"
>Coyote leaps onto you, wrapping her arms and legs around your torso with a giggle.
>Suddenly, a blue whirlwind envelopes you, spinning you around wildly as the goddess cackles with glee.  She clings on for dear life as you start to feel dizzy...
>Eventually, the wind stops; you slow to a halt, then promptly fall backwards, with Coyote landing atop you.
>She winks and sticks her tongue out playfully, and you shake your head to clear it.
>She soon lets you up, and the two of you head into the pizza place.

>This old restaurant has never really been much to look at.  It's pretty dated, decor wise.
>But... they make the best pizza in town here, so you're absolutely willing to deal with tacky interior design.
>While you're not at all impressed, Coyote seems awestruck.
>Her eyes seem to twinkle as she looks around with a gleeful smile.
>"Wow.  I love this place already!  I appreciate a less modern look every now and again."
>Guess that makes sense; she is a rather old goddess despite appearing to be maybe 10 years older than you physically.
>You walk up to the hostess stand and get a table for two; the woman behind the counter glances at Coyote with apparent confusion, but says nothing.
>Once you're seated, you open up the menu.
>"So, what kind of topping do you like, Coyote?"
>"Mm?  Uh... hm.  Do they have buffalo meat?"
>"...I, uh... I doubt it."
>She frowns and huffs indignantly.
>"What kinda self respecting pizza joint doesn't have the best topping?  I'll be back, wait here."
>Before you can stop her, Coyote stomps back into the kitchen.  As she walks, her frown gives way to a grin as all manner of chaos breaks out in her wake.
>Pizzas fly up into the air on blue gales of wind.  Toppings relocate themselves to other pies as patrons reach for the slice they want.  Various lights glow brilliantly, "coincidentally" shining as to make an image of Coyote's face on the wall.
>But the worst?
>The lid on a shaker of red pepper flakes promptly unscrews itself just as a man goes to add some seasoning to his food.  A man you recognize, with a stifled snicker, as your manager.
>Eventually, the goddess makes it to the kitchen, a blue apron and chef's hat spontaneously appearing on her person as she enters.
>She throws one last mischievous wink your way as the door closes behind her.
>...shit.

>This is gonna go down one of two ways.
>Either you'll get a questionable pizza with minimal fuss...
>Or you'll have to find a new favorite pizza place.
>It all comes down to what Coyote does in that kitchen.
>You flag a waiter down and ask for a beer; you're probably gonna need it soon.
>Suddenly, the door to the kitchen opens up; a man is literally kicked out by a familiar blue foot.  He flies forwards and lands face first in a pizza, with a loud snicker punctuating his landing.
>To your growing horror, more and more kitchen staff are evicted as the lights in the back room steadily grow blue.  The ambient chaos of the dining room slowly ramps up...
>Metal trays whirr through the air like mad frisbees.  Breadsticks swing about in mock swordfights.  The radio station changes to some song you've never heard...
>A familiar voice welcomes listeners to KYOT Radio, and then promptly kicks off a wild, jazzy tune.
>Glasses and bottles literally dance across tables, growing tiny blue legs and kicking along to the music.
>From the kitchen, you hear Coyote herself whistling along to the music, with loud BANGS and bright flashes of light occasionally peppering her melody.
>People around the restaurant look... impressed?  The hell?
>Sure, a few look horrified.  But the majority?
>They seem to love it.  Especially the kids.
>Suddenly, a triumphant yell echoes from the kitchen's depths as what seems to be a massive blue firework flies out of the window.
>It flies right into the center of the room, where a disinterested delivery guy regards it with a complete lack of expression.
>You hold your breath as the firework halts and seems to swell up...
>...then gasp as it bursts, showering the whole room in blue sparks.
>When the smoke clears, you're shocked to see that everything is... back to normal.
>Coyote, clad in her apron and chef hat, steps out of the kitchen with a smug grin, carrying a large pizza in one hand.
>"Bon appetit!  One Coyote Special, hot and ready."
>She serves up the food, then sits down as her clothes promptly vanish.

>Without hesitating, Coyote grabs a slice of her cooking and takes a bite, her face lighting up with joy.
>"Mm-mm!  You have to try this, Nonny; you'll love it."
>...will you?
>You're not entirely convinced that, uh, buffalo pizza is going to taste particularly good.
>But...
>You can't say no to that face.  She apparently worked hard on this.
>Putting on a fake smile, you grab a slice and take a bite.  You brace yourself for what's sure to be the worst food you've ever-
>Hey wait, this isn't bad at all.
>Indeed, it's actually... it's actually pretty good!
>Your smile becomes genuine as you heartily scarf down the rest of your slice.  Coyote looks genuinely thankful.
>"You really like it?"
>"I do, thank you."
>"I'm so glad to hear that!"
>Coyote reaches across the table with both arms, letting them extend unnaturally so she can hug you remotely.
>When she lets you go, you grab and wolf down another slice of her pizza.
>The two of you quickly polish off the rest of the food, grinning and chatting idly as the other patrons watch and murmur.
>Eventually, your blood runs cold when someone approaches...
>A cop.
>The officer looks over at you with a strange smile, eyes totally obscured by shades.
>"Evenin'.  You two enjoyin' yourselves?"
>You nod, and so does Coyote.
>"Greeeeat.  Listen: I got a disturbin' the peace complaint on you, so I'm gonna need you to leave."
>You smile.
>"Sure thing, officer.  Sorry for the inconvenience."
>"Mm.  Don't let it happen again, alright?"
>He nods curtly, then shuffles off awkwardly...
>Only to accost and handcuff a guy your age before leading him out of the pizza place.
>Wiping sweat from your brow,  you quickly hop up as Coyote happily packs up the last slices of pizza in a blue box.
>With that, the two of you head out, with several people high-fiving Coyote as she passes by.
>Her smile is definitely earnest.

>As you quickly exit the pizza place, Coyote snickers and scarfs down a slice of her buffalo pizza.
>"Well, that was interesting.  Did that help with your belief any?"
>She nods, mouth too full to speak.
>"Mhm!  Mfew new belieferf."
>"Great to hear."
>You give her a celebratory hug, then keep walking when you see the cop from before, still leading his perp away.
>The guy insists he did nothing wrong as the officer simply grins, showing no signs of halting his march.
>Man, are you glad you aren't THAT guy.
>Instead, you're lucky enough to have an audience with a literal goddess.
>Subconsciously, you hug her again.
>Coyote finishes her slice with a sigh of happiness.
>"Ah... that was a good dinner.  What now, Nonny?"
>"Uh... maybe a movie or something?"
>"Sounds good to me; anything good playing?"
>"There's some neat looking stuff out now.  We could always just pick out something when we get there."
>"Sounds like a plan to me!  Let's head thatta way."
>Casting one last glance back at the unfortunate arrestee, you head off to the theatre.

<???>

>What the hell?
>You were enjoying a nice dinner at your favorite pizza place, then everything suddenly went berserk!  Then, when you thought it was all calming down, you got arrested?!
>Man, what a bad day.
>Could things possibly get worse?
>...probably.  Sigh.

>As the officer stiffly leads you away, you plead innocent.  You really didn't do anything!
>He says nothing, only chuckling and smiling.  Seems he's not interested in hearing you out at all.
>You sigh... and shrug as a longshot solution comes to mind.
>You throw up a prayer to Anubis, hoping in vain maybe SOMETHING will happen.
>...
>...
>...sigh.  So much for that.
>You're shoved awkwardly into the back seat of an unmarked white car.  The cop laughs again as he climbs into the driver's seat.
>"Ready to go, dirtbag?"
>Defeated, you nod and sigh... 
>Only to hear banging on the window.
>You look up to see...
>...no way.
>A broad, muscular-looking jackal woman(?) in a business suit, holding a wad of papers. She gestures for the cop to roll down his window, and he does so reluctantly.
>She eyes him with harsh intensity and speaks with a haughty tone.
>"Have you got proof this man did anything wrong?"
>"Err..."
>"How about probable cause to overstep your jurisdiction?  I can smell that you're not from here, and are indeed far from home."
>"Well, you see..."
>"Do you even have identification?"
>"Uh...!"
>"Then you haven't the right to arrest this man.  Release him NOW."
>With a splutter and a defeated sigh, the cop lets you go, shaking his head and muttering.
>"...have to find one... try a different excuse..."
>He hops back into his car, flips you the bird, and speeds off.  The jackal huffs indignantly, then turns to you.
>"Are you injured?"
>You shake your head.
>"Excellent.  Please, if you ever need my help again, just ask.  I think you'll find I'm rarely busy."
>"Thanks, Miss, uh..."
>"Anubis."
>You faint.

<Anon>

>As you walk, a bad feeling creeps down your spine.
>"I dunno, Coyote... something about that cop was just off."
>"Hm.  I didn't smell another deity around... could just be a weird mortal, I guess?"
>"I hope that guy was alright."
>The goddess cranes her neck and perks up an ear, then smiles.
>"Yeah, he's fine.  It all worked out, I promise!"
>...you feel reassured by her smile, and put the incident behind you.

>After a surprisingly uneventful walk, you make it to the theatre.
>As fate would have it, they're playing some cheap knockoff of that Percy Jackson movie from some years ago.  Jacky Person and the Thunder Burglar, apparently.
>Sometimes you wonder how Hollywood gets away with this shit.
>Anyway, you head inside and buy your tickets, pulling Coyote away from a popcorn machine when it starts glowing an ominous blue.
>She puts on an exaggerated pout, but relents and grins after a second.
>"So what's this about, anyway, Nonny?"
>"It's about demigods and gods."
>Her eyes light up.
>"Oooh!  Am I in it?"
>"...I don't think so.  Sorry."
>"Aww.  Oh well; I can see how you humans interpret some gods I know!"
>With that, you make your way to your seats.

>The movie is almost hilarously low budget.  A fact not lost on Coyote, who's been laughing hysterically the whole time.
>The other patrons have been throwing popcorn for a while now.
>"Gah-hah-hah, did you see that?  Hades, in a hawaiian shirt?  Oho man, that's rich!"
>"Is... is that supposed to be Cerberus?  Oh man!  The big girl wouldn't be happy to see this; they've made her a big dumb beast!"
>"GAH-HAH-HAH-HAH!  They- They made Anubis a guy!  Gah-hah-hah!"
>"Aaand of course Zeus is a creeper; at least they got that one right."
>Her running commentary continues for the whole film, eventually driving the other watchers to leave.  
>You're now all alone with the goddess and her raucous laughter.
>...her infectious laughter.
>You crack up yourself, cackling with the hysterical goddess.  She wraps her arms around you and hugs you, still laughing, and you return the favor.

>When the two of you finally stop laughing, the theatre is silent.
>You share a smile, then kiss her on the cheek.
>She blushes a bit, then pulls you into a tight hug.
>You flinch when you hear a woman speaking from behind you.
>"Hmhmhm, seems the mortal made the first move.  One would think a force as wild as Coyote would be the dominant one."
>You look around in confusion as a familiar, staticky chuckle echoes, heralding a rather energetic-sounding woman's voice.
>"Well, Cap, there's a first time for everything, kheh heh!"
>Another, more businesslike voice speaks up.
>"Why are we watching this?  I thought we were watching that montage of historical assassinations I made..."
>"Death, nobody said that but you, kheh!"
>"I'm acutely aware of that now, thank you."
>"Shhh... silence now, both of you; they're listening."
>You look up at the screen and see three silhouttes on a blank white background.
>One seems to be a goat woman, another is clearly the Raiju from Coyote's presentation, and the last...
>It looks like some amalgam of bones.
>The Raiju waves with another crackling giggle.
>"Hello again, kheh heh!"
>The bony silhouette rapidly changes shape, now resembling a sabretooth tiger's skull.
>"Bah, we never watch what I want to watch.  I don't know why I hang around with you two."
>"Because people die from electricity a lot?"
>"Perhaps because I nearly passed into your domain once, and you're merely waiting for the possibility of it happening again?"
>"...it was a rhetorical question.  Whatever, I need some coffee."
>"If you keep drinking that stuff, you're gonna die, kheh heh!"
>"I swear to gods I will kill you where you stand."
>Coyote looks at you and shrugs with a grin.
>"Movie club.  What can I say?"

>In the interest of friendliness, you decide to chat up the audience.
>"So, uh... who are you ladies?"
>All three of them chuckle.
>"I am Capra, o follower of Coyote.  A goddess of love... and pleasure."
>"I'm Volta, the Raiju from your office!"
>"I'm Death, simple as that."
>"Nice to meet you all?  Don't you think watching a couple kiss is a bit rude?"
>"Hardly... it IS my jurisdiction, after all."
>"Nah, even if it is, I ain't worried about manners, kheh!"
>"I'll be honest and say: yes, it's kinda rude."
>"Okay... hey, maybe you guys would want to watch a movie with us?  We're trying to chronicle some of Coyote's stories to bolster her belief."
>"Hmm, and I suppose you need inspiration, o Coyote priest?"
>"If you can help, it'd be much appreciated."
>"Oooh!  Ooh!  Lemme start up a movie, kheh!  Whatcha wanna watch?"
>"A moment, Volta.  Mortal, why don't you and your goddess head to the library after this?  You could find out what tales of her exploits have already been published."
>"Good idea... thanks, uh, Death."
>The bony silhouette noncommitally waves a hand.
>Volta's silhouette vanishes, then reappears as another low-budget pantheon-themed movie starts...

>The movie soon reveals itself as some stupid comedy along the line of Weekend At Bernie's, in which Anubis tries to convince the public that King Tut never died.
>It's okay, you guess.
>In just a moment, Capra, Volta, and Death manifest in the theatre.  Capra sits regally in a chair like it was a throne.  Volta reclines and kicks up her feet.  Death collapses roughly, slouching in her seat.
>Seeing them in person is quite different from seeing their shadows.
>Capra is clad in a robe that exposes her prodigous bust proudly.  Her horns curve elegantly, and several golden bits of jewelry decorate her body, with emeralds set in each piece.  Her green eyes watch you intently.  She suddenly blinks a few times and, blushing an emerald green, pulls her robe up so it covers her chest.
>Volta's loud blue-and-yellow fur seems to stand on end, making it difficult to discern her exact build.  She, like Coyote, wears nothing but her fur.  Her yellow eyes glow brilliantly with energy, small sparks occasionally discharging from them.
>Death has incredibly thin-looking skin and pale blond fur stretched over a bony, gaunt form.  Bullet holes dot her chest, as do stab wounds.  A noose dangles from her neck.  She appears to be the tallest of the trio, and wears a white suit stained with blood in places.  She seems rather bored.
>Capra chuckles.
>"Hmhmhm.  Perhaps I should summon my own follower..."
>She snaps a finger, and a rugged man appears next to her in a flash of emerald light.  He immediately embraces her, kisses her cheek, and lounges in his seat, watching the movie with interest.
>Suddenly, someone kicks open the theatre door.
>In steps a massive, muscular jackal woman in a black suit and tie.  She gently carries an unconscious man you recognize as the guy getting arrested earlier.
>Volta waves.
>"Kheh, hey Anubis!  Whatcha got there?"
>"Hm?  Oh, just a client... what are we watching?"
>Her eyes narrow at the sight of the movie's gaunt, male Anubis.
>"Hmph.  Seems they got two things wrong there."
>Anubis sets the man down gently, then, almost subconsciously, she stretches, her shirt riding up a bit to reveal chiseled abs.
>She sighs and flops into the seat next to the fainted man.
>"Might as well get comfortable, I suppose..."
>Coyote grins as she looks around at all her friends.  She turns to you, and you smile back, throwing an arm around her.

>As you cuddle Coyote close, you chat up the other supernatural ladies.
>"So, Volta, Death: you have any followers you want to bring?"
>"Kheh!  I'm not that high ranking, silly!"
>"Anon, who would follow Death...?"
>"Okay then, fair enough... Say, Anubis, what's the story with your companion?"
>She looks over at him with a sigh.
>"He called for help, I responded, and he fainted when he realized who I am.  So... I'm making sure he's okay before I send him home."
>"That's nice of you."
>Coyote leans on you, resting her head on your shoulder lovingly.
>Suddenly, the fainted man wakes up with a start.
>He looks around in a panic, then his eyes fall on his bulky companion.  He blinks a fee times.
>"A-Anubis...?"
>She nods curtly...
>And he promptly falls onto her, embracing the hearty goddess.
>"Thankyouthankyouthankyou sooo much.  I love you."
>Anubis stammers, obviously flustered.
>"W-well, ah, y-you're welcome, mortal... t-think nothing of it."
>He continues to hug her tightly, babbling rapid thank yous and declarations of love, causing her to become more and more flustered, sweating and stammering worse.
>"S-so... strong, yet so caring... thank you."
>"...y-you're very kind..."
>The goddess practically faints herself when the man plants a kiss on her cheek, practically having to leap from his chair to do so.
>Coyote laughs hysterically, making Anubis even more worked up.
>Volta winks at you before gently toucing Anubis on the shoulder...
>Causing a bolt of lightning to disintegrate the sleeves of her suit, revealing rather muscular arms, much to her embarassment and her companion's apparent delight.
>Anubis buries her face in her hands, looking very much as though she's blushing under that black fur.
>"...Volta... please control yourself."
>"But... fine, geez.  Spoilsport."
>The Raiju pouts comically, then collapses back into her seat with a huff.

>While watching Anubis scold Volta, you chat up the unenthused Death.
>"So... you going to see Infinty War?"
>"...NO.  I've always preferred the X-Men films anyway."
>She huffs and shakes her head.
>You glance back over at Anubis.  Her makeshift follower leans against her, an arm wrapped around her middle.  He looks up at her with an adoring smile and thanks her rapidly.  She grins sheepishly...
>Then quickly smooches him on the cheek.  He nearly faints again, much to her amusement.
>Volta watches with relative disinterest, munching clearly burnt popcorn.
>Coyote yawns and leans more of her weight on you; you hug her as close as you can.  Her soft, warm fur is as remarkably cozy as always...
>You kiss her on the cheek once more.  Your smooch is met with Capra's follower giving you a thumbs up and an approving nod.  He then plants a kiss on his own goddess, who blushes green.

>Coyote sighs happily.  Convinced she's comfortable and content, you sit back and enjoy the film.
>Anubis grows slowly more open to her admirer's affections, letting a tiny, shy smile cross her face as he hugs her tightly.
>She wraps a strong arm around him, pulling him into a tighter embrace than he can manage himself.
>Capra and her follower lean on one another like two old trees, simply enjoying each other's company and love.
>Volta continues to munch her popcorn, toasting each individual kernel with tiny bolts of lighting fired from her fingertips.
>Death remains silent in her seat, apathetically watching the movie onscreen rather than acknowledging the sappy romances surrounding her.
>She meets your gaze and shrugs before tossing a handful of candy into her sabertoothed maw.

>You feel a pang of sympathy for the bored Death, and so decide to strike up a conversation.
>"So, what kinda movies do you like?"
>"Mm?  Ah, mainly anything with a decent bodycount, ha... though I'm admittedly fond of these superhero films you mortals have been putting out."
>"Oh, have you seen Logan?"
>"I have.  I wasn't particularly fond of it, personally."
>"Yeah, me neither.  ...so, what's your story?"
>She raises an eyebrow.
>"Story?  Mortal, I know good and well you're aware of the concept of death."
>"I am, but I don't know Death the woman."
>"...hmph.  Well, my story isn't a particularly interesting one.  I thrive on my widespread belief... every mortal knows of and fears death.  Some... welcome my approach, but most revile me."
>"...and so you don't have any loving followers like the others?"
>She sighs and rubs her bony temples.
>"...I have a few... gentleman callers, shall we say.  Mortals who relentlessly flirt with their own demise.  A few who have grown so despair-filled that they crave my touch over life.  But, I have no true followers, no.  As expected, given my station."
>A small frown crosses her face for a moment.
>"I'm sorry, Death."
>"...thank you, Anonymous.  That's very kind."
>"How did you-"
>"Please.  I know the names of every mortal there is... as well as their ancestors."
>She puts on a smile.  ...a rather unnerving one.
>"I also have a fair bit of insight into each and every one's eventual demise..."
>You blink, and suddenly the spectre's face fills your entire vision.
>"...WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW HOW YOU WILL PERISH?"
>You stammer out a non-answer... and Death backs away, laughing hoarsely.
>"Ah, I merely jest.  I wouldn't burden you with such knowledge."

>Death continues laughing as you think on her words.
>...you're mortal, and Coyote isn't.  One day... you won't be there for her anymore.
>...
>You draw yourself up to your full height and confront the chortling force of nature.
>"Tell me.  I'm not afraid to find out."
>She abruptly stops laughing, then stands, towering over you and indeed everyone in the room.  Her body seems to shift on a skeletal level, her sabertooth tiger head becoming more akin to some sort of canine.
>She stares down at you, scarlet eyes glinting maliciously.
>"Very well, mortal.  Listen closely, for I shan't repeat myself."
>You find yourself in a pitch black void, alone with Death.  Her white suit stands out audaciously against the darkness.  The noose dangling from her neck sways in an ominous wind.
>"Anonymous.  When I look upon your life essence, I see a man of little joy.  From the departure of your Grandmother to only a few days hence, you've been a rather miserable sort.  However... I see... a very blue influence in your life that seems to be helping your bitterness."
>You stare up at the monologuing Death.
>"And...?"
>She snarls loudly.
>"Do. Not. Interrupt. Me."
>There's a momentary flash of black light, and she suddenly has a massive scythe by her side.
>"I have few qualms with taking you early. I am alotted some leeway with this sort of thing."
>You maintain your resolve.
>"I'm not afraid of you.  I would do anything to live, for Coyote.  I want to know my fate so that I can change it for the better."
>The reaper scoffs.
>"CHANGE FATE?  Insolence.  You think you can challenge destiny?"
>"I would challenge anyone for her happiness."
>Death regards you with an intense glare...
>Then a smile spreads across her face.
>"I like you.  You have immense courage, to speak to Death itself in such a manner.  Anonymous... you need not worry about changing your fate.  I think you'll find it rather favorable."
>"Meaning?"
>She chuckles again.
>"To put it simply, I see plenty of blue in your future."
>You nod, smiling as you are returned to the theatre.  Death nods respectfully, then takes her seat once more.

>You cast a glance around the room.
>Anubis's companion has somehow managed to fall asleep, leaning against her and snoring.  She gently cuddles him close, a genuine smile on her face.
>Capra and her follower have also dozed off, sleeping in each other's arms as green hearts lazily float overhead.
>Volta amuses herself by throwing bits of charred popcorn at the sleeping couple. Staticky cackles escape her every time she hits them.
>Coyote suddenly throws her arms around you with a wild grin.
>Death still looks unamused, simply popping the remainder of her candy into her fanged jaws with a frown.  Meeting your gaze, Death pointedly grabs her noose and tightens it.
>Volta lets off another staticky cackle as she successfully lands a kernel in Capra's open mouth.

>Eventually, Coyote begins to doze off, yawning cutely.  She cuddles up against you.
>"Mmm... love you, Nonny..."
>Unfortunately, the movie suddenly ends just as she says this.  Volta cackles loudly.
>"NONNY?  Kheh heh, what a name!"
>Coyote drowsily smiles at her friend as you blush madly.
>"Well, uh... that was fun, everyone.  We should get together again sometime."
>Volta nods eagerly.  Capra and her follower remain asleep, snoring in harmony.
>Anubis gently squeezes her snoozing companion with a sheepish smile.
>"...perhaps we should."
>And Death, well...
>"Mmm.  If I come to another of these meetings, I'm bringing the film."
>Everyone murmurs in agreement as you and Coyote exit the theatre.  She waves farewell to the roomful of goddesses, grinning ear to ear.
>Once outside, you start trying to remember what you were planning.
>"Hey, Coyote.  What were we going to do next?"
>"Huh?  Uh... the library, right?"
>"Oh yeah; thanks."
>With that, the two of you stroll off towards the library.

>Sometimes it's amazing how people seem so willing to overlook Coyote.
>The library is no exception.
>Not a soul acknowledges her presence, even when she tries pulling little tricks on them.
>After tripping a fellow with her tail, to no reaction beyond a sigh, she walks over to you with a pout.
>"Hmmph.  None of these people are fun.  Can we just grab some books and get out of here, Nonny?"
>"Yeah, one sec."
>You quickly round up some books on the various pantheons of the world, as well as some collections of Native American folklore, making sure they mention Coyote.
>When you check out, the librarian, an ancient-looking woman, squints at the goddess.
>"...young lady, you seem familiar somehow."
>Without hesitation, the trickster bows, blue confetti bursting behind her.
>"I am the Great Coyote, if that rings a bell!"
>"..."
>A look of awe slowly spreads across the woman's face.
>"...from the old stories?  It... it can't really be you, can it?"
>"It's me, the real deal.  I could... prove it, if you'd like?"
>The librarian nods eagerly, and Coyote gets a broad grin.
>She snaps, and the library grows dark.  On one wall, an animated adaptation of Coyote's buffalo story plays out, with her narrating live as she so loves to do.
>The patrons watch and listen, impressed, and applaud when it's all over.  The librarian seems absolutely awestruck.
>"I... I believe you.  My mother loved to tell your stories, Great Coyote.  To actually meet you... it's an honor!"
>The tiny lady walks around her counter and embraces Coyote tightly, the goddess stooping down to meet her.
>When the two break apart, the librarian waves farewell, as do the patrons.
>Coyote's smile practically glimmers as she exits the library with you, looking even more colorful than ever before.

>As you look at Coyote, she seems more solid and tangible as well as more vivid.
>It warms your heart to see her looking more healthy and happy.
>...but you can't help but tease her.
>"Y'know something?  I bet you'll get fat from all this new belief you're getting!"
>She stops walking for a moment and looks at you, mouth agape...
>Then snorts loudly before breaking into her usual guffaw.
>"Gah-hah-hah-hah!  You may be right; I certainly feel more... full than I have in a while.  Thanks for all your help, Nonny."
>She hugs you close and kisses your cheek lovingly.
>She suddenly has a thought.
>"Wait, why are we WALKING home?"
>You suddenly fall into a hole in the ground, landing roughly on your bed, back in your apartment.
>"There we go, gah-hah!  Let's see those books, eh?"
>You crack one open to a random page...
>And your heart skips a beat. 
>It's... it's one of Grandma's Coyote stories.
>...wait a minute.
>"Hey, Coyote... do you suppose Death would let me visit Grandma?"
>For once, the blue goddess frowns, whimpering a bit.
>"...I'm sorry, Nonny.  It's not possible.  Death might be willing to allow it, but the fact of the matter is that mortals meeting the dead is undoable.  I... I'm sorry."
>She hangs her head sadly.
>"...the one thing you probably want most... and I can't do it for you.  I'm so sorry."
>Coyote embraces you again, squeezing you tightly, and begins to sing another of her wordless tunes again, soothing you.
>You run your fingers through her heavenly fur, smiling in spite of your pangs of sadness.

>"Coyote... it's okay."
>She continues to sing, her voice wavering a bit as tears drip onto your shoulders.  Her embrace tightens again.
>Eventually, she sighs and stops her song, releasing you with a wistful smile.
>"I know.  You are strong.  I just... wish I could help you.  All I can offer is my love."
>"And that's enough for me, Coyote."
>You kiss her on the cheek, and she smiles earnestly.
>She looks thoughtful for a moment, then nods.
>"Nonny, I'm going to do something for you.  Something I don't do lightly."
>Before you can ask what it is, she opens her mouth wide...
>Then yanks out one of her long, sharp teeth bloodlessly, wincing.
>She carefully deposits the tooth in your hand with a smile.
>"I hope you like this gift..."
>It feels like... this tooth contains some intense energy.  You nod and close your fist around it.
>"Thank you, Coyote.  I love it."
>She smiles again, showing a comical gap in her grin.
>You can't help but chuckle, and she returns the favor as the fang regrows before your eyes.
>You glance down at the fang, a thought coming to mind.
>"How about... I tell YOU a story for once?"
>She gasps.
>"Nonny, I'd love that!"
>You crack open the book again and flip to one of Grandma's favorites.
>As Coyote listens, enraptured, you narrate a tale of the trickster, emulating Grandma's style as best you can.
>You even minic her Coyote voice, cracking the goddess up constantly.  She also laughs at the shadow puppets you make for some parts.
>Once the tale ends, she applauds, smiling brilliantly.
>"Great job, Nonny; you have a knack for storytelling... it's almost as if I lived that very story, gah-hah!"
>She nudges you with her elbow, chuckling, and you laugh along.

>At Coyote's urging, you read another of Grandma's old favorites, throwing an arm around her and embracing her warmly.
>You still gesture and perform shadow puppets...
>It's just that you don't realize one arm is still around the goddess until the story ends. As you watch, your new, blue third arm vanishes as Coyote snickers.
>"Thought you may need a hand, gah-hah!"
>You hug her tightly, laughing along.
>"I love the way you tell my stories, Nonny; do another, do another!"
>Smiling, you thumb through the book until you find another of Grandma's stories.  You begin narrating...
>But...
>Thinking about her smile... her exuberance for these stories... her... in general...
>...
>You trail off, drowning in memories of Grandma.
>...
>...
>Your worthless dad couldn't be bothered to even show up to his own mother's funeral.  That atomized what little respect you had for the man, and cemented your decision to get as far from your parents as possible.
>You can only imagine how heartbroken she would be, knowing her own child didn't care...
>Against your will, you feel tears coming on.
>You think of yourself as a strong person, but dammit, your Grandma gave you everything she had.  She was truly the strongest woman you've ever known.
>And now she's gone.  Not even a goddess can bring her back.
>...
>Silently, tears flooding down her own face, Coyote hugs you close.  You bury your face in the soft fur of her shoulder and let it all out.
>All your grief.  Your sadness.  Your burning hatred of your parents.
>The goddess takes a deep, shuddering breath and attempts to sing one of her songs...
>...but ultimately stops, merely hugging you and letting herself cry as well.
>"...I'm sorry, Anon.  So very sorry."

>You hug her closer, trying to calm down.
>"She... she's why I'm the man I am now.  She's why I fell for you, Coyote.  She helped me move past my family and be happy... and she's gone."
>...
>Coyote sniffles, wrapping her immeasurably soft tail around you lovingly.
>"She was such a wonderful woman.  So very strong... so caring... one of my all-time favorite followers.  I loved her too, Nonny, and I want you to know something... though she got sick, I made sure she never suffered a day in her life.  I called in favor after favor with my friends, doing everything I could to brighten her life.  In the end, and you know this yourself, she passed with a smile on her face, with her most beloved family member there: you."
>She sobs openly now, hugging you impossibly close.  You are entirely enveloped in soft, warm fur.
>"I say this because I want you to know: it's okay.  It's all okay.  I'm here for you."
>You attempt to choke out a thanks, but nothing comes out.
>The wind blowing past your ears tells you that you are once again in Coyote's Domain.
>The warmth and softness seem to intensify as Coyote finally manages to begin singing once more.
>...it's okay.  Everything...
>Everything is okay.

>You slowly pull your face from her fur.
>It's raining in the desert again.  This time, though, the goddess's tears aren't joyful.
>Despite her sadness, she smiles at you lovingly, arms and tail wrapped around you as she lies in the sand.
>Seems that at some point she simply laid down, with you ending up atop her.
>Coyote says nothing, merely smiling and singing shakily, tears flowing down her snout.
>You bury your face again, hugging her close and cuddling her.
>Everything... feels okay.
>For the first time since her death, you finally feel like your life is gonna be alright.
>You have someone with you now.
>Someone to love and be loved by.  Someone who knew and loved her as much as you did.  Someone who went to great lengths to make sure she never spent a minute of her illness feeling sad or despaired.
>You have the Great Coyote, and you finally know what makes her great...
>It's her heart.
>Despite her mischievous streak, Coyote really does love and care for her followers...
>...you've never been more determined to serve her.  In Grandma's memory, you WILL do everything in your power for the blue-furred goddess.
>The two of you share misty-eyed smiles and hug one another close, feeling the rain tap against your back.

>After silently smiling at one another for what feels like forever, you lean in and kiss her.
>The two of you hold your kiss for as long as you can, feeling your tears slowly dry up. The rain slows to a halt, the blue sun cheerfully peeking through.
>A rainbow appears, bearing both the familiar Coyote blue...
>And some other colors you recognize.
>Volta's shocking yellow.  Capra's inviting emerald green.  Anubis's professional looking black.  Death's pale, eerie blond.
>...then there are a few you don't recognize.
>There's a very soft, pleasant mint green.  A loud, almost... triumphant pink.  And...
>...a color that seems to defy your attempt to describe it.
>Coyote smiles as she breaks off her kiss.
>"I love you, Nonny."
>"I love you too."
>You remain lying atop her, comfortable.
>"...so.  How about we get to work on that book?  Get your word out there quicker and all?"
>"Sure, gah-hah!  I've actually been letting the old autobook run for a while.  It caught your stories!"
>She opens up her book, showing a perfect transcript of your earlier narrations.
>There's a footnote in blue ink...
>"As narrated by the Great Coyote's favorite follower."

>...after what feels like days, if not weeks of narration, you have exhausted all your Coyote stories.
>The autobook transcribes them all, editing as needed, and puts little footnotes from Coyote in several places.
>Suddenly, she grabs the pen and turns to the front of the book.  On the very first page, she manually writes:
>"In loving memory of Anna Marie Mous."
>Satisfied, Coyote nods and hugs you tightly.
>"Still has room for more... I'll have to keep thinking, gah-hah!"
>"We should start thinking about art too.  Can you draw?"
>She frowns thoughtfully.
>"Uh... I CAN, but it's not the best."
>She quickly opens the book to a blank page, then scribbles up you and her hugging.
>...it's not the best art, but it is cute.
>She smiles earnestly when you look at it.
>"Looks good to me, Coyote."
>"Great!  ...but we'll get a professional to do this.  Got any ideas?"
>You blush a little.
>"...maybe we could put a listing on, uh..."
>You cough and mutter the name of a furry site you frequent.
>"Ohhh, they specialize in MY type, huh?  Gah-hah-hah!  Sounds good to me."
>Still embarassed, you put up the listing...
>...thanks to the bizarre time situation, the post attracts no attention despite you waiting for a good while.
>Oh well.

>...wait.  You could just leave Coyote's Domain.
>"Okay... I think once we get the art, we should be ready to start looking for a publisher."
>Coyote grins and hugs you tightly.
>"Thank you, Nonny; thank you so much!  This will definitely help."
>Her smile gets a little more wry.
>"...speaking of art... I guess I should've known you had, ah, DIFFERENT tastes in women, gah-hah!  At least it looks like you've got pretty alright taste in art..."
>She squints at your still-open profile page, and you sweat bullets.
>"...gah-hah!  Wait'll the others hear that you prefer our type...!"
>...if she's gonna tease, so are you.
>"Y'know, I could get something SPECIAL made of you while we're at this.  Have a version for the book and one for... private use?"
>She starts to blush again, blue face turning bright red.
>"Of course, we'd need to send off some reference photos..."
>She averts her eyes from you, face practically glowing red.
>"...gah-hah..."
>She smiles bashfully, then suddenly lays on her side, posing seductively.
>She snickers a bit, face slowly becoming her usual hue.
>"...well?  Aren't you gonna take a picture?  Tell whoever picks us up to draw me like one of those French girls, gah-hah-hah!"
>You quickly snap a picture of her, saving it for... posterity, yeah.
>Coyote stands and stretches before hugging you again.
>"Let's go back to your place, huh?  See if we get any takers."
>As before, a blue trapdoor drops you and the goddess onto your bed.
>Once there, she promptly lays on her stomach, watching your laptop intently.
>...a few minutes pass, and she groans in boredom.
>"Bah, this is taking too long."
>"Well, what if we played a video game to kill time?"
>"Ooh, sounds fun!  Whatcha got?"
>"Well, I have Okami... stars Amaterasu?"
>She frowns.
>"...Sundog?"
>"Uhh... yes?"
>"Hmph.  I don't like Ammy that much, personally... she's nice enough, just... I dunno."
>"That's alright; I've had the same feelings about people I know.  What would you prefer?"
>"Uhhh... something fun, gah-hah!"

>"Uhhh.... how about... Marvel vs Capcom 3?"
>"Sounds good to me; let's roll!"
>You quickly load the game up... then remember:
>Amaterasu is in this too.
>"...hey, uh... what's the deal between you and Amaterasu again?"
>"I just... don't like her much.  Why do you-"
>She catches you totally off guard when she snarls at the appearance of the sun goddess onscreen.
>You quickly skip ahead to the character select screen...
>...and pick Ammy just to tease Coyote.
>She elbows you, grinning, and selects her team.
>...as soon as the match starts, she goes absolutely berserk on Amaterasu.
>You don't land so much as an attack before Coyote annihilates the white wolf, cackling in a much more sinister way than her usual, exuberant "gah-hah" laugh.
>Coyote wears a frankly concerning grin that only fades when the sun goddess is offscreen.
>Panting, Coyote sighs happily and turns to you mid-match.
>"THAT felt good, gah-hah!"
>Note to self: don't piss Coyote off.
>The rest of the match is considerably less offputting.  You manage to squeak out a win despite being down a character.
>Coyote beams and hugs you even despite her loss.
>"That was really fun, Nonny!  Thanks for playing."
>"N-no problem."
>"...sorry I got a bit intense, gah-hah."
>"It's fine, really."
>"I just... I do NOT like that woman."
>"I understand."

>"Are there... any other rivals I should know about?"
>"Huh?  No, none I can think of..."
>You smile, narrowing your eyes.
>"So, after all my help and love, you're still gonna keep secrets from me?  How naughty~"
>Coyote laughs, face going a bit red again at the tone of your voice.
>"No, no... it's just that I can't think of any more."
>"Suuurre~"
>Coyote giggles again as someone suddenly knocks on your door.  You cautiously answer it...
>And are stunned to be face-to-face with someone who can only be...
>Amaterasu, clad in a gold-colored kimono.
>The sun goddess smiles literally warmly as she bows.
>"May I come in?"
>"S-sure..."
>She thanks you politely as she enters the room.
>Upon seeing Coyote, Amaterasu stops dead in her tracks.  A warm smile again crosses her serene face.
>"Ah, Coyote!  I hadn't expected to see you here.  You're looking well!"
>The trickster puts on an unconvincing smile.
>"Hello, Ammy. Doing well?"
>"I am, thank you.  Seems you've found a follower, eh?  Wonderful.  I wish the two of you great prosperity and luck."
>She bows again, then turns to you. 
>"So: you are... Anonymous, yes?  Wonderful to meet you. I have heard much!"
>She glances at your laptop, gasping when she sees her likeness onscreen.
>"Ohhh!  That's what I felt, then.  I've never been happier to see mortals using my name.  These... Okami games have done wonders for me.  I'm positively radiant."
>...she is.  Ammy casts a brilliant glow from her person constantly.
>"But, I suppose I shouldn't linger long.  As unorthodox as it is, this IS your shrine, Coyote."
>The blue goddess swallows her anger as her grin becomes more strained.
>"Please, feel free to stay a while."
>As if waiting for that, Amaterasu gently takes a seat on the floor.
>"Thank you, Coyote.  I appreciate you welcoming me into your shrine."
>"N-no problem."
>...this is shaping up to be a bad situation.

>Okay, okay.  Don't panic.  Take this easy, and hopefully you can defuse this before you end up in the middle of a catfight of deific proportions.
>"Would you excuse us for a moment, Amaterasu?"
>"Of course, Anonymous; you are my hosts, after all."
>She smiles and bows her head as you lead Coyote to another room.
>"Okay, can you please tell me what the big deal is between you two?  And be specific, please."
>Coyote huffs, staring daggers in the direction of the living room.
>"...she got so much belief from those games, and she didn't even have to work for it.  I worked myself to the bone for centuries, and I... I nearly died from being forgotten.  It's not fair, Nonny; not fair at all."
>"...you're jealous of Amaterasu?"
>Your goddess narrows her eyes.
>"NO.  There's a difference in being jealous and begrudging someone for unearned success.  I'm happy she found a source of belief in this day and age; I hate seeing my friends... vanish.  All I'm saying is that she didn't WORK for her newfound popularity.  The Okami games were made without her intervention.  Meanwhile, do you know how many of my stories were written under my intervention?  Every single one."
>She sighs.
>"...so that's why I'm not fond of Ammy.  Sorry.  I'll try to be civil."
>You nod and hug her, then the two of you return to your guest.
>Amaterasu simply sits serenely, looking around the room with a sunny smile.  When her eyes fall upon you, her smile widens.
>"Ah, there you are.  Coyote, you have a wonderful shrine here, I see.  Anonymous?  Seems you've done a fine job of supporting her."
>"Thank you, I try my best."
>Coyote nods and pulls you close.
>"Yeah, my Nonny is a great follower.  I'm lucky to have him."
>The white wolf claps her hands together with an airy chuckle.
>"I'm very happy for you.  I know you work very hard."
>You smile, feeling Coyote's grip tighten.
>"Why don't I get us some drinks?  Would you like something, Amaterasu?"
>"Perhaps I'll have a drink, if you don't mind."
>You nod and head off to the kitchen, quickly pouring three drinks and rushing back to the goddesses.
>The sun goddess bows her head and smiles appreciatively, and Coyote flashes you a toothy grin.

>When you poured the drinks, you had conflicting ideas.
>Do you go with the weakest stuff you have, in case Coyote's up to something?
>Or do you go straight for the hard stuff?
>...you ended up going for the strongest drinks you have.
>If Coyote can't stay civil... you'll probably need it.
>Amaterasu takes a sip, and her eyes go wide.
>"My, my!  You've certainly spared no expense for your guests, Anonymous.  I appreciate that."
>With a vague glint of mischief in her eye, the sun goddess downs her whole drink in seconds.
>Coyote grumbles a little and quickly gulps down her glass as well.
>Her pupils narrow as she gives you an appreciative grin.
>You rush off to refill their drinks.
>When you return, both goddesses thank you, then quickly make short work of their beverages.
>...you're gonna need more booze.

>...after an hour or so, you've gone through your whole bottle.
>Coyote and Amaterasu are sitting on the floor together, giggling at nothing in particular.
>"I must say... sometimes it's nice to unwind; to be a little more... spontaneous."
>"I'll drink to that, gah-hah!"
>Coyote downs the last few drops of her drink, then shakes her head as a blue lightbulb suddenly appears over it.
>"Hang on, what're you doin' here, anyway, Ammy?"
>"Hmm?  I sensed a deity's presence here, as well as some belief in me, and so decided to investigate."
>"Belief in you?  That game...?"
>The white wolf nods, giggling, then leans her weight on Coyote with a happy sigh.
>"...this is fun.  Thank you for inviting me in."
>Coyote frowns at Amaterasu, whose eyes are closed.  She doesn't see the trickster's slowly mounting anger...
>"...did you come here thinking you could score a follower?"
>"Mm?   No, no... I have many of those anyway..."
>Coyote snarls and bares her teeth, glaring at the blissfully unaware sun goddess.

>This is not good.
>You meet Coyote's gaze and shake your head desperately.
>Her voice echoes in your head.
>"DID YOU HEAR HER RUBBING IT IN MY FACE?  CONCEITED BITCH!"
>...you try to mouth a response to her.
>"I don't think she meant it that way; please don't fight with her."
>Coyote continues to glare, then deflates with a sigh.
>Amaterasu perks up an ear and opens her eyes.
>"Mm?  Is something wrong?  You feel... tense."
>"No, no; nothing's wrong, Ammy."
>The sun goddess frowns.
>"Coyote.  You can tell me if something's the matter."
>"...it... it's you, Ammy."
>The white wolf's jaw drops as she stares at Coyote, horrified.
>"W... what?  Have I done something to offend?"
>"I... it's your followers.  Ammy, I work hard for my few followers.  Nonny here is pretty much my lifeline at this point."
>"I know... you work very hard."
>"And... you got such a huge boost from those games... and you didn't have to lift a finger for them to get made.  Ammy, it's just... it's not fair."
>To your shock, the sun goddess sheds a few tears, looking very remorseful.
>"Coyote... is that how you've felt since those were made?"
>The blue goddess nods, hanging her head.
>She gasps when Amaterasu pulls herself into a hug.
>"...I'm so sorry.  I had no idea... and here I am, reminding you of an injustice.  How tactless of me to sit in your shrine, talking about my own belief, when you've worked so very hard just to cling to life.  I truly apologize.  I only hope you can forgive me."
>Coyote smiles, a tear dripping from her own eye.
>"...I can.  That means a lot to me, Ammy; it really does."
>"So, we're alright?"
>"Yeah, we're alright.  Sorry for getting snippy."
>"No, no; I'm sorry for bragging."
>The two goddesses reconcile with a hug, smiling.

>Phew.
>Crisis successfully averted.
>To celebrate the goddesses making up, you propose a toast, to which they happily raise their empty glasses.
>Coyote laughs.
>"H-hey... what if we did a drinking game?  Could be fun!"
>"...sorry, I'm out of the good stuff."
>"WHAAAT?  Hmph."
>Coyote puts on a pout, driving Amaterasu into a fit of laughter.
>"Oh, Coyote!  You never cease to amuse.  I should visit this area more often... who else is around?"
>"Mm, Anubis... Death... Volta..."
>"I see... perhaps I should visit them as well."
>Coyote gasps and clings on to the white wolf.
>"Don't go yet!  We're having so much fun!"
>"I'm not leaving yet, don't fret.  ...provided your follower doesn't mind me staying a while?"

>"I don't mind... but I would like to hear some tips on boosting belief while you're here.  Got any advice, Amaterasu?"
>"Ah, I do.  Place your hands upon the lives of all those who follow you.  Give them your blessings, in a manner that they will know it's you.  Be helpful, be kind, and above all else just be THERE for them."
>"That's it?"
>"That's it.  Simple as that."
>"...hey, Ammy?  Thanks."
>Coyote hugs her friend tightly, the two smiling warmly.

>To celebrate the goddesses making up (and to kill time), you suggest a game of cards.
>It goes pretty well, for the most part, but...
>You're pretty sure Coyote is cheating.  A lot.
>For one, you don't remember this deck having a blue ace.  Especially not one with a suit resembling a familiar grinning face.
>For her part, Amaterasu at least plays fair.  You also refrain from playing dirty.
>After all... both these ladies ARE deities, and could probably smite you if they wanted.
>As you play, you make small talk.
>"So, uh... Coyote and I are getting a book published."
>"Is that so?  A collection of her famous stories, no doubt."
>"That's right, gah-hah!  My Nonny helped me compile some of the best."
>"I wish you good fortune in this endeavor, Coyote."
>The sun goddess smiles warmly while your phone chirps loudly.
>You check your email...
>Some artist has gotten back to you on the book.
>"Incogneato" apparently.  A cursory glance of his gallery shows that he's pretty competent and prolific.
>He'll do nicely.
>Coyote laughs triumphantly.
>"Great!  If he agrees to help, I may have to do him a favor some day... give him something he really, really wants."
>She puts a hand to her chin, apparently thinking about a good repayment.

>Coyote grins and nods as a lightbulb flashes over her head.
>"Got it, gah-hah!  He'll get his dues when the time is right."
>She refuses to elaborate further, so you shrug and message the artist.
>"Hello, my name is Anonymous.  This is gonna sound insane, but I'm publishing a book of old Coyote folklore and I was hoping you could illustrate her in various scenes?"
>You send it off, and soon receive a reply.
>"Oh, my granddad told those stories when I was a kid.  Sure, I can probably do that.  Thought Coyote wa a dude though?"
>"No, she's a woman, I assure you.  I have some reference pics if you want me to send em your way."
>"Ref pics?"
>You send off the photo of Coyote, and immediately get a response.
>"Oh wow.  Nice Photoshop skills."
>You hesitate to respond.
>"Thanks, but I think art would look better in the book, y'know?"
>"I getcha.  Gimme some scene descriptions and I'll do what I can, man."
>"Great, thanks so much.  You don't know how important this is to me."
>"Hey man, I get it; passion projects like this are great fun.  Glad to help."
>Seems like a decent enough guy.

>After a while of exchanging messages, you end your conversation with Incogneato.
>Coyote laughs and hugs you and Amaterasu.
>"We're so close to getting this out, Nonny!  I can't wait!"
>"Congratulations, you two.  Best of luck.
>"Thanks, Ammy; glad we made up."
>"As am I."
>The group hug continues for a while, then ends as Amaterasu yawns.
>"Well, I suppose I should be on my way.  Thank you for yout hospitality, both of you."
>"Thanks for coming, Amaterasu.  You're welcome back anytime."
>"Yeah, feel free to swing by sometime!  We'll catch a movie with Death's movie club."
>The sun goddess smiles and nods, then bows one last time before leaving your apartment.
>Once she's gone, it occurs to you just how LATE it is.
>You and Coyote get ready for bed quickly, then promptly collapse onto your mattress.
>She smiles drowsily and kisses you.
>"G'night, Nonny... love you.  Thanks for everything."
>"Love you too."
>Pulling her close, you cuddle Coyote's amazingly warm, soft fur.  With a sigh of happiness, you close your eyes and slip away into a restful sleep, ready for whatever tomorrow may bring.

>Barely conscious, you bury your face in the fluff of Coyote's neck.
>You gently rub her back, mumbling as you drift off.
>"I'm gonna be here even if this book doesn't work..."
>With that, you completely fall asleep.
>You dream of Coyote.
>Of handing her a ring with a dazzling sapphire inset.
>Of her walking down the aisle in a blue dress, her godly friends all dressed up and watching.
>Of her smiling through tears of joy as she says "I do."
>You dream... of true love.
>In your dream, you carry your new wife over the threshold of a blue door, entering her Domain as the godesses cheer and clap.  You chuckle as Anubis grabs Volta bodily, keeping her away from the door.
>The muscular jackal also has to fend off Capra, much to her chagrin.
>Eventually, you manage to get the door shut and locked...
>Then you lovingly consumate your wedding right there in the sand and sun.  Time jumps forward...
>The last thing you see before waking up is Coyote smiling bashfully and gesturing at her stomach with a blush...
>...you awaken feeling very rested.  Your face is still buried in fluff, and Coyote is still asleep.

>Well... you're not gonna wake her, right?
>No, no; you simply cuddle up closer, enjoying her company.  You glance up at her face, seeing her grin as she sleeps...

< Coyote >

>As she slept, the trickster walked the dreamscape.
>She never dreamed, herself; it was more fun to explore the dreams of others.
>Especially those she loved, like her Nonny.
>Tonight, she found herself in a rather heartfelt dream...
>He was dreaming of marrying her.  Of...
>Starting a family.
>She couldn't help but smile at his thoughtful proposal, even the blue ring he chose.  She laughed at his choice of guests, especially his thought of that old softie Anubis ever physically barring someone from a room.
>A blush came to her phantasmagoric cheeks when the dream dipped into the more intimate side of marriage...
>And faded in favor of a heartfelt smile when the final stinger came.  
>Only her Nonny would dream of having little demigods with her.
>...what... what would her children even LOOK like?
>The thought struck her as oddly funny.  Coyote laughed, doubling over in mirth.

< Anon >

>You continue to snuggle the goddess, smiling when she chuckles in her sleep.
>You're in no rush to get up.  You love her, and you love this situation.

>Well, five more minutes won't hurt anyone.  You're off today, anyway.
>Being careful not to wake her, you reach over and grab your phone.  Seems that your artist is still asleep, as the last message he sent was a good while ago. 
>Oh well. It'll get done eventually. 
>You set the phone back down, then cuddle up to Coyote again.  She smiles in her sleep again, subconsciously hugging you.

< Coyote >

>With her Nonny's dream over, Coyote found herself bored.
>She was still physically tired, so she couldn't wake up just yet... 
>Hmph.  She snorted indignantly while thinking of a good dream to visit...
>...bingo.  The artist was asleep right then.
>Effortlessly, the trickster strode across the dreamscape until she reached Incogneato's unconscious mind.
>She dipped into his dream, providing him with some divine inspiration.  She hoped it would help him in his work...
>After all, she was very grateful for his willingness to help out.
>Satisfied with her input, Coyote left Incog's dream, giggling at the various lewd bits haunting his mind.

< Anon >

>You start to dose off again just as the goddess awakens.
>She yawns and stretches, then grins at you. 
>"Gooood morning, Nonny!  Pleasant dreams, gah-hah?"
>You nod, and she hugs you close.
>"...I'm touched that you think of me that way.  Marriage and... starting a family and all."
>Coyote kisses you lovingly, smile becoming a bit more sheepish.
>"...l-love you."
>"Love you too, Coyote."
>She savors your words with a happy sigh.

>You and Coyote share adoring smiles for a good while, simply enjoying each other's company.
>Eventually, you pull her into a proper kiss, showing her how much you love her.
>Her tail wraps around you tightly as she kisses you; she grasps around until she manages to take your hand into hers, interlocking her fingers with yours.
>When the kiss ends, she smiles warmly, pupils becoming heart-shaped.
>You continue to lie there, holding hands, for several minutes.  Eventually, your stomach growls.
>"What do you say we have some breakfast?"
>"Sounds good, Nonny!"
>You leap from the bed and surprise Coyote by sweeping her up into a bridal carry.  She giggles madly as you head to the kitchen, toting her lithe form through the apartment.
>Once at the kitchen, you gently set her in a chair, then get cooking.
>You're not the BEST cook, but you can at least make a decent meal.  You think.
>Actually, it seems that you're more capable than you thought; you manage to make two perfect plates of food, with not a single issue.
>You suspect Coyote had some input on this, but you didn't see any blue magic...
>Oh well.  Food's food.
>Coyote smiles and thanks you profusely when you serve up her food.

>Coyote starts to eat, but you stop her when you get an idea.  You lift the lean goddess again and set her atop your lap.
>Once she's there, you insist on feeding her.
>"You're not using your hands this morning!  Lemme handle this."
>She grins, but doesn't protest as you gently feed her her breakfast.  Once her plate is clean, you reach up and gently rub her head, scratching behind her ears as well.
>"So... anything in particular you wat to do today?"
>"Hmmmmm, nah, I can't think of anything!  Whatever you want is fine, Nonny."
>"How about we start with a nice walk?"
>"Sounds like a plan!"
>You quickly get ready, dodging blue pranks and gags as you do so.  Coyote looks a bit confused, then bonks herself on the head.
>"Duh.  I already pulled those on you once, of course you're not gonna fall for them twice, gah-hah!"
>You chuckle warmly and finish getting ready, then depart, hand in hand with Coyote.

>It's nice and sunny outside, if a little hot. 
>On a whim, you lead Coyote to your favorite local ice cream place.
>It's always nice on a day like today.
>A few people take note of the goddess, smiling and even waving in some cases.  She grins back, tail wagging happily.
>When you get to the counter, you order your favorite while Coyote browses the menu.
>"Uhhh... what do you like, Nonny?"
>"If I'm honest?  I like a lot of em."
>"Oh, alright.  Guess I'll pick one at random, then, gah-hah!"
>She suddenly has a blue dart in her hand.  Closing her eyes, she throws it at the menu board...
>It loops with a slide whistle sound, then sticks into a name.  Coyote opens her eyes with a grin.
>"Alright, dreamsicle it is, apparently!"
>The bemused worker, a young lady who's been working here for a few years, laughs as she scoops up the goddess's chosen treat.
>"You picked my favorite, miss..."
>The blue woman extends her hand.
>"Coyote."
>"Miss Coy- wait.  You mean... THAT Coyote?  I did a school report on your stories!  You're awesome, you know that?  Your ice cream's on the house, ma'am, and you too, Anon!"
>Wow.  You've been coming here for a while now, and they've never given you anything free.
>Coyote wags her tail happily as she gets a tad bit more colorful once again.
>"Thank you!  You're very sweet."
>"It's an honor to meet you, miss Coyote! I hope you come back again soon; my boss would LOVE to meet you!  She's big on folk tales and stuff."
>The goddess chats away with the young worker while you polish off your own ice cream silently.
>When they finally stop talking, Coyote takes a taste of her ice cream...
>And her eyes literally light up.
>"I... love it!"
>She wolfs it down in record time, a wide grin across her face.
>Once she's done, you bid the young woman farewell and lead the goddess out of the parlor.  You start off towards the lake, another of your favorite places in town...

>You sit down by the lake and sigh happily.
>It's always so peaceful here.  The wind is blowing, the birds are chirping, the sun is shining, Coyote is jogging through the shallow water in slow motion...
>Wait.
>WHAT?
>Sure enough, Coyote is slowly, ever so slowly, "running" through the shallow end of the lake, clad in a blue one-piece.
>Said one-piece is conspicuously unzipped just enough to put some cleavage on display.
>Everything around her seems to move in slowmo, even the water splashing around her feet.
>Her tail is especially eyecatching, flapping as she runs in a strangely mesmerizing way.
>Eventually, though, she brings her Baywatch parody to an end, returning to your side.  She shakes herself dry violently, causing her fur to poof out comically.
>She winks at you, tongue poking out.
>"I've always wanted to do that!"
>The two of you share a laugh, then simply sit and enjoy the placid scenery.  Coyote sighs in contentment as she laysbher head atop yours.
>"This is nice. "
>You murmur in agreement, wrapping an arm around the smiling goddess.
>"When we get done here, I'll take you to the museum; they're supposed to be doing an exhibit you may like."
>"Sounds fun, Nonny!  But... let's just stay like this a while, please."
>"Absolutely."
>She kisses you, then wraps her tail around you lovingly.

>You wouldn't dream of interrupting a moment like this.
>You hold her close, feeling the warmth of her amazingly soft fur.  She again rests her head on you, quietly humming a calm song.
>Coyote cuddles as close to you as possible, her song tickling your ears.  A soothing breeze blows across the lake, gently caressing you and your goddess.
>Her music quietly echoes across the small park surrounding the lake.  Birds tweet along to the melody.  The wind blows through the trees, whistling in harmony with her.
>...even now, it's awe inspiring when you think about Coyote being a goddess.
>Time seems to grind to a halt.
>Your moment of supreme comfort seems infinitely magnified.
>Her fur is indescribably soft, to the point that you could get addicted to running your hands through the heavenly fluff.
>Her tail coils around you with a surprising firmness, yet is gentle enough as to not harm you.
>Her song fills your head entirely, flushing out any negative thoughts you may have.
>Coyote's smile seems luminous, brilliantly illuminating your day.
>She sighs happily once again as her song comes to a close.
>After what felt like a year of cuddling up with Coyote, time seems to return to normal.
>Seems that only a minute actually passed.
>Not that it matters.  All that really matters is that you felt a year's worth of cuddles in that one minute.
>You thank her quietly, and she nods with a smile, eyes full of joyful tears.

>Another sigh of contentment escapes Coyote's throat as she lets go of you.
>"That was really nice... thanks, Nonny."
>"Thank YOU, Coyote."
>With that, you head off to the museum.
>The place is actually surprisingly packed today; probably thanks to the new Native American exhibit.
>...that or the fact that the gift shop is giving out freebies to kids.  That's also a potential reason.
>Apparently some local company chipped in some funding for this exhibit; the banner cheerfully states TRULY LOCAL HISTORY, SPONSORED BY FIZZ-EEZE!
>Hmph.  That feels kinda disrespectful, in a way.  Oh well.
>As you stroll through the wing, Coyote happily rhapsodizes about everything on display.
>"Oooh, look, look!  I used to carry a pouch just like this, gah-hah!  Oh!  Look at that headdress!"
>She points out every single item, rattling off facts about them.  People start to gather around as she starts to get more personal in her stories, eventually grabbing a chair and launching into one of her Great Coyote stories.
>The crowd is enraptured, staring and listening intently to every word.  The goddess feeds on the attention, a smile lighting up her face as she talks.
>When she's done, she bows to a cheering crowd...
>Then introduces herself.
>There's a stunned silence, then the majority of them fall into asking her questions and babbling about how cool she is.
>Coyote looks over at you with a broad, genuine smile. Her voice echoes in your head, giddy with excitement.
>"They love me, Nonny!  Thank you so much!"

>Coyote smiles broadly as she launches into another story.
>This time, she acts it out, weaving the tale with the help of conspicuously blue props.  
>The crowd is awestruck, though some look extremely concerned.  One man glances down at his drink and frowns.
>The kids are enraptured, clapping and cheering.  Coyote eggs them on, even giving some of them a chance to use her props.
>With every word, every action, Coyote seems to grow more solid and vivid.  Her illusions become more elaborate as the story goes on.
>Her voice again rings out in your head.
>"Nonny, I... I feel so alive!  So... healthy!"
>Your heart swells with happiness and warmth.  You slowly walk up to the storytelling goddess...
>Once she concludes her tale, you pull her into a mighty hug and give her a kiss.
>A chorus of "AWWWW"s fills the room as she blushes a little and giggles.
>You wave at the crowd.
>"Thanks for listening, everyone; we're gonna take a little break, but Coyote will be back!"
>The audience goes wild, cheering and screaming, as you and the goddess slip off to another room.
>Once alone, she smiles again, a tear running down her cheek.
>"So many believers in one place...!  Thank you, Nonny; thank you so much!"
>She hugs you close, her fluffy tail wrapping around you tightly.

>You smile and run your fingers through her incredibly soft tail fluff.
>As you do, you lean on and kiss her again.  Once you break it off, you speak up.
>"Say... we could volunteer here some.  That'd probably help your belief."
>"Oooh, good idea!  I could tell stories for everyone!"
>"Heh, yeah.  ...Coyote, thank you.  Thank you for everything.  You've really changed my life these last few days... or however long it's been.  It feels like a lifetime, and I've loved every moment with you."
>She smiles, tears in her eyes.
>"Nonny, I should be thanking you.  If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here.    You even helped me write new stories... Thank you.  I love you, Nonny.  So, so much."
>She hugs you close, a newfound strength in her embrace.
>"I've enjoyed helping you with the stories... heh, maybe one day we'll be in the legends.  You, me... and maybe... a family?"
>She gasps, the fur on her face going red.
>"A... family?  ..."
>She squeezes you even tighter, tears dripping onto your shoulder.
>The tender moment is interrupted by the chanting of the crowd in the other room.  Coyote grins wickedly.
>"Let's give em the grand finale, gah-hah-hah!"
>You nod and head out in front of the trickster.
>She bursts into the room to thunderous applause.  With a bow, she launches into one last story.
>Everyone watches, captivated by her magic.  Even the more skeptical onlookers smile begrudgingly.
>Once she gets to the last line, she winks at you.
>"...and just like that, the Great Coyote... was... GONE!"
>There's a room-filling blast of blue smoke.  You feel something grab your ankle and pull you through a hole in the floor...
>...you land on your couch.  Coyote throws an arm around you as the TV shows the crowded museum.  Every single person in the audience is cheering, some yelling out Coyote's name.
>She smiles tearfully, ears twitching happily.

>Coyote hugs you close, resting her chin atop your head and burying your face in neck fluff.
>You enjoy the softness of her fur quietly, thoughts racing.
>...COULD you start a family with her?  Is it even possible?
>For that matter... how would she feel about... marriage?
>You start to formulate a plan... a plan to propose.  You'll need a ring, though.
>Maybe one of the other deities can help you?  But... you'd need to get away from Coyote for a bit.
>...wait.  Can't she hear your thoughts?
>"Say, Coyote... could you, uh, stop reading my mind for a bit?"
>She frowns and tilts her head.
>"Eh?  I can do that... why?"
>"It's a surprise."
>Her smile returns, her eyes glimmering.
>"Ooooh!  Done and done."
>"Thank you.  ...Coyote... is it actually possible for us to start a family?"
>She blushes, tail thrashing wildly against the couch.
>"A-ah... well... yes, it is.  But, for a mortal and a god to have a child, the god has to be willing to conceive... plus, demigods are complicated..."
>She blushes silently.
>"...are you..."
>Silence.
>She stares at you, smiling.
>"Nonny... I... would love to start a family with you some day."
>The two of you embrace tightly and kiss.

>You have a momentary urge to get Coyote in the mood.  Your mind tells you to let her subconscious conjure up something FUN...
>But another part tells you to hold off and save yourself for when she's ready to start a family.
>...
>Hm.  You put a pin in that for now.
>"Coyote, can I borrow your Autobook for a moment?"
>"Hm?  Of course, Nonny!"
>The book appears in your lap.  Coyote stretches and stands up.
>"Mm... have fun; I'm gonna take a little nap.  I've been busy today, gah-hah!"
>She strolls off to the bedroom, yawning.
>You tentatively open the book up as if it were a laptop.  Unsurprisingly, it actually IS one when it opens.
>Coyote's desktop is a picture of you and her hugging.  Aww.
>You quickly navigate to the browser, DiviNet, apparently.
>It opens up to what looks like a chat room.
>A message blinks.
>"Capra: Ah, hello, Coyote.  How art thou?"
>You hesitantly respond.
>"Hi.  It's not Coyote, it's Anon.  I'm trying to surprise her."
>"Capra: Ah, hello, Anon."
>"Ares: MORTALS BEGONE"
>"Volta: Aw, can it, jughead!"
>"Ares: FUCK YOU"
>"Ares has logged out."
>"Capra: Hotheaded fellow, as always.  What seekest thou, O Coyote priest?"
>"I need a ring."
>"Capra: Oh?  Hmhmhm.  Perhaps Hephaestus is your man."
>"How do I contact him?"
>"Capra: Try his site on DiviNet.  He refuses to simply use HermeSkype.  Heathen."
>"Okay, thank you, Capra."
>"Capra: You're quite welcome."
>"Volta: Hey Anon!  Send me some pics of you and Coyote, kheh!"
>"Capra: Hush, you."

>"Volta: At least ask her to take a pic with ya next time!  She may be into that!  Maybe!  Maybe dont even ask and just take a pic!"
>"Volta has been timed out for 5 minutes by Amaterasu."
>"Capra: Apologies.  She gets a little feisty."
>"No worries."
>"Amaterasu: I normally have no issues with letting her have her fun, but sometimes enough is enough."
>"Anubis: Oh, Coyote priest... can... I ask you something?"
>"Sure."
>"Anubis: What's it like, being a mortal in a relationship with a goddess?  I want to make sure my new follower is enjoying himself."
>"Capra: I can help."
>"Anubis: Please let Anon answer."
>"Uh... it's wild.  Coyote has done a lot of amazing things."
>"Anubis: I see.  I'll try to impress him.  ...out of curiosity... do you think he likes me?"
>"Absolutely.  Especially your muscles."
>"Anubis: Thank you.  Incidentally, how IS Coyote?"
>"She's feeling much better, thank you."
>The various gods and goddesses send off messages of congratulations.
>...you private message Capra.
>"Hey, how's your relationship with your follower?"
>"Capra: Mm?  Excellent.  He is so loving... he is actually sitting by my side at the moment."
>"Great.  ...does Coyote have any fantasies I should know about?"
>"Capra: No, I believe you'll find her rather 'vanilla', as some say."
>"Okay... thanks."
>There's a chime as you receive a PM.
>"Elartha: Coyote, are you there?  I wanted to ask you about landing a mortal follower."
>Uh oh.
>"Elartha: Coyote?  Something about your PM page feels different.  Are you feeling alright?"

>Well, shit.
>You can't lie to a goddess, right?
>"Hi, Coyote's asleep; I'm her follower."
>There's a pause, and the screen seems to... twitch.
>"Elartha: You're MORTAL?  I thought I tasted human on this page..."
>...tasted?
>"I am.  Sorry she's not here to help."
>The screen definitely wobbles this time.
>"Elartha: Well, can you help me?  Please???"
>"I can try."
>"Elartha: Please."
>"Well, for starters, tell me about yourself."
>"Elartha: I'm an elder goddess.  You know.  The Lovecraft popularized my kinfolk."
>...she's... she's an eldritch monster...?
>"Oh.  Well, uh... maybe just be yourself?"
>"Elartha: Be myself?!  I have driven men to madness with a glance; torn flesh asunder with a mere flick of my ear.  What makes you think a mortal would want me?"
>"Okay, okay, please calm down.  Just trust me when I say you'll be happier if you stay true to yourself.  Changing to suit someone else leads to heartbreak."
>"Elartha: ...I guess that's true?  Anything else you can do to help me?  I'm kind of desperate."

>"Well, what kind of follower are you hoping for?"
>"Elartha: I actually have my eyes set on someone..."
>"What do you know about him?"
>"Elartha: E V E R Y T H I N G"
>Her... her words seem to float off the screen for a moment.
>...your head kind of hurts.
>"What kind of hobbies does he have?"
>"Elartha: The usual stuff a mortal has?  I suppose?? I don't understand mortals."
>"Oh, okay... the big thing to know is that you should be willing to try new things with him.  It'll show that you really want to make this work."
>"Elartha: That feels like a cop-out answer but okay. I'll try some mortal activities.  Thank you."
>"One more thing... don't your kin... break mortal minds?"
>"Elartha: Yes.  It's not entirely voluntary..."
>"Can you tone it down around him?"
>"Elartha: I can try... but I worry.  You mortals are so... squishy.  Fragile.  I'm afraid I'll hurt him accidentally."
>"Well, just be as careful as you can.  Apologize if you hurt him."
>"Elartha: I see... thank you, Anon."
>How did she... never mind.  Elder goddess.  Reading your mind is probably a reflex for her at this point.

>Talking to this woman is giving you the creeps...
>...and a worryingly "itchy" headache. 
>"Well, I hate to rush off, but I have something I need to do."
>There's a pause before her response, the words of which again seem to float off the screen.
>"Elartha: What, talk to Hephaestus?  Fine, fine, fine.  Thanks for the help, I guess."
>"Good luck, Elartha."
>A full-body chill runs through you after typing her name.  A distant, discordant sound rings in your head.  Your vision blurs for a moment.
>Her response floats off the laptop altogether, the words flying into your face.  They feel coarse and rough, and taste like metal.
>"Elartha: Goodbye, Anon."
>Her chat window shrinks and vanishes as your head clears.
>What the hell just happened?
>Never mind that.  You have a ringmaker to get in touch with.
>You're not sure how this DiviNet works...
>...but it apparently doesn't matter.  You mutter under your breath about Hephaestus's site, and the browser automatically redirects you there.
>It's a very smartly made, professional looking site, one that clearly had a lot of thought and effort put into it.
>A link in the top navbar says "Contact Me", and so you click it. A chat window inmediately opens up.
>"H: Hey there, mortal.  What can I do for you?"

>Well, might as well stick to business.
>"Hi, I wanted to see if I could commission a wedding ring?"
>"H: Yeah?  For who?"
>"Well, can you keep it under wraps?"
>"H: Yeah, sure."
>"It's for Coyote."
>"H: Alright, lemme see.  You're gonna want a sapphire inset, blue highlights, some geometric patterns, maybe a little engraving of a coyote's head.  That all sound about right?"
>"Yes, actually."
>"H: Figured.  Anything else?"
>"When can you have it done?  How much will it cost me?"
>"H: About a day, I'd say.  Cost wise, hm.  Well, I doubt you carry gold.  Hm.  Did you get referred here?"
>"Yes, by Capra."
>"H: Yeah, figured it was a love goddess.  I can give you a discount for being sent here, so... cost should be, oh, I dunno, about $5 million?"
>Your jaw drops.
>"Really?"
>"H: No, not really.  You mortals are pretty gullible, you know that?  No, this is just a ring, won't take me more than a bit.  I'm not worried about payment.  Besides, you kicked in some belief by coming here, and from what I hear you saved that loony trickster from death.  So, I think I can spare this much for someone like you."
>"That's very generous.  Thank you."
>"H: Yeah, no problem.  Need anything else?  Got questions?  Shoot."

>"How are you doing lately?  Like, you and the rest of the Greek pantheon?"
>"H: You know, you're one of the first mortals I've spoken to that's asked that in a while.  Things are going well thanks to modern media.  You mortal folk have done well keeping us in the spotlight, I must say."
>"Good, good.  Is there anything I can do to help you?  I feel bad asking for work and doing nothing in return."
>"H: Don't you realize you ARE helping?  You're contributing belief to me, Coyote, and every other deity you've dealt with.  You even outright served as the trickster's sole anchor to this world for a time. Don't worry about the cost."
>"Well, thank you."
>"H: Like I said, it's nothing.  Helping you helps me in the long run.  It's a give and take, you know?  Gotta hand out those blessings to reward those who care. Then, they'll be more inclined to keep caring, and to make more people care.  Easy as that."
>Who would've guessed the god of the forge would be so chill?

>"Can you tell me anything about demigods?"
>"H: Out of academic curiosity, or are you thinking of starting a family?  Either way, demigods can be tricky.  Life is rather complicated for someone who is both part mortal and part deity.  But, ultimately, every single one is different.  My advice to you?  If this is something you want, tell her."
>"Thank you.  So, uh, Aphrodite and Capra; are they rivals?"
>"H: In some sense, I suppose, but they've never butted heads.  They ARE love goddesses, not hate goddesses."
>"True.  Is Zeus really as, uh, out there as the the myths say?"
>"H: Moreso."
>"I figured.  Hey, uh, do you know anything about how a mortal can safely talk to an elder god?"
>"H: Hm.  Well, that's tricky.  They are by nature major cognitohazards to mortals.  One answer of course is to just not think about things too much. But that of course isn't optimal.  No, the best way is to rationalize them into more understandable forms.  Normally they'll try to manifest in a mostly coherent form, but they don't always have the best grasp on that sort of thing.  A sane, levelheaded mortal can fill in the gaps of their form to have a safer, if still unnerving, experience."
>"I see, thanks.  You're a pretty nice guy, Hephaestus; you should come hang out with me and Coyote sometime."
>"H: I would, but I'm pretty busy.  I appreciate that, Anon."
>"Well, I know some people who may need rings soon, and I'll be sure to refer em to you."
>"H: Thanks, Anon.  I appreciate you spreading the word."

>"So... uh... can you do more 'intimate' commissions too?"
>"H: Haha, maybe just start with the ring, Anon."
>"True.  So, I'm using Coyote's computer to talk... how can I get in touch in the future?"
>"H: You have a smartphone, right?  Right.  If you look at it right now, you'll see an app installing.  Use it to connect to DiviNet whenever.  It's disguised as a tax calculator so Coyote won't find it before you're ready."
>"Wow, thank you.  So, how do I get the ring discretely?"
>"H: You let me worry about that.  I'll make sure she never catches wind of it.  You just worry about popping the question when the time comes, and the ring will be there when you need it."
>"How will it be delivered?"
>"H: It'll probably just be teleported.  Simple, subtle, smart."

>"Well, thanks again for the help.  Take care, Hephaestus."
>"H: Likewise, Anon.  By the way, don't forget to delete your history before giving Coyote her computer back."
>You log out and scrub Heph's site from the browsing history, then put the Coyotebook away.
>With that, you peek in on Coyote.
>She's fast asleep, smiling and snoring.  She looks so comfortable...
>...you carefully slide into bed with her, taking pains not to wake her.
>Once there, you cuddle up as close as you can.  Unconsciously, she wraps an arm and her tail around you.
>The soft, warm fur of your goddess quickly lures you into a drowsy state.
>You glance at the clock.  5:00 PM.
>Plenty of time for a nap.  With a yawn, you lay your head over closer to Coyote's smiling face, then begin to doze off yourself.  You lean in and kiss her gently, prompting her grin to widen a little.
>With that done, you promptly fall asleep.

>You quickly feel yourself slipping off into a dream.  You are standing in the midst of a meadow of blue flowers.
>It's not long before a familiar melody wafts through the air, tickling your ears.
>Coyote, clad in a flowing blue dress, elegantly dances through the flowers, singing one of her soothing songs and approaching you slowly.
>She smiles, love in her eyes, as she reaches you and extends a hand.  You take it without hesitation.
>The meadow becomes a familiar blue desert.  You and your goddess waltz across the cerulean sands, the entirety of your surroundings swaying and dancing to the rhythm of her music.
>Coyote's dress vanishes, and she pulls you close, insanely soft fur carressing you gently.
>She kisses you atop the head and hugs it close to her chest, still quietly singing.
>Her voice rings out through your mind, even in the dream.
>"I love you, Nonny.  So much."
>"I love you too."
>She pulls you even closer somehow; your body feels intertwined with hers on some metaphysical level.
>It's as if, for a moment, your entire world is nothing but the unmatched softness and comfort of her fur.
>You sigh happily, burying your face further in her fluffy neck fur...
>...you awaken with your head resting firmly beneath Coyote's chin.  You glance at the clock after managing to pry yourself away from her miraculous fur.
>1 AM.
>...seems your nap became a full 8 hours.  Oh well.

>Carefully rolling away from Coyote, you check your phone to see if the artist got back to you.
>...
>He sent you a fantastic, amazingly accurate sketch of Coyote.
>"I dunno how this came out so well, but here it is.  If this works for you, I'll do the whole book in this style."
>You smile and pop off a response, then cuddle back up with Coyote, knowing that this guy's the perfect choice for an artist.
>...you wake up again, this time at 7 AM, and check your phone once more.
>Incogneato has sent you a ton of rough sketches.
>"I know I should be asleep, but it's like I've got divine inspiration or something; I don't even feel tired. I can probably get all this done in about a week or two."
>"Great, thank you!"
>You laugh triumphantly, and Coyote jerks awake with a moan.
>"Mmmm...?  What's... did I miss something funny?"
>She laughs drowsily, then yawns.
>"That artist said he'll be done in like a week; Coyote, the book is almost ready for publishing."
>She suddenly snaps into alertness, staring at you slackjawed.
>"Nonny, you mean... we did it?"
>She lets out a howl of glee, the room filling with blue light as she throws her arms up.
>"WE DID IT!  WE DID IT, NONNY!"
>She pulls you close and spins around, hugging and kissing you.  You can't help but chuckle, and she joins in.
>"We sure did."
>She hugs you tight for several minutes, tears of joy dripping down her snout, when a deep, thundering voice echoes in your head.
>"Hey Anon.  Check your pockets... I rushed your order.  Felt like you needed it now.  Good luck, my friend."
>...you feel a newfound weight in your pocket, an unmistakably ring-shaped weight.

>Time for the big moment.
>You think back to something Grandma told you about...
>...the day Grandad proposed to her at the lake.
>"Hey, Coyote, let's go out to the lake to celebrate.  Sound fun?"
>She nods vigorously.
>"Sounds great, Nonny; let's take a shortcut, gah-hah!"
>She grabs you and pulls you through one of her trademark floor portals; you land in the grass, right by the lake.
>It's very picturesque today.  The sun shines beautifully, reflecting off the pristine water.  The green grass and leaves wave playfully in a cool breeze.  The birds sing their songs and the ducks quack in a counterrhythm.
>It's all perfect.
>You look over at Coyote.
>The gorgeous scene is reflected in her eyes, her smile showing her zest for life and all the beauty it entails.
>...it's time.
>You gently elbow her in the ribs, winking.
>"Well, I guess with this book coming out, you won't be needing me anymore."
>She looks rather confused.
>"Whaaat?  Don't be silly, Nonny; I need you.  I LOVE you!  I wouldn't trade you for a million followers."
>You smile and pull the ring from your pocket, keeping it concealed for now.
>"Really?  Well, that's great.  Means I still have some use for this."
>You present the ring to her, sapphire inset, blue engravings and all.  Coyote gasps.
>"Coyote, will you marry me?"
>A genuine smile crosses her face, for once not showing any teeth.  Tears well up in her eyes as she practically tackles you, wrapping her arms around you.
>"Of course I will, Nonny.  I... thank you."
>She kisses you repeatedly, tears still flowing, as a flock of blue birds flies overhead, singing a familiar tune and flocking in the shape of a heart.
>The birds get to the end of their song, then explode into blue fireworks.  Some blasts are shaped like the trickster's smiling face, some like your face.
>The sparks spell out a message...
>"COYOTE AND NONNY: ETERNALLY IN LOVE"
>She hugs you even closer, kissing you once more before simply resting her chin atop your head with a happy sigh.
>...yeah, you can definitely get used to this.
