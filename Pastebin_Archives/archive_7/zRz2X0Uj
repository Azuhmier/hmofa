>Be Anon. 
>Have Hyena friend who you've been rooming with for a while. 
>More of just sleeping on his couch really.
>He manages to snag you a position at the company he works for. 
>Nothing prestigious, just sales. 
>Goes pretty okay. You aren't good at sales, but you aren't really terrible either. 
>You figure as long as you're above that red panda guy who just kind of blanks out at his screen for minutes at a time you should be okay. 
>Hyena bro's lunches never really sync up with yours but it's aight. 
>One day he comes down with pneumonia. So bad he has to go to the hospital. 
>You still have to keep up with the daily grind though. 
>It's a Thursday night and you just got off work. 
>Walk to the train station like usual.
>See a fennec fox you vaguely recognized from the office looking rather frustrated as she rummages through her purse. 
>You knew she was one of Haida's friends, but you'd never really met her.
>Since she's near the pass scanners you head up to her. "You alright?" 
>She gives a frustrated sigh as take out your card. "No. I lost my train pass," she says, giving up searching through her purse. 
>"Don't worry, I got you covered." 
>Scan your pass twice. 
>She looks a bit surprised but thanks you. 
>"You're one of Haida's friends, aren't you?" she asks. 
>"Yeah, that's me. I'm Anon. Haida landed me a job down in sales." 
>"Fenneko. How is he doing? He hasn't exactly been keeping me updated." 
>"Really, really bad pneumonia. Don't know how he got it but that was a pretty freaky 2am ER visit. He should be fine and out in a week, they're pumping him full of antibiotics," you inform her. 
>"Ow, his poor insurance." 
>"Yeah, sucks our company doesn't have decent health coverage either. I was actually on my way to see him right now, would you wanna tag along?" 
>"Can't, I gotta head home. Thanks for filling me in though. And for the free ride," she says as you pass by her line. 
>You give a little wave and the two of you part ways. 

>You go check on Haida. He's pretty worn out but recovering okay. 
>Stay for an hour or so, just to get his spirits up. He always did hate hospitals. 
>Go home after. 
>On the train ride home you feel your phone buzz twice in your pocket. 
>You got a message from that fennec girl, as well as a friend request. 
>...
>You thought your profile was set to private.
>Check. Yep, it is. 
>The fuck? 
>Figure it's a bug in the application and accept both the message and friend request. 
>"Hey, just wanted to say thanks again for covering my train home. You saved my ass back there." 
>You type a response back. "Don't sweat it." 
>A few minutes go by before you get a response. "Haida okay?" 
>"Yeah, pretty bummed about being bedridden though." 
>"I'll take retsuko to go see him tomorrow then," she sends. 
>"Is that the girl he keeps spazzing over?" you ask. 
>"And not doing anything with, yes. I've been trying to get him to confess for months now." 
>"Rip. Maybe I can give him a little push or something." 
>"Oh yes, I'm sure you get allll the ladies with that train pass ;)". 
>...
>Wow. You've known her less than five minutes and she's already spitting fire at you. 
>"Kys." 
>"You kys." 
>W.o.w. 
>Alright, you admittedly were interested at this point. 
>"How'd you even find my profile anyways? It's set to private." 
>";)" is all she sends back. But before you can even question further she just sends another message. "Anyways, gotta go. TTYL." 
>It says she's offline right after. 
>The rest of your train ride was peaceful. You had to admit the fox was fun to talk too. You'd have to get to know her better.

>Friday you had off thankfully. Your schedule was only set for Monday-Thursday. 
>You pretty much spent the whole weekend either beating off, playing some vidya, or cleaning up around the house for when Haida would come home. 
>Last thing you wanted was your friend to come back barely alive to a filthy apartment. 
>You texted Fenneko off and on. The second day after she'd friended you she's apparently gone through your wall and teased you for being an edgy little shit back in High school. 
>You were just surprised she went that far back. 
>But Haida told you when you last visit him to not be surprised. That was just Fenneko, she cyber stalked most of her friends. 
>Which meant you were a friend in her mind. 
>He looked just as confused when you mentioned your profile was private but laughed about it. Once again, that was just Fenneko. She surely found some sort of loophole. Probably in minutes too. 
>Haida ended up getting released from the hospital a bit early on Sunday, and surprisingly that Retsuko girl he was always on about had dropped him off. 
>They were a thing now, or at least it seemed that way. 
>Good on him. 
>He was back at work with you Monday. Not out of persistence but out of fear of being fired by his literal pig-faced boss. 
>Poor guy. You felt bad for him. 
>But there wasn't much you could do to help him. 
>You were on your break when you ran into Fenneko again. She sat across from you at one of the break room tables. "Wow, lunch of champions?" 
>She was referring to the chips and m&ms you had as your "lunch." 
>"Yeah, I kind of forgot to make lunch this morning." 
>"Haida told me you woke up late, you're such a good friend aren't you?" She said with a snort and a little grin on her muzzle, though she was on her phone as always. 
>"I also visited him more than once when he was deathly ill." 
>She paused and looked up, then reached over and took one of your m&ms. 
>She didn't eat it, she just pegged you in the forehead with it. "Jerk."

>She begins eating her own lunch and asks you something after a moment. "We always get drinks after work on Mondays, you wanna come for once?" 
>"You and Haida?"
>"Mhmm," she nods. "Retsuko used to come but she has yoga on mondays." 
>You didn't really have anything planned, so what the hell, why not? 
>"Sure, I'm in. Right after work?" 
>She nods. "It'll be nice to not have to listen to him whine alone." 
>"I'll give you that much, he does get a bit...nasally when he's complaining." 
>That gets a genuine laugh from her, not like the sarcastic deadpan one you'd heard once or twice before. "At least it won't be about his love life anymore." 
>"Nope, worse," you shake your head. "He'll be going on and on about how great it is. 'Oh Fenneko, Retsuko and I are just perfect together, oh golly gee'," you say, mimicking his voice. 
>She laughs harder, coughing a bit as you nearly made her choke on her lunch. "You are way too good at that." 
>"Well I've been living with him for a year, getting a knack for it was bound to happen." 
>You glance at your phone. Your break was about over. 
>You stand and collect your garbage. "I gotta get back to the daily grind. See ya tonight Fenneko." 
>"Later." 

>You meet up with Fenneko and Haida around 5:30. Haida looked even more worn out than he usually did. 
>"How ya holding up buddy?" you ask as you all head out the door. 
>He coughs into his elbow/."Okay I guess. This cough is killing me though." 
>"I'm sure some liquor will help you feel better," you say, patting him on the back. 
>Thankfully for him the bar wasn't that far from work. 
>You all got a table and ordered some drinks. Haida got a beer and so did you. Fenneko got a wine. 
>Haida looked a bit longingly at the empty seat beside Fennneko, and you glanced at her. 
>She was silent before noticing Haida's look, and your own. 
>"Don't you dare," she mouthed, but you just smiled. 
>"So, Haida, how's the new relationship treating you?" You ask.

>Fenneko glares at you, not really out of anger but because you can see she's trying not to laugh. 
>Haida perks up almost immediately, and you smirk over at Fenneko, mouthing "Three, two, one." 
>"Oh you guys, it's been great! Every bit as wonderful as I imagined it would be, Retsuko is just...like, the best girlfriend I could ask for!" He says. His tail is wagging behind him. 
>"That's great to hear Haida," Fenneko says, though as he sips from his beer you make eye contact with her again. She has to bite her cheek. 
>"Huh? What's so funny?" he asks when he sees you trying not to laugh. 
>"Nothing buddy, Fenneko's just being rude." 
>"Oh that's bullshit!" she fires back. "You're the one doing the stupid impressions!" 

>Haida just looks confused. "What impre-? Oh come on, are you making fun of me dude?" He asks defensively. 
>"What, me? Never! Like I said, she's just being rude." 
>Fenneko tries to kick your leg under the table but it doesn't really reach, skimming your pants. 
>You smile at her condescendingly. "Yeah you're stubby legs wont make it that far sweetheart." 
>"Screw you." 
>You roll your eyes and motion for the waiter to come over so you could get more drinks. "Not even on your birthday." 

>As the night goes on you and Fenneko keep bickering in between pestering Haida about his new love life. 
>Haida stops drinking after his second beer but you and Fenneko are a bit far gone. 
>He's the one who leeds you to the train station once you guys finally leave the bar. After her third glass of wine Fenneko had gotten a little more playful with you. At some point you ended up sitting next to her instead after taking a leak. 
>The whole time she'd been rubbing your thigh or something like that. 
>Not gonna lie you found the fox pretty hot, and when you popped a halfie she wasn't shy about groping it. 
>Haida is oblivious to it all, of course, until you reached the train station.

>Once you're there though, Fenneko rather aggressively pulls you towards her own platform. 
>Haida looks a little surprised but you just smiles at him, knowing you were probably gonna get laid. 
>"Alright, uh...just don't be late tomorrow dude.." 
>"No...no promises..." you say, a bit lightheaded from your alcohol intake. 
>Your train arrives soon after he leaves. 
>It's late, practically nobody is in the train car, and the one person who is in there is facing away from you guys. 
>Needless to say she's on your lap the second you sit down, cupping your face in her smaller clawed hands, her muzzle to your lips. 
>There was something incredibly hot about how she just went for it, to say nothing about the way she's kissing you. 
>Things get heated rather quick, the fox grinding her hips against your rock solid cock through your pants. 
>Holy shit she's not even wearing underwear. 
>You wonder if she took them off just for you back at the bar at some point. 
>Once at her stop she gets off of you, only to rush you to her house a block away. 
>You don't even make it to her bed. Despite her only being barely above your waist she manages to push you back onto the couch. 
>"Take those goddamn pants off you asshole," she growls at you. 
>You barely get them down enough for your cock to spring free before she's in your lap again, kissing you even more feverishly than before. 
>Her sex is absolutely soaked and you can feel how hot she is down there as she grins on your length. 
>Finally she breaks the kisses, glancing down at your length. Seeing it gives her the slightest moment of pause. 
>You aren't the biggest in the world, a little above average, but that was in human terms. You must be huge from her perspective, judging by the look on her face. 
>But she wastes no time in lining you up and slowly lowering herself down into your lap, slipping you inside. 
>Holy...shit...
>You have to fight not to cum right away.
>She's so warm, wet, and unbelievably tight.
>She manages to get about half of your length inside of her before wincing, though as she starts bouncing you do work gradually deeper. 
>You rest your hands on her hips, helping her stay steady, but you let her do the work. You don't want to hurt her. 
>When she finally manages to get you all the way in her eyes roll back and she moans softly. "F-fuck, Anon...god, why are you so big?.." 
>You can't even find it in you to answer, you're too lost in a haze of drunken pleasure as she speeds up on you. 
>Her wetness becomes audible even over the noise you're both making. Her sex keeps squeezing you whenever she pauses the rocking of her hips, milking you. 
>When she hits her peak it's rather suddenly, and she lets out a string of loud, high whimpers as her claws dig into your chest. Her walls convulse and clamp down all around your length, and that sensation is too much to fight against. 
>You cum hard, pouring your load deep in her pussy. 
>She collapses against you, muzzle resting against your neck as she relaxes. "God, were you just as pent up as me?"
>"You...you were rubbing my dick all night...what did you expect?" you ask tiredly.
>She gives a soft laugh and finally gets off of you. 
>Your half-hard cock slips out of her, and some of your cum drips down her thighs. 
>"Ugh, shoulda used a condom.." 
>"I'll just get you a plan b in the morning," you yawn, pulling up your pants after wiping yourself off. 
>"No, its's okay. I'm on the pill. Just would have saved the cleanup. Thanks for warning me," she snorts you grin. 
>You get a bra tossed at your face. "Jerk." 

>You really hoped this wouldn't be a one time thing.
