“Pass me the monkey wrench.” “We don’t have a second monkey wench, this is a two person flight and I’m definitely not a female monkey. But…” “Monkey. Wrench.” “Oh. I don’t carry those.” “You call yourself an engineer, skin?” “Yes. I don’t carry monkey wrenches because they went out of fashion a century ago. But I am equipped with-.” “A wrench! Give me a goddamn wrench before we overheat.” “We’re not gonna overheat.” “We will if we don’t fix these pipes. And since your ‘elite’ company decided to go cheap I’m stuck with a shitty ship, and you, skin.” “I’ll give you your wrench if you call me by name, hairball.” “John, please give me your precious wrench.”
	John smirked with confidence as he unhooked and passed the deep red wrench, but he didn’t put too much force behind it in preference to watching it slowly float to the white furred primate, leading up to her clenched jaw and furrowed brow that housed darting brown eyes, all packaged with a cream-fleshed face. John’s distinct smugness was only elated by her erected tail and frazzled fur. She quickly grabs it and clamps the mouth of the loose bolt, twisting it in place to secure the pipe with a surprising amount of power while keeping unwavering eye contact. John’s shoulders sunk a bit; the fun was over. She had a blunt tool and was well on her way to anger if he kept up the teasing.
	“Thank you, John.” She said through her teeth, displaying two decent pairs of fangs, the most prominent being the upper pair. “You’re welcome, Raxa.” John said with a mocking politeness. But at least he wouldn’t be called “skin” as much.
