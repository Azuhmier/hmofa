>Be Anon
>You were 26 years old, standing at an even six feet.
>You were an avid outdoorsman, and were currently out camping in the Appalachians.
>On this particular outing, you had managed to convince your GF to come along.
>It was a bit of a rough relationship, but you thought that maybe a peaceful weekend away from everything would be just what you two needed to really connect.
>Oh, how wrong you had been.
>From the second she had step foot into the woods, almost everything that came out of her mouth was a complaint.
>Whether she was complaining about the humidity, or pleading for you to cut the trip short, she just won't shut up.
>It's the second day of your trip, near the evening.
>You had tried to teach her how to fish in a lake nearby, only for her to drop the rod into the water and then blame you for it.
>fuckmylife.jpg
>Currently, it was in the evening, and the two of you were sitting on opposite sides of a campfire. She was using a canvas fold-up chair, while you were simply sitting on a fallen log.
>You were focused on some corned beef hash browning in a small skillet over the fire, while your GF was staring at you with a scowl on her face.
>"Anon, you can't -honestly- expect me to eat that. It's so greasy!"
>You tell her that it was fine, and that you couldn't really just stop cooking it at this point.
>"Ugh, it smells fucking disgusting! You know how I feel about red meat!"
>Why the hell do you even keep her around?
>"God, this place sucks. Next time you wanna go on vacation, you're taking me to a resort or something."
>Before you can form a response, she stands up.
>She ducks inside your shared tent, and comes out holding a couple packets of travel toilet paper.
>"I'm gonna go pee. And NO, I don't need any help."
>You tell her not to go too far, and to be careful.
>"Oh, be quiet. I know how to piss, Anon. And I can't go if you can hear me!"
>You just watch her with a neutral expression as she marches off through the bushes, leaving the circle of light around your campfire.
>Sometimes it was difficult to keep your anger in check around her.
>You just sigh, poking at the sizzling meat with a small spatula.
>Just another day and a half, and you could be out of here and back to your monotonous life as a wagie back in the city.

>It's been nearly 20 minutes since your GF left to go pee. She still hasn't come back.
>Fuck, did she get hurt or something? That would just be the cherry on top of the shit sundae that this trip was turning out to be.
>At first you had thought she had decided to maybe take a shit or something, but it was getting unnerving.
>Just as you're about to get up and start looking for her, you can hear the sound of something moving in the treeline.
>Now that you notice it, there's also this weird smell in the air... Almost like burnt copper or stale blood.
>Whatever it was, it wasn't particularly pleasant.
>Suddenly, something walks out of the brush and into your camp.
>Oh, it's just your Girlfriend. 
>It's her alright, but there's something... Off about her.
>Her clothes and hair are a bit dirty looking, and she's standing kind of funny. It almost looks like she's laughing, but without the noise.
>You ask her if she's okay, but she just continues to stare at you.
>You motion for her to sit down, and she rushes over to you, plopping herself down on the log next to you.
>She sits closely next to you, her arm and thigh gently pressing against you.
>This was weird... You didn't like how she was being so quiet. Or how she suddenly wanted to be close to you.
>It was pretty out of character for her.
>An unsure look on your face, you turn back to the skillet.
>It had finished cooking a while ago, and was sitting on a rock next to the fire.
>You can hear your GF sharply inhale through her nose.
>Wait, no. She's... Sniffing you?
>thatjustaintright.mp3
>You scooch away from her a bit, making her cock her head at you.
>You ask her if she wanted some of the corned beef hash, or if she wanted to get some rest.
>She smells the air, and then violently nods.
>Well, that's certainly a change of mood from earlier.
>As you try to plate some of the hash onto a tray for her, she keeps trying to grab it.
>You manage to hold her off just long enough so that you can give her a decent amount.
>You hand her the tray and a fork.
>She drops the fork and scoops the steaming food into her mouth with her hand, finishing it within a minute.
>You have to practically wrestle the tray out of her hands to stop her from licking the remaining grease off of the plate.
>You ask her what was with her today, making her cock her head at you once more.
>What the fuck?
>She croaks out a phrase.
>"Yes, I'm FINE."
>Well, she certainly still had her bitchy mood.
>But something was weird about how she said it. It's almost like the pitch in her voice was off?
>Weird.

>Maybe things would be better when you woke up in the morning.
>You stand up, telling her that you were going to sleep.
>She stands up as well, a toothy grin on her face.
>You ask her what happened to her out in the woods, and she just shakes her head at you.
>She probably just fell down or something...
>Her hand tugs on your arm, pulling you closer to her.
>She wraps you in a hug, smelling your hair.
>Still hugging you, she moves her head to face you.
>She still has that wide grin, staring at your face.
>Ew, what the fuck!? That metallic smell is coming from her breath!
>Wait. Oh fuck.
>The woman in front of you has dark brown eyes.
>Your girlfriend's eyes were blue.
>holypoptartsinapencilsharpener.webm
>This isn't your girlfriend!
>You pull away from her, alarm on her face.
>She must notice your alarm, as she takes a couple steps back, her head tilting at you once more.
>To your horror, her head doesn't stop tilting until it's horizontal, the vertebrae in her neck audibly popping.
>You scream at her, asking what she did to your GF.
>The grin slips from her face as she walks closer to you.
>You want to run, but your legs are frozen.
>She grabs your arm with an iron grip, pulling you to your tent.
>You try to resist, but she's way stronger than she looks.
>She doesn't even bat an eye when you start throwing punches at her.
>The creature that looks like your girlfriend roughly throws you onto your sleeping bag, the air being forced from your lungs.
>She begins to tear at her dirty clothes, ripping the fabric off of her skin. She doesn't stop until she's mostly naked, her sopping wet loins bared to you.
>She grins at you, causing you to scream out once more. Holy shit, whatever this thing was, it was going to fucking rape you!
>In place of normal Human teeth, are a bestial set that look more at home in a werewolf movie.
>It drops down onto it's knees, hands grasping at your jeans. Her fingers are almost inhumanly long, with the nails rough and ragged at the ends.
>The Creature tries to tear at them, but the denim seems to be just a bit too sturdy for her.
>You kick and yell, but it's no use.
>Wait a minute!
>Your pack is just a couple feet away from you. Maybe if...
>You keep kicking at her, your arms gripping the pack in a panic.
>You do your best to unzip it with one hand, using the other hand to try and get her off of you.
>Your hand enters the pack, feeling around until it closes around a cylindrical metal object...
>Bear mace, Motherfucker!
>You whip out the aerosol can, pointing it right at the creatures' wide, excited eyes.
>It's too focused on getting your pants off to notice what you're holding.
>You shut your eyes tight, and pull back on the tab, sending a fine red mist of liquid tear gas directly into the creatures face.

>The Creature's hands tighten around your jeans, ripping them as it screams.
>It flops onto one side, clawing at the air.
>You take the opportunity to clamber out of the tent.
>You unsteadily get to your feet, and book it in a random direction.
>Fuck, fuck, fuck!
>You don't stop running until you're choking and tears run from your eyes.
>Leaning against a tree, you try to get your breath back...
>What the FUCK was that!?
>Jesus Tap-Dancing CHRIST, a fucking MONSTER just tried to jump your bones!
>It was like some shitty greentext on /x/!
>You take a quick inventory of yourself as you try to calm down.
>You're out in the middle of nowhere, with no clue where you are.
>Your jeans have been torn to ribbons, leaving your boxers exposed.
>You have no supplies, and nothing to contact the outside world.
>To summarize, you're good and truly fucked.
>You groan, rubbing your sweat-covered brow.
>You look around, seeing if there was anything in the immediate area that could help you.
>It's all just rotting sticks and mushrooms.
>Damn.
>You try and look at the sky for a point of reference. You knew that there was an established campground intended for more novice campers a ways east of here. If you could get there, you would be able to get help.
>Too bad the night sky is blocked by a thick covering of leaves.
>Damn trees! Maybe deforestation wasn't too bad of an idea after all.
>You uneasily look around once more, hoping that the creature wouldn't find you.
>In any case, it would be better to get a move on. You weren't accomplishing anything by standing here with your thumb up your ass.
>Picking a direction, you start to walk at a brisk pace.

>You're not sure how long you've been walking, but you're getting increasingly terrified at the thoughts running though your mind.
>Where's your Girlfriend? Is she dead?
>Why did that Thing look like her? Why did it try to have sex with you?
>Was It trying to find you?
>You come to a dead stop after that last thought leaves your mind.
>In the distance, you can see two pin-pricks of light through the vegetation. Flashlights?
>Holy shit, you're fucking saved!
>You call out to the lights and rush towards them, yelling that you needed help.
>As you get closer though, the color drains from your face and your cry tapers out into a rattling moan.
>The lights did not belong to a pair of flashlights.
>It was simply the reflection off of an animals' eyes.
>To be more specific, the eyes' of the Creature.
>welp.gif
>It looked different now.
>It still looked vaguely like your Girlfriend, except it was now 7 feet tall, propped up by animalistic legs similar to a deer or goats.
>It's arms were unusually long, with long, yet blunt, claws poking out from it's four-fingered hands.
>The Thing's torso and head still had the appearance of your GF's, except for the weird sagging effect the skin had.
>One thing was for sure.
>It was NOT your day.
>You book it in the opposite direction, running as fast as your bare legs can take you.
>You glance back, and see it following you at the same pace.
>Running becomes the only thing in your mind. That and the need to vomit.
>You keep on running, but every time you look back, the creature is the same distance behind you, a grin on It's face.
>It's toying with you.
>You keep on running until you trip over a root, falling flat on your face.
>Before you get up, you feel a large hand gently pressing against your back.
>You're slowly turned over, the creature's eyes seeming to appraise you as they run over your body.
>It smiles warmly at you, It's brutish hands lovingly stroking your head.
>It leans in close, the smell of bear mace choking you.
>It tenderly whispers something in your ear, but you can't really make them out.
>The situation proves to be too much to you, and you start to feel faint.
>You let out a shaky cry, then black out.

>You wake up with a start, your leg kicking at the air.
>Your eyes blink rapidly, but you still can't see anything.
>Either your surroundings were really dark, or you were blind.
>After a minute, your eyes adjust to the darkness, showing you where you were.
>You were sitting near the mouth of some cave, lit up by the light from the moon.
>You're covered by a large animal hide, which you roll off of you.
>You quickly realize that you aren't wearing any clothes.
>Looking around the immediate area for your clothes, you can see nothing except for pebbles.
>And a large pile of bones.
>Some of which are recognizable as belonging to Humans.
>Oh, FUCK.
>Uneasily, you stand up, moving to the cave entrance.
>When you get to the edge of the cave, you're met by a ledge.
>Looking down, it's almost 30 foot drop straight to some sharp-looking rocks.
>Yeah, this seems about right for the lair of a monster.
>You don't even try to maneuver your way down.
>You weren't good at rock climbing on your best days, so you didn't really like your chances when you were naked and tired in the darkness.
>From behind you, you can hear a sharp noise suddenly cut through the quiet air.
>Then you feel a large, warm hand rest on your shoulder.
>You don't bother trying to scream. You know nobody can hear you.
>Turning you around, you stare into the face of the creature, now fully changed.
>It's chest is covered by a thick layer of fur, with two large breasts poking out.
>It's head is situated on the end of a long neck, also covered in a thick covering of scraggly fur.
>It's face resembles no animal you've ever seen before.
>It almost looks like some weird mixture of a cow's facial structure, a dog's muzzle, and a deer's horns.
>Whatever the Thing is, it still has that disturbing grin on It's face.

>It pulls you in for a hug, your face pressing into the fur between Her breasts.
>To your surprise, it doesn't smell how you thought it would.
>Instead of an unbearable stench, it instead has some vaguely familiar animal smell. Almost like that of a dog.
>You can hear and feel a deep rumble coming from the Creature's chest as it rubs along your back with it's large hands.
>It slowly eases you back over to the hide blanket.
>You're slowly let down onto your back as the Thing begins to straddle you.
>You can feel a thick, warm drop of it's natural lubricant drip onto your shaft.
>One of her hands gently cups your groin, rubbing the slick moisture all over your length.
>She coos at you as she coaxes your dick to rise like some sort of sick snake-charmer.
>She begins to stroke your length slowly, her other hand positioned on your chest to keep you from running.
>Many conflicting thoughts are rushing through your head at this point, most of them relating to whether you should run or not.
>Well, it's not like you could get out the front of the cave. And you're pretty certain that the other end of the cave wouldn't really give you many options...
>Oh, what the hell. You might as well try to enjoy this before the Creature decides to rip your neck open.
>You let out a sigh, and rest your head onto the pelt under you.
>The Creature let's out a satisfied squeal as it sees you finally giving in.
>You look it in the eyes as it shimmys up your pelvis a bit.
>You can see it holding your dick with one hand, trying her best to align it with her own slick opening.
>When she has it just where she wants it, she slowly eases herself down, your cock sinking into her.
>She eases onto your shaft at a tortuously slow rate, taking atleast 2 minutes until your hips finally meet.
>She shivers happily, feeling you hilted inside of her.
>Panting, she begins to lift up again, just as slowly as before.
>You're not sure how long the cycle continues, but she has your dick throbbing inside of her, begging for more.
>She looks at you with a knowing smirk, her hand leaving your chest.
>Big mistake, faggot!
>You immediately thrust up into her, forcing a loud cry out of her.
>Her hips drop down onto you, smacking against your pelvis with a loud slap.
>It stings a bit, you're too busy trying to stuff her full of your cock to even register the pain.
>If you were going out, you were going out with a bang! Literally!
>You hammer into the Furred woman's cunt without mercy, drawing all sorts of embarrassing noises out of her.
>At one point she even flops onto her side, your dick popping out of her.
>Without skipping a beat, you push her onto her back, climbing on top of her before slamming back into her.
>Her skinny legs and arms loosely wraps around you as you pound into her.
>She lets out several loud, feral cries as you slam deep inside of her.
>Suddenly, her arms and legs tighten around you, and she lets out an ungodly scream as her climax hits her like a bullet.
>It's enough to set you over the edge as well.
>You groan as you spray her insides white with your love, her internal muscles drawing your cum directly into her womb.
>Her hand lovingly strokes your head as she huffs and pants, her long tongue hanging out of her mouth.
>Your head rests in her fur, your head swimming.
>You feel a deep and satisfied rumble coming from deep within her.
>Her fur feels so warm, and you can't help but close your eyes.
>Everything feels right in this moment.
>Balls deep inside a monster who probably killed your Girlfriend? Whatever.
>Trapped in a cave 30 feet off of the ground? Eh, so what?
>Hopelessly lost in the Appalachians? Well, it could be worse.
>With a smile, you left yourself drift off to sleep.

>To your shock, you wake up the following morning.
>You sit up on the pelt, your skin sticky with the remainders of last night.
>Next to you, you can see the Creature looking at you with a peaceful smile.
>She's happily rubbing her stomach, staring at you.
>To your shock, she suddenly speaks in a raspy voice.
>"Our children... We will raise them... Together..."
>idshabbening.png
>Well, you could cross "fathering demon children" off of your bucket list.
>You sigh, laying back down.
>She reaches over, patting you on the thigh.

>From that day on, you were never again seen by the outside world.
>Your Girlfriend had actually survived, being picked up by the side of the road crying about some "huge fucking monster".
>Her cries were interpreted as those of someone in a state of  shock and hysteria, and were thus ignored.
>Your disappearance had been investigated for about a month and a half before being dropped.
>The official word that closed the investigation was that your camp had been attacked by a Black Bear, and you had been killed.
>Never-mind the fact that no traces of Bear fur were found at your camp, and Bears hadn't even been sighted in the region for the past 6 years.
>You lived on, somewhat happily, in the company of your monstrous baby-mama and your many children.
>And there you would remain.
>It could be worse, though.
>Hey, at least she didn't eat you.

THE END
