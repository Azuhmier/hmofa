>finally, I worked my ass off, and now it's all done
>I completed the ritual, collected the necessary offering, drawn out the proper summoning circle and runes complete with white candles to keep the called creature confined
>I have done this all in order to summon your very own demon
>the only thing left to do now is to call the demon's name
>Aega, I call her name
>she is a demon of secret knowledge, mainly of arcane magics
>Aega, I say once more
>according to all my research, saying a demon's name three times is the final act needed for a summoning
>taking a deep breath, I collect myself for what's to come
>Aega, I speak her name the third time
>the very moment the last syllable leaves my lips, she appears right in the middle of the summoning circle
>and by god, is she something to look at
>she is rather tall, easily standing half a foot higher than yourself
>she looks as if a goat decided to stand up on its hind legs, only where her forelegs would be, she instead has human hands
>on the top of her furry head, she has two long horns, curved just ever so slightly
>looking closer, I can see she has some nice muscle underneath her furry exterior, maybe not body builder muscle, but something nice to look at, certainly
>also, she has breasts, the nipples currently obscured by her light gray fur
>she even has those odd horizontal eyes goats have, and they are currently staring straight at me
>she looks away, gazing at her surroundings, observing the summoning circle and candles
>and she...laughs
>this demon from the bowels of hell, or the netherworld, or wherever demons actually come from
>she is called forth to this mortal realm, and the first thing she does is laugh?
>confused, I ask her what's so funny
>those sideways eyes look at me once more
>"I did not mean any insult, human. It's just been such a long time since anyone has called me."
>her voice has a strange tone to it, as if she's on the verge of breaking into a song
>"And it's certainly been a long time since a man has called me."
>nervous, I gulp down the lump in my throat, worried I may have done the ritual wrong
>after all, if even a single part of the ritual is done incorrectly, it could be seen as an affront to the demon in question, and they'd be liable to take their frustrations out on you for being so arrogant
>but instead of lashing out or attempting to walk free from the circle, Aega just stands there
>after what seems like hours, but is probably just a tense few seconds, she speaks once more
>"I see you've done everything right."
>she lets out a small chuckle
>"You even got me rum. I've been dying to have some again. You'd be surprised what you miss when you haven't had it in nearly three decades."
>upon saying this, she reaches down to the offering that had previously placed just off from the center of the circle, a generous bottle of Captain Morgan, and begins to chug it down
>not a very expensive offering, but the guidebook wasn't specific, it just said 'rum'
>deciding now is as good a time as any, I finally introduce yourself
>hearing the name, Aega stops pulling from the bottle and looks me over once more, mulling over the new information
>"Anon? Strange name. I remember a previous man by the same name who called me a few centuries ago. My, what a time that was. He wanted me to grant him all my knowledge of the magical arts. Heh, stupid man got what he wanted. But, so much knowledge all at once was too much for a human to bear, and he went positively mad."
>she began to laugh at her own story, and the rythmic movements of her chest definitely get my attention
>I was a bit distracted by her sudden laugh earlier to note it, but her breasts are glorious
>the perfect size to fit right into the palm of my hand
'bad brain, we have a demon here, we shouldn't waste this'
>clearing my throat to get her attention, she quiets and looks on in curiosity, 
>probably wondering why exactly I had called her
>and so, I ask her a very simple question
Would she like to have dinner and see a movie with me?

>she opens her mouth, then closes it without speaking
>her eyes widen as she realizes why exactly she was summoned
>then, she narrows her strange horizontal eyes at me, glaring daggers through my forehead
>"You performed the ritual, probably worked weeks on drawing the circle and runes just so, and THIS is what you want?"
Well, of course, it's always been a dream of mine to meet a demon
And she was certainly a beautiful one at that
>hearing this, she make a face as if she had just been slapped
>"I will not have my time wasted on such trivial nonsense. Now, human, either state a true wish or send me on my way."
>I steel myself for what I'm about to do
Seeing as I summoned her, it was within my right to demand anything I wished, no matter how trivial, and so long as the demon in question has the power to grant said wish, they must do it before being sent away.
>this seemed to only further irritate her
>"You insolent little insect. Have you any idea what nonsense you speak?"
>as she says this, she throws the Captain Morgan down, shattering it, causing glass and rum to fly around
>some of the rum hits one the candles, causing the flame to peter out 
>"I am a the daughter of the demon general Matelph, I command the knowledge of ancients. With a snap of my wrist, I could send your mind hurtling through untold nightmares. I could make your skin erupt in the hottest flames to ever grace this mortal plane. I could-"
She's kinda cute when she's mad.
>she stops her rant and stares at me, her jaw practically on the floor
>she stammers, trying to find the proper words for a retort
>closing her eyes, she takes a deep breath
>when she opens her eyes once more, they have an eerie golden glow
>"Summoner Anon, is this...date truly what you wish from I, Aega, demon of arcane secrets?"
It's the reason I did all this, yes.
>"Then by demonic code, I shall fulfill this desire, and in return, you shall grant me a second piece of your true name."
>true names were a tricky thing when it came to demons
>true names are more than just your birth name
>names have power, after all, and the names people know themselves by are the most important names 
>with a true name, a demon, or even a human with enough magical power, could perform all manner of spells or inflict curses on someone
>however, the funny thing about true names is that they're also hard to use with magic
>since humans are ever changing creatures, such that our minds can be swayed and our belifs malleable, performing magic with a true name is time sensitive
>after all, the John Smith of yesterday is not the exact same John Smith of today
>but still, even taking all that into account, giving one's name to a demon is about as risky as giving a gun to a monkey
>sure, they might not pull the trigger and hurt you, but they could
>I sighed and nodded, agreeing to Aega's terms
But, she wouldn't get the second piece until after the date's over.
>she scoffed and kicked a shard of glass, letting it fly outside the summoning circle
>at which point, she finally noticed one of the candles' flame had gone out
>you see, the candles are for binding a demon inside the circle
>without the candles, the demon could just walk free, probably kill the summoner and then go home
>but, since we had already finalized the contract, bound by our spoken oaths, before she had noticed the missing flame, she couldn't do anything
>had she noticed sooner, she could have left of her own accord
>she might have even made good on her threats of burning me alive and all that jazz
>thankfully, however, she never knew until now
>"Stupid candle," she muttered
>"Fine then, Anon. Your date shall commence at once. I'd prefer to be over and done with it so I may go back home."
Well, I suppose that's alright. But, she'd need to change into something less...demonic.
>she looked down at herself, running her hands down her furry body
Humans don't do too well with walking, talking animals. If she went out like that, she'd freak people out and cause a panic.
>"I see."
>she closed her eyes and snapped her fingers
>a small green shimmer enveloped her body breifly, before disapating
>"I have now placed a spell on myself. Any besides yourself who gaze upon my form will see a simple woman."
>well, that's awfully convienant
>almost like the writer is too lazy to think of something more clever
>whatever, if it means I can still see her as she is, I'm fine with it
Alright. Was she ready to go? I know a nice little place not too far from here that makes the beast burgers I've ever had.
>she tilts her head at that, her ears flopping about slightly from the movement
>"What is a burger?"
