>someone makes fun of her for having a family pic in her locker
>she turns around and immediately assumes it was you
>doesn't even give you a chance to react
>punches you straight in the face, sending you tumbling backwards
>both get dragged to the principle's office for fighting
>she explains herself first
>you tell the principle you were just punched out of nowhere and for no reason
>she realizes your voice is completely different from whoever it was that made the comment
>her now misplaced anger allows her to maintain her composure, but inside she feels really bad
>both of you get 3 days suspension
>her human dad arrives to pick her up before your parents can get you
>see her tearing up ever so slightly as she leaves
>your dad finally picks you up
>explain what happened in the car on the way home
>luckily he's pissed at the school and the bunny now rather than you
>basically get 3 vacation days
>next day while home alone the doorbell rings
>go to answer
>see that it's the bunny
>her dad is standing behind her
>open door annoyed yet curious as to why they came here
>invite them in
>sitting across from you in the living room she explains how she mistook you for someone else
>says she felt really bad for it as soon as she realized it wasn't you
>her slightly shaky voice and watery eyes let you know she's not lying
>tell her that you forgive her
>she was trying to do the right thing
>surprisingly her dad seems to be the most relieved by this
>see them out, wishing them a good day as they get in their car
>later tell your parents what happened
>now dad is mostly just pissed at the school
>finally get back to school
>realize you have a class with the bunny girl
>spend a little time chatting with her before class starts
>decide to talk more over lunch
>throughout the day your friends express their confusion at how the two of you seem to be getting along
>they sort of accept it when you explain to them what the actual situation was
>lunch time rolls around
>get your food and head into the cafeteria
>mosey around to give yourself time to find where she's sitting
>doesn't take long thanks to her huge stature
>notice she's sitting with some other bunny girls
>they're also fucking giant
>there's a white one, a brown one, and a gray one almost identical to the one who punched you
>the only way you can tell the two apart besides their clothes is how one of them always looks like she's moments away from murder
>sit down across from them and introduce yourself
>finally learn the one who punched you is named Megan
>Amanda is her identical twin
>the brown one, seemingly most normal of the bunch, is named Lisa
>and the white one, easily the most smug, is named Sally
>spend time talking about yourselves over food
>Amanda tells you that Megan's expression is mostly just a tough-guy facade, much to her chagrin
>actually having a surprisingly fun time chatting with them
>eventually Sally chimes in with a comment about how you and Megan would make a great couple, jokingly calling you the "two stone-faced lovers"
>apparently her sisters are allowed to get away with a ton more as, instead of getting pissed off, she just sits there, blushing slightly
>you smugly retort with how that would be one hell of a "how I met your mother" story, eliciting an even more embarrassed blush from Megan
>lunch is now just about over
>exchange numbers between you and the bunny sisters
>end up talking to them frequently
>surprisingly enough you talk to Megan almost every day
>eventually get to talking about more serious parts of your lives
>she tells you about how their mother died when they were just infants
>luckily she understands when you don't have any good response to give to that, being much the same way herself
>tell her about how your parents divorced when you were young
>nothing compared to losing her mother, but figured you may as well share
>your somber conversation ends when she has to go eat dinner
>meet up over a weekend just to hang out
>spend some time outdoors at a park before heading back to your house for lunch
>the two of you fix something together since your parents are asleep
>spend some more time talking over food
>head into the living room to probably watch a movie after finishing up
>end up sitting on the couch just talking for a while
>eventually you decide you want to ask her
>now is the perfect opportunity
>she's just perusing random movies
>then, you strike
>"Hey"
>her ears perk up
>"You wanna go out?"
>she puts the remote down
>then punches you in the arm
>probably gonna leave a bruise
>just as you're about to speak she wraps her arm around you and pulls you close to her
>she might as well be about to give you a noogie
>when you try to look up at her face she pulls you down farther and leans her head back to make sure your vision of her face is completely obstructed
>then you get a very cheeky idea
>"So I guess that's a no, then?"
>to your surprise, she still doesn't speak
>what you shouldn't have been surprised about is her using the arm that's wrapped around you to punch you in the other arm
>definitely gonna leave a bruise
>she then pulls you almost into a full on bear hug
>you're damn near sitting in her lap at this point
>she finally speaks
>"I oughtta punch you again."
>"What? Why?"
>"For not letting me ask you out."
>you shoulda known
>it was rigged from the start
>"You still wanna watch a movie?"
>"Sure."
>you two end up mostly just sitting there relaxing
>you have an arm wrapped around her and she's got an arm wrapped around you
>the movie is mostly just background noise, you may as well be sitting on the porch or on the bus
>eventually you part ways and she goes back to her house
>shortly after dinner
>get a text
>3, actually
>one from each of Megan's sisters
>each basically just saying congratulations and asking how it went
>give fairly vague answers since it still feels like a pretty intimate moment
>next day you get invited over to her house for dinner which they all helped their dad cook
>spend most of dinner getting prodded and teased by Megan's sisters
>mostly variations of them calling you a secret masochist, saying they knew all along, or saying they were impressed you did it before Megan did
>surprisingly little from their dad though
>not any of the stereotypical "dad meeting his daughter's boyfriend" stuff
>just before you're all about done with dinner you ask him about the lack of that
>tells you that he has great trust in his daughters and that they've had nothing but good things to say about you
>they all seem just slightly annoyed with him outing them
>you feel very flattered and can't help but smile, something which elicits reactions from them as if they've just seen a fairy
>next year
>finally a senior
>got a decent first truck from saving money
>been taking it easy in school thanks to clearing out most required classes in the previous years
>got an incredible girlfriend, though you're still jealous of how strong she is
>getting ready to go pick her up for prom
>going very early just to be absolutely safe should any obstacles come up
>in your tuxedo, dress shoes on, freshly shaven, just a bit of cologne, hair combed
>get in your truck that's almost contrasting of your attire to the point of parody
>pull out of the driveway, waving to your parents
>a few twists and turns later and you're heading down a fairly long two-lane straightaway to Megan's neighborhood
>not quite dark yet but the Sun is close to the horizon
>you see someone off to the side of the rode a ways ahead with their arm out
>oh, it's a hitchhiker
>you're surprised anyone still does that
>slowly come to a stop next to them
>realize it's actually a bunny woman
>hopefully Megan doesn't think you were cheating on her
>open the door and let her in
>your truck tilts to the side as she crawls in
>now that she's next to you you realize she's way bigger than you thought
>she's actually a fucking giant
>barely fits in your truck
>definitely even bigger than Megan
>you ask her where she's going
>she simply responds by saying she'll get out when she needs to and that she won't be a bother
>you usually didn't play music while driving for fear of getting distracted
>this just made the ride feel unnecessarily tense now that there was someone else with you
>neither of you spoke for the duration of the ride, though you were fine with this
>eventually you got to the entrance to Megan's neighborhood and the bunny woman still hadn't left
>at this point you told her you weren't able to take her any farther
>swiftly and without saying anything she got out and went and stood by the side of the road
>guess you were feeling uneasy for no reason
>you turn into the neighborhood, slowly making your way down the street
>you check your rear-view mirror and see her standing there, just waiting for another random car
>you make your way through the twists and turns of the neighborhood towards Megan's house only to realize you've hit a dead end, still not having reached her house
>well, you're still early
>you turn around and head for the entrance to the neighborhood to check the other half
>you reach the street with the 5100s
>see 5125, 27, 29, 31
>just gotta keep going til you spot 5143
>several houses down, right where the 40s should start, you see her
>but not Megan, instead it's the bunny woman from earlier
>you roll to a stop just in time to see her cross the street, straight towards 5143
