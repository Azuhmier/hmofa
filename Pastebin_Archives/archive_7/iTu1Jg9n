Behold, my apprentice! the great and powerful witch of this land has created the most, powerful potion YET Haha!"
>I thought last time was the most powerful potion". You cock an eyebrow at the hyperactive witch
>Her ears droop down at the words of your reality buzz-kill
>"Yes okay, but that didn't work, this time though-THIS WILL BE THE-"
>"the most powerful potion the world has know yes I know. You've said this a *million* times today~".
>That may sound rude and brusk but Anon and the witch have been at this for hours
>Anon and the witch have been practicing dark arts for years, Anon was like an apprentice, getting ingredients, mixing potions, the usual things
>Anon heard about a job opportunity to work alongside a powerful witch, so naturally Anon took the job offer, unfortunately, as the years passed you found out that was probably spread by her
>the witch isn't as good as she thinks she is, but you love her enthusiastic energy and her child like spirit towards chemistry and the dark arts
>Every day she tries her best and always keeps motivated
>And although you may love to be a bit sarcastic you give her motivation as well
>Today she's working on a new potion
>Apparently it's a secret that involves you
>Suddenly she pulls the "powerful potion" from the cauldron 
>"behold Anon, and see *my* potion".
>She always puts on a performance when she makes a new one >she could easily perform in the theater
>Her tounge rolls off at the end of every sentence always giving her dramatic performance
>You think she's seen too many other wizard's
>"Tis a love potion Anon!, as my apprentice: you must try it out..I mean-I can't because I'm the witch so you know-if you you'd please drink it for me~".
>She's too adorable when she wants something
>I wonder what she's playing at
>Does she think that by drinking this you'll fall in love with her?
>Even the most novice witches and anybody who uses magic knows love can't be made into a potion
>Oh well, better just play along I guess
>You take a sip from pink like gloop in the vial
>You fear the worst, but the potion tastes like water
>Wait!, It is water, she must have given you the wrong vial
>How the hell did she turn water into pink sludge?!
>That's a question for another day
>She looks at you with anticipation, clutching her witch hat tightly turning it in her hands
>You decide to have some fun with her
>"W-what's happening to me!"
>You put on your own performance for her this time
>"The potion. Working. It's, taking-over, my, whole body."
>Shatner would be proud
>"Do you love me now Anon~"
>She beams with excitement waiting for a sign of success
>That was too cute, holy shit muh heart
>You make impression of being under a spell and walk over and hold her waist close
>"I do, more than anything"
>You sound robotic to really sell it your under a spell
>It may look cruel to pretend you're in love with someone
>But you don't have to perform what you really feel
>There's a reason why you've stayed so long 
>It wasn't to become a magician
>You couldn't care less about that stuff anymore
>Just seeing her face any day was worth being a walking experiment
>The witch throws her hat down and does the same
>"Oh Anon, I'm so happy now I always loved you but I was too scared but now we-"
>She looks behind you to see the original potion on the shelf
>"Wait, how did it work, I didn't use the-"
>You lay a soft kiss on the witch, her eyes widened and left speechless
>She doesn't protest and does the same holding your head closer
>You break the passionate and hold her hands tightly
>"You casted your love spell on me years ago".
