>you've both been best friends since elementary school
>at first you didn't know why the others picked on her
>the grown-ups just said that she was different
>at first you thought it was because of her tail
>holy heck was it soft!
>you once asked her why she spoke so slow and walked funny, 
>boy was mom mad
>you just asked a question!
>Mom just said that she had something called "cereal palmsie" or something. 
>apparently she got hurt when she was still in her mommy
>when the doctors gave Cassie to her mom, she was so happy that she went to heaven
>even though she's different, you still like her
>her brown fur was really nice looking. And the fur on her face, tail, neck, and inside of her ears were a bit lighter
>her eyes were as blue as the water in the picture books mom read to you at night. 
>she's so nice, you wonder why all the other kids pick on her 
>Cassie doesn't talk that often. She doesn't want the other kids to hear her stutter. 
>she sounds nice though, you think. Like the yellow birds that come to your house right before school lets out. 
>Mom let you sign up to be her Best Buddy... even if you already were her best friend in the first place. This club must just solidify that. Weird.

>is she scared?
>"A-a-anon... I ju-just wanted to say.... say.... that I lo-love. I love you!" 
>she practically shouts it out to the world. It's cute when she tries so hard to say something that's on her mind.
