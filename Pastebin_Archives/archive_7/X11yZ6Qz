IT'S MY LIFE

>Be Anon
>You were 27, standing at a height of 5'11".
>You were just your average wagie, another nameless asshole working a soul-sucking job in a cubicle, monday through friday, nine to five.
>Currently, you were riding the bus home, on a cold and snowy Friday evening.
>It had been an exceptionally shitty day for you, even more so than it usually was.
>First off, you had been almost 30 minutes late to work after your alarm hadn't woken you up, leading you to miss the bus you usually took.
>Instead, you had been forced to call someone to drive you instead, a ride which you had to pay for.
>Next, you had spilled piping hot coffee at your desk, all over your keyboard and pants.
>In addition, you also had discovered that you'd incorrectly filed some forms the previous day, a mistake that took you nearly 2 hours to correct, and had left you stuck at the office for a lot longer than usual.
>To top everything off, your boss had told you that he needed you to come in to work Sunday. A Sunday you already had made plans for with friends.
>You tried to give him an excuse that you couldn't come in, but like usual, he didn't care. His only advice for you was to cancel your plans. What a dickhead.
>At least you had the rest of tonight and tomorrow to wind down and relax a little before you restarted this hell that was your life on Sunday.
>Seeing as it was late December, the skies had already begun to darken, the streetlights shining off of the snow collecting along the ground.
>As the city bus rushed past the streets, you stared out the window, trying to avoid eye contact with the crackhead staring at you from across the aisle.
>You weren't really looking at anything outside though. Just trying to pass the time. Too bad your phone was dead.
>When you got home to your shared apartment, all you really wanted to do was go rest in bed the rest of the night.

>Eventually, the bus reached your stop, a block away from your home.
>You stand up as you hear the hydraulic brakes hiss, not wanting to spend any more time on the hot, stinking bus. Fuck public transportation.
>Stepping off of the bus into the bitter Winter air, you begin to trudge down the sidewalk towards your home. It seems nobody had bothered salting or shoveling the sidewalk, so your socks pant-legs quickly got wet from the side-of-the-road slush. Ugh.
>Reaching your building, you walked up the steps to the front door, opening it and heading up the two flights of stairs to your apartment.
>Turning the key in the lock, you open the door, making sure to close and lock it behind you.
>You were immediately greeted by your Roommate, an Anthro Border Collie named Sarah.
>"Heya, Anon! How was work today? I see you had to stay late."
>Ugh... You liked Sarah, but work was really the last thing you wanted to think about right now.
>You just shrug, kicking your shoes off, and taking your coat and hanging it up on the wall.
>Sarah frowned, her ears folding back. There was a concerned, almost worried, look on her face.
>"You, uh... Feeling alright? Anon?"
>You nodded, telling her you were just a bit tired. It was a long day. You just felt like crawling into bed right now.
>Sarah huffs at you, walking over to where you're standing.
>Before you can react, she wrapped you in a warm hug, her fluffy fur pressing against your chilled skin as she rested her snoot on your shoulder.
>She sharply exhaled out of her nose, blowing air against your ear.
>"Sorry for asking about work, Anon... I know how you feel about your job." She said in a slightly hushed tone.
>She pulled back from the hug almost as soon as it began, her hands moving to rest on your shoulders, a smile and a twinkle in her eye.
>"Come on over to the couch, Anon. We'll play some games?" Sarah said, cocking her head at you, her ears flopping around.
>Eh... Fine. Might as well. Not like you had anything else to do.
>Sarah only smiled at you.
>"Good enough for me, Anon! Come on."
>Taking your hand in her paw, she lead you over to the couch.
>She sat you down, before heading over to your old CRT television. An old piece of shit, but a reliable piece of shit.
>Sarah bent over a bit to pop a game into your Xbox, giving you an eyeful of her wagging tail as she fiddled with the console.
>Ok, maybe it was a little cute.

>Sarah turned on the console, grabbing a controller before she plopped herself down on the sofa next to you, starting up the game.
>It's your old copy of Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition.
>You must've sunk at least 600 hours into this game. For some reason though, every play-through was still fun for you. You hadn't picked it up in a few months, though. You just hadn't really had the time or motivation.
>Sarah offered the controller to you, but you just shook your head.
>You tell her you were fine with just watching her play for now. You didn't have the willpower to play right now.
>She just tilted her head at you.
>"Oh? Well... Just speak up if you want to take over."
>Instead of picking up from your old character, some meme melee build you thought was funny, she started up a new game.
>That same cutscene you've seen hundreds of time started playing again, before putting you into the character creation screen.
>Sarah turned to you with a smile.
>"Can you help me make a character, Anon? Something good."
>Her tail kept thwapping against your waist as it wagged.
>You don't mind though. You thought it was... Cute. Kind of.
>With your help, she managed to design one of the ugliest motherfuckers you'd ever seen. Even for a Bethesda game, the dude's face looked like it got run over by a truck. Twice.
>Of course, she names it Anon.
>You looked at her with a deadpan look, but Sarah just playfully stuck her tongue out at you.
>"It's a perfect recreation of your features, if I do say so myself."
>You groaned, but she just snickered at you.
>Sarah went through that same damn tutorial, Doc Mitchell making the same jokes and showing her the same Rorschach tests. Blah blah blah.
>"I think I'm going to make a heavy guns character, Anon."
>Soon enough, she'd finished the torturous first few minutes of the game, and was thrust into the Mojave.
>But of course, the first thing she did was kill everyone in Goodsprings. Not even Easy Pete could stop her. What a monster.

>After about an hour of watching her play, Sarah handed you the controller.
>At one point you had left to change out of your work clothes, now much more comfortable in just a pair of sweatpants and an old t-shirt you usually slept in.
>"Take over for me, okay Anon? It's pretty late, so I'm gonna fix us something to eat. You stay here, okay?"
>You offer to get up and cook, only to see an expression of mock anger flash across her face.
>She pokes you in the chest with a dull claw.
>"You better stay here! Or you'll see how vicious I can be!" She tried to growl, making her best attempt at giving a comically large snarl.
>You couldn't help but smile and let out a small chuckle, crossing your arms.
>Sarah pouted, her tongue sticking out a bit as she gave you a hurt look.
>Seeing you cross your arms, she tilted her head at you. "You cold, Anon? I think it's cold in here."
>It -was- a tiny bit chilly in here, but you told her that you kind of liked the cold.
>Even though it was almost a full-blown blizzard outside, Sarah liked to keep the apartment fairly cool. She always blamed it on her winter coat of fur.
>"Here, let me get something for you. Be right back!"
>Before you could say anything, she was off, rushing into her room for a moment.
>She quickly came back holding a folded blanket, carelessly tossing it over your body.
>Sighing for a moment, you breathed in. Smells freshly laundered!
>You pulled at it so it no longer covered your head, only to see Sarah's smiling face.
>"Do you like it? One of my friends made it! As a gift for me."
>One of her friends? Wait a minute. This is a WOOL blanket... Which friend-
>"Before you ask, yes Anon, it IS made from her wool!" She said, pausing for a moment before continuing.
>"Apparently there's this one company for sheep, where if you send them a bunch of your wool, they send you back a blanket made from it! I thought it was neat, so she "made" me one..."
>While most wool blankets you'd encountered before tended to be pretty scratchy, this one was pretty soft. Surprisingly so.
>Still, it was a little weird having a blanket "made" from one of her friends.
>Whatever. You wrapped it around yourself, leaning back into the couch.
>Sarah grinned at you again, before walking into the kitchen.
>"Don't you get up, Anon! Just sit right there. I'll have dinner done for us soon. I'll make one of your favorites."
>You offer once more to help her, only to hear a less exaggerated growl come from the small kitchen across the room.
>"I SWEAR, if you come in here, and I'll howl at you! Really loud, and it'll hurt your ears!"
>Not the most evil threat, but for sure one of the cutest ones anyone has ever given you!
>You suppose you were stuck on the couch for now.
>Sarah peeks at you from the kitchen, and after making sure you're still seated, she smiled at you.
>"It should be ready in maybe 20 minutes. Oh, and don't worry, I got the dishes tonight. You owe me though, Anon!"
>She was gonna wash the dishes? She was now a saint in your eyes.

>As you sat on the couch playing Fallout, the familiar smell of one of your favorite foods drifted through the apartment.
>You could hear Sarah's claws clack against the tile floor of the kitchen as she finished preparing the food.
>Soon enough, she walks out to the couch holding two plates.
>Hell fucking yes. Kraft macaroni and cheese, and cheap boiled hot dogs. A dinner fit for a king.
>"We'll eat at the couch, Okay? I don't want to set the table."
>You put the controller down, and took a plate. A paper plate. So that's why she said she was going to do the dishes. Very very funny.
>Sarah set her plate down on the coffee table, and instead of sitting down, headed over to the TV.
>"We'll watch a movie while we eat, okay? There's nothing really good on TV right now, trust me. Anything you had in mind to watch?"
>You shook your head, telling her to just pick whatever.
>"Well, you know what I'm always gonna pick!"
>Yeah...
>Of course, she put in her favorite movie.
>Slaughter-Sphere 2.
>It came out last year, but you swear she must watch it every other week.
>You wouldn't say it's the best movie ever made like Sarah insists, but overall you'd say it's an okay flick. You gotta admit though, the practical effects are pretty kick-ass.
>Sarah sat down next to you again, setting her plate in her lap, starting to scarf down a hot dog.
>She sat close to you, her legs pressing against you through the wool blanket.
>Her eyes were glued to the screen, her big tail wagging as the opening credits began to play.
>You bite into a hot dog, the familiar and comforting flavor easing your tension.
>Oh, nice! These were the cheese-filled ones!
>You almost inhaled the rest of the hot dog, Sarah glancing at you with a pleased expression.
>"You like it? I actually managed to find them in-stock at the store. I thought this was as good a time as any to break 'em out."
>She tilted her head at you, smiling and closing her eyes.
>"Especially when my Anon needs a bit of cheering up!"
>It took you a significant amount of strength and willpower to prevent your heart from melting right then and there.

>Pretty soon, all of the macaroni and hot dogs were gone. What a shame. They were so damn good.
>Before you can even offer, Sarah grabbed the paper plates and tossed them into the trash.
>After shutting off the lights for the movie, she comes back to the couch and sits next to you.
>She pressed against you, pawing at the blanket.
>"Hey, share some blanket with me, alright?"
>She lifted up the edge and slid under it with you.
>The collie leaned against you, her soft fur tickling your arms. Her Winter coat sure came in thick this year.
>The movie rolled on, but it was clear that she wasn't really paying attention to the movie.
>Over the past few minutes, Sarah had been trying to subtly scooch closer and closer to you.
>Too bad she wasn't very good at being sneaky.
>Before long, she looked up at you with an unsure look, almost like she was debating a hard choice in her mind.
>After a couple moments, she spoke up.
>"Um, Anon?"
>You looked at her, a blank expression on your face.
>"This... Um... This might sound a bit weird, but bear with me. Please."
>"Can you... Uh..."
>She rubbed her legs together a bit, her hands tightly gripping the blanket.
>With a pleading look on her face, she managed to blurt it out.
>"Canyoupetmeabitplease?"
>What.
>If you could see her blush past all that fur, you'd bet that she would be as red as a tomato right then.
>A /devilish/ grin on your face, you asked her to repeat her request. You didn't hear her.
>She tripped over her words for a moment, but finally managed to get it out.
>"Can you please... Pet me? Just a little bit..."
>You couldn't help but smile.
>You simply nodded at her.
>An eager look on her face, she looked down a bit, presenting the top of her head to you.
>You began to gently rub and pat her head, forcing some light whines out of her.
>Instead of the blanket, her paw loosely gripped at your shirt under the blanket.
>Her snoot pressed against your shoulder as you -really- dug into her fur with your fingertips.
>You could feel her hot breath on your neck as her tongue flopped out of her mouth.
>She could do nothing but pant as you gave her the GOOD pets and scritches.
>Lewd!

>As you gently stroked and scritched her poofy fluff, she slowly made her way on top of your lap until she essentially became a second blanket for you.
>Her arms hung over your shoulders, her muzzle resting limp on your shoulder.
>You almost thought Sarah was asleep. The only thing convincing you otherwise was how her muscles will tighten and she'll gasp whenever you scratched at a new spot of her fur.
>She shakily managed to get a few words out.
>"Aghh... Thank youuuuu Anonnnnn...."
>You gave her a gentle headpat in acknowledgement, and returned to petting at her soft fur.
>Her arms shifted a bit, wrapping around your shoulders as she rubbed her muzzle against your neck, her cool nose poking you.
>She went limp, her weight dragging you down with her onto the couch cushions.
>You were trapped in between the couch and Sarah's sleeping form! A fate none can survive.
>You didn't really mind though. This was pretty comfy, if you were being honest.
>Looking at the TV, you could see that the movie is just finishing up the ending.
>Jesus, you must have pet her for nearly an hour! What did you do to this poor puppy?
>You tried moving your hand off of her head, halting the petting.
>Almost immediately, her body tensed up and a quiet whine came drifting out of her muzzle.
>Shit!
>As quick (and gently) as you could, you resumed the petting.
>Her body once again softened up, and she let out a sigh.
>In her sleep, she tucked up against you, her whole body touching yours.
>You kinda wanted to go to your own bed, but you didn't have the heart to wake her up. You never would have forgiven yourself if she did.
>Besides. You didn't think that she would mind.
>Almost like she was a mind reader, her grip on you tightened and she mumbled something imcomprehensible in her sleep. She must have been dreaming...
>Well, that settled it. There's no way you could move. It looked like you're snoozing with her on the couch.
>You didn't have to bother trying to get more comfortable. This is the comfiest you'd felt in a long time.
>Closing your eyes, you settled in.
>You breathed through your nose, able to smell her wonderful scent. You couldn't explain what exactly she smells like, but it's just pleasant in general. It must be the fur soap she used. She always bought the fancy stuff.
>It wasn't long before you could feel yourself begin to drift off, the combination of warmth, softness, and her scent making you drowsy.
>You ended up falling asleep like that, trapped in her soft, warm embrace as the movie credits roll.
