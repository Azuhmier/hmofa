Summary: Ursetta isn't the best roommate -- alright, she's the worst. She's lazy, unemployed, and has the personality of someone who has spent her life on message boards. But with rent piling up, she's gotta pay someway. You either kill her, kick her out, or find out what the third option is.

PART 1 - Death of a sales-anon

>You come home after a long day at work, desperately wanting to fall onto your couch and mindlessly watch Netflix
>The door to you apartment pops open like the unsealing of some kind of dangerous chemical storage facility
>The sour smell of weed, unwashed clothes, musty fur, sweat and farts hits you like a truck
>When you can finally stand the stench and your eyes stop burning, you look around and find your shit head roommate Ursetta, fast asleep on YOUR couch, her massive bear-paw halfway into a bag of of Doritoes, other buried in her pants
>She wasn’t the best roommate you’ve ever had
>In fact, she was the worst. She’s lazy, loud, never cleans up, takes over the whole room and-
>Well, the picture is clear enough there. You’ll just be glad when the lease is up and you can leave
>Craigslist — Never again
>The sound of you popping your leftover soup into the microwave is like a powerful magnet to Ursetta, who appears behind you as you mindlessly stare at the rotating dish in the microwave, too tired to acknowledge the massive shadow looming over you
>”Heyyy Anon, how was work, you big working man?” 
>You feel a hand travel sensually up your sides, and it makes you shiver with everything except arousal
>”Didja ‘circle back on those 119s and then innovate your blockchain e-commerce cloud?’” She can no longer keep from snickering
>You don’t dignify her ‘playful banter’ with a response. At least you have a job, you want to say
>”Awww shit, you know I’m just kidding,” she smacks you on the shoulder –- hard. You wince as the sting of her partial retracted claws catches you in the meat
“What the fuck was that for?” You turn to face her
>She’s about your height, that is, a solid 6’1” (lol manlets), so you stand even with her
>North American Brown Bear, broad, manly shoulders, arms like heavy, furry tree-trunks. The rest of her is pudgy and round, like she’d bulked up to hibernate but forgot to lose the weight afterwards
>Everything about her jiggles
>Including—
>Your eyes momentarily flick down a trail of… something leading from her collar down her chest
>Her greasy tank top, one of her only vaguely ‘feminine’ items of clothing (save for the tampon wrappers that end up all over the place) conceals her rather heavy chest, and when she laughs you can see the god damn things bounce like a trampoline
>”Just banter, scrub,” she says as she makes for the fridge
>The sound of her footsteps is likely the bane of your downstairs neighbors, who might want to know which fat ass is making all the noise
>And the ass was, is, well, fat. Meaty and thick is a better word. Her whole lower half was, a product of doing nothing but playing games and watching movies and anime all day, practically swollen with muscle and meat, but not from any sort of athletic activity — just the graces of mother nature who takes pity on chubby chasers (of which you are not).
>Her sweats, which she’s outgrown since her “dismissal” from the movie-theater strain against her thickly padded rear
“Banter is like, jokes, not beating on people. And it has to be witty,” you say, trying to restrain your tone and the urge to insult her.
>*ding*
>You take your soup from the microwave, glad for the distraction
>”That was witty. Don’t you do all that corporate stuff at work? I was doing like, satire. What real people do.”
>The sound of an energy drink being opened is like a gunshot against your eardrums
>She was going to be up all night doing god knows what, but it would probably be loud
>She lifted the bright orange can to her lips and took a loud, exaggerated sip, locking eyes with you
>She winked playfully, trying to keep herself from laughing as she ramped up the volume on her ‘lewd noises’
>And that’s the thing that bugs you the most: She’s always ‘playfully harassing you,’ talking about humans and their cocks and how all the girls on her… what is it, her Burmese Shadow Puppet Symposium on the computer are all jealous that she gets to live with a human
>She even jokingly said she could get a few girls to buy your underwear “because human junk is a hot commodity, and your dickjuice is worth more than all the oil in The Middle East
>After that you marked all of your underwear (and socks) with a sharpie so you’d know if any went missing. You’ve kept a running tally for months
>Nothing’s gone
>Yet.

>She was still slurping, except taking her time
>Oh fuck off you lazy bitch
”Hey, so how’d the job search go today. Any luck?” You ask
>She shakes her head and finally puts down the can
>”I took today off from that. There was this anime that premiered today that I wanted to torrent. I got it on the network drive if you wanna watch it with me,”
>You stirred your soup casually. You were far more petty than she could comprehend
>”You know rent is due at the end of the month, right?” >The sound of her nervous scratching fills the meager kitchen
>When Ursetta got nervous she did this thing where she’d stick her hands down the back of her pants and scratch her ass like nobody was going to pay attention to it
>Kind of like those people who pick their nose mid conversation like it’s nothing
>That, or maybe Ursetta had a rash
>Oh god, she probably hasn’t bathed in awhile. You don’t want to think about down there
>”I know rent is coming up… I was looking yesterday but since I can’t drive, it’s hard to find things that are nearby,”
“I’m not trying to be a dick (lol yes I am) but you do need to find something. What about your degree?”
>”Japanese Language Degrees aren’t selling right now apparently, but hey at least I can read some manga without translations.”
>She finishes scratching her ass, her goldfish attention span is somewhere else
>”Aha!” her voice, heavy as lead, booms in the small kitchen “You think I could be a good prostitute?”
>You practically spit out your soup
“What the fuck kind of question is that?” >She starts laughing, pleased with your reaction
>Your amalgamation of disgust and fear only serves to spurn her onward 
>”Or maybe I’m an ‘escort,’ one of those high-class whores that rich men buy.”
>Okay, she’s obviously not taking this whole thing seriously at all
>Typical Ursetta, hiding a serious issue behind humor. You roll your eyes
”Don’t flatter yourself. Besides, I have no idea where bear’s rank in the hierarchy of ‘anthro hookers,’ but I don’t think it’s at the top.”
>”Yeah, but I bet all kinds of perverted people want a woman like me. And humans have a lot of cash. Get that inter-species kink crowd. Then I’m rolling in green.”
“A woman like you?” >”Yeah, THICCCC,” She playfully jiggles her own breasts, laughing like a kid with a toy
>You swear to god she may as well be a dude with a vagina
>”All the people on the internet say that being thick is what’s popular with guys now, so I can pull that off easy.”
>You lean against the counter and set down your bowl
“Are you seriously considering this?” >Another gale of heavy, dumb laughter escapes her, rumbling the kitchen. You brace the cabinets
>”Hell no, I’m not gonna be a slut! I bet I could be a voice actress for anime dubs or something though-”
“Yeah, wouldn’t work. Not like you’ve got any experience anyway,” you jab. “You sound like a dying bovine.”
>She scowls
>”What’s that supposed to mean?”
>You’re feeling a little aggressive tonight, or it’s just hot in here.
>Might be the heat of the place, she always cranks it up HOT. You feel a little pissy
“I’m just saying I’ve never heard you talk about a boyfriend before, and I’ve never seen you have anyone else over here,”
>She takes a heavy step forward
>”Just because I don’t have a boyfriend doesn’t mean I don’t have ‘experience.’ I’ve done lots of stuff!” She counters
>It’s obvious by where her hand is that you’ve struck a nerve
>You smirk, because now it’s your turn to step over the lines
>Oh man, you are gonna smear these lines like you shoulda done a long time ago
“Just because you got a really good dildo doesn’t mean you’ve got experience with anything,”
>Oof
>You can see the blood hitting the inside of her cheeks despite her thick, unkempt fur
>She’s steadily acquiring an unhealthy, pinkish-red glow
>”W-Well just because I own a dildo doesn’t mean I don’t have sexual experience! Lots of women these days have sex toys and they aren’t afraid to show it,”
>Go in for the kill, Anon. Put this chubby bitch in her place “I think you’re just saying that because you’re embarrassed. If you saw a dick that wasn’t purple and made of silicone you wouldn’t know what to do with it,”
>”Yes I would, I totally would- I mean, I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH DICKS!”
“Bullshit,”
>”Fuck you, I can prove it!”
>What
“What did you just say?”
>Her entire spine stiffens as her eyes go wide, and the look of someone who wishes they could catch the words out of the air freezes on her face
>There’s an awkward pause, and you hope the conversation ends right here
>It doesn’t
>Why can’t she read the room?
>”T-That’s right, I’ll p-prove it!” she says, trying to sound confident, which would honestly look a lot better if she wasn’t blushing hard and stammering, and of course scratching her ass AGAIN
>Your heart leaps off your ribcage
>And lands right in your groin
>She’ll ‘prove it?’ Does that mean what you think it means?
>No anon, no, don’t think with your dick, don’t call her bluff
>You don’t want this, you don’t want this dra-
“How are you going to ‘prove it’?”
>You are literally trash anon, fucking trash man garbage person
>”….”
>She keeps her gaze fixed on the television in the living-room, unable to look you in the eyes, but her stuttered, heavy breathing says it all
>So much for all that teasing and groping and faux confidence
>”You really want me to show you?”
>No, no, no, no, no, no
“I mean, if you want… I’m just fucking around though.”
>Your two heads are now fighting for the controls of your mouth, and the larger of the two is clearly losing
>”Take off your pants,”
“Uhhhh,”
>”Just… Just take off your pants and don’t make this weird.”
“This is already weird!” Your mind makes one, final, desperate lunge at saving you from forever having an awkward roommate situation
>The sound of your hands undoing your belt and Ursetta’s deep, ragged breathing fills the room
>You are trash
>The sound of tinkling metal as your belt slips down, then the button on your slacks, then your zipper, draws her attention like a cat to a lazer pointer
>Is that speciest?
>Who cares
>You stand in the kitchen in your boxers, pants around your ankles
>”You actually did it,” she mutters, hot in the face. “What the fuck?”
>You swear you can see her sweating underneath all that fur
>”I guess I should…Well do that thing, right?”
>That thing?
>She apprehensively walks towards you
>LAST CHANCE ANON PULL ‘EM UP NOW HURR-
>She drops onto her knees with a tremendous crash, eye level with your junk
>You don’t know what to do with your hands right now. You never know what to do with them during blowjobs except put them on top of a girl’s head when she’s sucking
>Only, Ursetta is just… sitting there, unsure of herself
“You okay?” >She draws in deep, ragged breaths
>”Fine, fine. Just a bit of a head-rush down here is all,” she says through gasps. ”I feel all tingly.”
“You really don’t have to do this if you don’t want-”
>”Hooo boy,” she lets out a slight moan, breathing hard. “It is MUSKY down here haha. When was the last time you showered?” she tries laughing off her obvious apprehension
“Ursetta, wait, you really don’t have to do this,”
>SO PULL YOUR PANTS UP ANON QUIT BEING BOTH A LIAR AND A TRASH MAN
>She slips her fingers under the waistband of your underwear and pulls down
>”No, no-” she sucks in a deep breath, “It’s fine. I said I would do this. Besides I have to take responsibility right? Heh. Heheheh.”
>Your dick bounces free practically flopping right into her face
>She continues verbally shitposting
>She gives your dick a few exploratory squeezes and pokes like it’s some kind of alien life-form
>Her breath is really hot on your inner-thighs, and despite the fact that it’s your fucking slob roommate, your dick is already starting to swell with blood
>You’re getting impatient though
“You having fun down there?”
>”Jesus don’t be in such a hurry, alright?”
“Hey, you’re the expert on dicks here, is this part of your technique or something?”
>She pauses and clears her throat, her pathetic gaze can barely match your intentional stare as you catch each other’s eyes
>”A-As a matter of fact, yes, it is,” she says, and then mumbles something about hentai making it look easy
>You shut your eyes and try to block out all the voices in your head, screaming at you to stop because this is too weird
>You didn’t even really like Ursetta, but somehow you got her to suck you off? Were you that desperate? Or was she?
>Her massive, awkward hands grip the length of your shaft and clamp down HARD, trying to mimic some weird pumping motion she probably saw in porn
>Is she trying to strangle your dick?
>Those voices in your head get louder as she continues literally choking your cock
>You could have just done this yourself, this is going to make everything so weird from now o-
>You practically keel over as Ursetta puts the entire length of your dick – from the tip to the base of your shaft – right in her mouth
>It fits wayyy down her throat with impressive ease, but in the process she scrapes you across her razor-sharp teeth
>You stifle an existential screech
>For stability, you Michael Jordan-grip her head with both hands and squeeze as hard as you can
>Quickly she pulls back, once again grazing your shaft
>She leaves your dick hanging stiff, huge gobs of bear-spit literally dripping off of it in the way that syrup drips off a tall stack of pancakes
“Christ I think you bit me,” you moan, searching your most intimate parts for any blood
>”Sorry,” she grumbles, once again approaching your dick with some hesitation
“I thought you said you’ve done this before?”
>”I have,” she pouts, her voice falling to a whisper as she kung-fu grips your dick once more. 
>“It’s just been awhile,”
“CLEARLY!”
>You can’t tell if she’s now doing this on purpose or not anymore. A very dark part of you wants to just ram your cock down her neck and fuck her face, but you’re now almost certain this is her first time with a real, actual cock, and that might put her off from dicks for good
>So you tell her to relax her grip a little bit and just stroke it very slowly
>She does as you say
>Now, that’s a lot nicer and smoother
>The slick sound of her hand gliding up and down, combined with the small little jolts of electric pleasure traveling up and down your groin make you moan ever so slightly
>Her face perks up
>”See? I told you I’ve done this before! I just needed a little warm up!” she says proudly
>Her jaw practically unhinges, and as you look down, all you can see are the razor-sharp coffee-stained teeth coming down uncomfortably close to your dick
“STOP!” You yell, as if your life depended on it
>Well, it kind of did. You’d kill yourself if you didn’t have your dick
>She looks up at you, her mouth still a gaping hole of frothy-thick saliva and dagger-teeth
>”No?” she slurs, her fat pink tongue lopping out of her mouth like it’s been hit with novacaine
“Don’t go all in like that at first. You need to take it slower. Just try...” fuck, how do you phrase this? You’re already kind of uncomfortable
>You take a few deep breaths. How are you still hard through all of this? Normally nerves get you
“Try licking it at first, okay?”
>”Just licking it? Like that’s it?” “That’s all for now. If you don’t know what you’re doing, just start with that,”
>You sigh in relief as her mouth clamps shut without your dick between her jaws
>She looks somewhat hurt, and you can hear her scratching her ass-cheeks again
>”I knew that, o-obviously,” she mutters. “It’s just so… I don’t know… down here everything makes my head feel fuzzy. I feel like I’m drunk or high or something,”
>”You didn’t drug me to get me to suck you off, right anon?” She’s laughing as she breaks into a good stroking rhythm, eyeing your crotch like some kind of plump turkey
>Why would you joke about that? Is she actually drunk right now?
“Urs, don’t ever joke about that. Especially right now.”
>She continues babbling, completely unaware
>”Because that’s so lewd and raunchy. I bet you wanted to get me all drunk and out of my mind so you could force yourself on me. Well luckily for you I’m just so nice I’ll do it sober!”
>You open your mouth to speak, but she silences you by very deliberately dragging her slick tongue all the way up from the base of your shaft to your head
>”Hehe,” her head lulls from side to side “Senpai your ‘thing’ is all leaky, fufu~~”
>She smacks her lips loudly a few times, savoring your… flavor…
>”Cocks,” 
>She savors a dollop of pre-cum dripping from your tip, moaning when it hits her tongue
>The feeling is electric and you can’t help but coo ever so slightly
>”I’m cock drunk,” she giggles. “This is so lewd,”
“Please don’t do the anime stuff right now, okay?”
>She doesn’t hear you or acknowledge you
>You grab her pudgy cheeks somewhat forcefully and force her to look up at you
>Good god her skin is hot
>Should you be worried about her? Is she taking her estrus medicine?
>You should call the doctor, or the vet, or…
>She’s panting with need, her eyes glazed over with lust
>You… really want to be inside her mouth right now

>Thankfully the larger of your two heads prevails, and you DON’T destroy her face
“Listen. Just keep going like that, okay?” >She blinks a few times, a million miles away
“Are you listening to me?” You snap your fingers >She nods, but you think that’s just her trying to get back between your legs
>You let her go and she nearly collapses, head still swimming
>Yet she’s giggling ever so slightly, like some sorority girl that’s obnoxiously drunk for the first time
>”I wonder what these taste like?” she says to herself. She hunches down a little lower and presses her mouth against the underside of your balls
>First is an exploratory lick, which makes you stiffen up and shiver
>Then it’s a good, long slurp. Not too strong, but not too light
>She spends a good portion deeply lapping at your ballsack, rolling your nuts around with her tongue
>You need to stop her sometimes and tell her to be lighter, but she’s picking this whole thing up pretty fast
>She does long, slow, deliberate passes until your balls are practically dripping with spit
>”You taste salty Anon. You should shower more.”
“Hey, I-” >”It’s just banter,” she croons “I want you to shower less from now on.”
>You grit your teeth and lightly press the back of her head deeper between your legs
“Just stop talking for awhile, okay?”
>She lets out a happy sigh and does exactly as she’s told
>It’s almost like she enjoys how your leaking cock is resting on her snout, trailing precum across her face as she worships your nuts
>Now it’s more appropriate to moan, and you do, letting her know that you appreciate her rather delicate ministrations
>Her mouth travels a little further up until she’s slowly working her tongue around you base of your shaft and up
>The feeling is actually pretty nice. You don’t have to think a whole lot, just shut your eyes and feel her tongue
>Feelsgoodman
>After a few minutes of having your nuts spitshined you start to get antsty and desperate
>You want more than just her slobbering all over your knob
“Urs, stop for a second.”
>She unhappily obliges, looking kind of pouty
>”You seemed to be liking it, so what gives?” Her head goes back in for more, but you stop her with a gentle palm against her snout
“It felt fine, but I want you to suck on it now.”
>The biggest, stupidest grin spreads across her face
>”OKAY!” she yells, far, too loud for your neighbors to not be unwilling voyer fetishists
>Her jaw flies open, as if ready to take a huge bite out of your crotch
“HOOOLLD ON!”
>She scowls
>”Lheh Mheh shuchk yerr chohc fahg”
“Slow down or you’re going to bite my dick off. Keep teeth AWAY from the dick. Got it?”
>Her eyebrows narrow and she focuses her attention back on your dick >”Dhont theat meh lhike suhm mhoron,” she mutters
>Whatever, you’d rather insult her than endure a blowjob from her shark mouth
>She wraps her lips around the tip, her tongue swirling up and down slowly over the sensitive glans
“Gooood. Now, you gotta like, ‘suck’ on it, like it’s candy or something.”
>Her confused stare says everything her occupied mouth can’t
>”Well I’ve never sucked a dick before, but that’s how you’re supposed to do it,”
>She narrows her focus down the length of your shaft, pulls in a deep breath through her snout, and-
>SCHLOOMP
>Teeth
>TEETH
“URS, TEETH!” you cry
>Delicately, she lowers her jaw and adjusts the vacuum seal she has around the tip of your cock
>her cheeks fill outward a little bit like sh’e puffing on a cigar
“That’s- That’s better. Just keep it right there.”
>And that’s what she does, just suckles on the tip
>She lets out a tiny whimper, which brings your attention down between her legs
>Her free hand is working unseen underneath her sweats
>You don’t need to be some kind of sex god to know what she’s doing
“Are you masturbating? Like right now?”
>She releases her vice on your dick
>”Whatttt? I can’t help it right now!”
>Well, you’ve walked in on her doing worse before
>But that’s because she was flickin’ the bean in the living room
>ON YOUR COUCH
“No,” you say breathlessly. Your cock is throbbing with need. Every thought you have right now is about release. “Keep going. Just… Do what you have to do.”
>She wraps her lips around your tip again, savoring your precum
>Her eyes flutter shut, like some kind of cock connoisseur
>You instruct her to slowly take you in and out of her mouth, going deeper each time
>Every centimeter she pulls into her mouth makes you shive
>Her hot, wet mouth wrapped around your dick, her tongue practically washing your cock, the sound of her whimpering and moaning as she gets herself off-
>Damn, this is nice
>She’s really getting into it too, gagging a little as she approaches the base
>Her mouth widens, and though you think she might be uncomfortable, the feel, taste and smell of REAL dick outweighs her discomfort
>Through your owned desperate whimpers, you tell her now pull her head back
“Slowly,”
>She humus in acknowledgment
>Her mouth caresses your dick as she slides you out of your mouth
>Fuck, she’s good at this. You swear she’s trying to suck your whole crotch off
>With an audible *POP* your dick comes free, though it looks like a glazed eclair 
>Ursetta breathes heavily, her chest heaving as she glances up at you
>”W-Was that good?” “Oh fuck yes.” You place your palm on the back of her head
“Do it again. Except a little faster.”
>She happily obliges, easily swallowing your cock, but taking some time to adjust her mouth a little as she gets closer to the base
>When she finally bottoms out, you can hear her pick up the pace with her own little session, her gags and moans melding into some unholy grumble
>Again she drags her mouth up the length of your shaft
>And then back down
>And up
>And down
>Each time, her surprisingly nimble tongue slips under and over your shaft, milking it for all its worth
>She takes to cock like a fish takes to water
>Her eyes squeeze tighter than before, and you hear her frantic whimpering as she works herself closer to orgasm
>She pauses in her routine, leaving you desperately wanting more
>Well fuck that, you’re not going to let her cum before you do
>With one hand, you grab her by the wrist
>With the other, you pull her own hand out of her pants
>”Hhehy!” She protests, her mouth overflowing with spit and precum
>Man it feels good to be mean to her. She honestly deserved it
>But you could lose your dick right now
>This was a stupid, horny gamble
>You thrust forward before she can chomp down
>Her eyes thrust open and the sound of a stifled gag erupts around your cock, spewing little gobs of spit into your thighs
>She looks up to you, her eyes the color of honey, cheeks scoured crimson
>There’s something in those eyes between ‘please let me cum’ and ‘please use my mouth’
>You think she’ll get the idea if you ‘show her’
>You tightly squeeze her wrists, holding her up like she’s some kind of marionette
>Or bobblehead
>You piston your crotch forward and pine for more real-estate in her mouth, which she happily obliges
>Then you slide back
>And forth
>Spit puddles beneath you on the dirty floor
>Or is that her own juices?
>Her eyes roll back as you pump her mouth, feeling soft cheeks collapse around you like a velvet glove
>God this feels good, and every time you get all the way down to the base, she makes a satisfied little grunt
>Her thighs squeeze and work themselves together
>That horny bitch is actually enjoying this
>Well, you are too. It feels good
>Like, really fucking good
>Soon you’ve worked yourself up to an exhausting pace as you pound into her mouth
>Your balls slap against her chin, but neither you nor her care
>She’s just happy to have you slipping up and down the back of her throat
>The faster you go, the louder she grunts, the faster her thighs work together
>And shit, she can grunt loud
>Feeling her throat vibrate with pleasure feels great as you smear your precum against the back of her neck
>You can’t believe she can get off hands-free
>The feeling of electricity is back, the steady tingle of an orgasm builds inside your tight balls
>Man, this is going to be messy, but you think she might like that
>You know you’re going to like making a complete mess of her maw
>You thrust with wild abandon, savoring every little inch of her hot mouth, every feral grunt and moan she tries working out around your throbbing cock
>Her sultry moans reach an apex as you bottom out again, your orgasm hitting you like a fucking wall
>In unison, the two of you climax
“FUCCCK!” you groan into the sky
>You can physically feel her pulling at your spasming cock, greedily sucking out as much of your hot load as her stomach can handle
>Her eyes practically explode open when she feels her own cunt spasm
>You can’t stop yourself from rocking back and forth against her tongue, emptying your swollen, sticky nuts down her throat
>You start to pull back, but she’s fighting and whimpering, trying to keep you from pulling out, desperately trying to ride out her own cunt-shattering orgasm with you still pulsing and pumping inside of her
>All this accomplishes is you dumping more of your cum onto her tongue,
>If she could scream from own orgasm, she would, but thankfully you’ve got that hole shut
>The neighbors probably thank you too
>In the shivering aftermath, you’re hunched over her face, and she’s limp from her crushing climax, hanging in your grasp like a ragdoll, held up only by your iron grip on her skull
>You drag your dick from her mouth
>She uses the last of her strength the keep her jaw wide enough not to graze you, but you can tell she’s spent
>Cum and spit dribble from her mouth and onto the sizable puddle on the floor
>Her entire muzzle is sticky, thick gossamer threads of spit and cum slop down her chin
>You have to grip the counter for support, your legs trembling
>As if reflexively, Ursetta’s eyes shut, and she greedily swallows what you left her in mouth
>The acrid taste makes her cough
>”You,” she huffs, still trying to keep upright. “You taste like,” she swallows again, her throat sore from being pounded. “You taste like fish,”
>Your head is swimming, so the awkwardness of that statement does not hit you like it should.
>That was…
“That was… really good. Thank you,” you stammer. You don’t want to put on pants right now. Your entire crotch is soaked. You just want to shower
>All you want to do is be clean, and just kind of… take in what just happened
>”Your welcome,” Ursetta’s palms slap against the tile as she tries to right herself on shaky arms. “I really liked that,”
>You maneuver into a chair, legs still trembling from adrenaline (and mounting shame)
>Ursetta defeatedly crawls onto her side, and is perfectly content to just lay there, breathing deep…
>Licking her chops
>Ew
>You look around in a post-orgasm daze
>The weirdness of what just happened hasn’t quite hit you yet
>But the smell has
>It smells like unwashed bodies, sweat and the bleachy stink of cum
>You unbutton your dress shirt and undo your tie
>Your inner thighs, especially your cock, look like a tsunami had just receded and left behind an ecological disaster in its wake
>You REALLY want to shower
>Your eyes travel around the kitchen and settle on your large roommate, laying on her side, trying to catch her breath
>She rolls on to her back, her heavy breasts like mountains on her wide frame
>You can see her erect nipples straining against the greasy fabric of her tank-top
>She wasn’t wearing a bra the whole time? >Not staring is hard
>And you entertain the idea of grabbing a handful of tit, but the smell of her unwashed sex practically kills your budding erection
>She isn’t saying anything, but she looks happily spent
>But she smells so…god…
>Should you-
>…
>…Redeem yourself?
“Hey, Urs. Wanna take a shower with me?”

PART 2 - The Mess We Made
>Mistakes were made

>You two end up in the small bathroom together, not saying anything as you strip down
>The bathroom quickly fills up with steam as the shower runs
>You’re naked and tired and feeling kind of gross
>Ursetta is still ‘dressed’ (if you could call her daily attire ‘getting dressed’)
>”Nice body, twink,” she tries to get a playful jab in to break the awkward silence  
“Hey, at least I actually got undressed,” you say, jabbing a finger into her padded tummy
>She recoils against your finger, which you didn’t really expect
>She’s always so obnoxiously touchy feely with you that you’d have never guessed she’d get bashful when you try it on her
>”I’m getting undressed, just gimme a second,” she huffs
“Weird, I woulda thought you’d be jumping to get undressed the minute you could.”
>She chucks her shirt at your face
>”Shut up bitch.”
>You pull her disgusting shirt from your face and blush — which you didn’t think was possible with her
>She’s bent-over, just starting to undress
>Her breasts hang nicely from her wide chest, heavy and succulent
>She really is stacked up there
>Nice
>Her sweats come down, and you finally get to see where she puts all of those chips and pizzas
>Right down in her hips, thighs, and chubby ass-cheeks
>You hate to admit It, but she has a decent body
>Her heavy, manlike shoulders clearly serve to support her heaving breasts, and the way that her wide waistline narrows out at her hips (which push just a touch against her fatty midsection)
>And then there’s her thunder thighs, which obviously fit well with her nicely padded rear, leaving only a small gap between her legs for her clothed sex to breathe
>You’re about to give her a compliment when she slips her panties from around her waist 
>Are they supposed to be stained yellow? 
>Oh
>Well, that kind of killed your remaining libido
>She catches you staring and smirks
>”See? I’m THICCCCCCCCCC-“
>Her breath hits your nose
>Oh god
>You can taste it
>The whole bathroom is starting to smell like fish

>You suggest taking turns in the bathroom, but she’s not having it, and pretty soon you’re squeezed uncomfortably close together in your tiny ass shower, sharing a thin stream of hot water
>She’s- Well, she’s soft, and her fur is oddly comforting against your chest
>But that’s not overriding your barely restrained disgust
>You work yourself over with body wash, mercifully sighing as its minty-fresh scent hits your olfactory senses
>Ursetta hums like some kind of pervert
>You can feel her hips pressing against, grinding, trying (in vain) to wretch another erection from you
>Her tongue slips out of her mouth, and she locks eyes with you
>”I wish I was like an Amazon or something, so I could be taller than you,” she laughs
“Stop,” you say, trying hard to conceal your anger
>Boy the afterglow didn’t last long. All it took was one sentence from her
>Now that you’ve gone this far with her, what does she expect? >What kind of perverted, awkward beast have you unleashed upon the world? Your hand holds the chain, and you let slip the bear of lust
>You continue washing yourself, at least that feels good
>It almost feels like the shame of 10 minutes ago is spinning down the (nearly) clogged drain
>You REALLY gotta make her undo that, it’s her fucking fur down there
>You try to reach behind her for your shampoo, but she takes this as her cue to grab your head and force you against her chest
>”Oh Anon, I was just waiting for you to make your move. I knew you were just some human pervert trying to take advantage of a gorgeous young anthro like me!”
>She laughs so hard it hurts your ears
>You struggle, but her bear strength is impressive
>Is she trying to rape you, or is she just playing around?
>Wait, wouldn’t that still be rape?
>OH GOD WHAT IF SHE ACTUALLY RAPES YOU
>You slap her back and she lets you out from between her tits
>Humid air fills your lungs
“Don’t do that! Jesus Urs!” You gasp loudly. “I thought I was gonna die!”
>She laughs a little bit more, obviously she’s got what she wanted. Some anime-esque reaction out of you. She probably saw this scene in some dumb show she watched
>”I was just playing around. Don’t be such a baby.”
“Don’t wanna hear it right now. Just hand me my shampoo,”
>Fuck her, she’s gonna get the silent treatment after this. You’re regretting that blowjob already
>If this is how she’s going to act you’re just gonna steer clear of her until the end of the month and keep jerking off into tissues
>She turns around, trying to find your shampoo among her many empty bottles of shampoo and conditioner
>Naturally your eyes are drawn to her thick butt
>Damnit, why are you like this?
>It’s wide on her frame, but nicely rounded, and it’s further accentuated by her broad hips (which are straining to be relevant against her ‘love’handles
>A mental picture of you slapping her ass and watching it jiggle pops into your head
“No, no, no, stop that!”
>She shoots a glance over her shoulder
>”You want me to stop?”
>Fuck, snap out of it
“No, you keep going. That was nothing. Just- It’s right there, in the white bottle,”
>She bends over slightly to pick up the shampoo, and now you want to spread her fat ass apart and pound her ass into oblivion, hoping it hurts her
“Damn she’d probably like that though,” you mutter
>Her ears twitch, and you shudder as you remember how sensitive her hearing is
>”W-What?” She stammers, her confidence deflating quickly like a sad balloon
“NOTHING! Hand me the shampoo!” You cry
>God this needs to end quick
>You keep your mouth shut this time though, having learned a bit more about your impulses
>Except for one
>Your cock is already at full-mast, jutting proudly into the air, just inches away from grazing Ursetta
>You spin around quickly and face the oncoming stream of water, briefly considering turning it from scalding hot to iceberg cold
>Just try not to think about it and it’ll go away
>Stay focused
>Stay shar-
>You feel something large and plastic poking at your ass-cheek
>”Hey little twink. Das right, I’m talking to yous. Gonna make you my bitch tonight,” Ursetta says, dawning the heaviest, manliest voice she can
>Annnd suddenly your boner is going limp
>Thanks Urs
>This girl is something else, you swear
>The shampoo falls against the shower floor
>Ursetta’s back in your ear, and you can practically hear her restraining her stupid, childish smirk
>”Uh-oh Anon, looks like you dropped the soap.”
>She pauses for dramatic effect
>”Go on. Pick it up.”
>You sigh loudly and turn around, robbing her of the satisfaction of groping you or something
>”Hey, that’s not how it works,” she complains
“Well, this isn’t prison, so,”
>”THIS APARTMENT IS A PRISIONNNNNN!” She yells, exaggerating her anguish and following up with her annoying laughter
>You open the bottle, ignoring her, and try to squeeze some shampoo into your palm
>It feels – and sounds – empty
“Why is this empty? This shouldn’t be empty.”
>”Oh, right. I use your shampoo sometimes,” Ursetta says, working some bodywash – your bodywash – into a rich lather across her chest and stomach
“Sometimes? When is that?” >She shrugs
>”Only when I’m out of my stuff,”
>She’s been out for what looks like MONTHS!
>You groan. All the thoughts of you NOT escalating the sexual stuff shatter, and are again replaced by you hate fucking her IN THE ASS >She just keeps washing herself, blissfully unable to read the anger in your posture or facial expressions
>She belches loudly and smacks her lips
>”That tasted like cum,” she says, her face screwing up with disgust and then delight. “That’s a taste I’ll have to get used to. You know what they never talk about in porn? Cum burps. I bet that’s some people’s fetish somewhere.”
>If you had a time machine, you would be stuck between going back in time and killing yourself, or going back in time and smothering her to death as a cub

>At least you feel clean(er) after the shower
>Plus you’ve got your own towel, so Ursetta just stands in the foggy bathroom, shivering, her damp fur knotting up
>She needs a trim, badly
”Damn, when was the last time you went to the groomers?” You ask delicately
>She clutches herself, trying to wipe the water out of her masculine-smelling coat
>”If I get a big job interview, I’m gonna go right before. Especially if my boss is a male. It’ll help my job prospects.”
“Right. Well, we should probably talk about your job prospects after this, or when you’re done living in a porno,”
>”NEVER!” She roars, trying to sound ironically cavalier, but it’s not going over well
>You don’t let her ‘borrow’ your towel either when she asks
>At least she doesn’t smell anymore, so some good has come (no pun intended) out of this

>With you changed into your pajamas, and her into ‘fresher’ looking sweats, you sit her down at the kitchen table and tell her that you honestly can’t afford to cover her rent this month
>Which was partially true
>You MIGHT be able to, but you didn’t want to
“And the thing in the uhhh, kitchen… We should talk about that too.”
>”Yeah, about how much fun it was?”
“That’s not where I was gonna go with that-”
>Her fingers creep across the table
>”Don’t lie anon, you loved it. I’d show you the proof but I already swallowed it all,”
>Wow
>What the fuck is wrong with this girl? >To top it all off she even tries an awkward wink, but she can’t get it right so her eye only goes halfway shut
“I’m not saying I didn’t enjoy it, I’m saying that we need to stop doing this stuff. We can’t fool around. You need a job.” >”I can be a prostitute, or a cam model”
>”No, a real job! Like, flipping burgers or something. Fuck. No fooling around.”
>“Well, maybe I can ‘pay my rent’ in some other ways?”
>She tries rubbing your leg with her feet but ends up stroking a table leg instead
>You couldn’t be more unamused right now — a facet she can’t read on your stabbing gaze
“Urs, how much porn do you watch? Honestly. Be serious with me here for one second.” >She coughs a little, nervously, hand already going behind her back
>The chair squeals in protest as she shifts awkwardly
>”I was being kinddd of seriousss with you. But I’m gonna look for a job. I need one anyway,”
“Thank you,” you sigh
>You’re tired, eyes as heavy as water
>You get up to leave, the old chair screeching against the kitchen floor
>”Anon, hang on,” Ursetta’s voice squeaks after your
>Do you dare turn to give this perverted bear another moment of your time? You need to sleep, or kill a fifth of vodka, or something to forget all this
>”Was it… the blowjob?” “What?” >”Was it good?” she coughs a little, trying to hide her shaking voice
“You really wanna know?”
>”I mean, kind of? It was my first ever. I liked it, so I just want to know if you-”
“Yes. It was good. It was REALLY good. But we can’t do that again. I want this to stop here, got it?” >”You liked it?” Her face brightens as she tunes out everything you say afterwards
“Yeah, you’re surprisingly good for an amateur. Now did you hear what I said?”
>”Yeah, I did!” She says, her voice as sugary and as pleased as punch. “Night anon!”
“Good. One more thing,” you pause, halfway between the kitchen and the living-room. “I’m having a few friends over tomorrow night. Do you think you could clean up the living-room a bit?”
>”Friends What kind of friends?”
“Just… They’re my friends, okay? So could you clean up?
>”Yeah, definitely!” she bobs her head
“And maybe go see a movie?”
>”With you and your friends? What kind of movie? You guys gonna watch some porn?” “What? No. Just- Aw forget it. We’ll talk about this tomorrow. But clean the living room, okay?”
>”ANYTHING FOR YOU DADDY!” She calls after you
>Your head hangs sadly and ashamedly — just like your dick right now
>You let THAT blow you
>Are you proud?
>You shuffle to your bedroom, defeated, achy, clean, yet feeling incredibly satisfied
>Unfortunately, she really knows how to suck a cock

>A few hours later you wake up to take a piss
>You’re only half awake, but you surprisingly she’s not camped out in the living room 
>Instead you can hear her hacking away loudly and frantically on her computer in her own room, keys slamming with the ferocity of 10 million smug keyboard warriors
>Nothing good can come of this

>You wake up to find the living-room is somewhat cleaner
>She’s tossed her energy drink cans and pizza boxes, cleaned up the coffee table a little bit, arranged the controllers to look ‘neat’ (as in all four lined up evenly)
>And that’s probably as good as it’s gonna get
>You brush, shave, shower, and head out to run some errands
>Ursetta is nowhere to be seen, probably locked away in her den, judging by the sound of her loudly snoring
>With the day off from work, you check in with your pals. All three of them, Jake, Ryan and Keith, all humans, are still down to hang out at your place and eat pizza and play some vidya
>Fuck yeah
>You hit the store, then the liquor store, and then break for home
>When you come back, Ursetta is… wait, is she actually in the shower?
>Well, joke’s on her, you bought more shampoo, conditioner, and body wash at the store and you’re gonna keep it in your room from now on
>You set a few tally marks on your bottles and head to the kitchen

>You’re setting things up in the kitchen and the living room when your roommate finally emerges from the shower, a crusty orange towel stretched across her chest
>”Oh, Anon, you’re back!”
>She sounds pretty happy
>”Aren’t your friends supposed to be over by now?” >You try not to pay her too much attention
“Yeah, in a little bit. You remember Jake and Ryan and Keith? We work together.” >She pauses halfway to her own room to scratch her ass and think back about the friends you never bring around (wonder why?)
>”I think I remember them. Which one was the Auschwitz-mode kid?” “Auschwitz-mode?” You cock your head in confusion
>”Yeah, skinny. Like he crawled outta the showers in Auschwitz.”
“Oh. I don’t rem- okay seriously, you can’t say that shit around other people.”
>”Pffft, I know dude. Just having some laughs. Lighten up stud,”
“Whatever.” You dismiss her and return to cleaning up what she didn’t, making sure the pizza is in the oven
>You hear her bedroom door click shut
>A relieved sigh escapes your chest
>Maybe she’ll just stay in there the whole night?

>”Holy shit dude, you suck with Falco!” Ursetta leans on the back of the couch, her un-clipped claws digging into the fabric
>You’ve been playing games all night and having a good time, up until Ursetta practically invited herself into the fray
>”I got winner,” she says. “You’re gonna suck my fucking dick, Ryan,”
>Ryan, on his third beer, laughs sheepishly, either worried or now curious
>”You’re really into Super Smash huh?”
>You scowl. These are YOUR friends, not hers!
>And you’re sure they’re only tolerating her because she’s got huge knockers
>If only they knew what fresh hell drove those knockers
>”Hey Urs, you ever watch competitive Smash?” Keith asks
>She hops over the couch awkwardly, shaking everyone’s drink like an ursine earthquake, too excited to calculate where she’s landing
>She plops right between Ryan Jake, wiggling her chubby ass to try to make some room
>”Bro, I could be in competitive Smash. My Falco game is fucking sick,” she sneers confidently
>”But do you think you could beat one of the five gods?” Keith asks.
>”Probably Leffen, that little Swedish guy. I’d kill him easy,” she remarks, as you go down as Kirby and strike a stock 
>Damnit, go away!
>”Anon, pass me your controller,” she reaches across your friends, eyes still fixed to the TV. “I gotta show this bitch how to really play Falco,”
>Jake nudges Keith and Keith nudges you
>You instantly see what they’re trying to communicate
>For fuck sake, she’s not wearing a bra again
>The deep canyons of her cleavage are even deeper as she reaches for your controller, gravity being a true bro and pulling those sweater-stuffers down against their knees
>Your buddies all nod with approval, and Keith gives you the ‘did you hit that?’ look
>You shake your head and try to mimic a vomiting sound beneath Urs’ hearing range
>”Anon, quit choking on an imaginary cock over there and give me your controller,” she fires back
>Is she… blushing?
>Your buddies howl with approval
>You get it. She’s like one of the guys. She makes dirty jokes and likes games. And she has big tits and a big butt
>These guys have no idea what it’s like living with her though
>She swipes it from your limp grasp and snaps upright, her whole being fixated on the game
>Like a true autist
>She blurs through the menus, her fingers suddenly nubile and precise despite them eclipsing the controller itself
>Damn, she really DOES take this game seriously

>And so you are forced to sit out as everyone has a great time and plays Smash
>The alcohol keeps flowing, the banter is non-stop
>It probably helps that Ursetta is raunchier than the guys are, always commenting on the male characters, joking about ‘loser has to dress up like a girl’ and other shit she probably read on her stupid videogame boards
>You sit back and try to be cool with everything, but it’s not easy
>Everyone’s brought their A-Game out now that Ursetta’s playing
>Ryan, a legendary Falco main, is easily keeping up with Ursetta, while Keith and Jake add a chaotic element to the Ryan-Ursetta grudge match
>Each game you get into, you’re knocked out quickly, almost intentionally by Ursetta or one of your ‘friends.’
>You’re not bad at smash. Hell, you can normally keep up easily with the guys
>But you get the feeling that they’re trying extra hard to impress/beat Ursetta

>Ryan clears Ursetta’s last stock, and the boys are practically yelling at the screen now
>”SUCK MY DICK!” He screams, pumping his fists into the air
>Ursetta isn’t happy
>”Only if I lose this next one. And we play on Cornetta next time, kay bitch?”
>”Yeah, sure, whatever. You messed with the best Falco main in town. Imma One man wombo-combo your furry ass,”
>”You’re on.” >Ryan was joking. You said stuff like that to each other all the time
>The only question was: Did Ursetta know that? He was treating her like one of the boys, but did SHE realize that? Did she know those boundaries?
>Probably. Not like your friends would let anything like that happen. That’d just be… weird
>You get up to get a beer from the kitchen and get away from the noise
>You do need a break from the noise sometimes

>The kitchen isn’t far from the living-room, hell, it’s practically connected to it
>But you can get far enough away to where the noise from the living room seems to fade away
>You crack a cold one and just stare into the fridge
>You don’t really want anything, but the cool air feels nice
>And you think: This isn’t so bad. I mean, it could be worse. She’s just acting like one of the guys, albeit kind of strange, like that 
‘friend’ who doesn’t know they’re not wanted
>Saying stuff like she’d suck the winners weiner
>And which Smash character she’d ‘smashhhhh’
>You can see her stupid face curling up into an immature smile as the last syalbul hits her tongue
>You throw your head back and crush the beer >Whatever dude, just get through tonight
>When you’ve had enough time to think and chill out (heh), you return to the living room

>Weird, they’re not yelling as loud as the were
>What happened to all the excitement from earlier?
>You can see Ryan, and Keith, and Jake all playing
>But where’s Urse-
>Oh my god
>You can her bulging sweats raised into the air, poking just above the top of the couch, as if presenting herself to your friends, the small tuft of her tail like a shark’s fin
>Her ears bobbing up and down
>”Mmmm, you really like to li- OW, Jesus, you bit me!” Ryan cries
>Oh my fucking god

>Are they letting this happen?
>The sound of Ryan’s cock slipping in and out of Ursetta’s mouth fills the room
>They’re letting this happen
“What the fuck are you guys doing?” Seems a natural question
>Ursetta pops off Ryan’s cock
>”He won. Gotta blow the winner. Rules.”
>Oh, right. That makes sen- 
“NO!” You cry, but nobody is listening
>Why is she so casual about all of this? Why does she not understand boundaries!?
>”Yeah dude, you deaf?” Ryan chuckles
>Easy to say with your dick in someones mouth!
>He looks down at Urs and just seems to melt when she downs his whole member and starts choking as she pines for more
“You guys don’t think this is weird? Like just casually getting your dick sucked right in front of each other?”
>They all shake their heads and shrug
>”I don’t think it’s weird. We’ve all seen each other naked before, right?”
>Cue Ursetta’s sudden fangirling as she rudely spits Ryan’s cock out of her mouth
>”OH MY GOD YOU GUYS GET NAKED TOGETHER!?” She cries, her eyes shimmering with hope. “Why didn’t you tell me about any of this? I wanna see you spoon!”
>Not interested in sharing the shameful details of your friendship, Ryan grabs Ursetta by the ears and pushes her face back into his crotch
>”You’re not done yet,” he says, a hint of ice in his voice
>She melts at his forceful tone and touch
>The whole ‘we’ve seen each other naked’ thing wasn’t as comfortable or as sexual as Ursetta was imagining
>And neither is this

Part 3 - To save your soul

>Ryan smacks her ass, which makes her seize up momentarily with pleasure
>”Hhey, dho that aghain,” she says, mouth full of cock
>Ryan Obliges
>Then Keith
>Then Jake
>A beer can hisses as it opens up, and they’re all laughing while you stare in amazement and horror
>She grunts with  masochistic pleasure with each swat at her wide, pillowy ass
>Soon your friends turn it into some kind of weird game, seeing who can make the loudest sound from either Ursetta’s groaning or their palms cracking off her butt
>You just stand there like some kind of cuck, beer in hand, watching your friends basically run a train on your cock-drunk roommate
>God fucking damnit, if this was going to go down you were NOT going to be the shy cuck
>Exhaling hotly through your nose, you slap your beer down on the table, grasp your roommates sweats, just above her stubby little tail, and pull down just enough to expose her cheeks
>You pull back, like a pitcher readying an open-handed fastball, and strike like you’re trying to smack the ass right off her chubby body
>The resulting crack is like thunder in your small apartment. Your open palm brushes quickly through her crop of un-groomed fur, striking her tender skin underneath so hard she actually does bite Ryan
>Everyone is stunned into silence, except Ryan, who unleashed a pained squeal from his throat
>”Fuck fuck fuck let go!” Ryan’s screams nearly reach the apex that your punishing ass-sault just did
>Ursetta is speechless until Ryan practically forces her jaws apart
>”JESUS FUCKING OWWWWWWWWW!” She howls, tears springing to her eyes. Her whole body shivers painfully and slumps forward into the armrest of the couch
>”No more of those!” She grunts, wiggling her plush butt in the air like it was on fire
>You take a step back
>No
>Your palm is bright red, and so is her right ass-cheek, where you caught her right in the meat of her derriere
>Christ you really got a piece of that one. You even planted one foot forward, just like you were pitching
>Jake and Keith start clapping. Ryan is still gritting his teeth as he checks his dick for blood
>”Its been through worse,” Keith laughs. “We’ll just dunk it in some rubbing alcohol and slap a bandage on it.”
>Ryan grunts in pain. “That’s not funny you faggot. I almost lost my dick!”
>”It was kind of funny, you gotta admit,” Jake says
>Yeah, it was kind of funny
>Ryan crawls off the couch, defeated. Ursetta’s ass is still thrust in the air, but she’s flexing it inward and rubbing the spot where you scorched her
>You think you broke her
>”Someone take my spot, I gotta go make sure my dick isn’t broken,” he says, his voice hoarse from yelling
>Jake volunteers, thrusting his pants down with unsettling agility 
>Well-
>You smirk
>-You haven’t broken her yet
>Reaching behind you, like God summoning out of darkness the light that is the universe, you strike open your tightened fist and lock your targeting systems on her jiggling butt
>Poor girl has no idea that she’s about to get Goku slapped
>She lifts her head just barely, tears still forming in her eyes
>When she sees you about ready to slap the soul from her body, all she can do is let the blood drain from her face
>Cause she’s gonna need it elsewhere
>Your snap your arm and plant your feet to keep yourself upright — either the beer or the force of this monster swat threatening to take you off your feet — and make contact to the sound of cannon fire
>The resulting *CRACK* could have broken glass, you swear, and when you feel how badly your palm stings, you almost feel bad for her tender, doughy ass for having taken the brunt of that
>Her lips purse, her eyes bulge from her sockets, her body tenses and coils up with a scream so incomprehensibly loud that your remaining friends plug their ears
>”aaaaaaaAAAAAaAAaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH MYYYYYYY GGGGGGGGGGGGGOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!” She nearly falls forward off the arm of the couch, her body uncoiling like a massive spring, its remaining energy turning inward into spasms
“Jesus Christ.” You stare at your singed palm in amazement. Who know you had such power within you?
>And then there’s the guilt
“Urs? You okay?” You ask
>She bites down on the arm of the couch, teeth fully puncturing YOUR couch fabric
>Fuck
>Well, you guess you deserved it. For ruining the mood and ruining the nigh-
>”AHGHAN” she says through the couch stuffing
“What?”
>”AHGHAN!” She thrusts her bright red butt into the air, practically at you
>You see how damp the slit between her legs is
>Dear God
>What have you done?

>You open your mouth to protest her request (seriously you might actually hurt her, that masochistic freak), but Keith steps between you and her
>”Listen, I’m a big fan of your work Anon, big fan, but you gotta let me have a crack at this.”
“Wha-”
>He claps you on the shoulder
>”I’m glad you understand. Now, step back please.”
>Face tingling with embarrassment and hot with confusion, you do as your told, as Keith readies his god hand
>The smack goes wide, hitting the top of her butt, to the right of her tail. She grunts and lurches forward, but then soundlessly thrusts her back end back out for me
>You see that she’s tensing up her thighs, and the pinkish slit of her engorged sex doesn’t escape your vision either
>Oh dear god you’ve opened Pandora's box
>Jake is next. He catches her right where you caught her, the bright red handprint matching yours
>He can’t hit as hard, but his accuracy is good
>Urs lurches forward and grunts into the meat of the couch, stifling her erotic pain
>What a freak
>Speaking of, you unconsciously trundle forward, pulled by your dick like a fish on a lure
>Your roommate lifts her head up, face wet with tears but scoured red with lust, and when she sees you standing behind her, she unhinges her jaw and lets out a long, hot breath
>”OH fuck…” She sticks her butt out and slams her eyes shut “Punish me daddy. Hurt your little girl.”
>”Yoooo what the fuccckk Anon?” Keith squawks
>You snap your neck behind you, face blistering red
“I-It’s not like that! She says weird shit all the ti-”
>”I want Daddy-Anon to hurt me!” She cries, and then, dropping her voice into almost a crackling, evil low, she hisses, “DO IT.”
“SEE!? This is what I mean! Having to live with her-”
>”I’m just a useless, fat bear who needs to be hurt for sneaking into your room and wearing your clothes when you leave~~”
“You do WHAT!?” You stammer, stepping forward. Without you even knowing, your fist uncoils into into a broad palm, ready to punish
“So that’s why my clothes are always stretched out?” You git your teeth
>You’re lost many good shirts and pants, always wondering why they’re stretched and torn
>”Sometimes I even sleep on your be-“
>And that was that
>You break her butt with a smack so hard she nearly falls off the couch
>She recoils in utter pain, but you’re not done
>The blood in your stinging palm, and the blood in your groin tell you otherwise. You go to strike again, but someone catches your palm
>”Anon, wait,” Ryan says
>Your tunnel vision expands
>Oh god you were about to smack the hair off her ass. Thank god someone stopped you before you took it too far
>”Let me do something. You owe this to me.” 
“I…What? What are you going to do?”
>Ryan doesn’t answer. He grabs Ursetta by the scruff of her neck and yanks her head off the couch
>The sound of upholstery shearing is like a cash register blaring against your eardrums
>Fuck, she ate your couch
>Ryan leans in close and whispers something to Ursetta. She looks pretty much broken by now, but there’s some part of her that still can understand what Ryan is saying
>And that part of her takes control. She arches her back and sticks her swollen rear into the air as Ryan scoots in close behind her, stiff cock at the ready
>Her inner thigh isn’t damp from the spanking — it’s soaked, nearly black from her sloppy, primed sex, primal with desperation
>You hate to admit it, but the sight of her so needy REALLY gets you going
>Ryan slides right in, and Ursetta groans as the first REAL, ACTUAL dick she’s ever felt splits her folds

>Your head spins
>Maybe it was the beers, the heat of the apartment
>God
>Is this really happening? 
>Keith and Jake drop their pants while Ryan hate-fucks your awful, annoying, kinda hot— NO BAD TRASH BRAIN
>Ursetta grunts and groans as Ryan pounds into her, his lower-half slapping off her body in a rhytyhm That’s the only sound that fills the room
>Nobody talks, just chugs beer and watches Ryan pound Urs, listens to her take it like a bitch in heat
>Which might be likely — You’re fairly positive she doesn’t take Estrus blockers
>And speaking of heat, you can feel your groin swelling with blood
>Damnit, you didn’t want this
>And as Ryan howls, his orgasm thundering through him and into Ursetta, you still feel like a cuck
>This is some BULLSHIT
>Jake and Keith don’t even care that they’re sliding into Ursetta’s ruined pussy as heavy ropes of cum bead out from her slickened pussy
>They just pound away, losing themselves to animal instinct
>And Ursetta, by her fourth orgasm, is babbling weird shit, doing weird hand gestures, like looking back at you and flashing the peace sign
>All before Keith forces her head down, of course
>Almost like she was taunting you
>You white-knuckle the beer can, crumpling it into a sharp ball
>Jake is still balls deep in her when your hands drop to your belt
>The game is still going, the invisible Super Smash crowd cheering to Jake’s shuddering orgasm as his balls clench and empty themselves inside Ursetta’s now stuffed pussy
>Three loads inside of her
>You just wanted one normal night to yourself
>Just to hang with your friends-
>Jake stumbles backwards, his cock still threaded to her backside by a rope of cum
>-You don’t care at this point
>Now it’s beyond personal
>It’s hatred
>For her, for ruining your night
>And how will your friendship recover?
>You rake down your underwear, full-mast and full of anger
>If she thought your spanking was tough, she’s gonna love this
>The freak
>You grab her by the scruff of her neck and yank back hard
>The corners of her eyes find you smirking
>A devilish smile crosses her lips
>”Hey Anon, ready to man up? Thought you’d ne-“
>You press the tip of your pre-slickened cock against her puckered asshole
>”Hey Anon, what do you think you’re…”
>You push your hips forward and slide easily inside her tight ass
>”ANON I POOP FROM THERE!” She cries, but you can feel her hole twitching with delight
>You lean forward, next to her ears, wrapping her fur in your fist
“Not right now you don’t.”

>With a thrust that could wake the dead, you piston forward, hearing her yelp in pain and pleasure
>She clenches around you, loosing a wet orgasm into your already soiled couch
>You don’t stop to let her ride it out. What’s one more stain on this God-forasken couch anyway?
>Instead you fuck her to the rhythm of her shattering contractions, pounding as her body flexes against you as it unconsciously tries to wring a load from your swollen sack
>Not today, vile thot
>She yelps with every inch you plunge, her claws bracing and ripping into the couch. She snarls as your grip threatens tear the fur from her body
>Instead you use it like a reign, pulling yourself forward and back with her tender fur as your anchor to her body
>She snarls as you pull a little too tight and bury yourself inside of her
>”I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY SENPAI,” she growls, fangs flashing
>And a hateful smile flashes across her mouth
>”But if you wanna play it like that, baka, then let’s see how you like my super secret move!” 
>Jesus Christ, right now? Really?
>”『Sticky Honey Grippu』(ザ·ワールド（世界）”
>You’re positive that’s not Japa-
She bucks her hips backwards, threatening to shake you off
>You hold on to your “reigns” for dear life
>She glances back
>”Still fighting huh? Heh, guess you’re a lot tougher than I thought. I guess I’ll have to go all out. Just this once. Forgive me master.”
“This isn’t anime you fucking weirdo, this is anal sex!”
>You slam forward, but only can stay lodged inside of her guts for a few seconds before she begins pumping against your rather thin body, throwing the bulk of her lower body against your twig legs
>In the midst of her anal assault, one of your hands starts slipping, her hair threading through your slick knuckles like fishing line
>”THAT’S RIGHT ANON, YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE ME ON IN A BATTLE OF WHOSE MORE DISGUSTING!?”
>She bucks backwards again and it takes everything you have to not fall backwards
>Your grip can only handle her powerful gravity for so long
>Your loose hand pulls the tuft of hair out of her skin, throwing it up in a spray, like confetti
>Ursetta lets loose a horrible, pained roar that rattles the windowpanes
>You can’t move
>That completely paralyzed you — and your dick, which is barely tip inside of her pink rectum
>You swallow some deep breaths, sweat trailing down your body
>She looks back at you, that smirk still on her face, but her eyes completely glassed over with pained tears
>”Had enough you little cuck? Maybe I’ll let you finish on my tits? And then afterwards you can order some pizza for me and your friends.”
>Who by the way are speechless. You turn to see them all leaning forward, eyes bulging from their sockets, someone’s beer is trickling onto the carpet
>Whatever
>”I told you this could-“ she breathes deeply, legs starting to tremble as she tries to slip away from you
>You just watch numbly
>”-This could be my job. See? I’m good at this.”
>Her voice drops to a whisper
>”I’m good at something.”
>…
>Your arms tremble in kind, shaking from adrenaline, lust, and alcohol
>You can barely believe the words as they leave your mouth
>But it’s okay — everything is becoming a horny blur 
“You are good, Urs.” 
>Hands trembling, red with exertion, you clamp them around her shoulders
>She gasps as you slowly pull yourself back inside of her
“You’re the best fuck I’ve ever had,” you whisper in her ears, voice grating from exhaustion
>You have one last round in you
“But I’m better.”
>You slam forward, crotch bouncing off her ass, balls slapping against her soaked pussy
>”Oh F-FUCK!” She cries, lurching forward to take your next barrage, stubbornly fighting gravity and exhaustiuon
>And what a barrage it is
>You wildly pound into her, no set rhythm, no tempo or thought — only a primal urge to dominate this little masochist and cum so hard you hit her stomach
>So you bottom out time-after-time, sinking yourself into her eager guts while you squeeze orgasm after orgasm out of her
>She sinks her fangs deep into the couch and screams as her cunt spasms and the tight ring of her asshole collapses rhythmically around your cock
>By this point she’s practically destroyed the couch, and you can feel it in each thrust
>The frame shakes unevenly, its poorly constructed wooden base cracking as you throw your entire existence into each punishing slam into her ass
>Just like you’re going to destroy yourself with this

>After what seems like a blissful eternity spent inside of her, her orgasm count well into the teens, you start to feel your groin tightening up
>One great, tense feeling — a wall of pleasure so immense it casts everything else up until this point in its shadow
>This will be one for the ages
>You dig your nails into her tender shoulder meat
>You don’t even care if you draw blood
>The electricity builds at the base of your dick, from static rumblings to Earth-melting lightning
>Then it hits
>You hunch over and spasm-thrust, pouring your GOT-DAYMN SOUL into this Bear
>Your balls clench up and squeeze themselves so hard it begins to hurt, but they did what they had to do to release the flood of cum they’d been sitting with
“FUCK!”
>And right as your orgasm crashes into you, Ursetta lets rip one of her own, another primal roar, undoubtedly assailing the neighbors with its baritone blasts
>Your bodies seize in unison, trying to squeeze everything out of one another
>You cum so hard your vision starts to collapse like a star going full super-nova
>First there’s an explosion of white hot pleasure
>And then a collapsing darkness
>Ursetta drops forward, unwittingly drawing you out of her ass, unsealing a plug that’s held record-level cum 
>Which all cums bubbling out onto the back of her thighs and legs
>And you don’t care
>You fall backwards with such force that you barely feel it when the frame finally snaps
>Like tender kindling fed to a fire

>You wake up in a pile of broken furniture and sweat, feeling something heavy against your chest
>Eyes splitting wide with panic, you look around
>Your friends are all gone
>But Urs has her feet on your upper chest
>She’s laying on her stomach, her plush ass dribbling your cum still
>Good lord
>Is she dead
 >OH GOD IS SHE DEAD
“URS!” You cry, grabbing at her body
>She doesn’t move
>You throw her legs off you and sit up
“URS! Urs you okay!?”
>Groping with your heavy, aimless arms, you accidentally grab onto her padded butt
>She shifts a little and moans, something about the ass being fat
>”Kyaa,” she says, still emerging from unconsciousness
>You slump back down into what remains of the couch
>Oh god, she’s awake
>She’s awake and this place is a disaster
>Your head starts hurting again, and the familiar gravity of sleep presses on your eyelids
>You shut your eyes
>When you wake up, everything will be back to normal. This is just a bad dream


Epilogue

>You come home after a long day at work, desperately wanting to fall onto your couch and mindlessly watch Netflix
>And you do, to a spotless apartment, onto a new couch
>Ursetta proudly waltzes out of the kitchen drinking a GLASS OF WATER (Not soda or an energy drink) and wearing a brown and red striped uniform with her name on a gold-plated name-tag
>URSETTA - LANGUAGE ASSISTANT 
>Well, it used to say movie theater tech, but she crossed it out so she could spew bad Japanese at people
“What’s up wagecuck?” You ask as she plops down next to you, practically lifting her side of the couch up
>”Shut up you corporate bitch,” she sulks. “Where’s your leash?” She motions to your tie
”Where’s yours?” you say
>She downs her water and slumps back into the plus cushions
>”Work SUCKKKKSSSSS” She groans. “My manager is already on my THICC-
“Don’t”
>”Is already on my ass about my jokes and banter and-“
>You cut in
“What did I say, banter needs to be FUNNY and NOT PHYSICAL to be banter,”
>”Pffft,” she kicks her feet up on the coffee table. “Weak noobs just can’t handle my banter.”
“You sure it’s that they just can’t handle you?” You say, smirking
>”I’m a lot to handle,” she tries
”I know.” You pinch her shrinking love-handles. “Emphasis on a lot.”
>She giggles instead of recoiling at your touch
“You know, I’d move your fat ass off MY COUCH if I could,” you say, continuing to poke her
>She hums with budding excitement, her thighs squeezing together
>”I bet you could find a way,” she says, her voice dropping to a low octave, staring intently at you, uncomfortably close
”Urs..” You lean in, hand sliding around her shoulder, mouth lolling open. “You are the worst roommate I’ve ever had.”
>Ursetta shudders with pleasure as you lean in for the kiss — but she’s only shaking from the insult
>You’ll either turn her into a respectable person, or she’ll make you a degenerate
>Right now, none of that matters
