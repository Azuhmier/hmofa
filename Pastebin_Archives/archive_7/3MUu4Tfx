>Today was a weird day, that’s for sure.
>You hated moving, yet here you were, cleaning out your garage because Clara asked you to.
>And who were you to say no to your lovely snow leopard wife?
>Happy wife, happy life.
>Happy husband doesn’t have a rhyme because no one cares.
>But she promised that she would make it worth your while.
>And she would, that was for sure, she always did.
>And so, you're sweeping the garage, waiting for Clara and Emi to arrive with the moving truck you and Emi loaded.
>Emi had struck out too much, her last roommate had flaked and refused to sign up for a new lease.
>As well as every guy she dated wasn't good enough, apparently.
>After you and Clara had a date night with her, she had stuck to dating humans.
>Guess you spoiled her too much.
>Clara had made the decision that Emi needed to move in then.
>While you don't mind, you wish she would have consulted you first.
>Your spare room got emptied, and the extra furniture was going to be stored in the garage
>Your buddy, the Chickenman "Chick" was coming over to help you move the heavy furniture.
>You offered him his favorite beer "Alamo" and a favor.
>While you weren't really "anonymous" like he was, you were a third generation Anon
>As such, you were still able to use the infamous Anonymous Network.
>Anonymous members were people, men and women who were transported from their world to this one.
>And they stuck together once they got here, helping each other out.
>Favors for favors, because some people came to this world with much, some with nothing.
>Mechanic had apparently come with an entire vineyard and promptly sold it.
>You hear the telltale vroom of a large truck engine coming down your street, and you walk out the open garage door...
>Here they come with the truck, Clara driving and Emi driving her own car.
>You can see Clara nervously holding her tail in her mouth as she drives.
>Why she didn't let you drive the truck, you'll never know. 
>She had never driven a truck like that before, but she wanted the experience.
>Whatever, as long as she didn't hit anyone or anything.
>You use your arms to direct her to the driveway as she backs up.
>Emi parks on the street behind your El Camino.
>Normally that would be in the garage, but you and Clara’s hobbies were getting in the way.
>Gun smithing equipment took up some space.
>Chick was interested with that hobby, but then again he always had an arsenal on him.
>As well when the mechanic learned that Lilith was barren, he borrowed one of the guns you made and spent all day shooting at targets.
>His silent rage was apparent, he didn't talk to anyone or do anything beyond shoot those paper targets.
>You couldn’t blame him at all.
>How could you?
>He and Lilith had been trying for a long time, only to learn that something had messed her up.
>How would you have reacted if you and Clara hadn't been able to have Lucatiel?
>Probably the same.
>Clara stops the truck at your motion, then parks it.
>"Hi, love! I told you I could drive the truck!"
>You smile and nod.
>"You did, good job!"
>She bounds over to you happily and gives you a big hug and a kiss.
>You hear Emi walking up the driveway, sticks cracking under her boots.
>"Hey Anon, thanks for giving me a place to stay for a while."
>She gives you a hug and kisses your cheek.
>You can't help but think her doing this greeting for you might be a factor in why her various human boyfriends didn't stay with her.
>You recall once she actually kissed you in a greeting in front of one of her boyfriends...
>THAT went over well.
>"It’s no problem Emi, you’re like family."
>As you go to let her out of your arms so you can start moving the small stuff, she grips you harder and gives you a kiss.
>"No, really Anon, Clara said this was your idea, and I really appreciate it."
>You peek over at Clara with a raised eyebrow...
>She gives you a sneaky smile and a wink.
>"Told you Anon is the best husband!"
>Emi nods while looking into your eyes...
>"Yes, he is," she says with a happy smile.
>You suddenly feel VERY uncomfortable.
>"Uh, let’s see about unloading this truck..."
>You peel away from the big cats and unlatch the truck's lock, then slide the door open.
>Nothing too big, a couch and lazy boy chair, her mattress, and a few things you can carry alone, like a table and such.
>The "spare" furniture would be stored in the garage.
>"Babe, where's Lucatiel? It’s almost her feeding time."
>You point to a baby monitor on your workbench...
>"She's napping, I put her to sleep about half an hour ago."
>Clara goes inside, leaving you and Emi to start unloading the truck.
>You knew that the small stuff was in the front, easy to get and move.
>As you move the small things, you think about how convenient having Emi around will be...
>She could easily babysit Lucatiel now when you had class and Clara had work.
>Granted, she would before, but you had to drop her off at Emi's place, or Emi had to come to you.
>You hear Emi tapping away at her phone, then hear music start, her phone connected to a small Bluetooth speaker.
>Huh, the latest Gorillaz album? Not a bad choice, but you preferred Demon Days and Plastic Beach.
>As you groove to Damon Albarn’s voice, you hear the revving Of Chick's Pontiac.
>You watch as he drives it around the cul-de-sac and parks behind Emi's car.
>Chick and Jasmine get out of the car, a small baby bump on Jasmine as she looks positively radiant.
>The big cats always have a certain glow of happiness when they're pregnant.
>"Jasmine! What an unexpected surprise! I thought it was just Chick coming?"
>She walks over and gives you a hug.
>"I got off work to help! Couldn't let Chicky have all the fun!"
>You frown.
>"Nope! You aren't helping! No heavy lifting while preggo."
>Chick walks up behind her, his eye patch still on.
>"Told you he wouldn't let you help."
>You shake Chick's hand calmly.
>"Hey man, your beer is in the fridge, let me know when you’re ready to tackle the heavy stuff."
>He nods and heads inside with Jasmine...
>You follow and motion to Emi to do the same.
>Clara should be done feeding Lucatiel, and you're sure the mom-to-be wants to play with the cub.
>Plus, you know Emi loves Lucatiel like she was Lucatiel’s mother.
>Jasmine is already fawning over the giggling cub when you get into the house.
>Chick is fishing through the fridge for his beer.
>"Yo, you want pizza? I'll order some New York style pizza from this local joint," you call to him.
>"Oh, get me the anchovy pizza! Emi and I love that one!" Clara says as she passes a giggling Lucatiel over to Jasmine...
>Jasmine tickles your cub's foot paws gently.
>"Yeah man, just get whatever you get, I’m not picky," Chick says as he sits next to Jasmine on the couch.
>You nod and leave the room, then order the pizzas.
>As much as you want to get this moving stuff done, you still want to relax and hang out with your friends.
>Between Chick and Jasmine's BHA stuff, you couldn't get everyone together all the time.
>Even this was a stretch, Jasmine being able to show up was surprising...
>Not that you were complaining.
>Although as your family cat, Scooter, crawled her way into Chick's lap, you think Jasmine might.
>Scooter and Jasmine had a weird rivalry you thought was hilarious.
>Scooter would smell Jasmine on Chick and because "fuck you, I’m a cat," would begin rubbing her scent all over Chick.
>You and Clara thought it was hilarious because Jasmine would then "subtly" rub her scent all over Chick again.
>And the cycle would go on.
>Although right now Jasmine was too busy to notice Scooter rubbing all over Chick's legs...
>You get up and head to the garage again, letting them all catch up with each other.
>Small stuff first, then the medium.
>Before long, the pizza guy arrives and he heads right into the garage, where you pay.
>No need to let your guests see the payment.
>You head back into the house, carrying the pizzas.
>Chick looks like he's on beer number 2, and the girls are all still talking happily about cubs and such.
>Emi holds Lucatiel, who is attempting to get to Emi's breasts in her mouth, and Scooter sits in Chick's lap with Jasmine eyeing her angrily.
>Scooter returns the glare.
>"Hey all, pizza's here!"
>You watch Clara bounce happily as you set the pizzas in the kitchen.
>The group slowly gets up and meanders over getting pizza and enjoying company.
>After a little while, Chick places a hand on your shoulder...
>"Let’s knock this heavy stuff out."
>You nod, "Cool, let’s go."
>Even though chick is shorter than you, you know you can depend on him with this stuff.
>Out of the bedroom comes the old mattress and the old bedframe...
>Into the room goes Emi's bed frame, box spring, mattress, and dresser.
>Everything else is pulled and stored into the garage.
>Emi helped with most of the smaller stuff, Clara helped organize the room, and Jasmine kept an eye on Lucatiel.
>She was getting the hang of this mom thing.
>You’re finished with the heavy stuff in about 45 minutes, and the not so heavy stuff within a few hours.
>With everyone working together, it went quick.
>You were grateful for Chick being able to help you out.
>You're sure you and Emi could have done it, after all she was fit and even ran with you when she stayed over.
>But you wanted an excuse to have your friends come over.
>Not that you needed an excuse, but having them over was always a pleasure.
>When you and Chick finish, you go back into your living room to Scooter and Jasmine glaring at each other.
>Honestly, it's hilarious to see a big tiger gal staring down a housecat, and the housecat not backing down at all.
>But still, you should break the tension.
>You walk over to Scooter, pick her up, and put her outside.
>Sorry kitty, you'll get some tuna later.
>Clara is already next to Jasmine.
>You sit next to her and Emi sits next to you.
>Chick grabs another beer and sits next to Jasmine.
>It's a shame Lilith and the mechanic couldn't come hang out, but Lilith had classes and the mechanic had to work.
>Clara and Jasmine coo at Lucatiel when Jasmine's phone rings, causing the cub to cry.
>"Oh! Oh, no! Sorry! I have to take this, it's my work phone!" she says in a panic, passing Lucatiel to Clara.
>You watch as Clara calms down the crying cub and Jasmine picks up her phone.
>It's always weird to hear one side of an important conversation.
>"Huh? Yeah? NO! No, no, no! I'll be there shortly! DON"T LET HIM GO!"
>Jasmine hurriedly hangs up and stands up.
>"I'm so, SO sorry, but we have to go, the BHA found an Anonymous member who's been homeless for years and is terrified of Anthros, I have to go!"
>Chick stands up quickly, setting down his half-drunken beer.
>"OK, let's go, Jasmine." He says, suddenly serious.
>You stand with them and help them out to their car.
>As important as this call was, you hate to see them leave.
>Clara gives Jasmine a big hug, you shake Chick's hand, and everyone says their goodbyes.
>Jasmine drives, and Chick is in the passenger seat as they pull away...
>You stand and watch them go.
>It's a shame they had to go, but finding a homeless guy from the other world is huge.
>Jasmine had told you the stories of some of the people who appeared in this world.
>Some appears thousands of feet up, some were babies, some where just children who didn't understand.
>You frown, thinking about it as you walk back into the house.
>Emi sits with Lucatiel, teasing and playing with the giggling cub.
>"Well, it's just us now, glad we got that all knocked out," you say calmly as you sit down.
>Clara sits next to you and Emi scoots closer to you.
>Well now, this doesn't seems weird at all.
>One guy with 2 big cats and a cub.
>Seems like a weird sit-com...
>But it's your life, and you can't complain.
>Although you can't see Emi's dating situation getting ANY better with her living with you...
>You know that Clara doesn't mind that though, and Emi probably doesn't either.
>For the rest of the evening, you all relax and enjoy each other's company, talking about Clara and Emi's job as nurses.
>The things they see at work is sometimes funny.
>Sometimes Clara comes home with her fur matted with blood and you have to help wash her.
>At about 19:00 (7:00 pm), you put Lucatiel down to bed.
>Emi and Clara are sitting and talking to each other quietly about something when you return to the living room.
>"What are you two whispering about over there?" you say as you sit down next to them.
>They look at you then back at each other.
>Oh god, they're scheming up something...
>"Well, we were thinking that since you did such a good job moving stuff..." Clara starts.
>"And because you were so nice to let me move in..." Emi says after her.
>"...you deserve a treat," they finish together.
>If that means what you think it means, then you're in for a fun night.
