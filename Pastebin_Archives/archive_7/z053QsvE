Prologue

>This had been a great week
>Your Loving wife, Amanda had suggested that you and her take the kids to Disney world and the area around it
>Why not do that? you were a firefighter and had plenty of vacation days saved up
>So you treated your loving Wife and you kids to the best week ever
>Your Son, Derek got over his fear of the dark because of the ride space mountain
>And you Daughter, Ashley, finally discovered a love of star wars
>Granted it was just because she saw a remote controlled BB-8 toy and insisted on having it but that's besides the point
>Even the Family dog, Moose, a big doofy German Shepard,  had fun wandering around the park with you all
>You had driven around Florida in your... uhm, Manvan (You refused to call it a minivan for masculinity) seeing the sights
>Daytona beach, Orlando, Cape Canaveral, the swamps to see some gators
>It had been a long time since you had seen your family smile so much
>When Moose tried to attack a Crab on the beach and it pinched his nose you laughed and cried for him
>The Lovable doofus just didn't know when other animals didn't wanna be friends
>You decided to take the wheel to drive home after the week was over
>After all Amanda was so tired from playing with the kids and your nighttime... activities that she could barely stay awake
>You too had been playing with the kids but you knew your limits and had the sheer willpower to stay awake
>How else do you fight a fire for 12 hours without food water or a piss break besides that?
>Lots of training
>As you drive up the Interstate, you look around
>You'll miss the Spanish moss, the willows and the warm humid rainstorms that happened every day
>You can see why old people retire to Florida
>The Mountains come and go as you drive through the Appalachians
>They always did take you breath away
>The serenity, the calm cool beauty
>You miss camping here, like you did with your father when you were a child
>Maybe when Derek was older you could take him camping, like you father (god rest his soul) had before you
>You enter a tunnel through the mountain and think of nothing else beyond relaxing at home with you wife
>The light at the end grows brighter and brighter and.........

Nothing

>The world is a blur
>Happiness, sadness, sadness, pain, and joy
>All things you can't even recall
>What is this around you
>Its reminds you of stars, or the aurora borealis
>You hear something
>Singing, music? You can't tell beyond its beautiful
>Spinning somethings in the distance
>Nightscapes of light and dark
>The edge of time and everything beyond it
>All of it is taken from you as sit up in the middle of an alley
>Where are you? Who are you?
>You sit up and ponder it as you look around
>Its night and nearly pitch black 
>Something bothers you
>But what?
>You run your fingers through your hair and feel like you're forgetting something important
>Maybe something on you can tell you who you are?
>You dig through your pockets in search of something
>Anything
>A cell phone? The battery is dead though
>A wallet! You flip it open and look at the license
>You are Anon....
>The memories hit you like a flash flood
>Your wife! Your Kids! 
>Where are they!?
>You run out of the alley shouting for them
>Grabbing anyone and asking if they had seen your family
>Only to your horror they aren't anyone
>Animals
>Walking animals pretending to be people
>What nightmare is this? You feel like you're in one of your children's storybooks
>"Sir are you ok! I'm with the police I can help you" a voice behind you
>You sigh in relief as you turn
>The police!
>You had dealt with them so many times!
>They might a silly competition with firemen but it was always in jest
>They could help you no doubt
>But its not police
>Its Moose, or a nightmare version of your beloved dog
>Walking on 2 feet, wearing a police uniform and talking
>TALKING!
>You scream and run
>What had you done to deserve this?
>You run
>Back into the only place you knew was safe
>The alley
>Anyway from the monsters that stalked the night of this nightmare
>You need to wake up!
>First you pinch yourself
>Nothing
>Then punch yourself
>Still nothing
>Then you bite yourself so hard that you taste blood and it pours down your chin
>This can't be real!
>Can it?!
>Maybe you need to sleep
>You curl up besides a dumpster in your alley
>Yea...
>Just sleep it off....
>This is all just a dream


Chapter 1: All Alone
>How long has it been since you entered this goddamn world?
>This hell
>Too long
>Why hasn't your suffering just ended
>Why haven't you just ended it yourself?
>You knew the answer to that one
>Hope that you could wake up and be in your lazy boy chair with your family around you
>And cowardice
>As much as you hated this life and where ever you were
>You had to live
>Live in this new world, this new hell
>A world filled with Animals disguised as people
>And when you saw normal people, and tried to point the Animals out; they look at YOU like you were the crazy one
>Then later you saw the Feds looking for you
>"The BHA"
>They were looking for you, to whisk you off to some torture
>Some hell for brainwashing you to not see these animals
>SO many animals acting like people
>At this point the only anchor to your old life was a picture, faded and torn
>You and your family
>Amanda, Derek, Ashley and you
>All smiling at a camera
>This picture was the only thing that kept you rooted
>It let you know that hadn't been a fever dream, not a drug induced hallucination
>And the drugs flowed
>As much as you hated what you had become, you hated this new world more
>You found a human, someone, and asked for the strongest thing they had
>What it was you didn't care
>Why would you
>As long as it made you forget them
>Forget your previous life
>The thoughts plagued you
>Where they here in this new world?
>Were they dead?
>Or were they alive and growing up without you? back in your world?
>How could you know?
>Would you ever know?
>You doubted it
>You sit in your box, head drooped, the pills whoever gave you taking effect
>How many druggies had you dealt with?
>Enough to say that you were never going to do drugs
>Yet here you were
>Paying random people for random pills
>Those animals had come to you before, offering you "Better" pills
>You ran from them, those whatever they were
>Demons, sent to torment you
>Or were they the vision of people, and you were finally seeing what they really were?
>Doesn't matter, the city is one you don't recognize
>you didn't even know what it was called
>But you never left it
>Maybe, just Maybe, you get pulled back to your home
>Even though every night proved you never would
>You had to try



>You lay in you usual alleyway
>The big cardboard box from something kept you warm
>A refrigerator box? The box from an oven?
>Doesn't matter
>It was your home now
>You sit in it
>The picture of your family pinned to the cardboard wall
>Even though you hated your life, hated everything for bringing you here
>You wouldn't beg for money
>Those animal things wouldn't get a thing from you
>Never
>Not in a million years would you ever let them see you
>Never would you help them
>How many times had you seen a group of those beasts robbing another one?
>Too many to remember
>And you recall seeing the robber look at you and simply dismiss you like a piece of trash
>Yea... At this point that's what you were
>Nothing more than trash
>Why didn't one of them just end it for you?
>Please Just Put you out of your misery!
>But they never did, they just looked at you and smirked, then let you live
>Condemning you to life
>But it wasn't all bad
>Even as you sat in your alley, these things; these animals gave you some mercy
>A dime, a nickel, a dollar
>You didn't beg like the others
>You simply slumped against the opening to your alley
>Trying to remember your family
>They tossed the bits that didn't matter to them your way
>Because you didn't matter to them either way
>You sat in your box, wearing torn clothing
>Scraps from a box, a dumpster, a bunch of junk left behind by people too self righteous to simply throw away their old clothing
>It kept you warm in the winter as you tried to close the cardboard box that you found
>How many winters?
>You don't know, too many drugs and too much alcohol made you forget
>At this point nothing bothers you though
>Why should it?
>Robberies, burglaries whatever
>The cops were all those animal things
>When they came asking you disappeared
>Into a dumpster, onto a roof
>Or simply got so high you didn't eve realize they were cops
>Even now as you sat in your box you didn't care as you heard the scuffle of feet and angry voices
>But something catches your attention
>A voice
>A poor sweet sounding feminine voice
>Begging for life, begging to be spared
>"-EASE! LET ME G-"
>Its cut off by a sharp thud
>A druggie you may now be, but you weren't a monster
>You had to help a girl in trouble
>As you stand the world whirls around you, the pills you popped doing their job
>Why now of all times? the one time you didn't want them to work you were a dizzy mess
>You rub your face and hair in an attempt to wipe away the drugged "out of it" feeling
>How many times hard you heard that?
>You grab a broken something
>A broom handle? A lead pipe? Whatever
>The girls weeping cries drive you onward, boring into your brain
>Who would hurt such an innocent sounding person?!
>When you finally find you source of the crying its from a group of Humans
>A few have somethings, knives, machetes, sticks?
>You don't know
>All you know is from the center of them is the crying , the begging for help
>You bring the blunt object, whatever it was, onto the back of the nearest offender
>Muscle memory returns
>Chop down that door, kick through that door frame
>Get to those that need help
>You keep chopping, your body taking control as your mind wanders to better times
>Times of happiness with your family
>Then your body freezes, your "ax" held tight ready to strike
>But you can't as the Humans run away
>One of those animals is in front of you
>Tears pour from the eye that remains and she grips her right arm with her left
>All that's left of her right arm is a bloody stump and her left eye is gone
>You stare, holding your ax ready to attack
>But all she does is tear up before speaking
>"Please.. Help m-"
>She passes out and begins to fall
>You drop your weapon and catch her
>As you hold the passed out dog thing in you arms, you think
>She's one of those things! 
>She's a monster!, you should just leave her
>But she begged out your help
>And humans did this to her
>You weren't like them
>You pledged to help those in need, even if it was in the other world
>No matter what, even if it meant running into a fire you were going to help
>The nearest hospital is nearly 3 miles away
>Better start running

Chapter 2: All In
>The Dog girl thing is passed out in your arms as you run
>You had put your belt around the stub of her arm and tightened it as much as possible
>Gotta stop the blood flow, gotta keep her from bleeding out
>You had looked for her arm before you left the alley but hadn't found it
>But you weren't going to stick around long
>She needed help and you were going to get her to it
>And so you run, pushing through the evening crowds of people and animal things
>A few give you terrified stares as you carry the bloody girl in your arms
>They can all go fuck themselves
>You swear to yourself as you feel yourself getting winded
>The time hasn't been kind to your physique, you hadn't been able to eat as much or work out
>You think the hospital is still about a mile away but you can't stop, how could you
>Run, run until your heart pounds in your chest and you veins pump battery acid
>Run even though your arms feel numb, supporting the limp weight 
>Run until your lungs burns 
>Then run some more
>Fueled by adreniline you finally make it to the hospital, panting and tired
>The Automatic doors open to the emergency room 
>"HELP ANYONE PLEASE" you call out loudly
>You see a nurse look at you confused then see her eyes fall to the Dog in your arms
>"OH GOD! GET A STRETCHER!" the Cat thing calls out
>In a flurry, nurses and doctors get her from you placing her on a stretcher
>You watch as  they take care of her, attempting to find blood to give the helpless creature
>But your work here is done, you got her here and helped just like she asked
>You need a seat though, it had been a long time since you had to do anything like that
>The waiting room chairs look good enough for now, and the pills you took earlier are still in your system
>Everything is spinning when you fall back into the chair roughly
>When this stuff, these pills wear off you'll leave
>Maybe one of the human nurses can give you some pills or something
>What a day
>As you sit and relax, staring at the floor you see a few pairs of shoes start in from of you
>"This is the man who brought her in" you hear a male voice
>Huh? Who are they?
>Hands grab you and lift you to your feet
>"Sir, we have some questions for you"
>Your eyes focus on cops
>A human and a dog- thing
>NOPE!
>You struggle and try to push them off you
>"NO! LEMME GO!"
>They would turn you  itno that group the BHA
>Never! you had to fight them off!
>But youre so tired and they are much stronger than you
>You're thrown to the ground and they put the cuffs on you as you struggle 
>So this is what you get for helping someone, you get arrested
>They physically lift you as you try to fight them off you still and carry you into the back of a police car
>You're thrown into the back of the patrol car roughly
>"Figures a fucking drugged hobo would attack a defenseless woman" you hear one of the officers say 
>What? They think you did it?
>Figures they would
>You feel the car start as you lay face down in the patrol car
>Fuck these guys, they don't know anything


>You sit in a jail cell waiting for something
>Waiting for anything to happen
>How many hours have you been in here?
>Long enough for the pills in your system to wear off
>Ugh what a waste of good pills and drugs
>Whatever they wanted from you they wouldn't get it
>After a while a few officers come and hand cuff you then drag you  to an interrogation room
>Literally
>You fought the whole way there
>In the end though you're handcuffed to a table and sitting across from  german shepard thing
>"So sir. why dont we start with your name, im officer Davies"
>You frown
>"Fuck off, dog get me a person to talk to"
>He bares his teeth at you
>"Is that why you hurt that girl you speciest scum?!"
>Speciest?
>"Whats a speciest? Is that some kinda weird insult in this world?"
>When you say that his ears perk up
>"This world? Are you?" He eyes you  "One sec" he says before leaving the room
>You look over at the one way mirror and frown at your reflection
>Long matted dirty hair, a scruffy straggely beard,  clothes covered in dirt and refuse and cold eyes
>How long had it been? you lost count of the days
>About 5 minutes later a human comes in wearing a suit and tie
>"Hello sir, I'm going to ask you a question that might seem weird but, What do you know about the cold war?"
>You frown? he wants a godddam history lesson? What is this a joke?
>"You mean like the cuban missile crisis and the red scare? Hiding under your school desk from nukes?"
>His eyes go wider and wider as you answer
>"Wow, you're really from the other world"
>Your frown deepens 
>"You mean the normal world where animals aren't treated like people?"
>He looks you over and frowns back
>"Is that why you hurt that woman? Shes only about 20 and you know they couldn't save her eye"
>That makes you mad
>Really really mad
>"Did you even talk to her? I didn't do that to her! She called for help and i carried her 3 miles to that hospital!"
>Another man in a suit enters the room and whisperes something into the First mans ear
>"My associate tells me that there were reports of a man matching your description carrying the victim, Ms. Cameron, to the hospital, but that doesn't mean that you didn't assault her in a drugged up stupor"
>You sigh and slump back against the chair angrly
>"I'm not talking to you anymore, you aren't listening to me anyway, plus you never read me my Rights"
>The men look at each other and frown
>You knew you had them at that, in almost every state, at least the ones in your world, the police had to read a person thier rights when they are in custody before asking questions
>And these guys had been asking questions
>The men leave the room and you're left in the room for a while
>How long you don't know but long enough for you to fall asleep
>The sound of the door opening stirs you awake
>A man wearing a cowboy hat walks in and sits down opposite you at the table
>"Howdy there, I'm just here to let ya know you ain't under arrest or nothin'. People call me Hank and I'm with the BHA"
>You remember the BHA, men in Blacked out vans looking for you when you first arrived
>"You mean the feds? here to brainwash me to thinking these animals are people?"
>He actually smiles at that and chuckles to himself
>"They're called Anthros, and yes they are smiliar to feral animal but they are people, just a different kinda people. They aint much different in terms of who they are or how they act, just looks no different from a white person or a black person"
>Anthros? Fancy name and a lot of extra explaination for saying they ARE animals but legally they are people.
>"Fine animal people, What do you want anyway?" you ask calmly
> "Well first off your name, and secondly what year did you come here?" he says with a smile
>"Anon. I don't know what year it is here but I go pulled here summer of 2013"
>His eyes go wide
>"Oh man thats a while...tell me more about what happened"
>So you do
>You tell him about how you were transported and where you were
>What you did as a job
>About the Drugs and alcohol
>And all about your family
>You hoped that he would telll you there's a way back to your world that you could return and see your family
>Or at least tell you that there was a way to know they were ok
>But he told you what you feared the worst
>There was no way home, there was no way to find out about your family
>You were stuck here with nothing
>You feel your heart sink further than ever
>No way home
>"Look Anon, we can help you at the BHA but you gotta get clean, we can send you to rehab but it's on you"
>Huh? Help? 
>"What do you mean help? I've got nothing here"
>He smiles
>"We know you've got nothing but the BHA is here to help Anonymous memebers like you; thats what you are by the way; Anonymous, people like you got transported here"
>They'll help you, get a shell of your life back together? 
>For What?
>"Whats the catch?"
>He shakes his head, "no catch, its our job, you get clean, we shack you up in a temporary home until you can get on your feet"
>You sigh
>"Rehab huh? Alright then, how do we get this started?"
>You hear what sounds like shouting from the other side of the glass
>After a moment one of the men is suits bursts in yelling
>"You can't Just Let him go! he brutally attacked a young Anthro!"
>Hank Stands and looks the man over
>"He's our responsibility now, if by chance he DID do this we can turn him over to you once you do some investigating WITHOUT voliating his rights next time"
>The man in the suit, you never learned his name but he looks utterly defeated
>"Fine but we want full details on where he will be"
>You rattle the handcuffs holding you to the table
>"Can I get uncuffed now?" you ask 
>Grumbling the suit uncuffs you and lets you go
>You rub your wrists and stand up
>Maybe it was time to turn your life back around



Chapter 3:  Beauty of a Hidden Heart

>It burns, it all burns
>You skin crawls and you feel like you’re going to puke at any moment
>Withdrawal is being a bitch and a half and you're only 2 days into the detox process
>Now you knew why those junkies would just keep themselves high
>Except you are the junkie
>The Bureau of Human Assistance, or the BHA, the people you avoided so actively were there to help all along
>They were paying for this Rehab for you
>It was a high end place too, you got your own room
>Hank said they had failed you, that you living in the streets should have never happened
>He told you an expert in Human assistance would come as well as another Anonymous Member
>But when they would come he hadn't told you, but he did say it would be sometime this week
>You hoped it was soon, you wanted to know how to live again
>How to be a person
>How to cope with losing everything
>More than everything, Losing your family, the love of your life and your kids
>How do you get back to being the person you were, when they were the reason you were
>They had been the best of you
>And you had been here how long?
>Hank told you it had been 5 years
>Five long years on the street
>Amanda would be 11, Derek would be 9...
>You had missed them growing up
>For what? You were given no real reason as to why you were pulled here
>Only a bunch of Half-assed "No one knows"
>You look in the mirror at the shell of your former self
>Dressed in white hospital garments, hair clean and free of knots but still long and unkempt
>Your facial hair had grown wild, you looked like a crazed version of Hagrid from harry potter
>A knock at your door and in pop the head of a Human nurse
>They don’t bother waiting for an answer here for some reason but they learned to peek first
>The last time they just entered it was an big wol- Ahem- a Wolf Anthro
>How else does someone react to a Fucking hug wolf tearing open the door than to throw the first thing in reach at it?
>Turn out for you the first reaction was the throw a lamp at it- Him- right him not it
>But a human you’re ok with
>"Mr. Anon? You have a few visitors, try to stay calm"
>It must be them, finally
>You're about to answer when in walks a tiger
>A FUCKING TIGER
>This is like a bad version of some gladiator game
>You trapped in a small room with an apex predator and no weapons
>A certain British man’s voice hits you
>IMPROVISE ADAPT OVERCOME
>You jump to your Closet and rip out the hanger bar
>Fuck this you aren’t going down without a fight
>"ANON PLEASE CALM DOWN YOU!" you hear the nurse shouting
>Fuck that! It’s a goddam tiger
>As you go to swing your improvised club at the tiger something hits you in the chest sending you sprawling out onto the floor
>"Calm down, I know you're scared but try to avoid attacking us"
>You look up from the floor, rubbing your head
>In front of the tiger is a man
>Heavily scarred and wearing an eyepatch, he look like he belonged in a modern Wild West film
>Somehow not only had he decked you but also gotten ahold of the bar you had in your hands
>But his calm stern voice calm you down 
>"Sorry...sorry I'm just not used to...them" you say, looking away
>"Anthros?" you hear him say
>You look up at him
>He is offering you a hand to help you up
>You take it and he pulls you to your feet with ease
>"Yea... Anthros" you say still not making eye contact with either
>A hand falls on your shoulder, making you jump and look at him
>"Come on, let's all talk. Maybe somewhere a little more open" he says with a slight smile
>You nod and avoid looking the tiger
>As much as they tell you it’s ok to be near them, memories of people torn apart by animals float in your head
>Even koalas, those Chlamydia infested fucks, were dangerous in your world
>And Here you had seen them walking around 
>Where they also infected? Not that you really cared for the answer
>The duo lead you to an outside courtyard, a picnic table sits in the center under a dogwood tree whose petals rain like snow
>You sneak a few peeks at the tiger as it- she sits
>Is she pregnant?
>You feel a twinge of guilt in your stomach
>Was this who you wanted to be? A man who attacked pregnant animals
>Not animals
>People
>You sit opposite them and finally look at the tigers face and notice her eyes
>Green like American money
>You quickly look away
>"Come on now, I won't bite" She says calmly
>You fight your urge to run as you look up at her
>Yea, that’s a tiger, a white tiger, that’s smiling at you with her large fangs exposed
>"There you go! See! I'm not gonna attack you or anything, although I must say your reaction to seeing me was a bit more...violent.... than I expected" She says calmly
>You look back down
>"Sorry, I'm just no used to this yet"
>More guilt 
>You tried attacking her and she’s being nice
>Something fuzzy on your hand makes you jump and pull it back to you across the table quickly
>"Sorry! I didn't mean to startle you!" you hear her voice
>You look back up
>Come on man! Keep it together
>It’s just a giant murder cat and a dude that makes Clint Eastwood look like a pussy
>Clint Eastwood never even existed here! Why does that bother you so much right now!?
>Breathe, Introduce yourself
>"It's ok, just not used to this, I'm Anon"
>You extend a hand, a Shivering, shaky hand
>But it’s still your hand
>She takes it slowly and gently
>This must not be her first rodeo
>"Jasmine, pleasure to meet you Anon"
>Fuzzy paw and sharp claws
>You would be lying if those didn't make you nervous
>Those sharp fangs of hers too
>When she lets go she introduces her friend
>"And this is my lovely husband!" she says enthusiastically motioning to the man who knocked you over like you were a child
>Husband? Humans and Anthros together? This opens up a whole new world of confusion to you
>Also no wonder he was so fast to defend her, you would have done the same for Amanda...
>He seems to sense your confusion and unease as he extends a hand to you
>"People call me Chick, I'm Anonymous like you are and I’m sure you have questions"
>You sigh and look at him then her then back at him
>"First things first" you say with a knot in your throat "Can I ever learn what happened to my family? I was driving andIgotPulledAndThen...” 
>You feel the tears forming and your mouth stop working
>You know the answer already but you need to confirm it with someone who has been through it
>"There's no way to know for sure, not unless another Anonymous member appears with knowledge of them" He says solemnly
> Tears run silently down your face as you look at him
>"None?" you choke out
>He shakes his head
>"I’m sorry Anon, there's nothing we can do"
>You hang your head, and wish you could do the same to your body
>"What- Who did you leave behind Anon?" you head Jasmine's sorrowful voice
>Its almost instinct how you reach into your pocket for the picture of your family
>How many times a day did you do it? 
>Even when your old torn clothes got taken you saved the only memoir from your old world
>You slide it across the table to them, tears running down your face as you point each out
>"Ashley was 6 when I left, she wanted to be a news broadcaster"
>"Derek was 4, he said he wanted to be a firefighter like me"
>"Amanda was my high school sweetheart, we said we would always be together"
>That last part made you fall forward into your arms, sobbing quietly 
>Always together can sometime mean together as long as the universe thought you deserved it
>By now, if she was still alive she might be remarried
>Living a whole new life where you were a distant memory, a scar in the back of her mind
>Would your children even remember you?
>It all hits you again like tsunami, washing over you and drowning you in sorrow
>A fuzzy paw rests on your hand which is still on your families’ portrait
>"I'm so sorry Anon, I can't even begin to say I understand" jasmine says, you can hear her choking back tears
>You look up at her and chick, tears still in your eyes
>Even with your vision blurred you can see the tears forming in her eyes
>And Chick is... stoic, a face you've seen before
>A look on the face of your fellow firefighters when they lose something
>When you emerge from a fire with a dead child in their arms
>A face trying hard to not show the pain
>So he was like you
>How like you, you don't know, but you weren't going to ask
>You knew how it felt to try to describe your past life
>He seems to also want to change the subject, for your sake, and maybe in some part for his
>"When you were found, they said you carried a Dog Anthro 3 miles to the hospital where you were arrested, if you're so scared of Anthos, why would you do that? He asks, his voice monotone, but with a slight crack of emotion
>It was barely there but you picked up on it
>Maybe
>You wipe your eyes and look at him
>"Honestly? I didn't know she was an Anthro when I saved her, I heard crying for help and I just...acted... and when she passed out I couldn't just leave her to die, I’m not a monster"
>He nods, maybe in approval, maybe in understanding
>"You can trust Anthros you know, they won't try to hurt you, they are just people like you and me"
>You at him, eyeing the scars and eyepatch
>"Promise I can?"
>He nods and digs into his pocket before pulling out a photo of his own
>Its him, Jasmine, a tall man with his arm around a snow leopard, and a gruff man with holding a raccoon in front of him
>All of them are smiling and happy
>He points to each human
>"3rd Generation Anonymous, Married to a snow leopard" he points to the tallest one
>"First generation Anonymous, Married to a raccoon"
>Jasmine smiles happily and digs through her purse and pulls out a small book
>She flips it open, revealing a photo album and points to each picture as she does
>"1st generation married a Maned wolfess, 1st Generation married to a Hybrid..."
>She goes on and on
>1st gen, 2nd gen, 3rd gen Anonymous
>Happily married to Anthros, some with children
>"You can trust us Anthros Anon, we are people like you, just a bit fuzzier" she says, intentionally causing her fur to fluff out a bit
>You actually stifle out a bit of a laugh
>"I-I'll try" you say meekly
>"Good, because I have someone who wants to meet you really badly" Jasmine says with a toothy smile as she taps away at a phone
>Who would want to meet you?
>You don't know anyone here
>Chick looks a bit uneasy, looking from you to the tigress
>"You sure about this love?" he says quietly
>You're sure you weren't meant to hear that but you did anyway over the quiet taps of clawed pads hitting glass
>"mhm, trust me!"
>What are they talking about?
>You're left to sit and ponder that for a moment before a familiar feminine voice sounds off behind you
>"UH h-hi"
>No
>It can't be
>You turn around and see her
>The dog you saved from the mob
>Wearing a blue and white button up shirt and jeans
>And with a medical bandage covering her left eye and bandages wrapped around what would be her right arm
>Even now in your disbelief she stands awkwardly, her remaining purple eye focused on you
>"Anon this is Madeline Cameron, the Anthro you saved" you hear Jasmines voice
>You barely hear her
>Her screams echo back to you
>The mob surrounding her
>The smell of her blood that covered you as you ran
>You stare as she nervously shuffles next to you
>"Uh... Hi...I'm Madeline, My friends call me Mattie" the Dog says to you 
>She raises her stump, frowns at it then raises her left paw to you
>Hesitantly you stand then reach up and shake it
>Fuzzy paw
>You look at her, light brown fur covers her body, her hair is cut short
>Her ears end in black fur and she has an uneasy smile\
>"T-thank you Anon, they told me you carried me 3 miles and that you used your belt to apply a tourniquet to keep me from bleeding out" 
>She has a cute voice, that’s a bit higher than you expect
>You feel her eye studying you
>It makes you suddenly self-conscious
>You need a haircut and to shave badly
>But they wouldn't let you have sharp things here so that would have to wait
>She sits next to you at the table as you sit
>"Anon was a firefighter before he got pulled here, we're working on getting him recertified" Jasmine says with a smile 
>They were? News to you but whatever you needed a job
>"So you have no family here?  Who is here to visit you and stuff?" Mattie asks with a frown
>You frown slightly
>"Anon doesn't have anyone besides us right now" Jasmine answers for you
>"Oh....can I visit you again then, you saved my life I would feel awful just leaving you here" 
>Mattie looks up at you then her ears fold down
>You recognize that! That’s what dogs do when they are unsure!
>Moose used to do that....
>"You don't mind if I visit you, do you Anon?"
>You sigh
>Might as well get used to being around Anthros
>"I don't mind Mattie, I could use the company" you say looking at her
>Her short tail wags slightly as you answer
>When you look up you see Jasmine beaming at you with a smile
>"That’s good progress to getting you used to Anthros Anon" Jasmine says before looking at her cell phone
>"Oh shoot, we have to go! We have a doctor’s appointment, it was nice to meet you Anon" 
>Both Jasmine and chick stand up
>You stand up as well and shake their paw and hand, respectively
>Mattie stands as well and looks at you
>"I have to go too Anon, my parents are worried about me and came into town"
>She sticks out her left paw, which you shake 
>"Thank you again, I’ll see you again soon"
>She leaves the courtyard, leaving you underneath the dogwood tree
>The petals billow past as you stand and a shiver runs down your spine
>So this was it then
>The start of your new life
>But were you ready for it?
>You breathe deep and head back to your room
>It doesn't matter if you’re ready or not
>You just have to keep on living


Chapter 4: Broken

>Withdrawal was proving to be a bitch and a half
>Turns out you had a mix of drugs in your system because you never even bothered to learn what it was that you took
>As such, you got hit with a tsunami of symptoms
>Nausea, Shivers, headaches, joint pain, you name it
>It had been 6 days since Jasmine, Chick and Mattie had visited you
>And as sincere as Mattie sounded when she said she would visit you, you doubted she would
>Why would she?
>Who would want to visit a junkie hobo?
>Hopefully not a girl like her, she seemed nice enough even though she was a dog
>So you sit in your room, suffering in silence
>They offered you some other kinda drugs to wean you off but you refused
>It didn't make sense to you
>"Here take more drugs to get you off drugs"
>Dumb logic to you so you sat alone in your room
>There was an area you could go out and watch TV and socialize, but there were too many anthros out there
>How do people come here and just accept it?
>How do they come to this world and just see animal people and say "oh ok cool"
>Maybe they didn't have the panicked wake up you did
>A scrambling crawl through an alley looking for your family
>Was it just because you had so much to lose? So much you had lost?
>Your thoughts are broken by a knock at your door
>"Anon? You have a visitor" 
>Jasmine had requested you have an Anthro nurse or helper or whatever her title was
>An anthro border collie Named Michelle
>She was nice enough to you, although she often wanted you to go out and socialize
>Nope, you needed to get used to this on your own pace
>It was taking a while but you were getting there
>How weird was it to see these animals that look like your pets back home
>No...Not back home
>This was your home now, there was no way to go back
>"Anon?"
>You snap back from your mental detour and focus back on Michelle
>"Uh.. right.. let them in" you say, not trying to sound dismissive
>But you can't quite look at her, she reminded you too much of your childhood pet
>But with boobs and hair
>Michelle disappears behind the door frame and ushers in Mattie, who gives a small, but warm smile
>"Hi Anon, you cleaned yourself up I see" she says, her purple eye studying your face
>You run your fingers through your hair and down your now clean shaven face
>"Yea... couldn't stay looking like that" you say attempting to smile
>The small Canine girl looks around your room quickly until her eye rests on the photo of your family
>"Is this...Them? Your family I mean?" she says stepping closer to it
>Every instinct is telling you to leap forwards and snatch the picture away, but you resist it
>She's just a girl coming to thank you
>Not a monster
>Just have a conversation with her
>Easy right?
>You swallow hard and step forwards
>"Yea, that's Amanda, and Derek and Ashley and our dog Moose" you say as you point out each one of them
>It's hard holding back the emotions in your voice
>She steps away from it instantly
>"Sorry! Sorry! I know that must be a tough subject"
>You sigh, turn and then sit on your bed
>"Don't be sorry Mattie, It's not your fault"
>She walks over and sits next to you
>"I'm still sorry that happened to you, I can't imagine what you went through"
>You look over at her and see her looking down at the floor
>Tears forming in her eye
>Fatherly instincts kick on
>"Hey Hey! Look, I'm...dealing with it, if anything I'm sorry"
>She give a light sniff then looks at you
>"Y-You? Sorry? For what?"
>You frown slightly and your eyes fall on the stump that was her arm
>"That... if I hadn't been on whatever drugs, I might have been able to find and save your arm...." you trail off, looking down
>It had bothered you for days
>Her arm couldn't have just disappeared
>And in your drugged haze you might have just glazed over it 
>The guilt was in the bottom of your stomach like a pit
>A fuzzy touch, padded fingers grip the top of your hand
>"You saved my Life, you beat those men up with a pipe, put a tourniquet on me and THEN and carried me 3 miles, you did more than enough"
>You grip her paw
>Honestly this was the only real meaningful contact you've had with someone since you got taken
>But meaningful doesn't need to be dreary; so it was best to change the subject
>"So uh Mattie, do you have a job or school or something?"
>She frowns a bit
>"I was in school to be a Pharmacist, but I've had to take time off because of the injury"
>Pharmacist? That means she could get you...
>NO
>You shake the thoughts out of your head
>Rehab is for getting better, not for pressuring the only creature here to show you compassion into getting you drugs
>But you felt hollow
>Those drugs filled the hole your family left
>You were going to have to find a way to fill it, to not have a hole in your soul anymore
>Or at least learn to live with it there
>"And you Anon? What did you do before? I recall Jasmine said you were a firefighter" Mattie asks with a small smile
>You focus back on Mattie
>Had you always wandered in and out of thoughts?
>Must have messed with your cognitive functions along the way
>"I was a firefighter. But I was also an EMT"
>You look into Mattie's deep purple eye and she smiles
>"That explains how you were able to hit those guys so hard" 
>Heh something like that
>In times of stress, muscle memories come back like a flood
>All those hours training to get through doors
>Hours spent cutting through drywall to look for the last ember to put out
>What you assume is Mattie's Cell phone rings a few short rings, causing her to jump slightly
>"Oh! Sorry Anon, one sec!" she says with her ears folded down
>Digging through her purse quickly, she fished up a cell phone with a small charm made out of coins with holes in them
>Japanese coins? You can't tell from here
>"Hello? hi Mom, oh... I'm with Anon"
>She mouths a quick "Sorry" to you
>"Yes the guy who saved me.. Huh?"
>Her remaining eye goes wide and you swear you can see the color drain from her face despite all the fur
>"NO! NO NO Mom! He's Not used to Anthr- Hello?"
>She looks at her phone, wide eyed
>"FUCK!... Uh.. Anon, How would you like to meet my parents?"
>You blink twice at her, mouth agape
>If you were a computer you would have a Loading bar
>"Parents? what?"
>She gives you a small apprehensive smile
>"Yyyyyes? They want to meet you and thank you"
>You give a small sigh, looks like you can't get out of this
>She gives a small smile of sympathy
>"Please Anon, they really wanna meet you, plus I think you should get out of here for a bit...Michelle told me you just stay in here all day"
>You feel a small squeeze on your hand 
>"Please?"
>Perhaps you could use a little time out of here, out of the alley and out of the streets
>But were you ready to be out there?
>You look down and away from her, trying to avoid her eye contact
>But your gaze falls on the picture of your family
>Would they be proud of what you were doing? Trying to hide from thankful parents?
>Hell, you would do the same thing if someone saved Ashley....
>"OK Mattie, I'll meet them" you say with a bit of hesitation
>You look back to her and see her grinning broadly
>"Thank you Anon" She sighs out with a bit of relief
>"For the record I tried to tell them you aren't too fond of Anthros..."
>You frown
>"It's not that I'm not fond of anthros Mattie"
>She stares at you with her head cocked to the side
>"I never really got, I Dunno, introduced to them in a non shocking way I guess? I woke up in a panic to find my family only to have"
>You motion to her in mock shock
>"THIS! People out of a story book or a children's movie but real! Walking, talking animals! And honestly you're the only one I've talked to more than a few seconds!"
>She squeezes your hand tighter
>"Well I hope I'm giving you a good impression" 
>How could she not?
>No other person, human or anthro, would give you the time of day
>Yet here an anthro was talking to you 
>She even visited you like she said
>You stand and she follows suit
>"Lead on, I guess" you mumble hesitantly
>A quick nod and the small Canine is leading you gently out the door and through the rehab center
>"Ms. Cameron, already lea- Mr. Ymous, you're out of your room!?
>Michelle stands at the nurses station, wide eyed and mouth agape
>"I'm Borrowing Anon! I'll bring him back later!" Mattie calls out as she pushes past the shocked nurses
>You're lead into the street, where you stand shivering and looking around quickly
>So many of them... so many different kinds
>Lizards? Felines? Birds? Bovines?  
>So many different kinds of Anthros rush past you in this bustling city that you don't even know the name of
>Iron weighs down on your feet, your eyes shift quickly and you feel your body shiver
>Too many!
>Too Much!
>Barking! Squawking! Mewling!
>Your lungs feel like they are going to collapse, your heart is going to implode with how fast it's beating
>Vague shouting, a somewhat familiar voice
>One you just barely got accustomed to
>"ANON!"
>A sharp tug on your arm and you're staring at Mattie
>"Hey there... Stay here with me... Focus on me, come on"
>You breathe deep and keep you eyes locked on her, trying to ignore the anthros pushing past
>A quick chirp from her phone and she breaks contact with you to dig in her purse again
>Your hand feels somehow incomplete without her paw there
>Was it because you were out here? There were only 2 real anchors you had in this world at the moment
>Your alley; a smelly dark place where you could hide until your final days
>And her, a small anthro you barely know
>Pathetic, once you think about it
>Mattie is holding her phone in her paw, texting and cursing to herself
>You see her stump move a bit each time she swears
>"Do you need help?" you ask calmly, looking for something to do with your hands
>She looks up at you quickly, a slight look of annoyance on her muzzle
>You put your hands up, unsure of what you did
>"Uh sorry Madeline, just trying to help"
>Her face softens at that
>"Just Mattie Anon, and its not your fault, I just have to get used to this I guess" she waves the bandaged stump at you as she speaks
>Another wave of guilt, another stab of sorrow
>"Not that it's your fault!" she says quickly as she grasps you hand and pulls you to a parking garage nearby
>You must have had a frown on your face
>"Come on, my parents will meet us here"
>You're dreading meeting her parents to be honest
>How could you look them in the eye?
>You're a drug addicted loser who let their daughter lose an eye and an arm
>She has a firm hold of your hand when a car pulls up
>How long has it been since you paid attention to car models?
>Well, you know the answer
>5 years
>5 years of being out of the loop on everything
>Even more so because this world has different types of cars to accommodate different sized anthros and their various limbs
>Bigger cabs for antlers, seats with holes for tails to peek through, sunroofs for giraffes
>Pretty neat considering 
>But a Black car parks in front of you and Mattie, who holds your hand in anticipation
>No matter how mentally prepared you think you are, the explosion of fur and emotion is more than you bargained for
>A small cannon ball of fur hits your midsection in a hug, knocking the wind out of you 
>You let go of Mattie's paw and double over, the pint sized furball latched onto your stomach
>"THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!!!!!"
>You gasp and fall over, the wind knocked out of you 
>A few coughs escape you as you try to pry the whatever it is off you
>"Jesus Beth, Let the man up" you hear a distinct male voice chime in
>The fuzzy missile lets go and back off, leaving you winded and on the ground
>"Sorry, I got too excited...." 
>You feel a paw and a hand offer to help you up
>Grasping both, you're lifted to your feet
>Mattie has one hand and the other is a human
>Not what you expected when Mattie said her parents where coming
>As you stand, you see a small dog anthro about Mattie's size and a Human
>Standing tall and with a confident smile, he helps you too your feet
>You're at a loss for words
>"Wait.. Humans and anthros can mix?" you ask before you can stop yourself
>Then the thought of Jasmine and Chick float back into your head
>As you say it you realize how much of a dick you sound like
>But water off the man's back, he smiles instead
>"Ah Mattie told us a bit about you, don't know much about this world huh?" he says with a smile
>The Small dog anthro next to Mattie hugs her tight and then looks to you in anticipation, only to be held back by the man
>"Calm down Beth... this poor man had a rougher time than I did coming here" 
>A Hand is extended to you calmly
>"Chase Cameron, first generation Anonymous, like you" the man says confidently
>The hand lingers for a moment as you stare at it, trying to catch our breath
>You reach out and shake it uneasily
>"Anon, uh...Yea, nice to meet you" 
>How you gasped that out is beyond you, the furry projectile knocked everything out of you
>"Elizabeth Cameron!" 
>The offending cannonball has pushed between you and Chase, her eyes alight with a fire you haven't seen before
>Her paw is extended to you, however it quivers with anticipation
>You go to grasp it only to have your hand pushed out of the way and have Her latch onto you once again
>"THANK YOU ANON"
>You look to Mattie, who can only give a half-hearted smile
>Looking down, Beth is holding your waist like a vice grip
>"You Saved our only daughter, even though you had such a bad time with anthros"
>A quick look around for some relief shows that Mattie and Chase are both standing back, letting this play out
>Yes, this was a meaningful show of affection, but Seriously you don't want a hug
>Hesitantly, you pat Beth's head, even though you're unsure if that's ok
>"hey now, I was just doing what anyone would do" you say calmly, hoping your words will make her loosen up on you
>Unfortunately it has the opposite effect and she tightens around you more
>"NOOOO! You saved her! THANK YOU!"
>You look to Mattie only to see her face palm (Face Paw?) at her mother's antics
>"Mom please, he don't know how to interact with anthros yet! Plus you're embarrassing me!" Mattie sighs, finally coming to your Aid
>All of your attempts to squirm away result in a tighter hug
>The canine looks up at you with tears in her eyes
>"We can never repay you Anon... We don't know what's happened to you but you can always call us for a hand!"
>Finally Beth lets you go and rejoins her husband
>"Mattie said you were homeless for a while Anon, why don't we at the very least treat you to dinner?"
>Your body shudders violently and completely involuntarily, causing you to collapse
>"Anon?! You ok?" Mattie cries as she rushes to your side
>You start getting up slowly and cautiously
>"Withdrawal Mattie, not ok at all really"
>Beth looks you over a bit differently now
>"Withdrawal? like drugs?"
>You grimace and look away
>"I haven't had a great time in this world" 
>You feel Mattie's paw wrap around your hand once more
>"Well, let's make it better then, I can help you in this world as repayment for saving me"
>A firm hand falls on your shoulder, and chase gives you a small shake
>"What you've done to yourself was terrible, but we aren't here to judge that alright? Mattie, send me the address of the rehab center, we'll just have to settle for pizza for now" He says with a smile
>Beth grips you in another hug
>"We'll see you in a moment!"
>They break away and get into a black Mustang and pull away as Mattie walks you out of the parking Garage
>"Well uh, they seem nice" you finally choke out
>"Dad came from your world a while ago, so he understands what you're going through kinda" 
>Mattie pulls you along slowly and more cautiously this time
>"You Ok Anon? Sorry about mom's hugs, she nearly reopened my stitches hugging me when she saw me at the airport" 
>You wave it aside
>"I understand as a parent, I can't hold it against her" you say with a small smile
>Seeing the level of parental concern was refreshing
>It was so very...human
>You both walk quietly back into the rehab center and back to the courtyard
>You sit underneath the dogwood tree and feel the petals rain on you as Mattie fishes her phone out of her purse again to text her father
>"You like pepperoni right? that Moms favorite and mine too" she asks as she texts
>Heh a dog likes meat, not surprising
>You nod calmly as you answer, realizing shes probably looking at her phone
>"Yea pepperoni is fine"
>Mattie smiles as she types away, mouthing out the words she texts
>Cute
>"Ok they are coming with Pizza!"
>How long has it been since you had fresh pizza?
>You sit and chat With Mattie about this world
>The culture, the music, the TV
>How to anthro couples work? If one is a dog and one is a cat can they breed?
>She got a little annoyed when you said "Breed" though
>"Not Breed Anon! That's for animals! We aren't animals!"
>Well fuck, how were you to know what terms to use
>By talking to her, you guess
>Before long Beth and Chase arrive with a few pizzas
>One bite and the flashbacks to your home are coursing in your head
>Ashley's Pizza party when she turned 5
>Yours and Amanda's first date...
>So many years of eating old food out of dumpsters and trash cans must have killed your care for real food
>That or the drugs made you not care
>The talks you have with the Cameron family is amazing
>Chase tells you of the historical differences
>No cold war, no red scare
>Beth tells you about different Anthros and how they like to live
>Mattie tells you of how medicine is so different here
>Before long you realize it's nearly 11 at night
>Michelle is poking her head into the courtyard looking both impressed and a little sad
>"Hey guys I'm sorry but we have to start closing up, I know you're making great progress with Anon but visiting hours ended hours ago" 
>Beth and Chase wish you a good night and leave, taking the leftover pizza with them
>You walk with Mattie to the exit door before she stops and looks to Michelle
>"Can I Stay the Night with Anon Michelle? you can say its part of his integration right"
>you look a bit confused at Mattie then to Michelle
>Why would she want to stay here with you?
>Michelle pulls her jowls a bit and looks a bit distressed
>"Well...Mrs.Jasmine did say we have to get you used to Anthros so uh...."
>Mattie tugs Michelle's arm and looks up at her with her single purple eye
>"Pleaseee I don't want to leave Anon here alone!"
>Michelle swears under her breath and sighs
>"Fine! But it's only because he needs more contact with anthros!"
>Mattie does a short jump and pulls you back to your room
>As you enter the room and close the door behind you, you give Mattie a quizzical look
>"Why would you wanna stay here with me Mattie?"
>She kicks off her shoes before turning and looking at you
>"Uh...Don't tell my parents ok?"
>You nod
>"Ever since...This" she waves her stump at you "I've been having nightmares about that day and just hope with you here, I can get some decent sleep"
>This poor girl...How silly could you be to think she would only be physically scathed 
>She must have been putting on a brave face for her parents so they wouldn't worry
>You nod and go to your closet
>"I don't have much in the ways of pajamas but I have uhm.. this"
>You toss her a t-shirt
>She looks at it then at you and gives a small frown
>"C-can you help me change? It's a bit hard now..."
>You internally kick yourself before walking over to her
>"Ok but this is because I'm helping you, nothing sexy or whatever"
>She nods and holds her arm and stump up
>You pull her shirt off her, revealing a black sports bra
>"Keep em up" you say and you grab the t-shirt
>Carefully you slip it over her arm and head then grip her jeans and carefully pull them off her
>She stands before you with a small smile
>"Thanks Anon" she says with a smile
>You strip down to your shirt and boxers before getting into your bed
>"It's a little cramped on this twin size, I hope you don't mind"
>She gets into the bed with you 
>"I just want a good night sleep, hopefully you and your smell will help"
>As you hold open the covers for her, she gives a small sigh and cuddles back into you
>Being in a bed was weird enough after all this time, but being in a bed with someone, let alone an anthro was a whole new weird experience
>You lay with her for a while, you arm around her
>The ticking of the clock tells you it's been a while that you've layed in bed
>Was this too much too fast?
>Mattie's quiet snores, while adorable, are a bit much
>But when she starts kicking and crying in her sleep you have to act
>How many nights had you laid with your children?
>Enough to recognize a nightmare when you see one
>And enough to know how to sooth one away
>"Shuuusssshhh it's ok Ashl-Mattie. I'm here, you're ok" you coo softly to her, running your fingers through her fur
>The kicking slowly subsides along with the crying and whimpering as you gently talk to her
>Before long a small smile is on her face
>Still got it huh??
>You smile slightly and focus on the small snores before you drift off to sleep yourself

Chapter 5: Do I Want To Know?

>You awake slowly, feeling fur against you
>Heh what a crazy dream, talking animals and drug filled days
>But of course the fur you’re feeling is Moose, Amanda must've let him into the bed again when she went to work
>Hopefully there was some coffee waiting downstairs
>You stay lying in bed, eyes closed, wrestling between getting up and out of your warm bed
>Eventually the need to go to the bathroom wins out and you finally open your eyes
>Wait... this isn't your room
>Quickly you sit up and look around you room at the rehab center
>The realization that you weren't dreaming sets in again
>You feel a wave of disappointment wash over you
>But wait what about the feeling of fur
>You look down and remember that Mattie stayed with you overnight
>She is still asleep, a small smile on her muzzle
>Actually kind of cute...
>You shake your head of the thought and carefully extract yourself from the bed as to not wake her
>That skill you learned from sharing a bed with your wife
>Ex-wife? Dead wife? Were you a widower?
>The term doesn't matter
>All you know is you're single now
>Not a thought you enjoyed in the slightest
>As you get up and head to the bathroom you think about dating
>You hadn't ever really dated before
>Amanda had been your high school sweetheart, as soon as you were able to marry her you did
>As you relieve yourself you think about Anthros and humans dating
>Chick and Jasmine were together and seemed happy
>Chase and Beth obviously had “done the deed" so to speak because Mattie was there with you
>That spirals into a whole new set of thoughts
>Do Anthros have the same parts as their "feral" counterparts?
>You recall reading that kangaroos have like 4 vaginas
>As well do dogs have that weird folded thing for a vagina? 
>Fucking weird thing to think about first thing in the morning
>Slight whimpering from the bedroom gets your attention
>You shake it off and wash your hands quickly then go back to see what’s going on
>Fatherly instincts always come back full swing
>Mattie lays in your bed, a frown on her face
>She whimpers softly and her legs kick a bit
>Just like Moose did when he had nightmares
>But she isn't a dog
>Well she is but more than that
>They keep emphasizing they are people too
>Just different people...
>Either way, you place a hand on her head and rub softly
>"Hey shush it's ok, you’re ok" you whisper to her as you pet her head
>Slowly her whimpering subsides and her frown is replaced by a smile again
>Yep still got it
>Quietly you pull away and go to your closet to begin getting ready for the day
>What did you have to do today?
>Not much, stay off drugs and stay out of trouble
>You pull on some pants and change your shirt
>Someone from the "anonymous network" had donated these to you
>In fact ever since you go placed into this rehab center people have been donating things
>You would have to ask someone about why they would do that
>You remember dealing with...no not dealing with... you knew better now
>You remember talking to a few homeless people while you were in your old world
>They said most people ignored them, rather than treating them like a person
>Why was it different here?
>Maybe humans learned better here, pack mentality or something like that
>Either way you were eternally grateful
>A pang of hunger hits you
>You don't usually go to the cafeteria to get food
>No reason to, usually Michelle or one of the other nurses brings it to you
>But you're sure Mattie must be hungry as well
>Silently you slide out of the room and head to the Cafeteria
>Before you even get to it the smell of coffee and bacon waft past you
>Memories flash by as you walk
>Hanging out at the firehouse with your crew
>Brewing a pot of coffee as you got the kids ready for school and day care
>Making BLTs for dinner with the kids and Amanda
>Why did the sense tied most to memory have to be smell?
>More and more memories wash over you like hard waves
>And all you can do is try to walk through them as they crash down upon you
>New memories float up from within the depths of your brain
>They make you want those pills again
>Something, Anything; a pill or a hit from a pipe to drown those memories again
>You stop and breathe hard, resting a hand on the wall
>Why did you have to be the one pulled here?
>Why not so many of those single people, men and women without a family to leave behind
>But then again another thing chick told you floats up
>Sometimes children get pulled here, sometimes infants
>You remember all the pictures of missing children, feelings of happiness and sadness hit
>You were happy that those children might not just be dead, but sad because you think of all the parents missing their children
>Pull yourself together Anon!
>What were those breathing techniques you learned
>Breathe in for 4 seconds through your nose
>Breathe out for 4 seconds through your mouth
>Calm down, but keep a hold of those memories
>No needs to throw them away, save them
>Once you feel like you’re calm enough you continue walking to the cafeteria
>The set up they have is basically like a buffet with several different kinds of foods being kept warm
>The BHA sure got you into a top of the line rehab center
>You grab up 2 trays and begin loading them up with the basics
>Scrambled eggs, bacon, a few slices of toast, and 2 cups of coffee
>Does Mattie even drink coffee?
>Meh even if she doesn't you'll drink it
>You can feel the stares though, the other patients staring at your back
>You're aware that you're the odd man out and that they probably knew about you
>In fact one of the first few days here you got called a "Speciest" by a wolf Anthro
>You assumed it was like the word racist but ignored it nonetheless
>Plus you're sure they were trying to bait you
>Were Anthros stronger than humans? Were different ones better at certain sports?
>What about the Olympics? How do those work? Is there a human category?
>Fuck were their just species categories?
>So many things to ask and learn about this world
>Well actually you have a person to ask
>Mattie had lived here her whole life and could probably answer things for you
>You steadily but quickly head back to your room and with a bit of trouble get the door open
>It’s hard to open a door when both your hands are full but you made it work
>Do opossums have prehensile tails? Can they grip stuff with them?
>Might be handy for carrying things
>As you enter the room you see Mattie is still snoring quietly on the bed
>Quietly you set the food down and then walk over to Mattie
>Placing a hand softly on her should, you shake her gently
>"Mattie, come on time to get up" you say in a hushed tone
>She opens her eye and blinks a few times then yawns as she sits up
>"Morning Anon, what time is it?" she drowsily mumbles "mmm I finally got a good night sleep"
>You look at the alarm clock quickly "it's 8 o'clock, I got breakfast for us"
>Her ears perk up quickly
>"You got food?"
>With an over exaggerated flourish you motion to the food on the table
>Her violet eye widens in surprise and she smiles at you
>"You even got coffee? I feel flattered!"
>She gets up out of the bed and you take a moment to really study her body
>Same as a humans really, except covered in fur...
>As well her hands and feet are more reminiscent of paws
>When she turns away from you, you see her tail pokes out of a hole in her shorts
>When she turns to you, you look at her lower chest and stomach
>Huh so she has breasts but not the extra nipples
>"Uhhh like what you see?"
>Her uneasy words snap you back to attention
>"S-sorry Mattie, I just haven't seen an Anthros body before. I was wondering how different you were from humans"
>You’re flustered about looking at her so intensely
>She cocks her head at you
>"Oh...that’s right you haven't really seen Anthros huh?"
>You nod solemnly
>"Well I don't mind you looking Anon, its ok. Really!"
>She does a quick spin on her toes...Uhmm pads?
>”What do you call your uh feet Mattie?"
>She giggles at you with a smile
>She starts pointing to parts of her body that are different and telling you the terms
>"Footpaws, tail, Muzzle, snout, ears, Pawpads”
>Pretty much the same as a feral dogs
>You notice her short tail wagging quickly
>"Do you have the uh" you motion up and down your own chest awkwardly "extra Nipples"
>Mattie giggles at you and takes a step closer to you
>She grabs your hand and places it on her lower chest
>"Feel!"
>The short fur on her torso is soft and parts under your fingers
>"See no extra nipples! Just like you!" she says happily
>You pull your hand away
>"You could have just told me Mattie"
>She pouts a bit, looking hurt
>"That wouldn't be any fun!” besides you need to have SOME physical contact with Anthros"
>Ugh she’s right but you feel like she should have just told you
>Mattie looks around quickly and see's the pile of shirts you now own
>"Hey Anon can I borrow a shirt? Mines dirty and I promise I'll bring it back!"
>You nod and she digs through the pile quickly before finding a black shirt with a big skull on it
>"Ooo punisher shirt! Cool!" she says as she pulls it on awkwardly
>She’s about to sit down at the table when she stops and looks at her stump
>"Uh...Anon, i know this is a bit weird to ask before we eat but can you help me change my bandages?"
>You blink hard a few times, processing the request before saying "yes" quickly
>She gives a quick smile and digs through her purse then hands you some lotion, a roll of medical tape and a few pieces of gauze
>"Ok Mattie, I’m a bit rusty at this but I know what to do"
>You lead her over to the sink and trash can then begin slowly unwrapping the medical tape on her stump
>As you pull off, you take note of the stitches around the wound as well as all the fur that was shaved away
>"They guys who attacked me didn’t make a clean cut so the doctors had to do something to the bone so it healed right" Mattie explains as you look over the stitches for any issues
>"Looks like its healing nicely and there are no infections so that’s good" you state bluntly as you finish looking it over
>You grab a clean towel, get it wet and soapy, then gently and diligently wash around the incision site
>Next you grab a dry towel and wipe it down and then apply gauze and some medical tape
>"You're good at this Anon" Mattie whispers as she watches you work
>"I was EMT certified as well as a firefighter" you say as you look over your tape job
>Satisfied that it's not going to come unraveled you give a short nod to yourself
>"Done"
>Mattie looks it over then looks at you with a frown
>You thought you did a good job, what’s her issue?
>"What’s wrong?" you ask calmly
>Mattie's frown deepens
>"I uh- I need help with my eye patch too"
>Right, that was a thing that had to be done
>Guess either Chase or Beth had helped her before
>She scoots a bit closer to you "Please?"
>You nod, and move your hands slowly to the bandages covering her eye
>"It’s a bit weird sorry" Mattie apologizes while trying to stay still
>You pull off the bandages revealing where her eye was
>The area around the socket is shaven and a few stitches are on the eyelids, which is thankfully closed
>"Looks good Mattie" you say as you apply a new bit of gauze and tape it down
>She finally gives you a smile as you finish up
>"Ok then Mattie, let’s eat, Plus I have some questions about this world"
>She nods happily before sitting down across from you at the table
>Both of you eat ask you ask your questions
>First about history, then about other Anthro species, then about just this world in general
>It’s actually quite interesting
>You had actually finished eating a while ago but Mattie seemed to enjoy talking to you
>And you enjoyed actually having someone to talk to
>But there is still one question burning in your head
>"Mattie this is gonna sound weird" you start out with a frown
>Her ears perk up slightly
>"Hm what’s up Anon?" she asks, cocking her head to the side
>That’s the same as feral dogs
>"Oh...do you, uh I mean anthro dogs...do they have the same stuff downstairs as feral dogs?
>She blinks a few times
>"Downstairs? What do you me-." she pauses mid-sentence
>Her eye goes wide as she pieces together what you mean
>"Oh...OH! You mean do male dog Anthros have that weird knot thing and to female dog Anthros have cookies?" she says with a giggle
>You feel your face turn red as she giggles
>"WEEELLLLLL, Males do have that thing but I know *I* do not have a cookie thank you!"
>At least she didn't make you feel her this time
>But her giggling at you is making you feel like an idiot
>"Look it’s a legitimate thing! I don't know any of this biology stuff!"
>Trying to defend your curiosities makes her laugh more
>Luckily her phone goes off causing her to jump slightly
>In a panic she digs through her purse for the offending noisemaker, growing more and more flustered as she looks
>When at last she does find it, she answers with a short "hello this is Mattie"
>You watch as her eye widens and she then jumps for her footpaws
>"OK ok! I’ll be there in a bit one sec!"
>She hangs up quickly
>"My mom got an appointment at the DMV so I can take the driving test again! I have to go now Anon sorry!"
>She quickly begins putting on her socks and shoes
>You notice her shoes look new and instead of laces they have Velcro
>Smart
>Mattie heads to the door and you walk her out of you room and through the rehab center
>At the front door she stops and turns to you
>"Thank you Anon, I haven't been able to sleep well since the attack, I'll visit again soon!"
>She then hugs you unexpectedly
>You go ridged for a moment, then hug back
>"Ok Mattie, I'll see you then"
>With a smile she pulls away and leaves you standing alone in the entrance
>What’s this feeling? Something new within you that you don’t recognize
>Doesn't matter now
>You retreat back to your room
>Hopefully she'll be back tomorrow

Chapter 6: Violet City

>Weeks have passed in a flash
>Mattie visits you in rehab every time she can, and often stays the night
>She said she had nightmares otherwise
>You weren't going to shoo her away for that
>But today was a special day, the majority of your withdrawal symptoms had faded and Mattie wanted you to come with her to meet some people
>Some sort of a support group
>As well Jasmine had come and presented you with a phone that someone called "the Mechanic" bought for you
>She said he had a weird complex involving the homeless 
>You were very grateful  of course, but now your phone had only a few contacts
>Mattie, Jasmine, Chase, Beth.... that’s it
>Of course you were going to meet a few more people along the way
>You had a Firefighter re-certification course in a couple months, when you were out of rehab completely
>Rain pours outside as you try on a button up shirt and slacks
>The you in the mirror looks like you
>But you don't quite feel like you still
>Like somehow you aren't really you, just a shell made to look and talk like you
>Was the real you the druggie out there in the alleyway? Or was it the family man you had been before
>Or was it a mix of both?
>The fancy clothes and haircut, they might just be a cover up
>Because even now, although you know you don’t need the drugs, the pills or the booze
>Part of you still wants them, the nurses said that would never really go away
>You just have to be better than that
>Going through all that, through getting pulled or transported or whatever it was
>It all made you numb, numb to your feelings, numb to your health
>But being near Mattie, helping her through her hard times
>Made you feel something again
>You recall a few weeks ago, when you were sitting with a frustrated Mattie
>She had to learn to write all over again
>She had been right Han-err pawed before the attack
>As such she was learning to hold a pencil again, how to write with her left paw
>You sat with her, and did the training with her
>Using your left hand to write was harder than you thought it would be, but you wanted her to know that she wasn't alone here
>It made you feel...useful
>Like when you taught Ashley how to read
>Or Derek how to ride a bike
>But at the same time that you helped Mattie, she helped you
>While you still avoided most Anthros, you enjoyed her company at least
>Although you weren't used to the shedding
>Well you were from your dog’s growing up but not like this
>But that was something you could deal with
>Grabbing a clip on tie, you pop your collar as you think and pin it on
>What would Mattie wear? She confided in you that ever since the attack she wore sports Bras because they were easy to put on
>Most of her wardrobe was usually just shorts and t-shirts, easy things to put on
>But this was supposed to be a fancy dress event or something
>Shirt and skirt? Pants? Maybe her mom would help her put on something 
>Your phone buzzes, snapping you out of your tangent
>Fumbling with it and swearing at the technology, you manage to tap the "pick up" thing on the screen
>These smart phones sure have come a long way since you last had one...
>"Hello?"
>Her voice is kind of distant as she speaks
>"Hey Anon! I'm outside! Hurry up so we can get going"
>"Mattie? Am I on speaker or something?" you say into the phone as you walk out of your room
>"My phone is hooked up to my car, hurry up!"
>Right that was much more common now
>As you walk through the rehab center towards the front door, you wave to Michelle
>Rain patters against the glass and the street lights cut through the inky darkness of the night
>A flash back of to you in the alley, rain pouring over the box you called home
>You shake it out of your head quickly as you step outside
>"Where's your car Mattie?!" you say was you stand under an awning, trying to dry for as long as possible
>"The red One!"
>There's a quick honk from a Red Sedan on the other side of the street
>"K" you say as you hang up and prepare yourself
>You rush out from your dry sanctuary into the heavy rain
>A cold drop falls down your neck, causing you to gasp
>The memory of the first night it rained while you were in this world flood back
>The coldness, the sadness
>NO!
>Do NOT let your memories ruin this night 
>You check the street for oncoming cars before dashing to Mattie's waiting car
>Pulling open the door and sliding in quickly, you turn to Mattie and are shocked
>She looks...Amazing
>A Red Chinese dress, complimenting her light brown fur, a red Eyepatch and matching sleeve over her stump
>All tied together with Red thigh high socks
>Her Violet eye rests on you as you stare
>"I look that bad huh? I told Mom you would-"
>"Holy shit Mattie you look stunning" you say, cutting of her self-loathing tirade
>Her mouth drops open as if to retort
>"Seriously Mattie, you look gorgeous" you say before she can say anything
>You hear her tail wagging, thumping against the chair through the hole that was made specifically for Anthros with tail, her ears are perked up and she’s staring at you
>"You mean it?"
>You nod slowly, not breaking eye contact with her
>She opens and closes her mouth a few times, as if trying to process what you just said to her
>"Come on Mattie, let’s not be late"
>This snaps her out of her trance of confusion and she shift her car into drive
>The DMV appointment she had all those weeks ago was for a driving test so see if she was still able to drive with one arm and one eye
>Her depth perception might be a little off but other than that she drives fine
>You on the other hand, had to wait to get clean before you would be allowed to try
>But Mattie seemed content with driving you around for now
>"You look very handsome too, by the Way Anon" Mattie says with a small smile
>You catch her violet eye taking quick peeks at you as she drives
>What’s this? 
>A feeling in that black hole you called a soul
>Butterflies? 
>What? Why? You hadn’t felt those since...Well in a long time
>This was MATTIE, and she was an ANTHRO
>No no no, you can't have feelings like this
>Not for her! 
>But as you look at her, you can see why you have them
>This was someone who has done nothing but try to make you feel welcome in her world
>Constantly smiling and asking for nothing but to have you help her sleep
>But you did more than she asked... For what?
>"Stop Staring at Me! You’re making me self-conscious!" She says with a small grin
>You feel your face go red and look out the window away from her
>But as you look out the window, her reflection is there
>How have you never noticed her body? Or were you forcing yourself to not notice?
>Well for starters her chest was always trapped by sports bras, but you can see now they are perky and at least a solid C cup
>Thick thighs...and you can still hear her tail wagging furiously
>"So uh... who are we meeting" you say, not wanting to sit in silence for the whole ride
>This awkwardness was something totally new between you two and you hate it
>"Uhmm, there is a support group for people who lost limbs and stuff, the person we are meeting is one of the people who lead it, plus her husband in Anonymous like you!"
>Wait, that sounds familiar
>"Oh uh neat" you say, hoping she'll continues
>Thankfully she does
>"Yea they said they wanted to treat me to dinner and I wanted you to come along...after all you've helped me so much" 
>As the drive goes on she explains how she Found the group on Pawsapp (What’s Pawsapp?) and joined it, then the head of it reached out to her
>Before long though she's parking her car in a parking lot in the suburbs of the city
>You look out the car window to see a dimly lit restaurant with the name "Chiasse & Chatte" 
>"Anon there is an Umbrella in the backseat, can you grab it for me?" Mattie says as she looks in her mirror and adjusts her eye patch
>You reach back and feel it, then step out into the rain
>Popping it open and walking around to the driver’s side of the car, you open the door for Mattie and offer her your hand
>She blinks once or Twice while looking up at you then takes your hand
>"So gentlemanly" she teases as you hold the umbrella above you both, keeping her dry
>You give a small smile at her and offer your arm, leading her to the front door, which you open for her
>Following her in and shaking off the umbrella, you look around the restaurant for whomever you’re supposed to meet
>"Over there! Come on Anon!" 
>Mattie grips your hand and leads you to a table where a One armed maned wolfess and a Human are sitting, looking over the menu
>OH!
>You've seen them before! Jasmines little book of pictures! They were in it!
>The Wolfess looks up and smiles as the two of you approach
>"Sorry! I had to pick up Anon, It’s nice to finally meet you both"
>The duo stand and greet you as you shake the man's Hand and the maned wolfess’ paw
>"I'm Raquel and this is my Husband Anon, it’s nice to meet you both"
>The man is tall and thin, but with a Smart smile for you and Mattie
>The wolfess has a happy, glowing smile and has a Plastic prosthetic left arm
>"I'm Madeline, but you can call me Mattie and this is Anon, He's Also Anonymous" 
>Raquel's ears perk up a bit 
>"Oh really? Well we can call my husband by his middle name so we don’t get confused"
>The man smiles "Call me Ethan I guess"
>You smile and pull Mattie's chair out for her then take your own
>The duo sit down across from you, beaming
>"So Mattie, let’s just get this part out of the way...what happened?" Raquel says before sipping some water
>Mattie shifts in her seat uncomfortably
>You know she doesn't like to talk about it
>So you step in
>"Uh, she got attacked by a group of people, they got her arm and eye" you say as you reach your hand to her paw under the table
>She gives it a small squeeze
>"OH! I saw something about that in the news! You got saved by a homeless guy right!?" Raquel says with her eyes wide, leaning in closer
>"Yea that was me...And he's the guy who saved me" Mattie says motioning to you with her head
>Raquel sits back and looks you up and down
>"Him? But I thought..." 
>Ethan rests his hand on Raquel’s paw
>"You're the one Jasmine told us about huh? The guy who lived on the streets and was afraid of Anthros?" He says looking you up and down
>You nod slowly
>Words gets around quickly thanks to the Anonymous Network
>"He's gotten much better though! I've been helping him get used to Anthros" Mattie says with a smile
>Raquel looks you up and down
>"How long were you out there Anon?"
>Ethan steps in "Raquel don’t just-!"
>"5 years. After I lost my family, I was on the streets for 5 years"
>The Maned wolfess' ears droop and you see Ethan grimace
>Mattie's Paw squeezes your hand tightly under the table
>Raquel Must regret asking because she changes the subject quickly
>"Well uh! I lost my arm in a swimming accident! I got caught by a propeller when I was swimming in a lake! Then a little while later, I met Ethan and the rest is history!"
>She beams at Ethan, who smiles at her
>Mattie smiles too, looking at you
>"Anon has been helping me so much, he's even been doing the writing exercises with me" she says with a smile
>You smile back at her
>At that moment, an Anthro golden retriever walks to the table with a pawful of menus
>"Hi all! I’m Bessie! I'll be your waitress! Can I get ya'll something to drink?"
>Mattie gets a coke, while you order a refreshing Dr.Pepper™
>Raquel gets water while Ethan orders Asahi Beer
>And since you weren't picky, you ordered a simple cheeseburger
>The rest of the group place their orders
>For the remainder of the evening, Raquel talks about different places to go for prosthetics, different services for amputees and even places to get glass eyes
>Ethan tells you about this world, and the previous one
>Seems he came here after you, so he had a bit of insight of the last things that happened there
>Nothing about your family though
>You didn't think that he would but still you hoped
>When at last it was time for you all to leave, the restaurant had actually closed
>Raquel and Ethan had given you and Mattie their numbers
>You smiled and waved them off when they pulled out of the parking lot as you held the umbrella above you and Mattie
>"Anon, why don't we just go back to my place? It’s close by and..." her voice trails off as she looks at you
>Fuck it why not
>"Ok Mattie, let's go" you say with a smile
>Her tail wags furiously behind her as she gets into her car, leaving you to follow suit
>When she started the car and pulled out into the street you can't help but feel....nervous
>Why? This was no different than when she stayed with you at the rehab center
>But still it....Feels different
>Like there’s a tension between you two that’s never been there before
>"Thanks for coming to that with me by the way, I didn't wanna go alone"
>You smile at her and see her purple eye dart to you momentarily
>"It was no problem, thank you for inviting me" you say, trying to watch her reactions
>Over the weeks you've learned the things she likes and how she reacts
>You see her ears perk and hear the swishing of her tail
>"W-we're not far Anon, my apartment's a b-bit messy...” she stammers
>Guess you got to her, in a good way though
>"Mattie, I lived in an alley, your messy apartment is NOT going to bother me at all" you say with a sly smirk
>She lets out a short Barking laugh
>"Fair enough! I hope you don’t mid the decor” she says with a worried grin
>Decor?
>Whatever it is you're sure it'll be fine
>She pulls up to a small duplex, pointing at one of the doors,
>"Mom and dad bought me this when I started going to school, come on I’ll give you grand tour!"
>You grip the umbrella and walk Mattie to the door, where she unlocks it and step in
>"Uh... ta-da! Welcome to my lovely abode!” she says gingerly flicking on the lights
>As you walk in and look around, the first thing you notice is the stacks of books that are everywhere
>Seriously LOTS of books 
>Some are look like college text books, some say things like "Monster Manual" or "Creative Campaigning"
>As you walk through and Mattie trails behind you quietly, you notice odd little things
>Graph paper, little figurines, posters of forests, dice laying on every table and what looks to be a statue of a dragon
>What is all this? Some kinda lord of the rings thing?
>You turn to her, both confused and perturbed
>"Uh Mattie, what IS all this stuff for?" you say as you pick up a piece of Graph paper
>On it is a (Badly) drawn sketch of floorplans
>"Uhmm...I like to play DnD... You know! Dungeons and dragons! It’s uh....my favorite hobby, but I don’t tell people cuz I’m afraid I’ll get made fun of"
>She looks to you with her single violet eye
>"You probably think I’m a dork now don't you"
>You actually laugh at that
>"No, I wondered why you never told me your hobbies before" you say looking around
>Nothing too crazy here
>"Some of the guys I worked with had one of these things set up too" you say as you look over one of her sketches "You tried to draw this with your left paw didn't you? Before the training?"
>She looks down and kicks a crumpled piece of graph paper out of the way "Yes, I used to DM and play as a Bard occasionally"
>You give her a smile
>"Whatever, if it's what you like that it's what you like" you say with a shrug
>Mattie's tail wags happily as she approaches you
>"Thank you Anon, now I have a favor to ask of you...." she says with an uneasy smile while she grasps your hand
>You look around the room quickly
>"With what, cleaning up? Or..."
>You shut up, seeing the uneasy look on Mattie's face
>This wasn't a joking matter to her, that much you can tell from the folded ears and tail trying to retreat between her thick thighs
>"Help me take a bath please? I don't wanna ask my mom and it’s hard to do with one paw" she asks quickly, scrunching her muzzle as if anticipating a negative answer
>You feel the butterflies in your stomach flutter
>Why? The anticipation of seeing her naked?
>You had slept with her how many times but now you were getting anxious?
>WHAT. THE. FUCK.
>"Of course I’ll help you Mattie" you say as you pet her head softly
>She looks at you first in surprise, then in relief
>"Thanks Anon" she says with a relieved smile
>She holds you hand and leads you to her bathroom
>"Help me take this off please, I wanted to look good for you tonight..." she says as she attempts to pull off her dress
>Hesitantly, you begin undoing it for her
>Was this ok? She was only 21 and you were... how old were you again? You don't even remember
>Finally she slips out of the dress, revealing a small red bra and red panties
>Did she plan this?
>As you help her slip out of the thigh high socks, you can't help but think that the hidden bits of her body
>Behind a simple piece of fabric where her most private parts...
>NO! Now is not the time for that!
>You breathe deep and focus as you turn on the water, she pours some kind of bubble bath into the water, causing a huge amount of bubbles to spawn
>She stand of a moment, adjusting the water temperature slowly, letting you watch her
>Still, you catch her violet eye sneaking peeks at you, as if to make sure you're still watching
>When she FINALLY finds the heat she likes, she turns away from you, showing a small set of hooks on her Bra
>Words aren't needed for this part
>You gently unhook the bra then move down to her panties
>Carefully and quickly you pull them off, revealing her ass before she lowers herself into the bubbly water
>You reach into the water and feel her fur, cool and free moving underneath the bubbles
>It takes a moment for you to realize that you have NO idea what you’re doing
>But still you delve deep into the unseen, rubbing and massaging her body and fur
>You grab a bar of soap and begin scrubbing gently, savoring the feeling
>It was different from cleaning your pets, instead of a whining dog, you had a woman sighing happily as your finger dug through thick fur 
>"Ooo feels good Anon" Mattie said with a content smile as you washed her legs
>Your hands trail up her body and chest, where luckily she also is scrubbing away calmly
>What is this feeling welling up
>Disappointment?
>Did you want to wash the unseen parts of her body?
>Why?
>Don't try to kid yourself, you know why....
>But still you help your favorite Anthro clean herself, wishing that you were in the tub with her
>Sadly, all good things come to an end
>Or does it, Mattie pulls the plug to the tub, allowing the water and suds to start draining out
>"Can you please grab me a towel off the rack?" she says pointing to a bar behind you
>You sigh and turn away from her to grab the towel, only to turn back towards her and seeing her standing, a few bits of suds on her fur but otherwise gloriously naked
>You can see small shivers going up and down her body as she stands
>Was it from the cold or nervousness?
>You can’t help but stare
>Perky and full breasts, a shapely ass, and thick thighs; never mind the fact they were all covered in clinging fur
>"TOWEL!" She says sternly to you, holding out her paw
>Snapping out of your thoughts you hand her the towel, then help her dry herself
>Your hands shake as you feel her body, even if it is through a piece of fabric
>When she is dry, she gives a faint smile and grips your hand 
>"Come on Anon, Bed time"
>Still naked and wrapped in a simple towel, she leads you to her bedroom
>NO
>You shouldn’t be feeling this!
>Not towards her....this was wrong right?
>As you're pulled along you scan every bit of your brain, trying to find a reason to sleep on her nonexistent couch
>Fuck it the floor then
>But every excuse you think of has a simple counter argument: this is what SHE wants
>She leads you into her bedroom, her walls covered in posters from movies and mythical scenes from things you don't understand
>"Out of those Anon, let’s go to bed" Mattie demands, pointing to your clothes 
>Quietly and hesitantly, you strip to just your underwear
>"Nope, all the way, if I’m Naked so are you!” She says with a smirk
>When did she get so bold
>But a quick look at her tells you otherwise
>She's shaking visibly, staring at you for any signs of anger or disapproval
>Her bed is only a twin, like the one you and her were used to sharing back at the rehab center, so you can’t complain
>You slip into it, then pull off your boxers under the covers
>When you hold them up to her, her eye goes wide
>"Oh Uhmm, Yes! Bed time!"
>She clicks off the lights, leaving only a silhouette of the canine in the darkness
>'Fwoop' come forth the soft sound of her towel hitting the floor
>"Ooooooo, this is ookkkkk" you can hear Mattie Mumble through the darkness
>You lift open her covers for her
>"Just like back at the Center Mattie, its ok" 
>A sharp inhale in surprise, then a calm exhale before you feel her weight on the bed
>"Right... just like at the center" you hear unsure mumbling
>Slightly damp, yet warm fur presses against you
>Slowly you bring an arm around her and pull her into your chest
>"Goodnight Madeline, its ok" you whisper softly
>You feel her tail slowly wiggle against you
>"Goodnight Anon, thank you for everything"
>Warm fur....Careful positioning....A girl that you cared about
>It was no use trying to deny it; you cared deeply about Mattie
>And even as she drifted off to sleep in your arms
>You can't help but hope she feels the same


Chapter 7: Up & Up

>Sunlight pours through the blinds of your bedroom, telling you it’s time to wake up
>But as you open your eyes, something is off
>Yes the usual fur is there
>Wait this isn’t your room
>Quiet snoring interrupts your thoughts
>You have your arms around Mattie, who sleeps with a small smile across her muzzle
>How cute can she get?
>Cute enough for you to want to snuggle her more
>She was Mattie!
>You can't get feelings for her…Can you?
>The girl you coached, the girl who coached you
>But even as you sit and look at her, you can clearly see one thing
>She isn’t JUST a girl
>She’s clearly a woman
>A woman who is different from you, but a woman none the less
>You run your fingers across your face and through your hair
>Why did you agree to this? Why would you torment yourself with her?
>A quick look at her and her body tells you why
>Aside from being adorably nice to you from day one, Mattie had a body that was just your type
>A nice perky chest and wide hips
>NO
>That wasn't it
>She was so nice to you, never blaming you for anything and only thanking you
>As well she was just so friendly
>As you look down at her snoring sleeping body, you can't help but feel sorrow
>A missing arm...A missing eye
>She didn’t deserve this
>You did
>If you could take her place you would in a heartbeat
>But you can't...much to your disappointment
>Best you could do was make her life comfortable 
>Just like she had done for you
>You slide out of her bed quietly, pull on your under shirt and boxers before heading downstairs to her kitchen
>This was still something you remember
>Make your lover breakfast in bed
>NO! Not lover....
>Right??
>You push graph paper aside as you clear a spot on her stove then look into her fridge
>The usual things for breakfast, you would have to thank Beth for making sure Mattie’s fridge was well stocked
>Eggs, bacon, shredded cheese and butter
>As you prepare a breakfast for her memories flood back like a deluge
>Your honeymoon, waking up and preparing breakfast for your wife
>Getting up early to spoil Amanda before she got the kids up
>Just being a good husband and making breakfast for the whole family
>You shake your head as you walk to her coffee maker, starting a pot of coffee
>You would never had that life back, fate saw to that
>But maybe... just maybe you could have a mockery of it
>Setting a few strips of bacon on a frying pan, you wait for the smell to draw Mattie to you
>In the meantime, you whisk up a few eggs, mixing a little bit of milk with them to add some fluffiness
>It was easier for you to make these than it was for Mattie to make them alone
>But that wasn’t your focus, in truth for a moment...You forget that you are in a different world
>For a moment, just a singular moment...You’re back in your kitchen, with Moose begging for a scraps of food
>But reality sets back in is a quiet yawn from the stairwell
>"Mornnnning 'Nonnn" comes a quiet yawn as Mattie stumbles into the kitchen, rubbing her good eye while wearing nothing but an old t-shirt
>You stand, spatula in one hand, oven mitt over the other, waiting for it to dawn on her that you were really there
>It doesn't take long
>She sips a cup of coffee before looking up at you 
>Her eyes go wide and she nearly drops the mug before trying to pull the shirt down to cover herself
>"ANON! I-I Forgot you were here" She says, ears folded back and tail trying to escape from your vision
>You ignore it, instead opting for the "I got food" approach
>Holding up the frying pan, you smile
>"I made us breakfast Mattie" you say with a calm smile
>Luckily, that calms her down as she looks at you and the food with her one good eye
>She doesn't have on her eye patch, which hits you with a pang of guilt
>She was so young......
>And yet she was looking at you with an empty eye socket....
>She deserved better
>Hopefully you would one day get revenge on whoever did such a thing to such a poor innocent soul
>Better to let your angry tainted soul get a little dirtier than let hers get even just a smudge on it
>But that’s a thought for another time as you 
>"Hope you like Bacon and eggs with cheese" you wafting the smell of bacon and eggs to her
>She gives a few sniffs before sipping her coffee
>"Thank you Anon, it smells delicious" Mattie says as she gets a plate of eggs
>What was this sense of accomplishment?
>All you did was make eggs
>Yet, hearing it from her
>...It was better than any drug you had had in the past
>You feel you heart skipping as she draws herself nearer, albeit hesitantly, eye locked onto you and an unsure look on her face
>Your hands feel disconnected as she pulls her arm around you, and you wrap your arms around her
>And everything feels like dream when you pull her into a kiss
>Or did she pull you into it?
>All you know is it's a Kiss to blast away the dull grey years of your life
>Burying the last 5 years of torment and sadness
>Even as you tongue fights hers, all you feel is warmth, not the sadness you expected
>She wanted you
>More than anyone else had in a long time
>Let’s face it, your marriage with Amanda wasn't perfect
>If anything...She would be relieved, that vacation you took was a last ditch effort to keep your family together
>She's rid of you, even if she felt bad about it; you and her had been drifting apart
>Guess fate decided to spare you all that
>But that didn't make it hurt less
>The smell of eggs and coffee drift around you as you hold Mattie close
>She pulls away from the kiss and looks up at you, an even more unsure look painting her muzzle
>"Are you Ok with this Anon? Ok with....Me?" she says waving the small stump that was left of her arm at you
>"I mean...I'm an Anthro...And y-'
>You silence her doubts with another small kiss
>"If you're ok with me Mattie" you say with a smile
>She nods quietly and looks up at you, smiling
>That smile fills you with more bliss than any drug had
>You pull her into a hug as her tail wags furiously
>"So uh...are you my boyfriend now?" she says into your chest 
>You chuckle a bit
>"Uh...I guess I am" you say down to her, rubbing her back
>She pulls away from you with a happy smile then grabs her plate
>"Let's eat breakfast and then get to the rehab center, you need to change your clothes" she says with a smirk
>You look down at yourself and then back to her and shrug
>So what you're only wearing boxers and a undershirt
>But all you had here was your dress clothes, so you suppose she was right
>You would rather stay here today, so hopefully she'll let you do that
>The both of you eat quickly, sipping coffee as Mattie looks on her phone at the sites Raquel pointed out to her
>Prosthetic arms are surprising to you now, they had come a long way since you were "in the Know"
>Guess basically going MIA for 5 years will do that
>She shows you a few on her phone as you sip your coffee
>This world really is a bit more accommodating than your last one
>How else could you explain the BHA simply coming in and helping you get your life back together?
>Or even that different Prosthetic arms for different species and different sizes Anthros
>Jasmine had even showed you rooms that you could move into once you were out of rehab (which was hopefully soon)
>When the food is done and you’ve loaded the dishes into the Dishwasher, you head upstairs, following Mattie
>"Help me get dressed please Anon? I can do it but it’s easier if I have some help" Mattie says, eyeing you pensively
>You nod and watch as she goes to her closet and picks out a blue shirt and black shorts 
>As she digs through her drawers for underwear and a bra, you pull on your pants and dress shirt
>Better to take it with you and wash it up
>As you finish buttoning it up, Mattie presents you with a Lacey black bra and matching Panties
>"These First!" she says as she pulls off her T-shirt
>>You get the chance to ogle her body once more
>Thick thighs and waist... perfect perky tits...
>"Hey quit staring perv" Mattie laughs at you "What have you never seen a naked woman before"
>You shake your head, noting her tail wagging behind her
>"You're the only Anthro I’ve seen Naked" you say as you walk over and kneel in front of her, holding her panties out for her to step into them
>The tail wagging stops
>"Wait like.....No others? Not even like porn or anything?" she says questioningly
>Anthro porn is a thing? Wait why you are even questioning that
>There is porn of EVERYTHING
>"Nope, never bothered looking it up" you say as you look up from your kneeling position
>She puts a paw to your Face
>"OH Mr. Boyfriend...I have so Much to teach you later"
>Should you be concerned or excited?
>You decide to go with excited 
>"I'm eager to learn" you say with a smile
>She nods and turns away from you
>"Snap the panties around my tail base" she instructs
>Right, tails. You had wondered how Anthros get their pants on and this was a quick learning exercise as you help Mattie get dressed
>You finish up by helping her get her eye patch on
>"Alright! Let’s get you to the rehab center" she says in a very plucky eager way
>Something seems off about that but whatever
>She guides you out of her house and to her car the ride is quick enough if you disregard traffic
>The whole time you try to figure out how to use your phone right
>Even as you apologize profusely as you try to get anything resembling helpfulness Mattie shrugs it off
>Her good mood is more than contagious though
>In fact it puts you on edge
>As she pulls into the parking garage you're set even more on edge as you spot
>"What’s going on Mattie?" you ask as you get out of her car and follow the now skipping canine
>"You'll see Anon!" she says as she skips far ahead of you into the rehab building
>As you follow her in, you're shocked to see Michelle, Jasmine, Chick, Chase and Beth all waiting there
>You stop dead in your tracks both confused and surprised
>"HI ANON!" comes the hello of the greeting from the furry cannonball that is Beth
>The wind is knocked out of you as you double over from the sheer force of her tackle to your midsection
>"OOF! H-hi Beth" you choke out
>You can see Mattie roll her eyes at the spectacle of her mom latched to you
>Looking around you see a few luggage bags, all with a name tag on them
>"Anon", they are full of your stuff?
>"What’s going on?" You choke out from the tiny yet crushing hug that is Beth
>"You've completed your rehab Anon! We have spoken to Mattie and several of the care providers here! They say you've made huge leaps and bounds, not only with you drug problem but with your Anthro issue!" Jasmine says to you, eyes beaming with a proud smile
>"You get to move into one of our Anonymous shelters, and be your own man!" She adds happily
>Mattie steps forwards looking a bit like a child who had just been yelled at
>"C-Can Anon stay with me instead? I can an eye on him better that way!" she says with a half confident smile
>Oddly enough, it's not Jasmine who steps forwards to comfort Mattie; it's Chase
>"Mattie, if you want Anon there with you, it’s ok..." he says with a knowing smile
>Jasmine looks a bit confused at the statement but relents with a kind smile that shows her large sharp fangs
>They actually make you wince a bit at the sight of them
>You were used to Anthros now....Kinda
>Mattie was an odd exception, the Anthro you had spent so much time with she was more than an Anthro
>More than a regular person
>She was more than you could ever describe
>Yet others, like Jasmine with her sharp sharp teeth, and Beth, who looked like Mattie but just wasn't her
>They were a mystery to you
>A thing to be avoided if possible
>"We already packed your stuff for you Anon, although we will miss you here" says Michelle with a smile
>You knew that was a lie
>How could they miss you? You had spent the majority of the time in your room, avoiding them
>But still you’re grateful for what they did for you
>You smile at her and Nod
>"Thank you Michelle, and thank you everyone, I won't let you down"
>The speech sounds hollow in the words you speak yet you mean every one of them
>Mattie gives you a hug as you grab some of you bags and begin heading to the car
>Chickenman, being the "wild west" guy he always reminded you of, simply throws 2 over his shoulders and carries them with ease
>But even as you and your company head to Mattie’s there are thoughts that bug you
>Are they just tired of you?
>Is the rehab center just trying to shrug of the speciest human?
>You didn't ask to be like this....
>But how do you get over the primordial fear of predatory animals?
>Even now ask Jasmine walked next to you, there as a twinge of fear
>What if she just turned and mauled you?
>Would the others stop her? Would it be seen as normal? 
>The questions flood your mind, involuntary, yet like a constant mosquito that you can’t ignore
>You breathe deep, trying to relax yourself
>Box breathing, that’s what they called it
>They were just people...Fuzzier people....
>They weren't going to maul you and eat your body
>You try to logic away those emotions, those basic fears
>And when Mattie pulls you into a one armed hug... All those fears vanish
>"Surprise! Bet you didn't expect that!" she says with a confident smile
>Such confidence, a look you have rarely seen from her in months knowing her
>You wrap your arms around her and smile
>"I didn't, you got me Mattie" you say with smile
>Her tail wags furiously and you hear Beth Squee happily
>"OoooH! Our little girl found a good Anon! I’m so proud"! You hear 
>But you ignore it and focus of the small dog hugging you tightly
>Mattie Made you happy, and you made her happy
>What else matters beyond that?

Chapter 8: Love Is All You Need

>Months have flown by in the blink of an eye
>And in that time you’ve lived with Mattie and made leaps and bounds together
>She's back in school to be a pharmacist and you actually gone and gotten re-qualified to be a firefighter
>Granted, you aren’t as spry as you used to be but you still got it all done
>You had income, a home and a loving girlfriend
>Maybe this world wasn't so bad
>But despite the snuggles and cuddles and trust you both shared
>There was never anything sexual between you
>Sure there were times where it came close, but in the end she would pull away and go to bed early, leaving you both confused and concerned
>You had never been with an Anthro,
>Fuck, you had never been with anyone other than your wife
>...Ex-wife
>Is it ex-wife? You never really got used to the semantics
>Either way, you were stuck waiting for Mattie to be used to... you
>She told you she had never been with anyone sexually
>Between her schooling and her love of D&D, she never really bothered trying
>She said it was just better to try and find a man who cared for her despite those things
>You cared for her because of all that
>Even with her arm and eye gone you cared for her
>How could you not?
>She was still smart, friendly, and a blast to be around
>And even as snow started falling, she made the most of it
>Snow angels were "Snow gimps" missing a wing, and snowball fights with the local children always had her trying to guilt trip them
>It worked the first few times but after that they learned
>As well, you got stationed at a local fire station, where you would spend 4 days a week
>That part is what really drove the wedge between you and....what was her name.....
>Guilt struck you every time you thought of her...Amanda... that's right
>But if you didn't have that picture of them all, their faces would be gone
>You couldn't remember them at all
>But what did they look like now anyway? It had so long
>Those thoughts didn't bother you now though
>Mattie had class late tonight, and you had the day off
>So why not prepare dinner for her?
>You had Chicken Parmesan cooking and garlic bread in the oven
>Snow fell freely outside and bitter winds gusted by
>Street lamps outside looked like burning torches when you looked out and remembered the cold nights of snow
>Why businesses had grates that spewed warm air out, you would never know, but you remember the frigid nights trying to find a free metal grate
>A bid to stay warm and not freeze to death
>Even now, as you glare out the window at the falling snow your reminded of cold and pain
>People never really have felt cold until it isn’t cold, it’s just pure pain
>Waking up buried in snow, feeling like your blood is frozen
>You shiver thinking about it, as you flip over the chicken strips in the oven
>Funny how this world changes people
>You never enjoyed cooking much before, but now that you knew what it was like to not have good food
>Now you loved it
>Either way, as you tend to dinner in the kitchen, you hear the front door open and then a quick "I'm home!"
>You smile as you brush your hands against each other quickly and head to the front door
>At the door is Mattie; standing confident and calm with a smile on her face wearing a long coat to keep her warm
>How long have you worked to get that smile?
>So so long
>Even with her missing eye, you loved that smile
>Her long coat covered her body as she stood in the front entrance of the house
>"HI Anon! Dinner smells good!" She says with her violet eye watching you
>You nod and smile
>"Chicken Parmesan and Garlic bread. I know you like them love" you say with a smile, holding up a spatula at her
>She nods and takes a step closer to you
>"Uh, Anon...Do you like... uh"
>She hesitates, looking at you with an uneasy eye
>"DO you like this?" she says finally, pulling open her coat uneasily
>She reveals lingerie, her breasts poking out from a bra that does nothing to hid her nipples and a thin underwear thong
>You stare at her open mouthed at the coat falls to the floor and she smiles at you uneasily
>"Uuuuh Surprise!" she says, propping her breasts up with her arm
>Speechless
>You are absolutely speechless as you look upon her
>Sure you had seen her naked plenty of times before but this... this was like a blind man seeing the sunset for the first time
>You stare, awestruck at her body and try to say something, but no words can even form in your mind as you look upon her
>But as you stare she shivers a bit and attempts to hide herself
>"Oh... I knew you wouldn't like...”
>You rush in, pulling her into a hug and not letting her finish that thought
>"Fucking hell Mattie, you look amazing! What even prompted this?" You say stepping closer to her
>She smiles and you feel her firm perky breasts press against you
>"You never made a move on me, despite us always snuggling and sleeping together" she says, smiling up at you
>You shift uneasily on your feet, looking into her eye
>"I didn’t want to pressure you Madeline, plus...it’s been a while since I was with anyone" you say, looking down and away
>Mattie pulls you down into a kiss and you feel her long tongue overpower yours
>For someone so much smaller than you she had a lot of strength
>You feel her sharp canine teeth, her tongue and breathe deep, savouring the smell of her fur
>This kiss was something that blasted away the boring years of street living
>The life of loneliness, worrying not about who you were but only the next hit
>Mattie’s paw wraps around the back of your head, pulling you deeper into the kiss as your hands explore her body and wide hips
>But the moment is broken by a loud beeping from the oven, telling you that the chicken is done cooking
>Quickly you pull away from Mattie and look at her with a bit of unease
>"Go get the food doofus!" she says with a cheerful smile
>You nod quickly and rush back into the kitchen and then to the oven
>With your mind racing about Mattie and her body, you grab the cooking tray with a shaky hand and set it on the stove
>Better get it placed down and out of the way as you turn off the oven and look to the doorway where Mattie stands waiting for you
>With a beckoning finger, she draws you out of the kitchen and into her living room
>You watch her walk with a confident swish of her hips as she goes to the couch and pats the spot next to her
>With a bit of hesitation, you sit down and look at her, loving the view but a bit afraid
>How long had it been since you had been with a woman? You had never been with anyone other than Amanda and now here you were
>A new world, a new woman, a new species
>Were you a new person too?
>All of those concerns are forgotten as Mattie straddles you and places her paw on your face, forcing you to look at her
>"It's ok Anon, I promise" she says before kissing you again
>Your hands snake their way down her sides, digging through her slightly chilled fur
>Her eye is locked on yours as you explore her body with renewed vigour
>How could not seeing her like this not excite you?
>She slowly grinds her hips against you as you feel every inch of her body and she gives a relieved smile when she feels your body react
>Finally, you snake your hands up her side and settle on her perfect breasts
>She moans a bit and bites her lower lip before pushing them together slightly with her arm and her stump
>"Do you like them? I know they aren't th-"
>You cut her off with a kiss that makes her moan softly into your mouth
>"They're perfect" you say as you pull away from the kiss that leaves her panting
>You reach behind her and undo her bra with ease, and pull it off her then place your hands back on those gorgeous mounds
>Even unsupported by the lingerie, her tits are perky and full
>Mattie moans more and you squeeze her breasts and gently pinch her nipples
>"Oooo that’s good" she gasps "Get these off"
>Her claws dig at your pants and you nod quickly
>She props herself up off you and you arch your back, then undo your jeans and slide them off without getting up
>Mattie's paw grabs at the hem of your shirt and tugs at it, helping pull it off you and get you undressed
>"Ooo Anon, someone’s happy to see me" Mattie gasps as she lowers herself once more onto you
>With your jeans no longer holding back your erection, your boner is pressed against her thong, which has a slowly growing wet spot
>Mattie’s paw runs down your chest and over her abs before her thumb hooks into her waistband
>With a little bit of difficultly she slides it off, although with a bit of help from you
>Her wetness is now pressed against your erections head, which strains against its cloth prison
>Slowly she grinds side to side, with her eye locked on you
>You place your hands on her thick thighs and guide her motion
>Her moans grow steadily as her grinding gets faster and your erection presses against her lips
>"Ready Mattie?" you ask as your hand guides itself to her wet slit
>She gives a small nod and interlocked her paw with your hand as she lifts herself a bit to allow your fingers access
>"Go slow Anon" she says with a worried look on her muzzle
>You nod and kiss her quickly
>With one finger you gently rub the outside of her lips before pressing between them gently, getting plenty of lubrication from her
>"Ooooooh just like that Anon"
>Gently you push a single digit into her, earning you small stifled moans
>She's tight, tighter than you expected and far far warmer than anyone else you had been with
>Slowly, you start to move your finger into and out, with each push getting a little further into her
>Her Moans grow steadily louder the further you push and eventually you full pointer finger is in her
>"Ready for another?" you say softly, the fingers on your free hand still interlocked with her
>Mattie gives a small nod and kisses you once more as you add another finger, pressing deep into her
>She moans softly into your mouth as you gently finger her
>You curl your fingers slightly, hoping to find that spot
>Eventually as you press deep into her, your pointer finger brushes a small area deep in her pussy that sends visible shivers up her body
>Her eye widens in shock as you deliberately rub your fingers against it
>"W-what Is the-that Anon?" She moans softly grinding her hips against your fingers, trying to relive the sensation
>"That’s your G-spot Mattie" you say as you rub the spot a bit harder, getting more shivers and shudders from her
>"M-my G-g-g-spot? I never had this when I d-did this m-myself_" she stammers, trying to keep her composure
>You nod and kiss her
>"You didn't have me before"
>You pick up the pace now, fingering her harder and faster earning you louder moans
>Mattie grinds her hips against your hand as you push deeper into her, causing her juices to drip out and soaking your boxers
>Her moans and more addicting than any drug you've ever taken.
>How could they not? They were bliss, a resonating sound of satisfaction for you that you hadn’t felt in so long
>You press further into her, rubbing her g-spot while kissing her softly
>Do you dare push it a little bit more?
>How could you not?
>You thumb presses against her clit and you rotate it softly as you push your fingers into her
>Quiet slow breathing from you is all you can do as you focus on Mattie
>Your fingers find every point to make her gasp
>Your thumb circles slowly, earning new gasps from her
>And even though you had been with women before, this was new
>She was tighter, warmer and more sensitive; every move you made, made her shudder slightly
>Each time you press against her g-spot, it causes more violent, yet graceful shudders
>Gently, yet steadily, you speed up, two fingers rubbing her g-spot and your thumb making quick methodical circles on her clit
>Even as she tries to kiss you to fight the oncoming orgasm, you can tell her body is responding to you
>As your fingers touch and rub every sensitive spot within her, she sits straight up, looking upwards and shivering
>A violent shudder resonates down her body and she collapses onto you, her arm trying to wrap itself around your neck
>You feel her legs try to close, but get blocked by yours as she straddles you
>Her inner walls clamps down with frightening tightness, forcing your fingers out, falling onto you with full force
>"Aaaaanonnnnn, Ooo it feels gooooood"" Mattie moans, panting heavily while looking into your eyes
>You smile and hug her close as her tremors from her orgasm shake her body
>After a moment or two she regains her composure and the small tremors stop
>Mattie smiles and grinds on you a bit
>"Ohhhhh someone is rearing to go" She says with a smile
>You had been so focused on Mattie that you are just now aware how painfully erect you are
>Mattie looks down at your boxers and back at you, biting her lip
>"Can...can we go all the way Anon? I promise I’ll try to be sexy" she says looking down at her body and then her stump
>With one finger under her chin, you lift her face and kiss her
>"You are sexy Madeline"
>Her ears perk and you feel her tail wag softly
>"Then uh... Let me get these off you"
>She gets up off of you and pulls on your boxers softly, which you help guide down your legs
>Your erection springs free, causing her to stare at it
>"It...it’s bigger than I expected" she say both nervously and worriedly
>"C-can I touch it?" she asks, extending her paw towards your shaft like it’s a museum piece
>You nod at her and her paw touches your shaft and wraps around it gently
>Its different than you expected
>Warm and soft, like being touched with very very fine silken fibres that were warmed
>Her paw gently moves up and down your shaft, feeling you from the head to the base and eventually your family jewels
>"It’s just like the videos, and different from those dog ones..." you hear Mattie murmur to herself as she slowly strokes your length
>"Videos?" you ask before you can stop yourself
>"Mhm videos online" She says absentmindedly, massaging your member gently with her paw
>She leans her head closer, you feel her hot breath on the tip of your cock
>A few wet licks from Mattie's long tongue sends shivers down your spine like you've never felt before
>It’s been years since anyone had given you any type of attention sexually and now you have Mattie cautiously licking you
>And it feels amazing, her tongue is wetter, stronger and softer than any woman you had been with, granted that was only one
>But it was a whole new feeling, one of sheer pleasure
>And all she was doing was licking!
>Her paw strokes you as she softly caresses you with her tongue
>Your gasps and groans fuel her further, and she takes the tip of your cock into her mouth
>Her tongue rapidly licks your tip and she quickens the pace of her stroking
>But all too soon she releases you from her mouth with a pant
>"A-anon I know this feels good for you b-but I’m at my limit! I Need you please!" she says standing
>Between her thighs glistens with wetness, somehow she was even wetter than before and her legs were quivering slightly
>Who were you to deny her the cure to her problem?
>You beckon her to you and she straddles you once more
>"Take it slow....don't hurt yourself" you say as she positions herself
>She nods quickly and places her paw on your chest as you position your cock against her lips
>She slowly lowers herself, allowing you to penetrate the sopping wetness that is Mattie's pussy
>Shallow gasps and long breathes
>You feel the radiating warmth, the incredible wetness and the constricting tightness
>When she felt tight on your fingers it was amazing but as you feel her on you with you inside her, it’s indescribable
>You place your hands on her wide hips and her guide her descent
>"Ooo its biggggg Anon" Mattie moans as she leans forwards onto you
>Well that’s an ego boost to be sure
>Slowly, you guide her moments up and down, helping move her with you still inside her
>She gasps every time you bring her down onto you, a soft *plap* noise is head each time
>Her fur is so soaked that is doesn’t act as a cushion anymore
>Her lone violet eye looks at you hazily, her arm around you while her stump tries to get a good grip
>You kiss her softly as you keep guiding her movements
>After all you are experienced with this, and even if Mattie was an Anthro, she was still a female
>You knew how to make them sing in bed
>At least you hoped you did
>You begin using your feet to bounce upwards, helping Mattie’s movements a bit more on you
>Her face is one of pure bliss, a bit of drool as she hangs onto you
>No more words from her, just the quiet *ha* and *ah* as you thrust upwards into her
>The inner walls of her pussy constrict, and feel tighter than before as she shudders a  bit and pulls you close, her body shivering and nuzzling against you
>"AAA-anonnnnn its sooooooo goood" Mattie moans, her mouth slightly agape with a grin
>You smile and continue, your hands on her glorious hips and ass, guiding her movements on you
>And as she constricts and nuzzles you, you feel your own limit approaching
>The build up from the licking and stroking was too much to bear
>"Mattie, can I cum in-"
>"PILL! DO IT!" She cries in a brief moment of clarity
>That’s all the invitation you need
>You unload every drop, every ounce of love you have into her, pulling her close in a shuddering orgasm that made your legs shake
>She gives out a long "aaaaaah" as you give a few extra thrusts, pushing into her with the last bit of vigor you have
>At last your arms fall away and your left breathless
>No human could compare to that which Mattie gave you
>The love, the warmth, the... well everything
>She slumps against you, her head resting on your chest
>"Was it good for my first time?" Mattie pants, looking at you expectantly
>you nod and kiss her
>"The best I’ve ever had" you say with a smile
>There was no lie there
>Just the love you felt for this woman

Chapter 9: Exitlude

>Time flowed by like a river as you and Mattie lived together
>you loved her, that much you knew
>How could you not?
>She accepted you, all of your flaws and you past
>And you loved her
>Her DnD campaigns that she constantly pulled you into
>The Days where she would come home and talk about her job (You didn't understand most of what it was she was talking about, but you smiled and nodded anyway)
>her parents, Chase who helped guide you through this new world and Beth who still gave you tackling hugs
>Oh, and you loved her despite her missing arm and eye
>To you it never made a difference
>In a way, both of you related to each other
>You both lost something
>But none of that matters as you sit across from her at this fancy restaurant
>you fidget in you pocket while looking at Mattie
>She has a big smile on her face as she eats dessert, strawberry cheesecake, which was one of her favorites
>Why were you nervous?
>You had done this before
>But... something was different this time
>You were different
>Just do it! Don't be a fucking soyboy!
>Grasping the small box in your hand firmly, you stand up, earning a confused look from Mattie
>"Anon? whats up we haven't fin-"
>Her eye goes wide as you kneel in front of her on one knee
>Yea it's cheesy, but its all you know
>She brings a paw to her mouth, staring at you with her beautiful violet eye
>"Are you sure" she finally says, disbelief filling her voice
>You chuckle as you reach forwards, extending a hand to her
>"Of course I'm sure Mattie, I love you; will you Campaign with me forever?"
>A DnD Callback; Nice
>She removes her paw from her face and places it into you hand
>Carefully, you slip the ring onto her padded finger
>"If I wasn't sure, I wouldn't ask" you say with a confident smile
>Mattie stares at the ring for a moment, tears filling her eye before she pounces on you in a hug
>"YES YES YES A THOUSAND TIMES YES ANON" she cries happily her arm around you neck in a comforting hug
>You smile as you wrap your arms around her 
>You never could feel bad about loving her
>Why would you?
>Were it not for her, you would still be in that alley
>And for some reason, you can't help but think
>Were it not for you, she would never have made it out of that alley either
>Were it no for each other, Things would have never changed
>But you're glad it did
