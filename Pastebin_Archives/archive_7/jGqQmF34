Notes:
> Prompts are purposefully vague, expand on it as you see fit. 
>> i.e. "Where We Met... on commute" could mean a train, a shared carpool/uber, or not on a vehicle but at its terminal (bus stops and subway stations.)
> The picture you posted can imply themes or settings.
>> i.e. if the picture depicts future-space and using the example Result above, She could be a bio-mechanical doctor and You could be a pilot for an interplanetary deliver service.
> "How I, Met You" implies the first meeting, however it isn't a rule.
>> i.e. You met at college / university (12) while both of you were in for a visit (1). You haven't seen each other since graduation.

You met on an ERP website. She managed to stumble her way in there without fully realizing what it was. You, on the other hand, were a regular. So when she pinged you for a session, you answered the call.

>"Anon: Hey, kitty. How was work?"
>She's still at a lost, and now there's a chat window talking to her.
>Maybe randomly clicking stuff wasn't the best idea.
>Specially since this isn't her computer.
>"Anon: You okay, kitty? You can talk to me, y'know."
>She wonders if this "Anon" was a person or an AI. It wouldn't be a stretch for her roommate to make one.
>It seems friendly enough, so she decides to humor it.
>Lacking a mouse, she starts tabbing-in to the chat field.
>After 12 clicks and 8 unrelated windows popping up, she finally types out a reply.
>"Kat: I'm fine. Just a little... tired."
>"Anon: Boss rode you hard today, huh? Same here."
>"Anon: Can you believe that guy? Drags my ass through the ringer and he STILL expects me to show up early tomorrow."
>"Anon: Is it too much to ask for a little recovery time?"
>For an AI, she thought it was pretty charming. And the speech pattern wasn't as janky as she assumed.
>"Kat: Looks like you had it worse."
>"Kat: Tho I did have to deal with another client."
>"Anon: At the same time?"
>"Kat: More or less. Had me going back and forth between the two 'til quittin' time."
>"Anon: Oof. No wonder you're sore."
>'Sore'... huh. She notes the strange choice of words. Looks like there's still a few hitches.
>"Anon: Hey, if you ain't that tired, we can still relax for a bit."
>"Anon: Wind down with something slow, y'know?"
>She's curious. It's an AI, what could it do?
>"Kat: Whaddya have in mind?"
>What follows is an elaborate foreplay scene depicting Anon undressing Kat and caressing all her intimate spots in an attempt to ease her soreness.
>Liberal descriptions of delicate hands brushing through soft, silken fur pinching sensitive nubs while tongues wrestle between teeth and fangs.
>Words on the screen fly by and she just stares, letting every sultry suggestion, every imaginary intent sink-in.

>Meanwhile.
>Foreplay was Anon's thing, says so right on his forum profile.
>And from his previous sessions with Kat, he knows she appreciates it.
>So much so that she asked for one-sided starts on their sessions so she could get... "good and ready"
>Not one to disappoint a truly avid fan, he agrees, and while basking in the afterglow of a job well done after typing out his latest novella of foreplay smut, he only has one thing to ask Kat on the other side of the screen:
>"Anon: You good?"
>30 seconds. No reply.
>"Anon: Still there, kitty? Or are you a little... "preoccupied?"
>"Kat: exit"
>That's definitely strange, even for Kat.
>"Anon: ?"
>"Kat: /quit"
>"Kat: shut_down=true"
>"Kat: window(close)"
>"Anon: Kitty, what the hell?"
>More lines appear, all written as if someone with a poor understanding of coding was trying to close a program.
>Anon tries to interrupt but his queries are ignored, and the attempts at coding get less coherent to the point where the last few lines look like someone slapped their face across the keyboard and hit enter.
>"Kat: HOW THE FUCK DO YOU TURN THIS SHIT OFF"
>Finally, Anon thought, something legible.
>"Anon: You're the tech nerd, kitty. Don't ask me."
>"Kat: I AM NOT A NERD AND STOP CALLING ME KITTY YOU SMUT WRITING ROBOT"
>"Anon: Robot? Wha"
>"Anon: Wait"
>"Anon: Is this Kat5402?"
>"Kat: no, this is patrick"
>"Anon: Funny. Answer the question please."
>"Anon: Is this the Kat5402 that I have regular ERP sessions with?"
>60 seconds pass. No reply. Too much info? Maybe. Who knows.
>At worse, whoever was on the other line left and he'd have a fun story to tell to the real Kat.
>If not...
>"Kat: no"
>"Anon: Are you using Kat's account and/or her computer?"
>"Kat: ...yes"
>"Anon: And as a totally sentient being who is definitely not a perverted AI text parser, may I ask to whom I have written softcore smut to?"
>"Kat: Her roommate... hi"
>...this could be the start of something beautiful.
>"Kat: It was good, by the way. The writing and stuff."
>"Anon: Really, now? I can keep going if you want.
>"Kat: I don't actually do ERP. sorry
>"Anon: Don't sweat it. Just relax and let me work my magic. For now, at least.
>"Anon: So, you in?"
>There was a brief pause. Not the kind where you had trouble making a decision, but more like you left something on and went to check. Like an oven, or an open door.
>"Kat: yeah"
>"Anon: Right"
>"Anon: Delicate fingers run across the small of her back. She purrs as silken fur fills the space between....
