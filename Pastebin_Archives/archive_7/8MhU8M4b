>Math class has been going on forever
>You're bored and starving, and 100% done with your stupid teacher
>She's droning on and on about quadratic equations, which bore the shit out of you
>By the time you actually get a job, you won't use any of this crap because you'll have a calculator anyways
>Just as you're about to fall asleep, the bell rings
>At last, math class is over; time for lunch
>If there's one thing in this shitty school that's good, it's the food.
>Anthros gotta have their protein
>Which means meat is on the menu every day
>Your buddy catches up with you
>"Hey Anon," he squawks, "can I copy your chemistry homework?"
>Fucking Ethan, such a chancer
"Sure thing, bird-brain, but you're doing my math homework next week, faggot."
>The crow seems relieved, drooping a little bit
>"Aww thanks pal. You really did me a solid."
"Don't mention it."
>You're walking straight to the canteen. It's normally a little risky in the first couple of minutes of lunch in a mostly-anthro school, but you're starving and willing to bust out the sharp elbows to get food sooner
>Ethan's giggling a little
>"So uhh, did I tell you what happened yesterday with Eloise?"
"Lemme guess, she shot you down again?"
>He gives you a shit-eating grin
>"Nuh-uh! We're going out for coffee this weekend!"
>You grin back. Cool, the little nerd got some success for once
"Not bad, maybe you'll actually get to lose your hand-holding virginity one of these days"
>He chuckles
>"So what about you, dude?"
>Fuck.
>Now you're going to look uncool as shit.
>Not that you had much of a chance anyways, you're a nerd that hangs around with fucking Ethan in the library or computer labs every recess, and then goes home to shitpost before bed
>About the closest you get to a love life is-
>CRASH!
>Oh fuck, speak of the devil.
>Three tall hyena girls are standing in front of you and Ethan in the corridor
>The crash comes from the leader, smacking her hand into the lockers in front of you
>Her name is Athena.
>She's over six foot tall, clad in a leather jacket and a Misfits shirt, her short shock of dark hair featuring dyed streaks of red and blue. She has a set of headphones around her thick, fluffy neck.
>And she's staring directly at you, her not-so-secret crush.
>She licks her lips.
>"Crow, fuck off." she says, not taking her eyes off you for a second
>Ethan is only too happy to oblige, and he scurries off, tail quite literally between his legs
>She moves in a little closer, you can start to smell her and hear the heavy metal blaring from her headphones
"U-uh, H-hi Athena..."
>Athena growls at you, and with her thugs flanking her, you decide not to make any further comment
>"Don't give me that shit. Why didn't you sit with me in math today?"
>Is this bitch serious
"Because you scare the shit out of me?"
>You kinda blurted that out without thinking, but it must be something she's into, because she giggles
>"You little tease."
>Athena crosses the distance between you two, putting both hands besides your head, pressing her body against you
>She's close enough that she could steal your first kiss if she wanted to
>She stinks of feminine musk and cigs, and her breath smells of cheap whisky
>Despite this, you don't often have girls close to you, the attention is nice - aaaand yep, that's a boner.
>There's no way she wouldn't notice something like that when she's this close to you
>She licks her lips again, and gives you a predatory grin
>"You're free this weekend, aren't you, nerd?"
>Well, she's not wrong, you are a nerd, and you have got fuck-all to do
"Y-yeah, I'm free..."
>Her grin widens, and she licks your cheek, making you shudder
>"Good. You, me, and your little friend..." - she gives your growing tent a quick grope, making you moan softly - "...meet outside the Starbucks at 12 tomorrow. I'll leave the girls at home. Don't be late."
>With that, Athena releases you, and swaggers off. One of the other yeens chuckles as they follow her off. "You gon get laid, bitchboy~"

---

>It's Saturday, and the time is about 10am
>You've got a date
>Dragging yourself out of bed you wonder what she was thinking
>Athena has never been very subtle, so why's she asking you out on a date?
>From what you know of hyenas, they don't normally act that way, preferring the more direct approach
>Then again, that was based on internet porn, so it probably wasn't exactly accurate
>Either way, you're not about to end up on the shitlist of a hyena bully who's much bigger than you
>No showing is out of the question
>You hit the shower, and once clean pick an outfit
>She only asked you for coffee, so you might as well just go with the usual
>You pick out some nerdshit graphic tee and tight jeans, not exactly fashionable but that's how she sees you day-to-day so whatever
>And with that you head out, head still buzzing with thoughts of what lays ahead
>You get into town uneventfully, just about on the dot 12pm
>Athena is here
>Sure enough, she's dressed the same as always, her ragged leather jacket is still in place, she's swapped out the Misfits shirt for a Maiden one
>Those skinny jeans don't look familiar though, she looks good in them
>She spots you and gives a grin with more than a few teeth
>"Hey cute stuff."
>She grabs you in a bear hug, burying you in her substantial chest
>She still stinks, though her breath doesn't seem to smell of whisky today
>Does she only drink at school or something?
"H-hey Athena, you look great"
>That's not a lie, the jeans really accentuate her toned legs
>She lets out a happy yip and squeezes you even tighter, almost lifting you up
>"You little flatterer, we're gonna have some fun today"
"Haha, y-yeah"
>You're not used to her being *this* touchy, sure she likes to tease you but she's never bear-hugged you before
>Full spaghetti mode engaged
>"C'mon, let's go get some coffee."
>She finally releases you, then gives you a wink
>"I see you brought your little friend along, just like I told ya," she says, looking downwards
>Fuck's sake Athena
>Once again, close contact with a girl was too much for your virgin body, and you've erected a little tent
>You can feel the heat rising to your face and you hang your head in embarrassment
>Athena holds out her front paws and takes your hands in them
>Oh shit, there goes the hand-holding virginity
>"C'mon bitch, ain't nothing to be frightened of. I won't bite... much."
>She squeezes your hands gently
>Harsh words, gentle heart, you guess
>Releasing one hand, she leads you into Starbucks
>"Don't worry cutie, I'm buying. Let's get some food too, I'm starving."
>Sure why not, Starbucks isn't exactly the classiest but it's ok
>Plus if she's buying, you don't want to be a little shit and make her pay too much
>Cha-ching, one quick trip to the counter later, and you're sitting at a table with a panini and a mocha
>Athena went for an espresso and a toastie
>She's chowing down on it, and with no manners whatsoever starts talking while eating
>"So, I read on the net humans prefer to go on a date before doing stuff."
>Seriously!?
>You raise an eyebrow
"So what you're telling me is that this is for my benefit?"
>She chuckles, and swallows the bite of her toastie
>"Totally. If you were a yeen boy, we'd be fucking already."
>You almost choke on your panini and she slaps you on the back, laughing out loud
>Some of the other customers are staring at you
>They're a mixed bunch, mostly human with a few anthros, which is pretty rare. Most anthros don't like coffee, though, so you don't tend to see too many in coffee shops
>Fully in control of the situation and without a single fuck given, Athena sits back in her chair, hand over the back of it, and downs her espresso in one
>She meets the stares of the other customers with a cool, toothy grin and eye contact
>They quit staring soon enough
>So now she's able to turn her attention to you, and give you that grin instead
>She reaches over and traces a finger round the rim of your coffee cup
>"So, cutie, you ever 'date' a yeen before?"
>What kind of Chad Thundercock does she take you for
"Uhh, no, not before you."
>She cocks her head
>"Really? Just about every other yeen girl in the school wants you. They only backed off because they're scared of me."
>Ok, she has to be lying
>You snort in disbelief
"Somehow I don't believe that."
>She cups your chin in her paw, gently lifts your head, makes eye contact with you
>Wow, she has pretty eyes
>Despite that grin never having left her face, she looks sincere
>"Anon, you're cute as fuck."
>You can feel your face heating up again
>She's the biggest bully in the school, she has a reputation for a reason, and here she is being gentle with you- ohfuckshesclosingthedistance
>Your lips meet hers, and with her hands cradling your face you've no hope of escape
>There goes the first kiss, too
>She's holding back, being a little gentle with you, but you can tell she wants more
>You kiss Athena back
>This... isn't bad.
>Heck, it's pretty nice.
>Rolling with it, you raise your hand and place it behind her head, stroking her short, fluffy hair
>She makes a low rumbling sound, halfway between a growl and a purr
>She shifts her own arms to be wrapped around your neck
>Even if this is just a chaste kiss, it's a heck of a chaste kiss.
>She breaks it first, in a show of amazing self restraint, and meets noses with you in an Eskimo kiss
>"That was pretty nice. Maybe you humans are onto something with this whole 'taking things slowly' shit."
>You chuckle softly
"See, we can be pretty fun, too"
>She grins widely at you, and gives you a kiss on the cheek this time
>You suddenly notice that the other patrons are staring again
>Human/anthro relationships aren't necessarily frowned upon, but they're pretty unusual and guaranteed to draw stares
>Athena seems to have noticed too, because she gives you another wink before caressing your cheek, and finally sitting back in her chair again
>"Finish up that coffee, cutie, then let's go somewhere more private."
>You nod and lift the mug to your lips
>It's the quickest you've ever drained a coffee cup before
>You pick up your panini too and start stuffing it in your mouth
>She laughs out loud
>"You know you can eat that as you walk, right?"
"Oh, yeah, ehehe, right."
>Sheepishly you stand up with your head hung
>Athena stands up, too, swaggers over to you and wraps her arm around your shoulders
>"C'mon, there's a pretty chill place where we can hang out for a bit just a few blocks from here."

---

>She wasn't lying, it's not too far away
>There's a thick door with a slot near the top, at Athena's eye level
>She bangs on the door loudly, and the slot opens, revealing deep blue eyes with slitted pupils
>"Hey slut, it's me, Athena. Got a cutie with me, any room in there right now?"
>The slot closes, then the door opens, revealing a black feline anthro girl behind it
>She's dressed in similar punk-ish getup to Athena, though lacking a leather jacket and with a tank top rather than a tee
>Well, considering it's some extremely aggressive looking punk band's logo, it could be a modified tee
>She fist-bumps Athena
>"Athena, you fucking cow! Yeah, sure, one of the 'guests' just cleared out yesterday. Room's a bit messy, but he didn't jizz on the carpet or anything."
>"Safe."
>From the way she said 'guests' this doesn't sound like an ordinary hotel
>Suddenly, the cat notices you
>She cocks her head
>"A human, Athena?"
>Athena growls with... pride?
>"Hell fucking yes a human. Isn't he cute?"
>She appraises you for a second
>"Not my type, Athena, but hey, ain't my place to judge."
>Athena chuckles, and gives you a squeeze. You begin to feel a bit embarrassed. Are you just arm-candy to her?
>"Be gentle with him at least. The cleaner hates my guts as is, without you making a pigsty out of the room. It's number 12 by the way. You know the way?"
>"Sure do. Ciao, kitten."
>"Fuck off, Athena. Have fun."
>Well that was an interesting exchange.
>Athena guides you in through the door. Inside, it's a shitty looking corridor with doors leading off, like a hotel with no front desk. You guess the surly cat at the door is the receptionist
>There's a 'CRASH!' as she puts the heavy door back into place, and goes to a deckchair laying off by the side
>She picks up her copy of some seedy magazine, opens it up about halfway through, and turns it on its side straight away
>The cover is a barely dressed panther boy draped over a male lion who's wearing a shirt labelled "DADDY"
>Even the title makes you blush
>Better stop staring and leave her to it.
>Athena leads you deeper inside, past several doors
>Everywhere there are punk and metal posters on the walls and doors, and a fair amount of graffiti
>'Sam sucks fat bison dick' and similarly classy stuff
"J-just what is this place, Athena?"
>She puts a clawed finger to your lips
>Finally you reach a grubby door that someone's scrawled '12' on in black sharpie
>Right underneath the number is a Saxon poster
>"Saxon, yeah, why not." Athena mutters, as she pushes the door open
>It's basically a crappy hotel room, no en-suite, just a double mattress with a ratty looking blanket and some sad looking pillows, with a few beer cans and empty cig packets scattered around
>There's an ancient looking CD player with an aux cord trailing out of it
>As the door shuts, she takes her phone out, a battered Samsung with a band sticker on the back, and plugs it into the aux cord
>'Princess of the Night' by Saxon starts playing from the slightly tinny speakers
>With the ambience out of the way, she comes right up to you and wraps her arms around you
>"Yeah, I know it's not the classiest place out there, but the 'guests' keep to themselves and Rache won't let anyone in if they look like trouble."
"That still doesn't answer what the heck this place even is!"
>"Calm down babe. It's just a safehouse for the scene round here. Some of the lads will get in trouble if they get up to their usual shit in a proper hotel, so Rache and a few other cats run this place. The policy is that you do whatever you want in your own room, so long as you don't fuck with the other guests. Oh, and you pay up front and agree to let the staff into your shows for free - if you don't suck."
>You let out a deep sigh
"So this is a punk-rock hotel, is what you're saying?"
>She chuckles
>"Sure is. I've done some bouncer work for Rache recently, so she owes me a favour or two. I figured I'd use it to get some quiet one-on-one time with my cutie"
>She kisses your forehead and leads you into the room. You sit down on the bed with her, and she flashes you a smile while stroking your head softly
>"And hey, the shit I read on the net says it's bad form to ask a human boy back to your house on a first date."
>The absurdity of it gets to you, and you laugh softly
"So you took me to a seedy hotel instead?"
>She cocks her head, thinks about it for a second, then slaps her forehead as if to say "D'oh!"
>You laugh a little louder and snuggle up to her. She obliges, putting an arm round you and giving you a squeeze
>"Oh, uh, sorry about the music, too. If Rache hears anything but loud fucking coming from in here, I'll lose some major street cred. So, I put the music on in case you're not feeling up to that."
>You can feel your face heating up again. You'll never get used to how nonchalant anthros can be about sex.
>Still... that she's willing to take it slowly with you is a huge comfort. You were more than a little worried that this whole date thing was an excuse for her to trap you for some weird kinky sex
>Who knew, it turns out that the rough-round-the-edges bully has a heart of gold that she hides from everyone
>You turn your face to hers, feeling emboldened, and when she turns her head a little you meet her lips again
>Once more, she seems to want more than you're giving at the moment, but restrains herself
>That is until you run your tongue over her lips, and she opens her mouth to let you in
>When your tongues meet, she starts to get a little braver, wrestling you with her rough predator's tongue
>You settle into her arms, hands pressed up against her chest submissively, and she seems only too happy to oblige, cuddling you close and tight
>Once again, you feel a stirring in your pants, and your tent presses up against her legs
>She breaks the kiss, and again segues straight into Eskimo kissing you, making that low growl again
>"It's so fucking cute when you do that," and she shifts her legs a little to let you know what she means
>You seem to be incapable of forming words right now, the kissing overwhelmed you a little, so you let out a soft whimper
>She really liked that, as she gives you another tight squeeze
>"God damn you're cute. You sure you don't want to, y'know..."
>Oh now she's being coy?!
"Ahh... Maybe you could..."
>She smiles widely, and releases you so that you're laying on your back. One arm is still around you, but the other is free
>She puts her big paw on your chest and makes a walking motion with it, heading slowly downstairs
>"I could...?"
>She's gonna make you say it, the bitch
"Mmnn... use your paw..."
>She lets out another predatory growl, and pushes her paw underneath your waistband
>ohmygodshestouchingit
>"I thought you'd never ask..."
>Athena gropes around in your pants, wrapping her big paw around your member
>You gasp softly, and she giggles
>"You're still far too cute~"
>Her paw is strong, but she's holding back a lot, rubbing her pads and fluffy fingers up and down your shaft
>She grips a little tighter, starting to jerk you off, but still gently
>Wanting to give her more space, you lift up your butt and slide your pants and boxers off
>You snuggle a little closer to Athena's ample breasts, and she kisses your forehead, starting to grip a little tighter and pump a little faster
>Being snuggled up to a big fluffy anthro, and not having to do the jerking off yourself...
>This is really nice.
>You let out a moaning whimper, and Athena squeezes you again
>"Hush... This is your first time, isn't it?"
>You nod, unable to say anything
>She kisses your forehead again
>There's a short while where she keeps quiet, and you edge closer and closer to orgasm
"Athena... mmmm..."
>She strokes your hair softly with her free hand, and slows her pace a little to let you recover some
>"Good boy... Do you want to finish like this, or...?"
>And she opens her mouth and shows you her tongue, gesturing at herself with the hand of the arm that's wrapped around you
>You look up into her eyes, and nod slowly
>She chuckles, and Eskimo kisses you again
>"Is that yes to the hand, or yes to something else?"
>You'd roll your eyes, if the giant hyena punk-rock bully didn't have your twitching, desperate dick in her paws
>She seems to get off making you beg for it
>You gather your energy, no easy task when Athena's stroking the virgin out of you even as she's eyeing you cheekily
"Athena... Please..."
>"Please what, sweetie?"
"P-Please s-suck me off!"
>She chuckles, releasing your dick and using her now free hand to pin your arm down
>"When you ask like that, you can get anything you want, cutie-pie."
>She frames your face in her hands, and kisses you deeply and hungrily
>This time, her tongue is in your mouth, and she's not letting you off easy
>She breaks the kiss, then traces her way down with soft kisses, until she reaches your manhood, still rock hard and ready for more
>She runs her rough tongue up the shaft and over the base of the head, eliciting a sharp gasp from you
>A soft chuckle escapes her lips before she gives the head of your cock a big, wet kiss, then takes it in her mouth
>Holy fucking shit
>Her warm, wet tongue is working its way over your head, and it feels divine
>The handjob was nice, but this feels like dying and going to heaven
>She's gentle again, slowly working your head with her tongue and your shaft with her hand, until she decides you've had enough teasing and starts to take your shaft in too
>She's a lot bigger than you.
>She has a long snout, since she's an anthro spotted hyena a good head taller and much bigger than you.
>This means her mouth is very deep.
>Especially compared to your dick.
>She easily takes the whole thing in her mouth, down to the balls, without needing to use her throat
>This time you moan loudly, "Ahhhhn~"
>She looks up at you with hungry eyes, somehow finding enough space to stick her tongue out and lick your balls
>That was hot enough that you can feel the gates opening
>Your dick is twitching in Athena's mouth, begging for release
>Somehow sensing that, she starts to milk your dick with her tongue and lips, bobbing up and down
>It's too much to take
"Ahhhhh-! Athena I'm gonna-!"
>Athena growls primally, and the vibration from her growl combined with the warm, damp heaven of her mouth finally drives you over the edge
>You haven't fapped in a couple days, and Athena probably knows that now, as you buck your hips against her and release an explosion of cum into her mouth
>You don't think you've had an orgasm like that in years, there must be pints of the stuff
>But Athena don't give a fuck, and laps it all up like she's dying of thirst
>Finally, your orgasm comes to a close, and Athena releases your dick from her mouth with a wet sound
>She opens her mouth and sticks out her tongue, showing it to be completely clean
>What a champ, she drank every last drop
>And with that, she crawls back up to lay beside you
>Somehow you find the energy to roll on your side and snuggle up to her
>She lets out a soft noise of appreciation and wraps both her arms around you, squeezing you tight
>"Good boy~ You lasted pretty well for your first time. My mates tell me most guys either can't get it up or cum in two seconds flat their first time."
>You let out a low murmur, but can't conjure up any words right now
>She giggles and gives you another squeeze
>"Sounds like you need a nap, sweetheart. Sure, I could use 40 winks myself."
>With that, you fall asleep in each other's arms.

---

>It's been a few days since you and Athena started dating
>The two of you continue the charade: she's rough and possessive in public, and a gentle lover in private
>And you're her submissive boyfriend in both
>You still haven't actually penetrated her yet, but she's all too happy to let you touch her wherever you want
>And in return, she of course gets to do the same to you
>School has been fun too
>You were seen as the badass that tamed the bully - and the lesser bullies decided it was time to leave you alone
>More than once Athena dragged you aside into the bathroom for a quickie
>She showed you off to 'the girls,' the two yeens at school she considered rough enough to be her friends
>They cooed over you like doting aunts, and she even let them tease you a little
>Though she gave the braver of the two a clip round the ear when she made as if to grope you
>A few hyena boys have given you envious glares
>One even tried to start shit with you, only for Athena and her goons to beat him senseless
>She earned a detention for that, which she didn't attend
>Overall, it's been a fun couple of days
>Tonight, though, she wants to give you a bigger challenge
>Tonight you'll be hanging around with a hyena pack
>Young hyena packs have an extremely bad reputation, which they revel in
>Underage drinking, sexual harassment, brawling with each other and other gangs, vandalism, and disturbing the public peace with loud rock music are their usual crimes
>Some even pick badass-sounding names and hit the streets like gangs
>Unlike real gangs, though, they're always too drunk to actually do any organised crime
>Also, so long as they stay in mostly-hyena anthro districts, the cops leave them alone, since they tend to grow up a bit once they've had kids
>Mostly they're just a nuisance
>Tonight, though, Athena wants to keep out of trouble seeing as you were around
>Her older brother, whose real name you don't know since everyone calls him Gopher, is driving you to Athena's parent's place
>You're sitting in the back seat, draped over Athena
>She's all over you in front of her brother, nibbling your ears, squishing her breasts in your face, and even groping you through your pants
>As usual when you're around her, you're rocking a tent
>Gopher's eyes are in front on the road, straight as an arrow
>Athena had told you he was gay, dating a "cute human like you", and that it was fun to get him flustered
>He seems determined not to let her have her fun
>"So, does your boyfriend make cute noises too, Gopher?"
>No answer
>She gives a wicked grin, and starts kneading your ass roughly
>Her paws are powerful, and you squeak involuntarily when she gooses you
>"Hehehe! Caught you lookin', Gopher. Jealous? Where's Shorts, anyway? You scare him off?"
>You can hear Gopher grinding his teeth, but he keeps quiet
>"What's with that dress ya bought last week? Mom and I were laughing for a good five minutes. Is that for Shorts?"
>Still nothing from him
>"Although... It was anthro-sized. Had a tail-hole, too. Maybe it was for someone else?"
>Finally, he reacts, and lets out a growl
>"Drop it, Athena."
>She gives a short, barking yeen laugh
>"Ahaha! Knew it. So you liked it that one time when Lozza put you in that dress?"
>He growls a little louder, and bares his teeth
>"Athena, shut the fuck up!"
>She giggles louder still, leaning back in her seat
>"Hehehehehehehehe! God you're so fun to piss off."
>His growling subsides, knowing the teasing is over, for now
>Not long after, he pulls the car to a halt
>"We're here. Get the fuck out of my car."
>Athena beams, leans over and ruffles his hair
>"Have a nice date, pumpkin!"
>He chuckles, the tension from earlier having dissipated, and flashes his little sis a small, toothy grin
>"Sure, just don't drink too much."
>You and Athena hop out of the car, and Gopher waves and drives off
>This is definitely not a nice neighbourhood
>There's trash strewn about the floor; more beer bottles than you can count, cig butts, and old fast-food containers
>The road itself is grimy and worn out
>There are bars on the windows of the one-storey house, presumably to stop people lifting them and burgling the place
>The car in the overgrown and dishevelled driveway has seen better days, probably back when Baywatch was still on TV
>The next door neighbour, another hyena, is snoozing on her equally-run-down driveway, with a young child laying on top of her
>Athena smiles sheepishly, noticing the look on your face as you survey the grungy surroundings
>"Yeah, it ain't much. But it's home."
>The two of you approach the front door
>Athena knocks loudly, and it opens after a second of rustling inside and a few loud shouts
>The hyena woman who opens the door...
>Well, for a start she's older than you by a good few decades, probably making her someone's mom
>The second, she has a unique look
>If you were being tactful, you'd say she had a unique punk/rockabilly-fusion look
>If you were being honest, you'd say she looked like one of the groupies at a Buddy Holly concert
>She gives you and Athena a big grin, and you notice she's missing a canine tooth
>"Well well well! Looks like my little Athena's finally growing up!"
>She ruffles your hair and gives you a playful slap on the cheek
>You endure it; the treatment from Athena's friends was rougher
>"He's as cute as your father was when he was that age!"
>"Moooom, I saw him first!"
>She possessively wraps her arm around your shoulders, and you lean into her
>Her mom starts chuckling
>"Don't worry Athena, I've only eyes for your father. You must be Anon?"
"Uh, yeah, that's me, miss...?"
>"Miss! Ha! You flatter me. Name's Crutch. They call me that from what I beat someone over the head with, after my skiing accident."
>She waves you inside
>It's a hyena den. It's as bad as it was outside
>That is to say, it's dishevelled, there's trash everywhere, and you can hear loud punk music from inside
>"Your mates are in the living room. They brought a boy from a few hoods over, he's tonnes of fun!"
>That sounds... uh.
"Uh, with his consent?"
>Athena and Crutch both start laughing
>"He's a yeen, hon. Of course he consented when three strong young'uns said they wanted someone to play with!"
>Athena cackles at her mom's crudeness
>"Yeah, he's fine. Hell, the girls might let you play with'm too, if ya ask nicely."
>What have you gotten yourself into

>You emerge into a large room, the source of the punk music you heard in the entrance
>There's 5 hyena girls here, and two hyena boys
>One of them is sitting on the ground next to the couch, which has been torn-up and slashed, not to mention stained in several places
>He has a collar on his neck, whose leash is being held by the girl sitting next to him on the couch
>The other boy is currently having his face ground on by a chubby hyena girl's crotch
>The girl sitting on the slashed-up couch waves as Athena enters
>"Ey! If it ain't the alpha bitch herself! And her cutie, too!"
>The other girls turn round
>"No shit! Hey fuckface"
>"Oh dude, he's cuuuute!"
>"Mate, where'd you find this cutie?"
>"Athena, can I borrow him?"
>The girl on the couch stays there, but the other girls crowd round you
>You start to get pawed. A lot.
>Someone grabs your ass, making you squeal
>This just eggs them on and they start chuckling
>Athena clears her throat, and they back off for a bit
>"Alright girls, this is my boyfriend Anon. I saw him first so back the fuck off."
>They moan a bit about how she never lets them have any fun, and back off
>"Anon, these are my mates. The girl on the couch is Snorlax."
>The other yeens burst out in a fit of giggles, and Snorlax looks indignant
>"Athena, c'mon, my name's Zara..."
>"Nah, your name's Snorlax, 'cos no-one can wake ya up"
>Snorlax/Zara pouts and says nothing else
>Athena grabs one of the yeens in a headlock and pulls her over to you, both chuckling
>"This lil runt is Squeaks. She's called that because that's the noise she makes if you grab her clit. Try it!"
>She grabs your hand and forces it into the scruffy yeen's bulging jeans
>Sure enough, she squeaks nervously, and the other yeens burst out laughing again
>Athena lets her go, and Squeaks winks at you and blows a kiss
>"And that'un over there-" she points at a yeen with cropped hair and a scar through one eye "-is called Cris. She gets to keep her real name cos she's a fucking psycho bitch."
>Cris says nothing, just twirls a butterfly knife you didn't see her draw around her fingers
>"This fat fuck is called Pepper, on account of being able to chug a bottle of habanero sauce."
>Pepper smiles at you, before returning to sitting on the hyena boy's face
>"And the one who's hand I'm gonna eat for touching your ass is called Razor."
>Razor, who's standing behind you, chuckles nervously
>"C'mon Athena, I don't think my hand tastes too good. I fap with that one, y'know?"
>The other yeens laugh again - real bunch of comedians, these guys
>Athena grabs you roughly by your shirt collar and throws you on the couch, before sitting down next to you
>You're in-between her and the one she called Snorlax
>"So, Athena, is it really off-limits to touch him up?" she asks nervously
>Athena gives her a predatory grin
>"His ass is mine. His cock is mine. You kiss him, I'll tear your fucking lips off. Anything else is okay."
>Snorlax chuckles, and pats your head
>"Anon was it?"
"Uh yeah"
>She ruffles your hair, and then pinches your cheek
>"Damn he's cute. Cris, check out how soft his hair is!"
>Cris comes over, and gingerly pets your head
>After doing that for a second, she turns to Athena
>"Where do human boys hang out?"
>Athena grins proudly
>"He goes to my school. There's a few more there."
>Cris nods, and slaps you round the face lightly
>Squeaks comes to join in the fun as Cris backs off
>"Hey, hey, Athena, can we dress him up?!"
>Uhhhhhhhhh
>Athena chuckles
>"Maybe later. I have some lingerie in my wardrobe his lil ass would look cute in"
>Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
>You have the weirdest boner right now
>Athena, never missing a trick with your libido, draws attention to it by reaching a paw down and groping your growing bulge
>"Looks like he likes that idea, girls!"
>The hyenas laugh again - don't they ever get tired of that?
>You feel your face heating up, and Athena pulls you close to her
>Making to nibble your ear, she whispers to you
>"You're doing great, hun. They love you."
>Well, you feel a little better for that
>Feeling brave, you reach over and cup one of her breasts in your hand
>She growls in pleasure, and actually bites your ear before slapping you on the back and releasing you
>Snorlax reaches behind the couch
>"You guys want a beer?"
>She produces two bottles, and hands one to you and one to Athena
>Athena coolly cracks the cap off hers using her front teeth, and you gingerly turn the screw top
>This is your first ever drink, jeeze
>Athena's already tucking into hers, giving it a good solid chug
>"Ayy, c'mon Anon, chug!" someone yells
>The other yeens burst into a chorus
>"Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!"
>Athena takes her lips off her own beer, and points to yours
>"C'mon, down the hatch!"
>Welp, you can't say no to her or it won't end well
>Here goes nothing
>You raise the beer to your lips, and start pouring it down your throat
>Holy shit, the fratboys in movies make this look a lot easier than it is
>Athena starts up a chant as you struggle to get all the beer down
>"WE LIKE TO DRINK WITH ANON, CUZ ANON IS OUR MATE! HE DRINKS IN MODERATION, AND LIKES TO MASTURBATE!"
>What the fuck Athena
>Well, joke's on her, somehow you managed to get the whole thing in one go
"Ahhh FUCK!"
>You throw the empty beer bottle down, and raise your arms in celebration as the yeens let out a whooping victory cry
>Snorlax tousles your hair roughly
>"Man, that was fucking badass. Sure you're not part hyena?"
>Athena looks at you proudly, and puffs out her chest
>"He's *my* fucking boyfriend, he knows his shit!"
>You strike a proud pose of your own, feeling a rush of long-unrealised masculinity
>Snorlax laughs
>"But, does he know how to do this?"
>She unzips her jeans and pulls out her... clit? dick?
>She yanks on the leash in her hand, and the hyena boy comes round
>You catch his eye for a second, and he gives you a look
>It's a sort of 'hey, it's a yeen's life'-type look, and you feel a pang of empathy for him
>Snorlax slaps him round the face with her clit, and he opens his mouth
>She catches Athena's eye
>"See how big mine is, Athena? Watch this guy go."
>She pushes her clit into his mouth, and makes him lower his head
>He makes it all the way to her pseudo-balls, without gagging
>The other yeen girls go "oooooooooh!" like it's a magic trick
>Now you see it, now you don't
>Snorlax shivers with pleasure
>"Ahh, yeah, good boy. See, human boys are cute, but - ah! - they can't compare to a yeen bitchboy."
>Athena snorts
>"Yeah, that tells me nothing. Maybe he can take your little baby-clit, but he'd not even get halfway up mine."
>The other girls almost fall over themselves laughing
>Even Pepper falls off her own boy, holding her squishy tummy as she cackles, giving him a chance to get in a few gasps of air
>Snorlax is flushed, looking humiliated
>Suddnly she reaches over and smacks Athena on the back of the head
>"Shut the fuck up Athena! Maybe you should have some humility, like your cuck of a whore mom!"
>The laughter stops
>Athena looks over at Snorlax, her face blank
>"What the fuck did you just say."
>Snorlax stares back wide-eyed, an oh-shit look on her face
>"Shit... uh, I'm sorry Athena, I didn't mean...!"
>Athena cracks her knuckles, and takes her jacket off
>Snorlax drops the leash
>You think you can pinpoint the exact moment she realises how fucked she is
>Sensing danger, the boy in-between Snorlax's legs takes the opportunity to slink off
>Athena stands up, and you suddenly get an impression of just how huge she is
>"Say that again why don't you? Hmm? SAY THAT A-FUCKING-GAIN!!"
>With the speed of a viper striking, she jerks out her big paw, and grabs Snorlax by the throat
>Snorlax grasps at Athena's powerful arm with both paws, making a choking sound
>Athena picks her up by the neck, and tosses her to the ground where she crumples like a ragdoll
>"YOU! FUCKING! STUPID! CUNT!" she screeches, punctuating each word with a sharp kick to Snorlax's ribs
>Snorlax coughs, curls up into the fetal position
>"shitshitshitimsorryathenashitshitshitpleasedontkillmeimsorryshitshitshit"
>Athena storms over to Cris, and snatches the butterfly knife out of her hands, before turning back to Snorlax's prone body
>"DIE!" Athena screams, raising the knife above her head
>SHIT, time to act
>As Athena brings the knife down, she suddenly stops
>You've caught her arm in your hand
"Athena, that's enough!"
>Athena freezes, and turns to you, her teeth bared
>There's a moment of tense silence
>Eventually, she relaxes her arm and closes her mouth, her expression gone from psycho-killer-mode to just mad
>You let her go
>She tosses the knife aside, and Cris scuttles over to collect it
>Athena looks down at Snorlax, who's weeping and begging forgiveness
>"You ought to thank my boyfriend, he just saved your ass. Being saved by a dude... you're pathetic."
>She spits on the grovelling yeen
>"Get the fuck out of my house. Don't let me see your stupid face around here ever again."
>Snorlax slinks off, out of the room and out of the house
>There's an awkward silence, until Athena lets out a snort
>"I've got some stress to work out." she says, and grabs your hand, leading you off deeper into the house
>You head through two sets of doors and into a small bedroom
>There are posters on every square inch of the walls
>Punk and metal bands, satanic imagery, half-naked men and women, and some vandalised movie posters
>She has a double bed that takes up most of the room, and on her bedside table are some bottles on top of a toughbook laptop
>The bed is unkempt, but the sheets are kind of juvenile
>Well, honestly, childish
>They have a cute kitten pattern
>There's a one-eyed teddy bear on her pillow
>She tosses you on the bed, and then slumps head first alongside you, head in her pillow
>You lay there next to her for a second, not sure what to do, until you realise she's sobbing into the pillow

>Gingerly you reach over to Athena's head, and stroke her in-between the ears
>There's a short moment where she keeps her head in the pillow, crying loud enough for you to just about hear it through the fabric
>Then she turns her head away from the pillow and looks into your eyes
>She looks a mess; her nose is running, her eyes are puffed up, with tears streaking down her face, and she has a heartbroken expression
>"Welp, n-now you've seen what a monster I am," *sob* "I-I guess this is g-g-goodbye, huh?"
"Nope."
>You aren't letting her do this
>You wrap your arms around her and pull her in close
>She snuggles up to you, still weeping softly, not letting you go for anything
>You stay like that for several minutes
>Holding her close and petting her hair gently
>Occasionally going "shshshsh" to calm her down
>After a while the tears start to subside, but she still says nothing, just cuddles up to you
>Finally, after another few minutes, she starts to talk, in a low voice, so quiet you can hardly hear her
>"My dad's not your typical hyena's husband. He's assertive and knows his shit. He even tells Mom what to do, sometimes. And from what she tells me, she likes it."
>She rubs her face on your chest
>"So that's why I overreacted to Snorlax saying that shit about her. It's shameful for a yeen woman to get bossed around by a boy."
>You give her a squeeze
"Still, she shouldn't have said it. It was over the line. You only teased her a little. I'd punch someone in the face if they called *my* mom a whore."
>She chuckles
>"Sure, but I shouldn't've tried to kill her over it."
"Ehehe, maybe not. Better to just kick her ass."
>Athena laughs again, and dries her tears with her paw
>"I guess that's what I'll do next time, hehe. Thanks Anon. I was worried you were gonna see me as a beast or whatever after this, and I'd scare ya off..."
>You kiss her forehead, and ruffle her behind her ear, causing her to make a happy lowing noise
"You're scary as fuck, Athena - and I wouldn't have it any other way!"
>Athena smiles at you mischievously
>"Oh, I'm scary, am I?"
>She starts petting your upper body, grinning at you happily
>You grin back
"Sure. You're big, strong, scary, and I like that I know my place with you."
>She giggles almost girlishly, and suddenly pins you on your back with both arms, making you chuckle too at her lighter mood
>With you underneath her, at her mercy, she looks down at you from the high ground and licks her lips
>"You're so fucking sexy."
>You can feel your face heating up
>And another part of you becoming aroused
>Athena lowers her body to lie across yours, and catches your lips in her own
>Normally she'd hold back, but right now she seems to want to really go at it
>She all but forces her tongue into your mouth, wrestling hers with yours, meeting your soft moans with her pleasured growls
>After a few moments she breaks the kiss, and licks her lips again
>"Y'know what you haven't done yet?"
>You grin
"No, what might that be?"
>"You haven't fucked me yet."
"Mnnnf~"
>She sits up and starts to grind on you a little, gyrating her hips against your groin
>You can see that big bulge in her pants squishing up to your own, and realise this is really about to happen
>She all but tears her top off, revealing large breasts covered only in her lacy black bra
>You grab a hold of her boobs and she giggles
>"Someone's eager! Lemme get my bra off..."
>She reaches behind herself, fiddles and curses for a second, and the bra comes off in your hands
>You toss it aside and start caressing her naked upper body, making her moan softly as she starts to work on your pants
>She's gotten pretty good at this by now; your button and fly are undone in a few seconds, and she shifts her weight so you can give her a little more room
>She pulls your pants and underwear off with one go, and your dick stands to attention
>Lowering her body, she kisses your dick and runs her rough tongue up and down it, fiddling with her own jeans as she does so
>Before long she's straddling on top of you, her pseudo-penis grinding up against your cock
>Both of you are making a lot of noise now, she's making a primal growl, and you're moaning at her close touch
>She leans over you and clamps her powerful jaws around your shoulder, biting you just a little bit, though not enough to break the skin
>"I'm gonna fuck you so hard I'll have to carry you home," she growls
>You're moaning harder as you feel her pseudo-penis brushing against your cock, retracting as it goes
>Eventually, she's just rubbing her moist entrance up against the shaft of your now-diamond-hard dick, and she reaches down and adjusts it
>"Ready to become a man?"
>You nod emphatically
>She pushes it up into her entrance, and lowers her body down
>You can feel your manhood being enveloped by her warm, wet folds, and you let out a loud moan
>She's panting and moaning too, interspersed between primal growls and dominant dirty talk
>The feeling of being inside Athena is without compare; her tight entrance is squeezing up against you, milking you before she's even started moving
>You cup her ass in both hands, giving it a spank and grabbing her little tail
>She growls possessively, putting her body weight on top of you and meeting your lips with hers
>As you're kissing each other she starts to rhythmically grind you, squeezing your dick inside her, shifting it inside her wet hole
>You shift one arm up to hold her close while still grabbing a handful of ass with the other
>She breaks the kiss, growling and running her clawed fingers through your hair
>"Hmmn, you like that huh bitch?"
"I love it!"
>She's rough, but not too rough, conscious as she is that you're a lot smaller than her
>She keeps riding you, occasionally putting a claw or bite mark on your neck and shoulders
>After damn near humping you senseless, and as you're getting close, she picks you up by your shoulders so you're sitting up
>Your face is buried in her cleavage; the scent of sweat and musk mix together in a holy cocktail of yeen goodness
>"C'mon bitch, cum for me. Cum for me!"
>All you can do is moan "Athena!" into her cleavage, as she pushes you over the edge
>You feel your dick twitching inside her, and a warm feeling down there
>She growls possessively, and holds you tight as you release
>"Good boy."
>She disengages and lies alongside you, ruffling your hair
>You hug her close, and in turn she wraps her arms around you, squeezing you tight
>"You're the best, Anon"
>You chuckle softly
>"Also don't worry, I'm on the pill. I don't feel like having cubs... yet."
>You chuckle a bit more nervously at that
>"Do you want to go out there and see if the others are still here, or shall we stay and cuddle for a bit?"
"Let's just stay here."
>She giggles
>"Good choice."

---

>The smell and sound of bacon cooking wakes you up
>You must've fallen asleep
>Athena isn't beside you; maybe she went to get some bacon
>You stumble out of bed and pull yesterday's pants on, before heading out
>Following your ears and nose, you arrive in the kitchen
>Athena is in here alone, frying bacon
>She's wearing a soft bathrobe - and by the looks of it, nothing else
>She hears you enter, and turns around and gives you a wide grin
>"Good morning sleepyhead! Do me a favour and get some bread out of the bread bin there, it's almost ready"
>Obliging, you head to the bread bin and grab a loaf out
>Seeing a bunch of paper plates in a stack next to the bread bin, you put two pieces each on two plates, and bring them over to Athena
>She ruffles your hair and pulls you in for a hug
>You rest your head on her chest, listening to her breathing gently
>"Y'know, cuddling up to you while you're sleeping is like dying and going to heaven. You're so fucking cute"
>You feel your cheeks heating up, and just about stammer out "t-thanks"
>She chuckles and squeezes you tightly
>"I know I'm a bit rough round the edges, an' I know I'm not like a human chick, but... aghh, this is so gay. I love you Anon."
"I love you too Athena"
>You kind of mumbled that into her chest, but you really meant it
>And judging by her happy growl and her tight hug getting even tighter, it looks like she heard it and liked it, too
>Wow, you've been dating her for all of about two weeks and already it's love confessions
>Next you'll have a car, mortgage, and litter of cubs on the way
>She keeps growling and making other quiet happy noises as she releases you, steps back a little, and bends down to your level to kiss you
>The two of you share a soft, romantic kiss, neither getting too eager since it's still so early
>After a lovely few moments, Athena breaks the kiss, nuzzles your neck a little, then reaches over you to dole out the bacon
>Soon enough, you're sitting together at the small card-table Athena's family uses to dine on, with a huge bacon sandwich and mug of coffee each
>Words are not necessary as you both chow down on the fried goodness
>Athena's is long gone, and yours is almost finished, before a yeen you don't recognise comes in
>He's big, about the size of Athena, with a grizzled look
>He's dressed in a white tank-top and off-white pyjama bottoms, and from his neck dangle dogtags
>His ear is missing a chunk out of it, and he has a bit of a limp
>"Morning Athena." he grunts, heading straight for the fridge
>He grabs a carton of orange juice and a bottle of milk, and puts these down on the table
>He notices you still chowing down on the bacon, grunts and nods at you by way of greeting
>Once he's finished preparing his breakfast, a simple bowl of muesli, he starts to eat it sitting opposite you
>"So, boy, you must be Anon. Hear you think you have it in you to date my daughter."
>That's a bit aggressive. Athena giggles softly and slaps you on the arm
"Uh, yes sir," you respond nervously
>He cracks a grin and chuckles
>"Hey, don't mind me, boy. I'm cranky as hell in the morning. Just take care of each other and don't do anything stupid."
>He holds out a big paw, and you shake it
>He's got a strong handshake, but not a rough one
>"Name's Mart. Could you do me a favour, kid?"
>He picks up his dogtags and shows them to you
>"If some happy-go-lucky sumbitch tells you the army is anything other than a shitshow from start to finish and tries to get you to sign up, you tell 'em I said 'fuck you'."
>With that, losing interest in you, he starts demolishing his breakfast with his teeth
>You've finished your breakfast now, and Athena goes through with you into the front room, figuring you'd just watch some TV or something and enjoy your weekend
>As you enter the living room, a familiar face or two greets you
>"Oh for fuck's sake, Pepper."
>Sure enough, the chubby hyena from last night is there, taking up the whole couch lying down
>On top of her is her boytoy from yesterday, snoring loudly
>She grins at Athena and gives her a little wave
>"Hey Athena. Look, after I spent most of last night sitting on his face, Danny here decided it was payback time. You remember him, the new guy? I've decided to keep him, he's adorable."
>She starts ruffling his hair, and he stirs in his sleep a little
>Athena sighs, and puts her paw over her face
>"Well, I kinda wanted to cuddle with Anon on the couch. Wake him up. There's food in the kitchen. You can talk to my dad or something."
>Pepper chuckles and pokes Danny in the belly
>He jerks awake
>"Who? What? Huh?"
>"Good morning cute stuff. Athena's mom let us stay over. Wanna get a bite to eat?"
>He relaxes a little, though he still seems a little antsy
>"Oh, cool, yeah, let's do that. I'm starving."
>They both get up and clear out of there. Athena watches them go, before sitting down on the couch and patting the spot next to her
>"C'mon, saved you a space, cutiepie!"
>Chuckling to yourself, you sit beside her and nustle up to her side, and she drapes her arm round you and pulls you in close
"So, your dad is a vet?"
>She sighs
>"Yeah, and that's how he got so tough, I guess. Went to the Middle East or some other god-forsaken place to shoot commies in the 80s. He never fails to bring up how he watched his buddies die if he wants to guilt-trip you."
>You feel her shrug
>"Honestly I'm glad Gopher turned out like a proper yeen boy. Dad's ok, but I wouldn't be able to deal with two of him."
>You quietly just lean into her, enjoying her warmth and the sound of her breathing
>She doesn't seem too eager to talk any more about her family, but she's only too happy to squeeze you and draw you in closer
>Athena turns the TV on, and some Saturday morning cartoons come on
>You sit there with each other for a good while
>Athena stops to pet your head a little every now and again, or call you a good boy
>The telly drones on in the background, neither of you are really watching, more just enjoying each other's company
>Feeling needy all of a sudden, you lift your face up and plant a kiss on Athena's muzzle
>Smiling, she lowers her head and catches your lips in hers, kissing back hungrily, eventually getting your mouth open to wrestle your tongue with hers
>Before long, you find yourself lowered onto your back and Athena lying on top of you, making out with you, an occasional growl escaping her locked lips
>You ruffle her hair, scratch her neck and a little of her back beneath the bathrobe
>She breaks the kiss and makes a happy lowing noise
>"Ahh, fuck that feels good! They're always talking about how good humans are with their hands"
>You chuckle
"Who's 'they'?"
>"Uhh, you ever hear about this website called Pawchan?"
>Pawchan, heh, what did you expect from a punk-rock yeen
"I've been on there a little."
>She chuckles
>"You've heard of BHC, BRED, and all that shit then?"
"Yup. I know your dirty little secret."
>She chuckles again, almost nervously
>You just grin at her
"I mean, I get it, but I'm not exactly a looker by human standards."
>"Psh!" she makes a dismissive hand gesture "You look good to me, that's all that matters."
"No, really. You know who my best friend is, right?"
>"That crow guy? He has a girlfriend."
"Yeah, 'cos it's easy for a raven to get a girlfriend with his smarts. I'm smart, but I'd never expect that to land me a human girl."
>She chuckles, with humour this time
>"Dumb broads don't know what they're missing, then."
>She caresses the side of your face, and gives you a gentle kiss on the lips
>"Forget about them, Anon. You're the cutest thing I ever laid eyes on."
