Don’t you wanna be mine?” said Chloe before rubbing her face against yours once more</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn’t want to tell her the truth, that your parents would say something if you came home smelling of “beast”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Most times your first action when getting off the bus and saying goodbye to Chloe was to B-line it to the shower</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Its better that she not know about your parent’s scorn for beastfolk</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even worse is their hatred for having a whole house full of them move in right next door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Its just that I like showering everyday. Is that weird or something?” you respond</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Chloe gives you a confused look</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Showering everyday? I guess there are somethings I just don’t get about you humans” she says rubbing the back of her head before laughing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One day after school you and Chloe are sitting on a bench waiting for the buses to warm up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Chloe scoots next to you with her bag in her lap as she puts an arm around you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I have a little something special for you my little shower boy” she says in a sensual tone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get excited, having never received a gift from a girlfriend before</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”What is it?” you say</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Chloe gives you a toothy smirk as she opens and rummages through her bag with her free hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pulls out a gallon ziplock bag with what looks to be a folded up cloth inside of it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She places it in your lap before you pick it up and look at it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You got me……..a cloth?.......Thank you?” you say confused</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Haha, no Anon. It’s not just a cloth. Go on, open the bag” chuckles Chloe</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You unzip the bag and are immediately punched in the face with the concentrated hyena stench of Chloe</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Holy shit” you say as the reek burns your nostrils</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I wiped that cloth all over me. And when I say everywhere, I mean EVERYWHERE. Now you can apply my smell on to yourself on your own.” Chloe whispers in your ear with a smirk </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to stealthily hold in your breath but nothing can stop the invasive smell from entering your lungs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even though the smell is intense, you can’t help but feel aroused. Like your mind is beginning to crave the wild pheromones </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Keep digging” Chloe whispers giddily</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reach your hand down between the folds of the cloth and pull out what looks to be an old pair of sweaty and stained boy short panties</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The smell emanating from the boy shorts is sharp, musky and fermented with the salty essence of Chloe’s crotch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’ve been wearing those for a couple weeks now. Thought I could give yah a little something to help you along when you jack it. You know, keep me in your thoughts” said Chloe grinning with her tongue out as she gives you a wink</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel your face redden as you quickly glance around to see if anyone was watching the two of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quickly place the underwear back into the bag and zip it back up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”What is it? Don’t you like my gift?” says Chloe</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”No-No I love it I just don’t want people here to see me with woman’s underwear” you say only half-truthfully</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Fuck ‘em, if they got anything shitty to say to you they’ll have to go through me” said Chloe pumping a bicep</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Yeah, your right….I shouldn’t be so freaked out. Its just outta habit, you know?” you say looking down at the bag with concern</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Chloe softens her gaze as she sees the worried look on your face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”What’s wrong? Something’s bothering you.” She says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Its….I dunno how I am gonna hide this from my parents” you say as you think of all the ways your parents would blow up at you if they found the bag</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Why do your parents care if you have some cloth and some old underwear? Just hide it in a drawer or under the bed or something” said Chloe dismissively</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Its not that….they’re…….never mind” you say before putting the bag away into your backpack</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Chloe gives you a suspicious look but decides not to pursue it any further</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You know Anon, speaking of parents. My mom and dad asked me to bring this new boyfriend I seem so enamored with over to dinner” said Chloe lightly kicking her feet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look up at Chloe with surprise in your eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Your parents want me to come over? They know I am a human, right?” you say feeling some anxiety in your chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Yeah, of course they do….why? Don’t your parents know I am a hyena?” said Chloe</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Yeah…Yeah they do” you lie</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Great, then how about you nut up and come over to my house at 6pm tomorrow? Sound good?” said Chloe standing up from the bench and holding out a hand to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel the anxiety rise through your back at the thought of meeting a family of Chloes but you choke it back down and grab Chloe’s hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Chloe pulls you to your feet as she wraps an arm around your back, slipping her hand into your back pocket and cupping a cheek</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Yeah, let’s do it. I’ll be over tomorrow at six” you say trying to sound confident but failing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Chloe gives you a toothy smile before pulling you into a long kiss, her tongue eagerly caressing your own</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You brace your hands onto her shoulders to stop her, fearing for those looking on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As her large soft tongue runs along your teeth and roof of your mouth, you drop your hands back down to your sides</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pinpricks flow over your head as you let the tall hyena have her way with your mouth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Chloe retracts her tongue, pulling away from the kiss before licking you once more on the lips</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”So how was that for a first kiss?” says Chloe licking her teeth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”It was….wild” you say as you stare into her face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Wild good or wild bad?” Chloe says giving you the eye</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Wild good” you say as you taste the notes from Chloe’s saliva on your mouth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Chloe’s hand in your back pocket gives your ass cheek a firm squeeze</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”That’s what I like to hear” she says giving the side of your neck a quick lick</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel a tingling sensation up your spine</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Come on you stupid fucks!

Chloe’s Family [Hyena(f)xHuman(m), school, smell, musk, masturbation, role-reversal]
By Teether


&gt;Two weeks had passed since you first agreed to be Chloe’s boyfriend after she mercilessly beat down your school bullies
&gt;Those two weeks were some of the most stress-free days you’ve ever felt since entering school
&gt;With Chloe always by your side and her giving out stabbing glares to anyone within bullying distance, your life felt like a breeze
&gt;Sure there were times where she overreacted to other females and possible bullying attempts but for the most part she kept a cool head
&gt;She always made sure to keep a possessive arm around your shoulder and rubbing you with her scent if you showered the night before
&gt;”Anon, why are you always taking all these showers for? Don’t you wanna be mine?” said Chloe before rubbing her face against yours once more
&gt;You didn’t want to tell her the truth, that your parents would say something if you came home smelling of “beast”
&gt;Most times your first action when getting off the bus and saying goodbye to Chloe was to B-line it to the shower
&gt;Its better that she not know about your parent’s scorn for beastfolk
&gt;Even worse is their hatred for having a whole house full of them move in right next door
&gt;”Its just that I like showering everyday. Is that weird or something?” you respond
&gt;Chloe gives you a confused look
&gt;”Showering everyday? I guess there are somethings I just don’t get about you humans” she says rubbing the back of her head before laughing
&gt;One day after school you and Chloe are sitting on a bench waiting for the buses to warm up
&gt;Chloe scoots next to you with her bag in her lap as she puts an arm around you
&gt;”I have a little something special for you my little shower boy” she says in a sensual tone
&gt;You get excited, having never received a gift from a girlfriend before
&gt;”What is it?” you say
&gt;Chloe gives you a toothy smirk as she opens and rummages through her bag with her free hand
&gt;She pulls out a gallon ziplock bag with what looks to be a folded up cloth inside of it
&gt;She places it in your lap before you pick it up and look at it
&gt;”You got me……..a cloth?.......Thank you?” you say confused
&gt;”Haha, no Anon. It’s not just a cloth. Go on, open the bag” chuckles Chloe
&gt;You unzip the bag and are immediately punched in the face with the concentrated hyena stench of Chloe
&gt;”Holy shit” you say as the reek burns your nostrils
&gt;”I wiped that cloth all over me. And when I say everywhere, I mean EVERYWHERE. Now you can apply my smell on to yourself on your own.” Chloe whispers in your ear with a smirk 
&gt;You try to stealthily hold in your breath but nothing can stop the invasive smell from entering your lungs
&gt;Even though the smell is intense, you can’t help but feel aroused. Like your mind is beginning to crave the wild pheromones 
&gt;”Keep digging” Chloe whispers giddily
&gt;You reach your hand down between the folds of the cloth and pull out what looks to be an old pair of sweaty and stained boy short panties
&gt;The smell emanating from the boy shorts is sharp, musky and fermented with the salty essence of Chloe’s crotch
&gt;”I’ve been wearing those for a couple weeks now. Thought I could give yah a little something to help you along when you jack it. You know, keep me in your thoughts” said Chloe grinning with her tongue out as she gives you a wink
&gt;You feel your face redden as you quickly glance around to see if anyone was watching the two of you
&gt;You quickly place the underwear back into the bag and zip it back up
&gt;”What is it? Don’t you like my gift?” says Chloe
&gt;”No-No I love it I just don’t want people here to see me with woman’s underwear” you say only half-truthfully
&gt;”Fuck ‘em, if they got anything shitty to say to you they’ll have to go through me” said Chloe pumping a bicep
&gt;”Yeah, your right….I shouldn’t be so freaked out. Its just outta habit, you know?” you say looking down at the bag with concern
&gt;Chloe softens her gaze as she sees the worried look on your face
&gt;”What’s wrong? Something’s bothering you.” She says
&gt;”Its….I dunno how I am gonna hide this from my parents” you say as you think of all the ways your parents would blow up at you if they found the bag
&gt;”Why do your parents care if you have some cloth and some old underwear? Just hide it in a drawer or under the bed or something” said Chloe dismissively
&gt;”Its not that….they’re…….never mind” you say before putting the bag away into your backpack
&gt;Chloe gives you a suspicious look but decides not to pursue it any further
&gt;”You know Anon, speaking of parents. My mom and dad asked me to bring this new boyfriend I seem so enamored with over to dinner” said Chloe lightly kicking her feet
&gt;You look up at Chloe with surprise in your eyes
&gt;”Your parents want me to come over? They know I am a human, right?” you say feeling some anxiety in your chest
&gt;”Yeah, of course they do….why? Don’t your parents know I am a hyena?” said Chloe
&gt;”Yeah…Yeah they do” you lie
&gt;”Great, then how about you nut up and come over to my house at 6pm tomorrow? Sound good?” said Chloe standing up from the bench and holding out a hand to you
&gt;You feel the anxiety rise through your back at the thought of meeting a family of Chloes but you choke it back down and grab Chloe’s hand
&gt;Chloe pulls you to your feet as she wraps an arm around your back, slipping her hand into your back pocket and cupping a cheek
&gt;”Yeah, let’s do it. I’ll be over tomorrow at six” you say trying to sound confident but failing
&gt;Chloe gives you a toothy smile before pulling you into a long kiss, her tongue eagerly caressing your own
&gt;You brace your hands onto her shoulders to stop her, fearing for those looking on
&gt;As her large soft tongue runs along your teeth and roof of your mouth, you drop your hands back down to your sides
&gt;Pinpricks flow over your head as you let the tall hyena have her way with your mouth
&gt;Chloe retracts her tongue, pulling away from the kiss before licking you once more on the lips
&gt;”So how was that for a first kiss?” says Chloe licking her teeth
&gt;”It was….wild” you say as you stare into her face
&gt;”Wild good or wild bad?” Chloe says giving you the eye
&gt;”Wild good” you say as you taste the notes from Chloe’s saliva on your mouth
&gt;Chloe’s hand in your back pocket gives your ass cheek a firm squeeze
&gt;”That’s what I like to hear” she says giving the side of your neck a quick lick
&gt;You feel a tingling sensation up your spine
&gt;”Come on you stupid fucks! Get on the bus!” the drunken bus driver shouts to the students standing around out front
&gt;Chloe brushes your hair out of your face
&gt;”Come on skin, guess our fun can wait for the bus” Chloe says turning towards the bus
&gt;As Chloe starts to walk, you reach out and grab her hand, intertwining her long fingers with your own smaller ones
&gt;Chloe looks down abruptly at your hands cradled together before looking away from you and holding her other hand to her face
*Is she blushing?
&gt;”Are you ok?” you say
&gt;”I-I am fine” says Chloe looking forward and taking a couple deep breaths
&gt;You both stand there for a second before you take the first step forward
&gt;Chloe immediately takes the lead, trying to pull you along
&gt;You’re pulled a couple steps before slamming down your feet
&gt;Chloe looks back at you confused
*Does she not know how to walk hand in hand?
&gt;You walk up beside Chloe
&gt;”We’re supposed to walk side by side, you know. Like a couple?” you say
&gt;Chloe huffs lightly
&gt;”Is this another human thing?” she says 
&gt;”It is, but if you follow along you might just enjoy it” you say trying to sound sweet
&gt;Chloe looks you over for a couple seconds before planting a kiss on the side of your face
&gt;”I’ll try anything once for you babe” she says
&gt;”YOU TWO! GET ON THE FUCKING BUS! I AIN’T GOT ALL DAY!” screams out the bus driver once more
&gt;You both look at each other and snicker before walking side by side across the front of the school and up and into the bus


------------------


&gt;You give a goodbye kiss to Chloe out of sight of your house and quickly return home
&gt;You rush past your parents, standing in the kitchen, and straight into the shower
&gt;You make sure to scrub every last bit of scent from your body before returning to your room in a bath towel and plopping your bag on the floor
&gt;You lock the door to your room before dropping your towel to the ground, leaving you completely naked
&gt;You go over to your backpack and open it
&gt;You pull out the ziplock bag and open it up
&gt;The air around you is filled with Chloe’s scent
&gt;In a bolt of panic you zipper it back shut, wondering whether the scent would get all over your room
*Stop being a pussy and just open it
&gt;You open the bag again, quickly pulling the lacy boy shorts from it before zipping it back closed
&gt;You go over and lay in your bed, grabbing some tissues from the box on your nightstand
&gt;You run the cloth of the underwear between your fingers, feeling the accumulation of sweat in the panties
&gt;The organic stink and muskiness of the underwear lingers in the air around them
&gt;Your nose wrinkles as the fumes whisp at the entrance to your nostrils
*If I want to be with Chloe, I have to enjoy her scent. I can’t be repulsed by my own girlfriend. I want her, I need to love her smell as much as she loves me.
&gt;You breathe out all the air from your lungs and nostrils before plunging the crotch of the panties down over your nose
&gt;You huff in an entire lungful of Chloe’s organic wild scent
&gt;Your nose is pierced with the beastial notes of her fur and the heavy zesty smell of her crotch sweat
&gt;You cough, as you taste the heavy pheromones from her rear on your tongue
&gt;You pull the underwear away from your face as you look down at your crotch
&gt;You’re already rock hard
*”Keep me in your thoughts” you hear Chloe’s voice repeat in your head from earlier in the day
&gt;You smile at the thought as you place the panties back over your nose, now smelling more like heaven to you with ever whiff
&gt;You place the tissues over the tip of your member as you begin to huff more and more of her scent, your mind filling with images of Chloe
&gt;You think of her slim frame and chest,  her tight butt with her cute little tail and how she held you as she gave you that deep kiss from earlier
&gt;As her wild hyena scent fills every nook of your nose you wonder what it would be like to eat Chloe out, what it would be like to fondle her breasts, what it would be like to fuck her
&gt;Before you can get much farther your pelvis begins to buck as you completely soak the tissues in your hand
&gt;You feel goosebumps travel along every part of your skin
&gt;You pull the underwear away from your face, gasping for air as you look down at the mess you’ve made
&gt;Your legs still tremble and your hands are shaky
&gt;That was the most intense orgasm you’ve ever had in your life
&gt;”ANON! COME ON DOWN FOR DINNER!” you hear your mom shout
&gt;You leap off the bed and quickly stick the panties back into the ziplock bag before throwing it into the back of your sock drawer
&gt;You quickly get dressed and run to the bathroom, splashing your face with soap and water
&gt;You run downstairs, ready to tell your parents of the plans you have for tomorrow afternoon
&gt;You make sure to leave out the fact that you’ll be over the neighbor’s house
&gt;Its best to keep you and Chloe a secret
&gt;……
&gt;You hope 


-----------------


&gt;Most of your day goes on as usual but with one clear difference
&gt;You and Chloe walk hand in hand most times you can
&gt;She even seems to be enjoying herself, not always having to physically drag you along with her
&gt;You almost think she’s getting some sort of thrill out of it with the way she acts
&gt;Aside from that, you slog through your usual boring school day and get off the bus
&gt;Except this time you head towards Chloe’s house
&gt;Your heart begins to race a bit as you both get up to the front door
&gt;Chloe opens the door and pulls you inside
&gt;You’re met with a wild cocktail of hyena smells 
&gt;You look around surprised by how normal the inside looks, other than the smell
*What’d you expect? A literal zoo house, you fucking racist?
&gt;You start to pinch your nose but when Chloe looks your way you let go
*Just hope my nose adjusts to this
&gt;”Come on, I want to show you my room” Chloe says eagerly pulling you down the hallway towards the stairs
&gt;”Shouldn’t we meet your parents first?” you say as Chloe pulls you up the stairs
&gt;”You’ll see them soon enough, don’t worry your little head” Chloe says with irritation
&gt;You shrug and follow her up the stairs and down a long hallway with multiple doors
&gt;On the left is two normal looking doors, on the right is a door covered in band stickers and a sign reading in bold scratchy text “KNOCK FIRST DAMMIT!” which you assume is Chloe’s room, next to that is the bathroom and down at the very end of the hall seems to be the master bedroom
&gt;Chloe opens the band sticker covered door and pulls you in, quickly shutting it behind her
&gt;You look around the small room
&gt;There’s a small twin sized bed against the left wall with blankets messily scattered and torn ontop of it, covered in dirty clothes
&gt;The floor itself is covered in piles of dirty clothes and shoes scattered about randomly
&gt;You see a small desk in the corner covered in empty energy drink cans and next to it, a large tube ampilifer plugged into a guitar sitting nearby on its stand
&gt;The guitar is a beautiful sunfire color and would almost look new if not for it being covered in deep claw marks, tearing through its paint
&gt;The walls and ceiling are completely covered in band posters, some punk, some heavy metal, some psych rock. A little bit of everything.
&gt;You squint, looking up at the ceiling as you try to make out the names of the bands
&gt;Suddenly your jolted from you gazing by the sound of distortion from the big amplify
&gt;You look over to see Chloe with her guitar, tuning the pegs as the tube amp crackles lightly
&gt;”Wanna hear a little song I made just for my favorite little human” she says with a wink
&gt;”S-sure” you say taken off guard, before backing up and sitting on the edge of Chloe’s messy bed
&gt;Chloe smiles and begins to individually pick at strings creating a beautiful angelic almost harp-like tune
&gt;”My little human to protect and to hold….My little human to care and caress…..”   sings Chloe with a beautifully feminine voice
&gt;Your mesmerized by the gentleness of the tune and the personal lyrics she sings
&gt;You feel your ears begin to blush as she gets into some spicier lyrics about the things she wants to do with you
&gt;You can’t help but feel endlessly wanted and cared for by the hyena
&gt;Chloe finally finishes up the last lyric before taking a deep breath
&gt;Suddenly Chloe starts belting out the same lyrics but in a black metal scream as she rapidly assaults her guitar strings with her claws
&gt;You sit back a little farther as the noise assaults your ears
&gt;Chloe finally finishes the last line, panting as she tries to catch her breath from all the screaming
&gt;You sit up straight and start clapping at the exhausted hyena
&gt;Chloe lays her guitar on the floor and comes over to you
&gt;”Really? You liked it?” she says eagerly with her ears perked and her tail wagging
&gt;”Yeah, it was great. I’ve never had anyone write me a song before” you say blushing as Chloe’s face gets closer to yours
&gt;”Goddamn your just so cute I could gobble you up” she says before planting a kiss on your mouth
&gt;You try to return the kiss but as you do you Chloe breaks away and begins sniffing your face and neck
&gt;”What is it?” you say
&gt;”You didn’t apply my scent today did you?” Chloe says irritated
*Shit, I was so late getting out the door I completely forget
&gt;”No I didn’t but-“ you say
&gt;”Do you not like my smell? Do you still think I am disgusting?” said Chloe with concerned eyes
&gt;”What no!” you say holding your hands up
&gt;”How do I know you didn’t just throw the bag out? Why are you so insistent on taking all these showers?” Chloe says looking hurt
&gt;”I didn’t throw it out! I just forgot, ok!” you say snapping a bit
&gt;Chloe looks into your eyes for a bit before calming back down and sitting next to you on the bed
&gt;”You don’t think I smell bad?” Chloe says not looking at you
&gt;”No, I like your smell” you say
&gt;”Then prove it” says Chloe looking over at you
&gt;”What?” you say looking at her
&gt;”I said prove it” she says quickly taking off her jacket, leaving her in a ratty band tank top as she raises her left arm
&gt;You stare at the hyena’s raised furry armpit as its sour notes tickle the cusp of your nose
&gt;”You want me to sniff your armpit? You say
&gt;Chloe chuckles, “Yes, don’t act like this is weird. Get in their and prove to me you like it”
*But it is weird….
&gt;You hesitate for a second looking at Chloe’s face before diving nose first into the furry pit
&gt;”I don’t hear you breathing” Chloe says as the fur brushes in and along your nose
&gt;You take a deep breath of the girl’s scent, causing you to cough as the zesty sour and wild fur notes course through the back of your nose and mouth
&gt;You can feel yourself getting hard as your erection begins sliding down the right leg of your pants
&gt;Chloe notices with a toothy grin and begins rubbing a hand along the hard on through your pants
&gt;”I can’t hear you breathing. More!” she commands closing her arm around your head
&gt;You try to breath in more but you can only cough as the smell overwhelms your normal senses
&gt;”Not good enough, human” Chloe laughs as she pins you back down onto the bed with you in the tight grasp of her arm, giving you no escape for air
&gt;Chloe begins to tickle your sides with her free hand as you begin to laugh wildly along with her
&gt;”Chloe, holy shit, stop! I am going to cry!”
&gt;You can feel your dick almost about to cum from sheer smell alone as you wiggle and thrash for fresh air
&gt;Suddenly, a knock comes from the door before it quickly opens
&gt;Chloe lets you go as you both sit upright on the bed
&gt;You look over to see a slim, feminine-looking, older male hyena in a long, colorful patterned cloth skirt and light green t-shirt. He has long flowing blonde hair and wears small round glasses on the bridge of his nose.
&gt;You see that the male hyena is carrying a tray with two sodas on it
&gt;”Anon, this is my dad, Ali. Dad, this here is Anon” says Chloe running her hands through her hair
&gt;”Nice to meet you Anon” says Ali in a soft tone as he gives you a light wave and a smile
&gt;”Nice to meet you Mr.Ali” you say back, not sure of what else to say
&gt;”It’s a pleasure, I brought you two some drinks but dinner should be ready in a couple minutes” says Ali putting the drinks down on a small table by the door
&gt;”Ok thanks dad, bye” Chloe says getting up to go over to the door to usher her dad out
&gt;”Oh and Chloe?” Ali says to Chloe as he leaves the room
&gt;Chloe sighs, “What is it dad?”
&gt;Ali leans close to Chloe and whispers but you still catch part of what he’s saying
&gt;”Go easy on the human….ok sweetheart?”


-------------


&gt;Chloe grabs the two sodas from the side table and comes back over to the bed
&gt;She hands one to you and you both start drinking them in between idle conversation
&gt;You can still smell Chloe’s armpit musk through your nose as it clings to your face and nostrils
&gt;Chloe finishes her drink before crushing the can on her forehead and lobbing it into a corner wastebasket
&gt;You try to do the same but the can doesn’t collapse, leaving you with a throbbing pain on your forehead
&gt;Chloe giggles as she takes the can from your hand and lobs it into the wastebasket
&gt;You rub the sore spot on your forehead before Chloe leans in and gives it a soft kiss
&gt;”All better?” she asks
&gt;”Sorta” you say still rubbing the spot
&gt;”Come on, let’s go downstairs, my parents are probably dying to meet you” She says taking your hand
&gt;You take a deep breath and stand up with Chloe, walking out the bedroom door and down the stairs to the kitchen
&gt;In the kitchen you see a rectangular dining table with two seats on each long side and one seat on each short side
&gt;On the left short side is a young teenaged hyena in a short frilly pink dress reading a book and on the opposite end is a long black haired female hyena of the same age wearing a dark black goth t-shirt and jeans full of holes, staring bored up at the ceiling with her arms crossed
&gt;On the far long end sits a giant muscular broad female hyena wearing dirty construction worker overalls and a dirty white tee with a dirty construction jacket slung over the back of the chair
&gt;Over by the kitchen counter you see Mr. Ali delicately attending to a large roast
&gt;”Hey everyone, I’d like you all to meet my boyfriend, Anon” says Chloe
&gt;Your heartbeat skyrockets as everyone in the room immediately turns their gaze towards you
&gt;A couple of silent seconds follow before the tall muscular female stands up from the table
&gt;She walks over to you as your heart starts to throb in your head before she begins sniffing your face and neck
&gt;She brushes her large head against the side of your face before pulling you up off your feet into a massive bear hug
&gt;Your face is pressed firm against her chest fluff between her massive breasts as you hear your spine pop
&gt;You can’t help but smell the large hyena’s strong scent of musk, sweat, granite dust, and roofing tar
&gt;”Welcome to the Hunter family, Anon!” she says in deep yet feminine voice
&gt;”Uh Mom, your suffocating him” says Chloe 
&gt;”Whoops, hehe, sorry. I get kind of get carried away around such cute boys” she says lowering you down before giving your cheek a pinch
&gt;”Mom!” Chloe says giving her mother a glaring look
&gt;”I am just kidding Chloe.  This one’s all yours,” She says before giving you a wink
*Did…. Did her mother just come on to me?
&gt;”Ughhh” says Chloe holding her face in her hand with embarrassment
&gt;Chloe’s mom lets out a chuckle and places an arm around you, bringing you towards the dining table, “Well, come on Anon, and let me introduce you to the family. My name is Bea but you can just call me Mrs. B if you want.”
&gt;Chloe follows behind you and Bea to the table, sitting down at one of the chairs opposite of Bea’s
&gt;Bea pulls out your chair, next to Chloe, for you before you sit down
&gt;Bea puts her large hand on your shoulder as she points to the other family members
&gt;”This little rebel over here is Savannah. She insists on wearing those ridiculous, flowery outfits everyday. I keep telling her she’ll never get a man that way but she doesn’t listen to me. She tells me times are changing, but what do I know. Kids these days” says Bea pointing over at the far end of the table at Savannah
&gt;”The times are changing mom, we can’t just keep blindly following the same culture we have for thousands of years. We’re isolating our selves from every other species” said Savannah putting down her book and pushing up her glasses
&gt;”You can tell she’s a little bookworm. Unconventional, but smart. As long as she comes home with good grades, she’s free to be whom she wants under my roof. Even if I don’t really understand it.” Whispers Bea to you
&gt;Savannah rolls her eyes before setting an intensely interested gaze on you as if she just noticed you were in the room
&gt;Bea points over at gothic looking hyena at the opposite side of Savannah
&gt;”This here is Reese, a bit of a recluse and not much of a talker but definitely takes more after her dear old mom.” Says Bea
&gt;”I don’t take after anyone” mumbles Reese as she flicks her long black hair out of her eyes
&gt;”Well you have to take after somebody child, what about all those artists and bands you like? You take after them?” says Bea
&gt;”I don’t take after them, they are a part of me. I use them for my expression” She mumbles before looking over at you with an interested look
&gt;”Hmpf, Well what can you expect from girls in the throes of puberty. Girls will be girls. Rebellious and reckless” said Bea before taking her hand off your shoulder and walking around to the opposite side of the table and sitting down
&gt;”I am sure you’ve already met my husband, Ali. Just the sweetest husband a wife could ever hope to have. He works as a teacher and is hoping to get a job soon at your school.” Says Bea
&gt;Mr.Ali looks over from the roast he’s been gently slicing to give Bea a flirting smile
&gt;Bea returns the flirting gaze 
&gt;Chloe rolls her eyes
&gt;”Hey honey would you mind grabbing me a beer why you’re over there?” says Bea to Ali
&gt;Ali lays a large slab of roast on a plate and grabs a beer from the fridge before walking over to Bea’s side and placing them down in front of her
&gt;”Thanks babe” Bea says before they both rub the sides of their faces against one another
&gt;Chloe crosses her arms and sticks her tongue out in disgust, “Can we not get all mushy in front of Anon?”
&gt;Before Bea can respond Savannah cuts in, “So what’s it like being a human?”
&gt;”Yeah what’s it like?” says Reese
&gt;You fumble for words at the question, not really sure of how to answer it
&gt;”Girls!” Bea says slamming her palm down on the table
&gt;”Sorry, just curious” says Savannah innocently
&gt;”Hmphf” Reese mumbles, crossing her arms
&gt;Just as you’re about to say something, Ali places a giant plate of raw roast in front of you, swimming in a lake’s worth of its own blood
&gt;Ali goes around the table, putting plates of meat down in front of everyone before seating himself
&gt;”Alright everybody, dig in!” says Bea before picking up a roast slab with her bare hands
&gt;You look down at the table for utensils but quickly realize there are none
&gt;You pick up the piece of meat in your hands and try to tear away a piece from the raw flesh
&gt;It takes you a lot of grinding and pulling to even get a small chunk of the bloody meat into your mouth
&gt;You look up from your piece of meat to see everyone mid-bite staring at you
&gt;”What?” you say
&gt;”Is everything alright?” Ali says concerned, “I didn’t over cook it did I?”
&gt;You put the steak back down on your plate, “No, no, everything’s great” you lie, “I just don’t have sharp teeth. Do you happen to have a knife?”
&gt;”We should have a smaller one around here somewhere” says Ali getting up from the table
&gt;”You need a knife to eat your food? Show us your teeth!” says Savannah excited
&gt;”Savannah!” Bea says
&gt;”No, its fine. I don’t mind” you say before you open your mouth, pulling back a corner with your finger
&gt;”Woah” says Savannah
&gt;”Weird” says Reese
&gt;Ali comes over to your side and places a small steak knife down by your plate
&gt;”I hope that works for you, everything else alright darling?” says Ali with his hands crossed in front of his skirt
&gt;”Yes, everything so far is great, thank you Mr. Ali”  you say picking up the knife and cutting away at the meat
&gt;Mr. Ali smiles before going back to his seat
&gt;The family continues eating as you carefully cut away at the roast on your plate, making sure to get at the well done parts
&gt;As you eat you can’t help but feel eyes drilling into the sides of your head
&gt;You look up to see Ali and Bea in idle chit chat before you glance over at the sides of the table and see Savannah and Reese staring at you
&gt;They both quickly look away but when you go back to eating you can feel their eyes once more
&gt;As you get halfway through your roast you begin to feel hyena feet slowly rubbing up and down your left and right legs
&gt;You sit up abruptly and look at both Savannah and Reese once more
&gt;Both give you a flirting look as they continue to sensually massage their feet up towards your thighs
&gt;Chloe looks over at you seeing the shock on your face before quickly looking under the table
&gt;Chloe growls at Savannah and Reese before kicking both of the sibling’s legs
&gt;The siblings cry out as they retract their legs back to their seats, rubbing their new bruises
&gt;”GIRLS! Behave yourselves” growls Bea
&gt;”Yes mom” all three females whine
&gt;The kitchen once again resumes into idle chit-chat about everyone’s work or school, normal everyday stuff as everyone continues to eat
&gt;You look over to see Reese leaning across the table in front of you to grab a saltshaker
&gt;As soon as she grabs the saltshaker she forcefully elbows your plate towards you
&gt;Your plate goes flying off the table, completely drenching you from chest to knees in blood as you stand up from the table
&gt;”Reese!” shouts Bea
&gt;”Sorry, I didn’t mean to” says Reese in a completely unconvincing voice
&gt;”Here, let me help you with that Anon” says Savannah with eager eyes as she bolts over to you with a napkin in her hand, blotting the blood close to your crotch
&gt;”Yeah here, I can help too” says Reese following after her sister to blot blood from your crotch
&gt;You start blushing and become flustered, not knowing what to say to the two sisters
&gt;”Get away from him!” growls Chloe, standing up from her chair
&gt;”What? We’re just trying to help” says Savannah
&gt;”Yeah, We’re just helping YOUR boyfriend” said Reese
&gt;Chloe stomps over to the sisters and yanks them off the ground by their arms
&gt;”I said get away from him,” Chloe growls in the most bestial way
&gt;”Ow, ok ok!” says Savannah
&gt;”Fine, alright!” says Reese
&gt;You look over at Bea and Ali who seem completely unalarmed with what was taking place
&gt;Chloe lets go of Reese and Savannah, dropping them ass first on the floor as Mr. Ali gets up from his seat
&gt;Chloe holds you close and gives you a reassuring rub of her face against yours
&gt;You have no fucking clue what just happened
&gt;Ali comes over and ushers you and Chloe back into the hall, ”I am so sorry for this mess Anon, Chloe can lead you to the upstairs shower. I’ll take your dirty clothes and wash them while you clean yourself off, ok honey?” 
&gt;You nod to Mr. Ali as Chloe takes you back towards the stairs, “Yeah, thank you Mr. Ali”
&gt;You and Chloe head upstairs, soon followed by Mr.Ali
&gt;You enter the bathroom and strip down, handing your dirty clothes out through the door
&gt;You look around the large bathroom
&gt;Other than the sink and toilet the bathroom looks almost spotless
&gt;You walk over to the almost brand new looking shower
&gt;You step into the shower as you look around for any soap
&gt;You quickly realize there is no soap or conditioner
&gt;You shrug and turn the shower on, letting the cool water run down over your body
&gt;You look down at the drain as the blood flows off your chest and legs
&gt;You zone out as you wonder whether you made a bad first impression on Chloe’s parents
*Was I not assertive enough? Was I not submissive enough? Did I do anything wrong?
&gt;Suddenly you feel eyes on you once again
&gt;You look up from the drain and over by the bathroom door
&gt;You see one head stacked on another of Savannah and Reese looking you over with greedy and inquisitive eyes
&gt;”So that’s what a human’s dingdong looks like” says Savannah
&gt;”Its so smooth looking, I think I like it” says Reese
&gt;You quickly try to cover yourself with the shower curtain
&gt;”GET OUT OF HERE YOU NOSEY LITTLE FUCKS!” you hear Chloe shout as she pulls both the sisters back from the doorway before slamming it shut
&gt;You sigh, letting the water pitter on you for a while more before climbing out of the shower and drying yourself off with a towel
&gt;After a couple minutes Mr.Ali hands you back your clothes through the door and you get dressed again
&gt;You step back out into the hallway to see Chloe right next to the door on guard, with her arms crossed and foot bracing the wall
&gt;”What are you doing?” you asked
&gt;”Keeping an eye out for the Sisses” she mutters
&gt;Mr. Ali comes down the hall from the master bedroom
&gt;”Chloe dear, maybe its best you took Anon home, its getting late and you still have homework to do” says Ali
&gt;”But dddaaaaad” Chloe whines
&gt;”You’ll both have plenty of time to catch up tomorrow. Oh and Anon?”
&gt;”Yeah, Mr. Ali?” you say
&gt;Ali leans forward and gives you a hug, “Thanks for being such a trooper and putting up with our family madness. Your welcome over here anytime.”
*Wow, I guess I didn’t fuck it up
&gt;”Thanks Mr. Ali” you say as Ali breaks from the hug
&gt;Ali smiles at you before heading down the stairs and back towards the kitchen
&gt;Chloe intertwines her fingers with yours as she leads you down the stairs and out the front door
&gt;You see the last of the sun going down over the trees in the distance as you both stand in front of the house
&gt;”Wow your family was-” You say
&gt;”A mess” Chloe chimes in
&gt;”I was going to say ‘great’” you say
&gt;Chloe huffs, “How? I bet your family is way more functional then my circus of a family”
&gt;Your throat clenches
&gt;”Speaking of which, when do I get to come over your parents place?” says Chloe
&gt;You cough a little
&gt;”Chloe…..fuck, I dunno how to say this” you choke out
&gt;”What? What is it?” Chloe says looking you over
&gt;”They…..they…..they don’t know you’re a hyena” you say rubbing the back of your head
&gt;”So?” Chloe says with a serious stare
&gt;”They…kinda hate beastfolk…..deeply hate beastfolk…..especially hyenas”
&gt;Chloe’s gaze and face muscles soften, “…..oh”
&gt;You straighten up and grab chloe’s other hand, “That doesn’t mean I don’t want to be with you. It just means that this whole thing’s gonna be a lot more complicated”
&gt;Chloe’s eyes and ears perk up, “So that’s why you were taking so many showers, it wasn’t cause of me, it was cause of your parents”
&gt;You nod, “Its not you, its them, if they even thought I smelled like ‘beast’ they’d put me through the wringer
&gt;Chloe’s ears droop, “And this whole time I’ve been badgering you about it, fuck I feel like such an ass”
&gt;You see the sadness on Chloe’s face and embrace her in a hug
&gt;”It’s not your fault, I should have told you sooner. I shouldn’t have lied to you in the first place” you say
&gt;Chloe grabs your chin and tilts it up towards her face
&gt;She embraces you in a passionate kiss as her tongue once more enters into your mouth
&gt;You can still taste some of the blood from the dinner roast on her tongue
&gt;She pulls back from the kiss and gives a determined look into your eyes
&gt;”Well, if they don’t like their son dating a hyena then they can go shove it up their asses. We’re not going to hide ourselves from anyone, especially not your parents” says Chloe
&gt;”What? But they’ll-“ you say surprised
&gt;”They’ll do what? Ban you from seeing me? Fuck ‘em” says Chloe
&gt;You feel energized by Chloe’s confidence
&gt;”They want to see you. They keep asking me to have you over for dinner,” you say nervously
&gt;”Then I’ll come over for dinner” Chloe says grinning
&gt;”But they’ll lose their shit!” you say
&gt;”Good! Let them lose their shit, as long as we’re together none of that matters” says Chloe holding both of your hands
&gt;”But-….I….Wh-……” you say looking for anything to say
&gt;Chloe embraces you in another kiss
&gt;”They’re nothing against us. Nothing they can say or do can separate us. I am not going to let anything happen to you” says Chloe looking into your eyes
&gt;You take a deep breath looking back into Chloe’s eyes
&gt;”Your right, we can’t let them get between us. I don’t care what they think anymore” you say feeling your confidence grow
&gt;The last of the sun dies over the horizon as Chloe embraces you in one last kiss and hug
&gt;”Your so brave Anon, I am so proud to be with you” says Chloe
&gt;You both stand, basking in each other’s presence for a couple minutes more before you say your goodbyes
&gt;You walk off towards your parent’s house with your head held high and proudly reeking of Chloe’s scent</textarea>
