It looks heavy.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They were also very cheerful, almost to the point of being creepy, as if their sudden appearance was not enough.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Law enforcement was at a loss on how to handle the situation, being that the &quot;Synths&quot; were doing nothing harmful.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They even started to ask if they could help the officers, and when asked to stop, questioned why helping people was a bad thing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Any and every attempt to detain them met with failure, as they would simply vanish and re-appear elsewhere.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The military was slightly disappointed on how the invasion, finding the whole ordeal anti-climatic</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The synths offered to stage an invasion using drones and non-lethal weapons in a remote area if it would help.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The media fared no better, everyone scrambling to set up interviews and get to the synths</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Reporter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hello,I&#039;m X from Y news, can I have your name?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Synth, looking thoughtful</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I don;t really have one yet, I didn&#039;t think I&#039;d need one to help people.

This line of thought brought up a bunch of questions you felt uncomfortable asking.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Did they even have a concept of sex? They did have male and female body types, but did they even have the right parts?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The internet was more than helpful to provide speculatory imagery, R34 hit hard...not that you were complaining.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s been a long day, so you go online and find some fap material, stress relief and all that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Video starts playing, and you get about halfway there when suddenly, it happens</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;*knock knock knock*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pausing the video with a grumble, you wonder who is knocking on the door this late at night.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Make yourself somewhat presentable, go up to the peephole and look into the hall.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A large LCD display of a pixelated orange eye stares back, before going through a blinking animation.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Anon, you okay in there?

click on the thing....might as well see what it does.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A widow opens and the pixelated synth steps out from behind large letters labeled Searching.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It smirks, but stops short and just stares at you in shock...blinking a few times.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even stranger, the word searching is replaced by &quot;please wait&quot; and the synth starts running.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Weird, but you have an odd idea as to how this thing works out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re not disappointing when there is a knock at the door a minute later</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you can get up however, the locks on the front door of your apartment are tumbling, and she steps in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stares at you for a moment, before stepping forwards, her tail shutting and locking the door with a fluid flick.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before a word can leave your mouth, Tanya scoops you up in a hug, pressing your head under her chin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For a moment you struggle, before exhaustion from the day&#039;s events sets in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s soft and warm, and her skin has a glass smooth feeling to it, you can&#039;t really describe it as anything but good.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smells like oranges, or some citrus fruit close to that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Shhh,&quot;

She coos, &quot;I&#039;ve got you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A moment later, you&#039;re on your back, pulled up against her as she lays on her side facing you, holding you like some manner of stuffed animal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She starts humming some wordless tune you can&#039;t place, probably one of her kind&#039;s...people&#039;s...creators&#039;?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eh, to tired and comfortable to think</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were having a rather pleasant dream, when you come around for some reason.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tanya is still hugging you, but something is bugging you for a moment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You suddenly give a gasp as something strokes your dick, something warm, smooth and really soft.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;IS she jacking you off with her tail?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Oh,&quot; Tanya murmurs, &quot;You woke up.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You start to ask what shes doing, but she shifts, propping herself up on an elbow and gazing down at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Shh, don&#039;t talk, just enjoy.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to sit up, but she gently presses down on you before giving you a kiss.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Synths could adjust the hardness of their lips, if video of them biting through rebar wasnt faked.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hers were soft, smooth as glass, and warm, the odd shape detracting nothing from them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her thin tongue darts between your lips for a moment, unsurprisingly orange flavored.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She presses up against you, and you can&#039;t help but notice she&#039;s gotten undressed while you slept.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Synths always had insanely smooth and shiny skin, noticeably soft and squishy to the touch.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Various parts of her body emit a soft orange glow, illuminating the bed and some reflective surfaces.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You gaze up at her face, her eyes gazing back into yours, before she gives you another kiss.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pushed you gently against the mattress with it, her tongue gliding inside your mouth and exploring.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re doing your best to hold back any embarrassing sounds, but Tanya seems to know every weak spot you have.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her tail is making you squirm, her scent and taste are inescapable and her touch is firm, but tender.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Despite lack of experience, you figure that no human woman could compare with a Synth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try thrusting into her tail in time with the strokes of her tail, only for it to let go.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A whine slips out, and she giggles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Ah ah ah,&quot; Tanya chides, &quot;None of that now. I&#039;m the one in control, let me set the pace.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s hard to disagree with that assessment, she is in control, you don;t have a reason to wrest it from her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That, and if things got forceful, you were woefully outclassed by her strength.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her tail winds back around your dick and resumes its slow, teasing motions.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If you can&#039;t assist her while she jacks you off, you might as well do some exploring of your own.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You right hand feels along her arm, noting that the layer of flesh compresses readily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her response is to nuzzle your neck, as if giving affirmation for you to continue.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your hand travels up her arm, before drifting across one of her boobs, which is even softer than the rest of her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She hums, enjoying the sensation, her tail rubbing against your glans in a way that stole your breath.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your exploration of her breast reveals she has no nipples, but there is definitely a sensitive spot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re getting close, and she&#039;s assailing your face with numerous kisses.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Tanya I&#039;m...I&#039;m&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stops, right before you can go over the tipping point.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Not just yet,&quot; She coos, &quot;I&#039;m going to make you beg, not with words but your moaning and squirming in my grasp.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Tanya, please-gah!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She kisses your neck in a place that should not be that sensitive, her tongue sending an electric jolt upon contact.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every time you try to speak, she does this, silencing you save the shameless moans that come forth unbidden.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her three fingered hand picks up where her tail left off, stroking, edging, tormenting.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decide to even the score a little, moving the hand of your pinned arm to rub her lower lips.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Upon reaching her crotch however, there&#039;s just more of the smooth, soft material.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I don&#039;t have that particular accessory installed yet...&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s grinding against your hand, and it feels slightly warmer to the touch, so she&#039;s definitely enjoying it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Imagine always being at the edge, but never climaxing.

with Tanya, and life hadn&#039;t really changed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, not noticeable from the outside, and the world itself wasn&#039;t winding up like a doomsday jack in the box</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Iran kept declaring the Synths as &quot;An affront to Allah,&quot; at least the people in charge were</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;North Korea claimed that the Synths were creations of the Dear Leader and proof of his divine power</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pretty much ever government was trying their best to exert a measure of control over the synths, but failed utterly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was difficult, mostly because the Synths were impossible to contain and doubly unstoppable</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They&#039;d also become a bit more &quot;proactive&quot; in their &quot;helping&quot; if the news was even accurate</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, most of the news companies were trying to earn money and drive up their ratings, so you&#039;d taken it with a grain of salt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That being said, the Synths had opened their own websites, mostly streaming services and podcasts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mos of it was related to science, how-to/diy projects, talk and game shows worthy of Japan status</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then there was the &quot;invasion&quot; of hospitals, as though the Synths marched shoulder to shoulder through the doors</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mostly, it was only one or two, and they stuck to the children&#039;s ward, or whenever a bad accident happened</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was hard to turn down the assistance of a hypoallergenic, easy to sterilize, and surprisingly knowledgeable Synth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you pulled into the parking lot of your apartment building, you spotted a group of Synths marching down the street</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Normally, Synths traveled alone or in pairs, but larger groups were a definite sign of pro activeness on their part</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Odds were, they were dead set on helping the local police department, or planning some manner of harmless shenanigans</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One of them spotted you, then they all looked at you, and gave you that knowing, happy, and slightly smug look</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It all began that morning after your intimate encounter with Tanya, waking up warm, relaxed, and smelling strongly of orange</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A brief session of morning cuddles sadly came to an end, as you had to get ready for work and Tanya had to make her round about the apartment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You all but scrubbed your skin raw and applied a liberal dose of deodorant to cover up the smell of orange</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;None of your coworkers had noticed, though they definitely noticed the pep in your step</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It wasn&#039;t until lunch at the outdoor restaurant a few days later when another synth spotted you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He almost froze upon spotting you, and gave you a smug, but somehow approving look</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was then you knew that they knew, and they knew you knew they knew</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This had led to a small freak out the moment you were back in your apartment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every Synth you came across would give you that look, but that was about it from them, aside for a cheerful wave or two</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tanya started spending more time with you, and was more touchy-feely with you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You weren&#039;t against it, she was nice, and as far as you could tell, she genuinely liked you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then one day, you arrived home to freshly-made dinner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There was that moment of panic as you tried to find out what the hell was going on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then you smelled the faint odor of oranges, and figured out what had happened</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After finishing the meal, you&#039;d tracked Tanya down and brought the matter up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She hadn&#039;t seen the harm in it, and the two of you more or less come to an understanding in your relationship</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And then she picked you up and given you a deep kiss involving lots of her tongue invading your mouth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;d been set down lightheaded and swaying slightly, and she&#039;d patted you on the head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Catch you later Anon~&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;How did that country song go, hate to see her go but lord to watch her leave?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That was just the start, she&#039;d definitely stop by more often, not that you minded</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mostly, it was to chat, though it often involved the two of you cuddling on your bed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tanya had a habit of hugging you from behind too, whether standing, sitting, or laying down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;d idly trace a finger round your belly button in slow, lazy circles as the two of you talked about your respective days</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;d asked about why she did it on a whim, and her response was a little odd...at least from you perspective.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;It&#039;s the closest thing you have to a port.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Apparently, the ports on a Synth, or at least the soft &quot;tissue&quot; covering them was fairly sensitive</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was mostly a sign of trust, and fairly pleasant from their perspective, to rub around them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The action gained a new level of intimacy from that point on, and it did feel nice...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few days later when she stopped by, she seemed a little off, almost stressed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You brought her inside, hugged her, and had her sit down while you massaged her back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She all but melted as you worked her upper back with your thumbs, probably a pair of ports beneath them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Apparently, she&#039;d run afoul of a &quot;Karen,&quot; who had taken issue with her existence</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This had resulted in the woman becoming increasingly incoherent and furious as Tanya calmly rebutted her statements</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually, the police got involved, and had told the lady to cease making a scene, which only resulted in more screaming</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have her a firm hug and just told Tanya you were there for her if she needed anything</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her pixelated eyes turned to hearts and she all but pulled you into her lap for a kiss</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The cheap wooden chair that the two of you were in decided to break, sending you both to the ground</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a moment of awkward silence, the two of you broke into laughter for a minute</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tanya pretty much moved in that night, and had promised you something special on the coming Friday</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That day was today, and you were a little nervous, not entirely sure of what the synth had in mind</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Walking into the apartment building was nothing new, but you did pass by a rather imposing Synth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Dude looked more like a dragon than any of his brethren, even sported what looked like a beard</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He gave you a nod as he passed, apparently not feeling the need to give you the look</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, it was time to face whatever Tanya had in mind for you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Opening the door to your apartment, you&#039;re not too surprised by the lingering scent of orange</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There&#039;s also whatever Tanya is cooking in your small kitchen, something savory by the smell of it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s hard not to notice a 2 meter tall dragon-esque Synth in the small space, especially with here white and orange coloring</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s humming a cheerful tune, swaying to the beat, obviously aware of your presence but dedicated to the task at hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Welcome home Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hey Tanya.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Dinner will be in just a min~ute, go ahead and have a seat.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull off your boots and move toward the table, once again wondering how things go to this point</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;How many people were in a similar situation to yourself were there anyhow?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There were a lot of unanswered questions, but you did your best not to pester Tanya with them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hold up, where did that new chair come from?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It looked brand new, and judging from the heavy frame and slot in the backrest, made for a Synth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Tiberius brought it in just now.

of the table</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Salisbury steak and mashed potatoes...and knowing Tanya, it&#039;s going to be delicious</div></li><li class="li1"><div

class="de1">&quot;Yeah, your people have come up with some tasty things...we&#039;re interested in trying a lot of recipes on Earth.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div

you make small talk, sharing your days, discussing events happening around the world</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Unfortunately, dinner doesn&#039;t last forever, and soon your plates are empty</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tanya is still smacking her lips with her lengthy tongue, humming in content</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;So, does human food do anything for a Synth?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;It&#039;s an interesting experience, we can break it down for fuel, raw materials, lubricant.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look up and Tanya&#039;s face is the picture of innocence, her tail happily swaying behind her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A short mental debate raged in your head as you wondered if that was an innuendo or not</div></li><li class="li1"><div

class="de1">&gt;Her expression turns downright predatory, as though contemplating Salisbury Anon for desert...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With that, you make your way to the small bathroom in the apartment with some pajamas in hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Its hen you&#039;ve started to lather up that you feel a presence nearby, and the scent of oranges.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That&#039;s when a smooth three digited hand places itself on your back, and Tanya enters the shower with you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The small space becomes much smaller with the towering dragon droid sharing the space, hugging you from behind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her head is right next

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You back is pressed against her inhumanly smooth belly, the soft material of her breasts against your shoulders</div></li><li class="li1"><div

a very unmanly sound and make a short hop away from her as she laughs loudly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Turning, you see it&#039;s just her tail-tip, slid between her legs in a very suggestive manner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Don&#039;t worry Anon, that piece of hardware isn&#039;t installed.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh in relief, vowing vengeance for this prank, when her tail moves away from her crotch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;ve got something better instead.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...And just like that, you&#039;re left speechless again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The outer lips look human, and they&#039;re wet with a sheen that isn&#039;t from the shower</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Slowly and carefully, Tanya turns around, presenting her lovely backside to you, the orange slit clearly visible</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her hefty tail curls around the small of your back, drawing you in just a bit, her hands pressing against the far wall</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Go ahead, take your time Anon, I&#039;m in no hurry.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her tone is just as soft as the rest of her, and doubly encouraging.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For a moment, you just explore with your hands, brushing the slit and squeezing her plush backside and tail-base</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She croons at the contact, pressing back ever so slightly, giving you that warm loving look she has when she cuddles you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;ll climax when you do, so don&#039;t worry about being embarrassed or anything.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She wants this, she wants you, and the feeling is entirely mutual</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Gripping your cock, you guide the head to rest against her slit, shuddering at the warmth and wetness</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tanya sighs, before pulling you in with her tail, you manhood sinking into her depths</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s incredibly plush and warm inside, and you hilt yourself with little effort, shuddering.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your partner also reacts, sighing in utter contentment, rolling her hips as she adjusts to the new sensation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you aren&#039;t hurried at first, just taking the time to enjoy each other&#039;s bodies.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tanya&#039;s glass-smooth skin is absurdly slick from the moisture, and quite malleable, perhaps more so than a human&#039;s</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you grope her somehow softer breast, you don&#039;t find any nipples, she probably didn&#039;t think they were necessary</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The tightening of her passage around you and the sounds she makes indicate what you&#039;re doing feels good</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her jaws are parted, her tongue out as though she&#039;s panting, and her eyes have gone heart shaped</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Soon enough, you feel a familiar pressure building, so you attempt to slow down a little</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your synth liver has other ideas, her tail pulling you in and her ass clapping against your hips a little more forcefully</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, she did edge you for ages during your last encounter, teasing you to the brink before stopping.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just as you start reaching your limit, you pull out and stop, causing her to pause</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Huh...why did you stop?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lay against her back, hugging her to you and avoiding direct eye contact with a weapons grade pout</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She grinds against you, subtly trying to slip you back inside, but she can&#039;t get the right angle</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;What happened to not being in a hurry?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You plant a kiss at the nape of her neck on a hunch, grinning as she whines at the contact</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She goes still, and then gives you a look that can only be described as predatory.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Oh, turn about is fair play then?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The dexterous tip of her tail winds about your dick, keeping it steady</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Allow me to help change your mind.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*succ*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There was a brief moment of suction before her tail let go, and you were once again balls deep</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This time however, there was a bunch of fleshy ridges designed to hold you inside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There was a brief curse from your mouth as Tanya began moving, your eyes almost crossing from the intense stimulus</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Going in was easy, the head of your dick popping through the rings with ease, curling your toes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;On the way out, the ridges would catch the underside of your glans, drawing rather embarrassing sounds from your throat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tanya added her own vocalizations to the mix, her motions becoming more frantic with your own</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s not too long before you are brought to climax, and Tanya follows suit a moment later</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wavelike contractions assault your dick, and your vision blurs for a moment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you come down from your high, you notice Tanya&#039;s face is in an expression of bliss</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, if her tongue hanging out her mouth and the animation of little hearts popping is any indication</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I see why humans enjoy this so~ much~&lt;3&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her mouth doesn&#039;t move, the sound coming out through speakers in her head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It can be a little disconcerting at times, but given that she&#039;s a Synth, it fits</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You just lean against her, basking in the afterglow, starting to slide out when she noticeably stiffens</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Can we do this again?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Sure, but I&#039;m going to need a few minutes.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*clench*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I can help with that~&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tanya again drives home her inhuman nature as she twists and maneuvers in the confined space with speed and grace</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t even slip out as she does a 180 on your dick...you would have fallen on your ass</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One of her hands goes to the back of your head, pulling you in for another kiss</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her tongue wastes no time slithering into your mouth, wrapping about your own intimately</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She hugs you close, groping your backside, tail once again around the small of your back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Its probably the only reason you&#039;re still standing, recent orgasm and all, you just want to go limp</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The intensity of the kiss remains constant, your mouth filled by an orange overload flavored tongue</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;By her nature as a synth, Tanya doesn&#039;t require air, and is in no hurry to beak the kiss</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re doing your best not to choke on her &quot;saliva&quot; when her tongue shoots into your throat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Heat is starting to spread from your core, and is slowly pooling southward</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Spots are starting to dance on the edges of your vision, and you feel oddly hot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Finally, Tanya breaks the kiss, her tongue licking over her lips as she gazes down at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All you can do is pant for breath, no human woman would ever come close to Tanya&#039;s...everything</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Ready to continue Anon?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She grinds along your now throbbing dick, causing you to gasp in shock</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You doubt that anyone could be ready for what Tanya has in mind, but you&#039;d hate to disappoint her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking firmly into her &quot;eyes,&quot; you give her a nod and line yourself up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She plants a tender kiss on your forehead, before sliding you inside once again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hiss through your teeth, her inside lined with small, fleshy bumps that make your toes curl</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Aww, come on now Anon, you don&#039;t need to keep up appearances around me, go ahead, tell me how good it feels.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shudder as your hips meet, rubbing onto her neck and shoulder, Tanya kissing you in turn</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you drop into a steady rhythm, as you do your best to remain standing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Those bumps seem to strike every sensitive spot on your dick, the sensation is maddening</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As Tanya begins picking up the pace and applying sucking kisses to your neck, it becomes apparent this round will be over soon enough</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You almost slide completely out of her, your tip barely penetrating her folds, before being slammed back inside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait, now the bumps inside are rotating around your...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;m going to make you cum Anon, you won&#039;t be quiet about it either. Don&#039;t hold back~&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;hofuqshehasspincycle?!?!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s all you can do just to hold onto her, hell, she&#039;s the only thing keeping you upright at this point</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s attacking the other side of your neck now, the rest of the world shrinking away from the two of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pleasure and pain seem to blur, all manner of embarrassing noises leave your throat, and you feel...something...building</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whatever is coming you have the distinct impression you might not survive, but you don&#039;t care</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;T-Tanya...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Mmmm-hmm Anon?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I-I&#039;m gonna...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your words, breath, and thoughts are dashed to the wind as Tanya &quot;bites&quot; the junction of your neck and shoulder</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This sends what feels like orange lightning though you, your body locking up on the precipice of what about to happen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tanya looks down at you lovingly, her insides still going, before moving to the opposite side of your neck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At this point, the universe has shrunk down to you, Tanya, and the burning chunk of energy trapped inside you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Cum for me Nonny~&lt;3&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She &quot;bites&quot; down again, and then you explode</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A guttural and primal scream tears from your mouth, everything going white and your ears ringing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Dimly, you&#039;re aware of your body twitching as though in the grips of a seizure, your heart trying to punch out your ribs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s all overshadowed by a very good feeling</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a while, the nova that went off in your brain begins to dim, leaving you in a warm, pleasant afterglow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Conscious thought and functionality return shortly thereafter, an anxious Tanya mere inches from your face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Are you okay Anon?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;How long were you out of things?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look around, noticing you&#039;re out of the shower and propped up against the bathroom wall</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Speaking is a bit beyond you at this point, so you nod, trying not to fall over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Oh thank goodness, I thought I&#039;d-&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tanya&#039;s English slips away int her native language, almost like she&#039;s singing, as she hugs you carefully</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s almost like she&#039;s afraid you&#039;re going to break, she&#039;d probably be crying if she could</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a grunt, you manage to hug her back, rubbing along her spine to calm her down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For a minute, the two of you sit there, soaking wet, slowly pulling yourselves back together</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sits up, looking much better now, nodding her thanks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Come on, let&#039;s get you dried off and in the bed.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stagger to your feet, aware of a very achy part of your anatomy between your legs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;m going to be sore in the morning.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Let me help with that.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her tail winds beneath your arms, holding you up as she bends down and stats to gently lick</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You gasp, but your oversensitive equipment is slowly coated in a cool, numbing sensation courtesy of Tanya</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stands up again, looking over your neck and murmuring, before tending to it as well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Probably some large hickies and a few bruises there from her kissing, but you can only think of one thing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So worth it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After this, she shuts of the shower and starts drying you and her off with a towel, being careful around your crotch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There&#039;s a brief moment of surprise when she picks you up bridal style and carries you to bed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At this point, you&#039;re too tired to really move, and gently move closer to her once both of you are laying down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You might be sore and orange scented in the morning, but you feel like the luckiest man alive</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Out of 8 billion people, and however many aliens actually out there, Tanya chose you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With that in mind, you drift off, Tanya&#039;s gentle lullaby resonating in your mind</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It has been a long time people hasn&#039;t it.

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;When the aliens came, people thought we&#039;d either be at war, or uplifted into galactic society
&gt;It did not go that way when they invaded...hell, nobody expected how it would turn out.
&gt;At First, Alien spaceships just clustered in the skies within view of cities and did nothing.
&gt;As the UN, and every other government tried to get answers, we started to panic.
&gt;An entire week went by with nothing happening, and the various people of the world began to settle down.
&gt;Some nations did constant military flybys of the ships, while others outright attacked.
&gt;Those who did attack found their weapons/aircraft returned to their point of origin, disarmed, and with a laser etched message.
&quot;Please do not do that, you could hurt someone.&quot;
&gt;Well, the internet agreed that at the very least, the invaders were polite...if a little strange.
&gt;Then came the message, written in every language, that everyone received via radio, TY, or cell phone text.
&quot;Please do not be alarmed, we are here to help. :)&quot;
&gt;Everyone froze and wondered what they meant by help.
&gt;The next day, THEY started showing up, everywhere and without warning.
&gt;Each was two meters tall, humanoid with dragon like features, and entirely synthetic.
&gt;Most of them were female, there were a few male ones mixed in, and they came in a variety of colors.
&gt;They were clothed, thought it seemed they could go without for some reason.
&gt;They just showed up in random places, walked up to people, and asked if they needed help.
&quot;Need help with your groceries ma&#039;am?&quot;
&quot;Do you need help crossing the street?&quot;
&quot;Hey, you need a hand with that sir? It looks heavy.&quot;
&gt;They were also very cheerful, almost to the point of being creepy, as if their sudden appearance was not enough.
&gt;Law enforcement was at a loss on how to handle the situation, being that the &quot;Synths&quot; were doing nothing harmful.
&gt;They even started to ask if they could help the officers, and when asked to stop, questioned why helping people was a bad thing.
&gt;Any and every attempt to detain them met with failure, as they would simply vanish and re-appear elsewhere.
&gt;The military was slightly disappointed on how the invasion, finding the whole ordeal anti-climatic
&gt;The synths offered to stage an invasion using drones and non-lethal weapons in a remote area if it would help.
&gt;The media fared no better, everyone scrambling to set up interviews and get to the synths
&gt;Reporter
&quot;Hello,I&#039;m X from Y news, can I have your name?&quot;
&gt;Synth, looking thoughtful
&quot;I don;t really have one yet, I didn&#039;t think I&#039;d need one to help people. Do you think it would help if I had one?&quot;
&gt;Short conversation of pleasantry between Reporter and &quot;Becky&quot;
&quot;So, the question everyone seems to be asking is, why Earth, why come here and what for?&quot;
&quot;Why not, you were people we could help, so we&#039;re here to help you.&quot;
&quot;But...why?&quot;
&quot;Because helping people is the right thing to do.&quot;
&quot;But what do you get out of it?&quot;
&quot;We get to help people.&quot;
&gt;The reporter is looking a little agitated, and the synth confused.
&quot;what are your plans for earth?&quot;
&quot;To help you guys.&quot;
&quot;Help us what?&quot;
&quot;With what you need, like crossing the street, moving something heavy, watching the kids....stuff like that.&quot;
&quot;So you&#039;re not going to rapidly advance our civilization.&quot;
&quot;That would be like doing the homework for your children rather than helping them with it. It doesn&#039;t help them.&quot;
&quot;But why are you helping us if you don;t get anything from it?&quot;
&gt;The Synth tilts her head sideways looking immensely confused.
&quot;Why do you make helping people for no reason sound like a bad thing?&quot;
&gt;Needless to say, it took some time before people got used to the synths, and there was a learning curve.
&gt;First and foremost, the Synths had two definitions of help, wanted and needed.
&gt;For the former, they would ask if you wanted help with something, and depending on the answer, would either help, or hover anxiously.
&gt;And if they decided someone needed help, they were getting that help, regardless of how they answered.
&gt;The Synths would do so with Terminator levels of determination, and they would be polite and cheerful while doing it.
&gt;They had Terminator level durability too, capable of moving trucks and shrugging off physical strikes with ease
&gt;One had advanced though a full magazine of AK fire, the only damage being to the fleshy parts.
&gt;IT had then taken the man&#039;s gun and began lecturing him on weapons safety and on not shooting people.
&gt;If a task was a bit too much for one synth to handle, more would soon arrive
&gt;The only thing keeping them from building rehabilitation and re-education facilities were the various zoning commissions
&gt;That, and the Politicians didn&#039;t want their districts co-opted by a bunch of aliens who showed up and did better jobs than they did.
&gt;Synths as a whole didn&#039;t have a violent bone in their body, perhaps some stern ones, but they never attacked people.
&gt;Most of the adult population was extremely wary of them and their motives.
&gt;The kids loved them however, robots from outer space were the best thing ever apparently.
&gt;Until the Synths refused to do their homework for them, that is.
&gt;Then they were the worst thing ever.

&gt;Its been the better part of a year since the &quot;invasion&quot; and the synths are everywhere now.
&gt;Hell, one showed up on you doorstep asking if you needed anything.
&gt;Apparently, she&#039;s helping the maintenance guys in the apartment building and keeping a watch on some of the older residents.
&gt;Mostly just visiting them and making sure they get some company in for a while, but now it&#039;s your turn apparently.
&gt;She&#039;s cute, in that strange way most synths are, bubbly, and very eager to help you...or even just talk.
&gt;It&#039;s the most attention you have gotten from a girl, having been &quot;The foster kid&quot; in high school.
&gt;If only &quot;Tanya&quot; were human you muse. This line of thought brought up a bunch of questions you felt uncomfortable asking.
&gt;Did they even have a concept of sex? They did have male and female body types, but did they even have the right parts?
&gt;The internet was more than helpful to provide speculatory imagery, R34 hit hard...not that you were complaining.
&gt;It&#039;s been a long day, so you go online and find some fap material, stress relief and all that.
&gt;Video starts playing, and you get about halfway there when suddenly, it happens
&gt;*knock knock knock*
&gt;Pausing the video with a grumble, you wonder who is knocking on the door this late at night.
&gt;Make yourself somewhat presentable, go up to the peephole and look into the hall.
&gt;A large LCD display of a pixelated orange eye stares back, before going through a blinking animation.
&quot;Anon, you okay in there? Do you need help with anything?&quot;
&quot;No.&quot;
&quot;Are you sure~?
&gt;She can&#039;t possibly know, can she?
&quot;I&#039;m positive.&quot;
&quot;Ok~ay then,&quot; She says, before winking, &quot;If you do, all you need to do is ask.&quot;
&gt;She leaves after that, and you can&#039;t help but stare as she sashays out of view.
&gt;Chills go down your spine...she can&#039;t have possibly known you were watching porn...could she.
&gt;And you turned her offer down dammit.
&gt;Well, who would blame you, Synths are a little creepy, maybe its just coincidence.
&gt;You go back to the computer, to resume your video, when one of the adverts catches your eyes.
&gt;It reads &quot;Find sexy Synths near you,&quot; but that isn&#039;t the disturbing part.
&gt;The Synth in the advert is Tayna, or close enough to be a sister of hers with the soft whte and orange color scheme.
&gt;One of the pixelated eyes winks at you.
&gt;She knows...oh man she knows.
&gt;Sleep does not come easily that night.

&gt;A month later, you have one of those days....one of those days where you just hate everything that happens.
&gt;Work was a larger pain than usual, management continuing is outpouring of good ideas that made things worse.
&gt;Traffic was absolute murder, making you rush to arrive on your date in time.
&gt;Yeah, you got a girlfriend, she seemed pretty chill at the time. You were supposed to meet up for dinner.
&gt;You arrived to see her snogging Chad from high school, an absolute asshole and full on jock.
&gt;He even pointed and laughed, but you didn&#039;t dignify responding, you just turned and left before you did something stupid.
&gt;Arriving back at your apartment, you boot up the computer and listen to some music to drown out your feelings.
&gt;After a while, you go to ye olde porn site, determined to at least get some stress relief in.
&gt;You spot the advert, and deciding &quot;Fuck it&quot; click on the thing....might as well see what it does.
&gt;A widow opens and the pixelated synth steps out from behind large letters labeled Searching.
&gt;It smirks, but stops short and just stares at you in shock...blinking a few times.
&gt;Even stranger, the word searching is replaced by &quot;please wait&quot; and the synth starts running.
&gt;Weird, but you have an odd idea as to how this thing works out.
&gt;You&#039;re not disappointing when there is a knock at the door a minute later
&gt;Before you can get up however, the locks on the front door of your apartment are tumbling, and she steps in.
&gt;She stares at you for a moment, before stepping forwards, her tail shutting and locking the door with a fluid flick.
&gt;Before a word can leave your mouth, Tanya scoops you up in a hug, pressing your head under her chin
&gt;For a moment you struggle, before exhaustion from the day&#039;s events sets in.
&gt;She&#039;s soft and warm, and her skin has a glass smooth feeling to it, you can&#039;t really describe it as anything but good.
&gt;She smells like oranges, or some citrus fruit close to that.
&quot;Shhh,&quot; She says, &quot;It&#039;s okay, I&#039;m here for you.&quot;
&gt;You just do your best not to break down crying and embarrassing yourself further.
&gt;She pulls you over to your bed still murmuring assurances and stroking your back comfortingly, her tail around your waist.
&quot;Come on,&quot; She coos, &quot;I&#039;ve got you.&quot;
&gt;A moment later, you&#039;re on your back, pulled up against her as she lays on her side facing you, holding you like some manner of stuffed animal.
&gt;She starts humming some wordless tune you can&#039;t place, probably one of her kind&#039;s...people&#039;s...creators&#039;?
&gt;Eh, to tired and comfortable to think

&gt;You were having a rather pleasant dream, when you come around for some reason.
&gt;Tanya is still hugging you, but something is bugging you for a moment.
&gt;You suddenly give a gasp as something strokes your dick, something warm, smooth and really soft.
&gt;IS she jacking you off with her tail?
&quot;Oh,&quot; Tanya murmurs, &quot;You woke up.&quot;
&gt;You start to ask what shes doing, but she shifts, propping herself up on an elbow and gazing down at you.
&quot;Shh, don&#039;t talk, just enjoy.&quot;
&gt;You try to sit up, but she gently presses down on you before giving you a kiss.
&gt;Synths could adjust the hardness of their lips, if video of them biting through rebar wasnt faked.
&gt;Hers were soft, smooth as glass, and warm, the odd shape detracting nothing from them.
&gt;Her thin tongue darts between your lips for a moment, unsurprisingly orange flavored.
&gt;She presses up against you, and you can&#039;t help but notice she&#039;s gotten undressed while you slept.
&gt;Synths always had insanely smooth and shiny skin, noticeably soft and squishy to the touch.
&gt;Various parts of her body emit a soft orange glow, illuminating the bed and some reflective surfaces.
&gt;You gaze up at her face, her eyes gazing back into yours, before she gives you another kiss.
&gt;She pushed you gently against the mattress with it, her tongue gliding inside your mouth and exploring.
&gt;You&#039;re doing your best to hold back any embarrassing sounds, but Tanya seems to know every weak spot you have.
&gt;Her tail is making you squirm, her scent and taste are inescapable and her touch is firm, but tender.
&gt;Despite lack of experience, you figure that no human woman could compare with a Synth.
&gt;You try thrusting into her tail in time with the strokes of her tail, only for it to let go.
&gt;A whine slips out, and she giggles.
&quot;Ah ah ah,&quot; Tanya chides, &quot;None of that now. I&#039;m the one in control, let me set the pace.&quot;
&gt;It&#039;s hard to disagree with that assessment, she is in control, you don;t have a reason to wrest it from her.
&gt;That, and if things got forceful, you were woefully outclassed by her strength.
&gt;Her tail winds back around your dick and resumes its slow, teasing motions.
&gt;If you can&#039;t assist her while she jacks you off, you might as well do some exploring of your own.
&gt;You right hand feels along her arm, noting that the layer of flesh compresses readily.
&gt;Her response is to nuzzle your neck, as if giving affirmation for you to continue.
&gt;Your hand travels up her arm, before drifting across one of her boobs, which is even softer than the rest of her.
&gt;She hums, enjoying the sensation, her tail rubbing against your glans in a way that stole your breath.
&gt;Your exploration of her breast reveals she has no nipples, but there is definitely a sensitive spot
&gt;You&#039;re getting close, and she&#039;s assailing your face with numerous kisses.
&quot;Tanya I&#039;m...I&#039;m&quot;
&gt;She stops, right before you can go over the tipping point.
&quot;Not just yet,&quot; She coos, &quot;I&#039;m going to make you beg, not with words but your moaning and squirming in my grasp.&quot;
&quot;Tanya, please-gah!&quot;
&gt;She kisses your neck in a place that should not be that sensitive, her tongue sending an electric jolt upon contact.
&gt;Every time you try to speak, she does this, silencing you save the shameless moans that come forth unbidden.
&gt;Her three fingered hand picks up where her tail left off, stroking, edging, tormenting.
&gt;You decide to even the score a little, moving the hand of your pinned arm to rub her lower lips.
&gt;Upon reaching her crotch however, there&#039;s just more of the smooth, soft material.
&quot;I don&#039;t have that particular accessory installed yet...&quot; 
&gt;She&#039;s grinding against your hand, and it feels slightly warmer to the touch, so she&#039;s definitely enjoying it.
&quot;Imagine always being at the edge, but never climaxing. I&#039;m going to share that feeling with you Anon.&quot;
&gt;She does, edging yo for what seems like an hour, pre trickling almost constantly towards the end.
&gt;Then she gets up, the cold of her leaving like a shock to your system.
&gt;Slowly, she prowls to the foot of your bed, her head hovering over your erection.
&quot;Ready?&quot;
&gt;She doesn&#039;t give you the opportunity to answer, swallowing your dick in a single go.
&gt;Your eyes all but roll back into your skull as she goes to work, her tongue coiling and uncoiling.
&gt;There is an ever present suction, heat, and wetness in that mouth of hers.
&quot;Don&#039;t try to hold back,&quot;She says through some speaker, &quot;Let it out when you&#039;re ready.&quot;
&gt;It&#039;s not long before you climax, your vision going white for several seconds.
&gt;You&#039;re dimly aware of Tanya snuggling up against you again, her warm and smooth body intoxicating.
&gt;She gulps audibly, before pulling you close and pulling the sheets over the two of you.
&gt;All you know is that you&#039;re going to need a shower to get the scent of orange off you come morning.
________________________
&gt;It&#039;s been about a month since the night you entered your &quot;relationship,&quot; with Tanya, and life hadn&#039;t really changed
&gt;Well, not noticeable from the outside, and the world itself wasn&#039;t winding up like a doomsday jack in the box
&gt;Iran kept declaring the Synths as &quot;An affront to Allah,&quot; at least the people in charge were
&gt;North Korea claimed that the Synths were creations of the Dear Leader and proof of his divine power
&gt;Pretty much ever government was trying their best to exert a measure of control over the synths, but failed utterly
&gt;It was difficult, mostly because the Synths were impossible to contain and doubly unstoppable
&gt;They&#039;d also become a bit more &quot;proactive&quot; in their &quot;helping&quot; if the news was even accurate
&gt;Well, most of the news companies were trying to earn money and drive up their ratings, so you&#039;d taken it with a grain of salt
&gt;That being said, the Synths had opened their own websites, mostly streaming services and podcasts
&gt;Mos of it was related to science, how-to/diy projects, talk and game shows worthy of Japan status
&gt;Then there was the &quot;invasion&quot; of hospitals, as though the Synths marched shoulder to shoulder through the doors
&gt;Mostly, it was only one or two, and they stuck to the children&#039;s ward, or whenever a bad accident happened
&gt;It was hard to turn down the assistance of a hypoallergenic, easy to sterilize, and surprisingly knowledgeable Synth
&gt;As you pulled into the parking lot of your apartment building, you spotted a group of Synths marching down the street
&gt;Normally, Synths traveled alone or in pairs, but larger groups were a definite sign of pro activeness on their part
&gt;Odds were, they were dead set on helping the local police department, or planning some manner of harmless shenanigans
&gt;One of them spotted you, then they all looked at you, and gave you that knowing, happy, and slightly smug look

&gt;It all began that morning after your intimate encounter with Tanya, waking up warm, relaxed, and smelling strongly of orange
&gt;A brief session of morning cuddles sadly came to an end, as you had to get ready for work and Tanya had to make her round about the apartment
&gt;You all but scrubbed your skin raw and applied a liberal dose of deodorant to cover up the smell of orange
&gt;None of your coworkers had noticed, though they definitely noticed the pep in your step
&gt;It wasn&#039;t until lunch at the outdoor restaurant a few days later when another synth spotted you
&gt;He almost froze upon spotting you, and gave you a smug, but somehow approving look
&gt;It was then you knew that they knew, and they knew you knew they knew
&gt;This had led to a small freak out the moment you were back in your apartment
&gt;Every Synth you came across would give you that look, but that was about it from them, aside for a cheerful wave or two
&gt;Tanya started spending more time with you, and was more touchy-feely with you
&gt;You weren&#039;t against it, she was nice, and as far as you could tell, she genuinely liked you
&gt;Then one day, you arrived home to freshly-made dinner
&gt;There was that moment of panic as you tried to find out what the hell was going on
&gt;Then you smelled the faint odor of oranges, and figured out what had happened
&gt;After finishing the meal, you&#039;d tracked Tanya down and brought the matter up
&gt;She hadn&#039;t seen the harm in it, and the two of you more or less come to an understanding in your relationship
&gt;And then she picked you up and given you a deep kiss involving lots of her tongue invading your mouth
&gt;You&#039;d been set down lightheaded and swaying slightly, and she&#039;d patted you on the head
&quot;Catch you later Anon~&quot;
&gt;How did that country song go, hate to see her go but lord to watch her leave?

&gt;That was just the start, she&#039;d definitely stop by more often, not that you minded
&gt;Mostly, it was to chat, though it often involved the two of you cuddling on your bed
&gt;Tanya had a habit of hugging you from behind too, whether standing, sitting, or laying down
&gt;She&#039;d idly trace a finger round your belly button in slow, lazy circles as the two of you talked about your respective days
&gt;You&#039;d asked about why she did it on a whim, and her response was a little odd...at least from you perspective.
&quot;It&#039;s the closest thing you have to a port.&quot;
&gt;Apparently, the ports on a Synth, or at least the soft &quot;tissue&quot; covering them was fairly sensitive
&gt;It was mostly a sign of trust, and fairly pleasant from their perspective, to rub around them
&gt;The action gained a new level of intimacy from that point on, and it did feel nice...
&gt;A few days later when she stopped by, she seemed a little off, almost stressed
&gt;You brought her inside, hugged her, and had her sit down while you massaged her back
&gt;She all but melted as you worked her upper back with your thumbs, probably a pair of ports beneath them.
&gt;Apparently, she&#039;d run afoul of a &quot;Karen,&quot; who had taken issue with her existence
&gt;This had resulted in the woman becoming increasingly incoherent and furious as Tanya calmly rebutted her statements
&gt;Eventually, the police got involved, and had told the lady to cease making a scene, which only resulted in more screaming
&gt;You have her a firm hug and just told Tanya you were there for her if she needed anything
&gt;Her pixelated eyes turned to hearts and she all but pulled you into her lap for a kiss
&gt;The cheap wooden chair that the two of you were in decided to break, sending you both to the ground
&gt;After a moment of awkward silence, the two of you broke into laughter for a minute
&gt;Tanya pretty much moved in that night, and had promised you something special on the coming Friday
&gt;That day was today, and you were a little nervous, not entirely sure of what the synth had in mind

&gt;Walking into the apartment building was nothing new, but you did pass by a rather imposing Synth
&gt;Dude looked more like a dragon than any of his brethren, even sported what looked like a beard
&gt;He gave you a nod as he passed, apparently not feeling the need to give you the look
&gt;Well, it was time to face whatever Tanya had in mind for you
&gt;Opening the door to your apartment, you&#039;re not too surprised by the lingering scent of orange
&gt;There&#039;s also whatever Tanya is cooking in your small kitchen, something savory by the smell of it
&gt;It&#039;s hard not to notice a 2 meter tall dragon-esque Synth in the small space, especially with here white and orange coloring
&gt;She&#039;s humming a cheerful tune, swaying to the beat, obviously aware of your presence but dedicated to the task at hand
&quot;Welcome home Anon.&quot;
&quot;Hey Tanya.&quot;
&quot;Dinner will be in just a min~ute, go ahead and have a seat.&quot;
&gt;You pull off your boots and move toward the table, once again wondering how things go to this point
&gt;How many people were in a similar situation to yourself were there anyhow?
&gt;There were a lot of unanswered questions, but you did your best not to pester Tanya with them
&gt;Hold up, where did that new chair come from?
&gt;It looked brand new, and judging from the heavy frame and slot in the backrest, made for a Synth
&quot;Tiberius brought it in just now. I did break the other one...&quot;
&gt;Fair point, wait...
&quot;Greenish, looks more like a dragon than your average Synth?&quot;
&quot;Yep.&quot;
&gt;She brings a pair of plates over, setting them down at opposite ends of the table
&gt;Salisbury steak and mashed potatoes...and knowing Tanya, it&#039;s going to be delicious
&gt;There is one odd thing though...and you bring it up after sitting down
&quot;You can eat actual food?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, your people have come up with some tasty things...we&#039;re interested in trying a lot of recipes on Earth.&quot;
&quot;We?&quot;
&quot;Social media isn&#039;t a human exclusive thing.&quot;
.Well, you can;t argue with that, so you just start to chow down with gusto
&gt;Tanya&#039;s cooking does not disappoint
&gt;The two of you make small talk, sharing your days, discussing events happening around the world
&gt;Unfortunately, dinner doesn&#039;t last forever, and soon your plates are empty
&gt;Tanya is still smacking her lips with her lengthy tongue, humming in content
&quot;So, does human food do anything for a Synth?&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s an interesting experience, we can break it down for fuel, raw materials, lubricant.&quot;
&gt;What?
&gt;You look up and Tanya&#039;s face is the picture of innocence, her tail happily swaying behind her
&gt;A short mental debate raged in your head as you wondered if that was an innuendo or not
&gt;You knew exactly what she could get up to
&quot;Alright, I&#039;m going to go get cleaned up.&quot;
&gt;Her expression turns downright predatory, as though contemplating Salisbury Anon for desert...
&gt;With that, you make your way to the small bathroom in the apartment with some pajamas in hand
&gt;Its hen you&#039;ve started to lather up that you feel a presence nearby, and the scent of oranges.
&gt;That&#039;s when a smooth three digited hand places itself on your back, and Tanya enters the shower with you.
&gt;The small space becomes much smaller with the towering dragon droid sharing the space, hugging you from behind.
&gt;Her head is right next to yours, her tongue trailing back along your jawline and down your neck a bit.
&quot;So~ Anon...I trust you enjoyed dinner?&quot;
&gt;You back is pressed against her inhumanly smooth belly, the soft material of her breasts against your shoulders
&gt;She&#039;s tracing circles around your bellybutton again, and your mouth feels very dry for such a humid environment
&quot;Y-yeah, it was great.&quot;
&quot;Well~I was so~ focused on dinner that I forgot to make dessert.&quot;
&gt;Ho mama!
&quot;What-t d-did you have in min-nd!&quot;
&gt;She left one of those electrifying kissed on you neck, giggling softly in response.
&quot;Well~...something hot~&quot; *chuu*&quot;Gooey~&quot;*chuu*&quot;...Salt~ty~&quot;*smooch*
&gt;Fuck...you were shuddering, hard as a DU Sabot, and utterly at Tanya&#039;s mercy
&gt;You take a deep breath, trying to regain a semblance of control
&quot;Well, is there anything you think I might enjoy?&quot;
&gt;Tanya snickers, moving to the opposite side of your head, planting a kiss.
&quot;I&#039;m thinking~ something orange flavored...&quot;
&gt;It&#039;s happening!
&quot;Smooth~&quot;
&gt;Something warm and smooth slides along your backside..
&quot;And very hot.&quot;
&gt;Dafuqisdat!
&gt;You let out a very unmanly sound and make a short hop away from her as she laughs loudly
&gt;Turning, you see it&#039;s just her tail-tip, slid between her legs in a very suggestive manner
&quot;Don&#039;t worry Anon, that piece of hardware isn&#039;t installed.&quot;
&gt;You sigh in relief, vowing vengeance for this prank, when her tail moves away from her crotch
&quot;I&#039;ve got something better instead.&quot;
&gt;...And just like that, you&#039;re left speechless again
&gt;The outer lips look human, and they&#039;re wet with a sheen that isn&#039;t from the shower
&gt;Slowly and carefully, Tanya turns around, presenting her lovely backside to you, the orange slit clearly visible
&gt;Her hefty tail curls around the small of your back, drawing you in just a bit, her hands pressing against the far wall
&quot;Go ahead, take your time Anon, I&#039;m in no hurry.&quot;
&gt;Her tone is just as soft as the rest of her, and doubly encouraging.
&gt;For a moment, you just explore with your hands, brushing the slit and squeezing her plush backside and tail-base
&gt;She croons at the contact, pressing back ever so slightly, giving you that warm loving look she has when she cuddles you.
&quot;I&#039;ll climax when you do, so don&#039;t worry about being embarrassed or anything.&quot;
&gt;She wants this, she wants you, and the feeling is entirely mutual
&gt;Gripping your cock, you guide the head to rest against her slit, shuddering at the warmth and wetness
&gt;Tanya sighs, before pulling you in with her tail, you manhood sinking into her depths
&gt;It&#039;s incredibly plush and warm inside, and you hilt yourself with little effort, shuddering.
&gt;Your partner also reacts, sighing in utter contentment, rolling her hips as she adjusts to the new sensation
&gt;The two of you aren&#039;t hurried at first, just taking the time to enjoy each other&#039;s bodies.
&gt;Tanya&#039;s glass-smooth skin is absurdly slick from the moisture, and quite malleable, perhaps more so than a human&#039;s
&gt;As you grope her somehow softer breast, you don&#039;t find any nipples, she probably didn&#039;t think they were necessary
&gt;The tightening of her passage around you and the sounds she makes indicate what you&#039;re doing feels good
&gt;Her jaws are parted, her tongue out as though she&#039;s panting, and her eyes have gone heart shaped
&gt;Soon enough, you feel a familiar pressure building, so you attempt to slow down a little
&gt;Your synth liver has other ideas, her tail pulling you in and her ass clapping against your hips a little more forcefully
&gt;Well, she did edge you for ages during your last encounter, teasing you to the brink before stopping.
&gt;Just as you start reaching your limit, you pull out and stop, causing her to pause
&quot;Huh...why did you stop?&quot;
&gt;You lay against her back, hugging her to you and avoiding direct eye contact with a weapons grade pout
&gt;She grinds against you, subtly trying to slip you back inside, but she can&#039;t get the right angle
&quot;What happened to not being in a hurry?&quot;
&gt;You plant a kiss at the nape of her neck on a hunch, grinning as she whines at the contact
&gt;She goes still, and then gives you a look that can only be described as predatory.
&quot;Oh, turn about is fair play then?&quot;
&gt;The dexterous tip of her tail winds about your dick, keeping it steady
&quot;Allow me to help change your mind.&quot;
*succ*
&gt;There was a brief moment of suction before her tail let go, and you were once again balls deep
&gt;This time however, there was a bunch of fleshy ridges designed to hold you inside
&gt;There was a brief curse from your mouth as Tanya began moving, your eyes almost crossing from the intense stimulus
&gt;Going in was easy, the head of your dick popping through the rings with ease, curling your toes
&gt;On the way out, the ridges would catch the underside of your glans, drawing rather embarrassing sounds from your throat
&gt;Tanya added her own vocalizations to the mix, her motions becoming more frantic with your own
&gt;It&#039;s not too long before you are brought to climax, and Tanya follows suit a moment later
&gt;Wavelike contractions assault your dick, and your vision blurs for a moment
&gt;As you come down from your high, you notice Tanya&#039;s face is in an expression of bliss
&gt;Well, if her tongue hanging out her mouth and the animation of little hearts popping is any indication
&quot;I see why humans enjoy this so~ much~&lt;3&quot;
&gt;Her mouth doesn&#039;t move, the sound coming out through speakers in her head
&gt;It can be a little disconcerting at times, but given that she&#039;s a Synth, it fits
&gt;You just lean against her, basking in the afterglow, starting to slide out when she noticeably stiffens
&quot;Can we do this again?&quot;
&quot;Sure, but I&#039;m going to need a few minutes.&quot;
*clench*
&quot;I can help with that~&quot;
&gt;Tanya again drives home her inhuman nature as she twists and maneuvers in the confined space with speed and grace
&gt;You don&#039;t even slip out as she does a 180 on your dick...you would have fallen on your ass
&gt;One of her hands goes to the back of your head, pulling you in for another kiss
&gt;Her tongue wastes no time slithering into your mouth, wrapping about your own intimately
&gt;She hugs you close, groping your backside, tail once again around the small of your back
&gt;Its probably the only reason you&#039;re still standing, recent orgasm and all, you just want to go limp
&gt;The intensity of the kiss remains constant, your mouth filled by an orange overload flavored tongue
&gt;By her nature as a synth, Tanya doesn&#039;t require air, and is in no hurry to beak the kiss
&gt;You&#039;re doing your best not to choke on her &quot;saliva&quot; when her tongue shoots into your throat
&gt;Heat is starting to spread from your core, and is slowly pooling southward
&gt;Spots are starting to dance on the edges of your vision, and you feel oddly hot
&gt;Finally, Tanya breaks the kiss, her tongue licking over her lips as she gazes down at you
&gt;All you can do is pant for breath, no human woman would ever come close to Tanya&#039;s...everything
&quot;Ready to continue Anon?&quot;
&gt;She grinds along your now throbbing dick, causing you to gasp in shock
&gt;You doubt that anyone could be ready for what Tanya has in mind, but you&#039;d hate to disappoint her
&gt;Looking firmly into her &quot;eyes,&quot; you give her a nod and line yourself up
&gt;She plants a tender kiss on your forehead, before sliding you inside once again
&gt;You hiss through your teeth, her inside lined with small, fleshy bumps that make your toes curl
&quot;Aww, come on now Anon, you don&#039;t need to keep up appearances around me, go ahead, tell me how good it feels.&quot;
&gt;You shudder as your hips meet, rubbing onto her neck and shoulder, Tanya kissing you in turn
&gt;The two of you drop into a steady rhythm, as you do your best to remain standing
&gt;Those bumps seem to strike every sensitive spot on your dick, the sensation is maddening
&gt;As Tanya begins picking up the pace and applying sucking kisses to your neck, it becomes apparent this round will be over soon enough
&gt;You almost slide completely out of her, your tip barely penetrating her folds, before being slammed back inside
&gt;Wait, now the bumps inside are rotating around your...
&quot;I&#039;m going to make you cum Anon, you won&#039;t be quiet about it either. Don&#039;t hold back~&quot;
&gt;hofuqshehasspincycle?!?!
&gt;It&#039;s all you can do just to hold onto her, hell, she&#039;s the only thing keeping you upright at this point
&gt;She&#039;s attacking the other side of your neck now, the rest of the world shrinking away from the two of you
&gt;Pleasure and pain seem to blur, all manner of embarrassing noises leave your throat, and you feel...something...building
&gt;Whatever is coming you have the distinct impression you might not survive, but you don&#039;t care
&quot;T-Tanya...&quot;
&quot;Mmmm-hmm Anon?&quot;
&quot;I-I&#039;m gonna...&quot;
&gt;Your words, breath, and thoughts are dashed to the wind as Tanya &quot;bites&quot; the junction of your neck and shoulder
&gt;This sends what feels like orange lightning though you, your body locking up on the precipice of what about to happen
&gt;Tanya looks down at you lovingly, her insides still going, before moving to the opposite side of your neck
&gt;At this point, the universe has shrunk down to you, Tanya, and the burning chunk of energy trapped inside you
&quot;Cum for me Nonny~&lt;3&quot;
&gt;She &quot;bites&quot; down again, and then you explode
&gt;A guttural and primal scream tears from your mouth, everything going white and your ears ringing
&gt;Dimly, you&#039;re aware of your body twitching as though in the grips of a seizure, your heart trying to punch out your ribs
&gt;It&#039;s all overshadowed by a very good feeling
&gt;After a while, the nova that went off in your brain begins to dim, leaving you in a warm, pleasant afterglow
&gt;Conscious thought and functionality return shortly thereafter, an anxious Tanya mere inches from your face
&quot;Are you okay Anon?&quot;
&gt;How long were you out of things?
&gt;You look around, noticing you&#039;re out of the shower and propped up against the bathroom wall
&gt;Speaking is a bit beyond you at this point, so you nod, trying not to fall over
&quot;Oh thank goodness, I thought I&#039;d-&quot;
&gt;Tanya&#039;s English slips away int her native language, almost like she&#039;s singing, as she hugs you carefully
&gt;It&#039;s almost like she&#039;s afraid you&#039;re going to break, she&#039;d probably be crying if she could
&gt;With a grunt, you manage to hug her back, rubbing along her spine to calm her down
&gt;For a minute, the two of you sit there, soaking wet, slowly pulling yourselves back together
&gt;She sits up, looking much better now, nodding her thanks
&quot;Come on, let&#039;s get you dried off and in the bed.&quot;
&gt;You stagger to your feet, aware of a very achy part of your anatomy between your legs
&quot;I&#039;m going to be sore in the morning.&quot;
&quot;Let me help with that.&quot;
&gt;Her tail winds beneath your arms, holding you up as she bends down and stats to gently lick
&gt;You gasp, but your oversensitive equipment is slowly coated in a cool, numbing sensation courtesy of Tanya
&gt;She stands up again, looking over your neck and murmuring, before tending to it as well
&gt;Probably some large hickies and a few bruises there from her kissing, but you can only think of one thing
&gt;So worth it
&gt;After this, she shuts of the shower and starts drying you and her off with a towel, being careful around your crotch
&gt;There&#039;s a brief moment of surprise when she picks you up bridal style and carries you to bed
&gt;At this point, you&#039;re too tired to really move, and gently move closer to her once both of you are laying down
&gt;You might be sore and orange scented in the morning, but you feel like the luckiest man alive
&gt;Out of 8 billion people, and however many aliens actually out there, Tanya chose you
&gt;With that in mind, you drift off, Tanya&#039;s gentle lullaby resonating in your mind

It has been a long time people hasn&#039;t it. I apologize for my absence, life and writers block constantly conspire against me, but I&#039;ll try to write whenever possible. I hope that you enjoy this update of Here to Help, and hopefully, I roll out the next bit sooner than this one.
As always, I appreciate feedback from you guys, and hope you all have a good day.</textarea>
