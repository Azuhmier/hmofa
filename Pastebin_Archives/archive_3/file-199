            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you are a Barioth, though not of the usual variety of monster many men hunted in their spare time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you were much rarer prey, known to some as an ayn-tro-murph</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;humans called you an anthro, in the few short meetings you had with them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a shapely figure born rarely from monsters, with the supposed capability of mixing together species that normally didn&#039;t mix if the legends were true</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;other monsters gave you a respectful distance, and most humans didn&#039;t seem to want to hunt you when you were growing up in the mountains</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your mother had stayed by your side for many years, but eventually she left your cave and started a new nest elsewhere and only came to your nest for the occasional visit with small Barioth babies to watch while she hunted</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you knew if you brought her your odd little younglings one day she would certainly watch them while you hunted, but you had never had a companion to share with</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;through your youth and onward hunters approached your cave with caution, and your mother would watch over as they spoke with you and taught you to speak their language</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;many wore odd garbs and carried a talisman with an odd symbol on it, but after you had learned their language and how to build what few things they could teach you, they too left you to your own life with time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;many years of lonesome existing finally made you wander down the mountains, trying to and occasionally succeeding in speaking with many a scared hunter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;in rare cases a nearly frozen hunter would be plucked away by you, and you would cuddle them by your fire as they rested in the happy but fearful embrace of your 8 foot tall frame</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you made the friendship of a human healing hunter over time, and he did his best to teach you healing medicines for when you got hurt and needed help</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;pain medicine for when a tooth was broken and another was growing into place, wound sealing pastes to stop the bleeding and speed recovery, and burn salves for if you were attacked by something that spit fire</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;in a painfully familiar way, not long after he taught you this he disappeared, but this time was different</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;when he returned the next time, he was bound in chains, and a hunter with a large sword was by his side</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;when you approached the curious sight the swordsman walked slowly towards you, speaking softly and trying to explain what happened...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;so he could get close enough to attack, and cleave your left arm off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;shocked and in pain, you fought brutally and won quickly, freeing the chained man before fleeing as he yelled for you to stop so he could help</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;pain and fear drove you into your cave, and you used large amounts of your stored medicine to save yourself from dying that die</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;unfortunately, you learned that arms and teeth don&#039;t share the ability of slowly regrowing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a large scar and a nub of an arm lead you to more solitude for many years, and a pained existence followed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;adjusting to the loss of your arm was slow, but you managed to get back to roughly where you were beforehand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;instead of gliding you leapt with your unusually powerful legs, finding your size lead to stealthy hunting your mother had no such abilities in teaching you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;this stealth was the key to experiencing the world of the lower mountains, and lead to an interesting discovery one day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a human sat in a grassy field, monsters surrounding him on all sides</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;surely, the hunter would soon be dead and a short fight over his body would be had by the massive beasts looming near him</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it came to you as a surprise then, that the beasts surrounding him all began to sit around him when he waved at them to sit down, and he pulled out an object you couldn&#039;t see from your perch of snow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you could plainly hear his music however, carrying on the winds and causing the monster near him both young and old to sway peacefully and enjoy his company when he arrived in the mornings</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;not a single creature dared attack him throughout the day as he walked with a few small Felyne helpers to gather berries and fruit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;months went by of him collecting, and a slowly waning audience that eventually only consisted of the youngest of monsters came close to hear his song</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you did note that monsters still roamed with bobbing heads and swinging tails when his music was playing, so you just assumed they became used to his music and saw him as no threat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after he took a trip up the mountain to play one day, a Grimalkyne wandered into your cave while you were sleeping and woke you by poking you with a stick</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;turning over on your bed of straw and branches, it waved at you with while offering you some berries</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the small bidepal lynx sat by your nearly dead fire, and it waited for you to say something to it or give it something while eating from a small bag of fruit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;unsure of what it wanted, but knowing that it was probably scouting for the man from the field, you dig inside of your bed and found a small piece of parchment and a bone with ink in it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;scribbling out your best remembered human writings you sent gave the tuft eared cat a note to send back to the human&#039;s village and hopefully him</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Wan 2 me chu. Sea me et cabe. Look 4 ded huntas, don go pass dah Kushala Daora skeleman. Chu do gud music.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;digging deeper into your bed you locate a small painted picture a human who tried to stay the night in your cave left you, of your form lied out comfortably on your bed nude and beckoning</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it was a very nice gift for him to give you, and you assumed that including it would show the hunter you were serious about wanting to talk with him</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after taking your note, the small feline runs out of your cave and treads snow as fast as they can, as if they knew how dangerous you were being polite after waking you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after a few days have passed, the man who makes music sent you back a note with his small fuzzy friend, telling you he would arrive again in a week</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;on the dusk of the seventh day you await carefully in your cave, knowing few humans dared to come near the entrance with the ghastly impromptu display decorating the exterior</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;skeletons you had remembered of long dead hunters that came to the areas up here to find monsters, but dying in combat or freezing while still holding weapons</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you wonder if it is overkill, but he should have the bravery to not flee if he already agreed to come this far and knew they would be his marker</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;or so you think he would, at least</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;in the distance, a lone hunter approaches wrapped in the finery of a bard</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What a strange man to take my offer, and dress up for the occasion...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you watch carefully from the hidden depths of the dark cave as he drags out his... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;hunting horn?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a very small one, made of metal that shined like with the intensity of the sun when light hit it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;his voice carries well into your cave, though his confused appearance tells you he cannot see you as well as you gaze upon him</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I have received your call! And the oddly... enticing picture you sent with it. No one else believed you serious, and though I cannot see you... I shall make my promise and signal you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;his horn plays soothing, gentle music to you, and an odd feeling of warmth engulfs you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you recognize the notes he plays, but not the order of a song you have heard before, and listen carefully as he attempts to call for you repeatedly with no halts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;C# B F# D, C# B F# D, A G D B, A G D, G F# D B G, F# G A B C# D E F#...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;his song is very intoxicating, and the longer you listen the more at ease you feel</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;how strange, no hunter before him dared use a song that made everything near him more calm before</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;in the heat of battle it would be useless</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;this man is a hunter, right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;surely no madman would dare brave the wilds to meet a Barioth in her cave, regardless of if she was an anthromorph or not</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you gently rub your long gone arm, and an odd feeling washes over you that can&#039;t be described in any way that seem correct</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;many hunters would see an anthro as an intense danger to them, since they carried all of the power of their larger wild brethren</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;and yet, excitement dances over your toned body as you lay there and enjoy his song for a few spare moments</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;was this feeling joy?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;were you excited he had the bravery to come to see you without any arms by his side?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;even with your one arm, you were an intensely dangerous thing...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the music stops, and his demeanor goes from confused to sad</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you realize he was serenading you for some time, and walk with a solid strut out towards him as he turns to leave</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hunter! Do not leave yet. I am sorry for not coming out sooner.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you walk slowly out into the air of the setting sun, noting he is shaking in the cold of the raw winds</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;The song you played for me simply made me swoon, and I had trouble keeping myself together. Please, come into my humble home.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;he shivers, his voice carrying a tinge of fear behind the chattering teeth as he speaks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I-It is... the careless whisper. A song of a bard who regretted a mistake in not loving someone truly, and his sorrows paint affection into the notes of the music. The song has- well, no. Technically, the song is meant to be used when courting another human. I-I simply l-liked the tune and-&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hug the shivering human close to you, causing him to go silent, as he walks beside you down the tunnels towards the warmer nest in your cave</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I found your tune enthralling, hunter. Should you come to visit me again after today, I would love to be greeted by it once more.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;he slowly warms against your body, unconsciously nestling into the fur on your waist as you walk the smaller male towards your home deeper in the cave</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it doesn&#039;t take long for you to walk the entire distance, the winds outside barely audible from your secluded abode</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a busted chest sits in the corner, farthest from the campfire in the center of your humble abode, your bed near enough to receive ample warmth if need be but not ignite</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;above the fire is a large opening which smoke pours through, leading into an upper chamber that bleeds out the smoke into the air through holes in the ground</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;nearest the fire is a large flint a hunter had long since lost to you, and across from the flint bound in animal hides is the straw you use to feed the flames</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the human still cold against your side you walk towards the flint and rake it with your claws, the fire roaring to life in front of the two of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you walk over to your nest like bed and carefully pay for him to sit down next to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;without a single hesitation he obeys, cuddling up against you without thinking and taking as much of your warmth in as he can</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a smile graces your mouth as he slowly warms himself by your side, whistling a tune to him as he warms himself slowly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;when he is finally warmed, he scoots a small bit away from you, and beings to speak</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;This is a very nice place you have here. How did you come to own such a place as this?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you speak of your mother, and explain that she&#039;s left you alone for most of your life before you lost your arm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh. I apologize for their rudeness. Many humans simply attack monsters on sight as a force of habits, but I have found it much better to allow the younger creatures to get near me and realize I am no threat. It is why I always gather an audience of such powerful creatures when I play in the field! They have listened to me since they were young.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you speak kindly of his music, and ask where he learned such wonderful songs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;A college of bards. Boring place, but I learned how to spin powerful notes in charms for battle. I find their music boring however, and thus I play my own choices to put meaning behind my playing.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with a blush visible just barely on your own face, you ask him if he has serenaded other lucky women with his song</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;N-no! I have only played the song for you, fair maiden. I would hope you find the welcoming song as beautiful as you are to me.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;his blush widens to cover his entire face, and you smile in a way that bares your smaller teeth carefully</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;this human finds you beautiful, and has the bravery to sit on your bed beside you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;perhaps he wishes to warm your bed with his presence</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;for a moment his gaze wanders over your sparse coverings as your thoughts wander, but as you teasingly spread your legs slightly to allow him a better view he shamefully darts away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it is painfully clear the human male is intimidated by your direct display of similar interests, but you hope you can break his polite control so he may take to you as he seemingly desires</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you laugh softly, scooting around and behind him on your bed, slipping your lower coverings off slyly to tease him a bit, and move towards your chest from on top of the bed to gather food to share with your guest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you scoot to the edge of your bed, lazily extending your body over the side of the bent sapling frame and reaching to grab meat from within you chest to share with your guest; you purposefully lift your leg to gain better balance and allow the hunter to see clearly his flattery and kindness have excited you, but your somewhat fuzzy mind causes you to begin to tip off of the frame and risk falling to the floor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the bard quickly grips your hip carefully as you begin to tip over, balancing you and trying to avoid becoming overtly sexual, much to your dismay</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;when you lean back from the chest with two large skinned Jaggi legs, you notice that he is searching in his clothes to find utensils, after a moment of searching his coat he happily pulls two metal forks out and offers one to you as you set the meat over the fire</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you gently take the fork from him, moving in front of him teasingly before sitting down again and pulling him over to your embrace as he blushes, finally realizing you were allowing his eyes to wander on purpose</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;looking at his hand and hoping it wanders you take note he is missing the pinky finger on it, and look to the hand that hold his fork to see that it also shares his disfigurement</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a gentle simmer of something kindred burns within you as he looks up to you in confusion, his face of concern shared with yours as you lock eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hunter... who took your fingers from you?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;he looks away from your gaze, into the moss lining your lair, and seems almost ashamed that you took note of his wounds</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It doesn&#039;t matter fair lady. You have much more to worry of then I do. What is an arm to-&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you him spin in your arm to face you, and a gentle clawed finger seals his voice away gently</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I misspoke, and I must apologize. You are no hunter, fair human.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you gently close in on his neck, applying a delicate kiss as you can feel his heartbeat begin to beat like a distant war drum</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you slowly slide your arm down his face, down to his neck, caressing your way down his arm slowly to his hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you take a gentle hold on it, and rub the scar where his left pinky should be, noting that his hands are covered in many more scars than you had seen at a glance</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You are a musician. Your entire life comes from your hands and mouth. You breathe life into thin parchment, and make sweet the night air.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can barely control yourself now, his deep sorrow engulfing you and taming your spark of desire as tears form in your eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I am but a monster. My hands claw away at life, and rip it from those that would attempt to harm me. I am a weapon, and you are a precious treasure.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;for a moment you are startled as he pulls you close to himself, and the air between you begins to chill and freeze as your instincts cause your icy breath to begin to blow freely</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with no fear in his body, he places his hand upon your cheek, and gives you a slow passionate kiss through the frost</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your icy breath fades quickly to hot gasps, the human having turned a dying fire in your breast into a raging blaze with nary a single word said between the two of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;he continues to kiss you with a fearless passion, before breaking to whisper something to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You must be wrong. I see no monster before me. I gaze upon the perfection of a beautiful wild goddess.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you attempt to make a joke about his song having worked, but he pulls you closely again, and you feel his breath on the nape of your neck as he throws caution to the wind and passionately nips at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;frost and heat dance in the wind before your mouth, his sudden passion causing you to shake as if you had been struck by a bolt of lightning</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;he continues his vicious assault upon you until you feel primal urges begin to boil inside of you, your tail wrapping around the two of you and causing the both of you to topple to the ground</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;he simply laughs, kissing you on the mouth for a brief moment before speaking to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Might I have chance to warm your bed tonight, fair lady?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a devilish smirk cracks on your face as your right hand slowly rubs your wanting hot love, dragging a gentle wet smudge onto your finger as you bring it back up and put it in front of his mouth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;he seems confused for a moment, smelling it, before his eyes go wide and he playfully bites your finger</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a shiver runs up your spine as he licks it clean of your lustful cocktail, and kisses it when he has finished enjoying it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I guess that means I&#039;m going to do much more than that.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;still enclosed by your tail, his hands slowly rise up your waist, gripping your hips firmly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I think I may have to warm you up a few degrees more. Perhaps even give you a fair amount of my own essence to keep as you wish...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you smile and try to figure out what he means as you fur goes as poofy as it has ever been when you realize what he said</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a human, covering you in his hot warm love?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;that&#039;s a devilish thought you wish you had the idea of asking for...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;actually... no, you didn&#039;t wish you had been required to ask</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it was so much more enticing that he offered to let you have it first, and oh so very directly to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I will have to keep something to remember my gentle lover; If you tease me too much, I may be tempted to make a nest for us both to use and keep you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with a passionate grin you maneuver your tail behind you and against the floor, acting as a surrogate bed or table you lacked the ability to be thrown on and ravaged in your spartan abode</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your legs open wide and plant firmly on the ground, allowing your hand to open your lips and show to him just how much you wanted him to deliver on his teasing promise</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;he is quick to abandon his clothing, and his sword presses against your hot and quickly dripping lips as he grinds into you to lubricate himself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a few teasing thrusts against you and you shudder as he enters you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;just days ago you only had the idea of inviting a human to your lair to have chat, and with his display and further kind words... now you were mating with one</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;his speed is tender at first, as if he was afraid to go fast and harm you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with a wry grin spreading you focus on making your inner muscles contract a bit with each inward thrust, dialing up your body&#039;s ability to choose when a mate is locked into you with a smile</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;what you didn&#039;t expect was for this to make him speed up, however</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;his smooth and impressively sized human member rocks faster and faster as you try your best to tease him to a halt, but your muscular control is no match for the elegant design of the human&#039;s mating instrument and the effects it is having on your body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;thrust after thrust causes you to tighten more and more, and you feel you must be strangling the life from him as eh reaches his maximum speed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;every single thrust feels like a war-hammer beating pleasure into you, and you can feel yourself beginning to work towards your finish as he bares his teeth in a mixture of pleasure and smugness</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you are about to ask what he&#039;s so smug over when you feel his hand rubbing a particular part of your body your hand usually rested on, causing pleasure to blast you out of focus</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;his hands work wonders as you lose control to a small fleshy nub you normally ignored, causing a shuddering orgasm to rock you as he continues to put in work towards his own</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;he continues to do this for a while before reaching for your hand, and moving it towards your newly found pleasure button</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after showing you how to rub it, he moves his arms to your waist and puts all of the force he has in his hips towards mating you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with little time to prepare, you can feel his member suddenly twitching in the vice grip of your hot love, and you move your hand from your button onto his shoulder as you sense he nears his finish</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you wait happily in a state of near orgasmic bliss as you await for him to pull free and coat your stomach, but he never does</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;pressing his body&#039;s full weight on top of yours, his strong grip pulls your hips towards his as he presses forward;

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;you are a Barioth, though not of the usual variety of monster many men hunted in their spare time
&gt;you were much rarer prey, known to some as an ayn-tro-murph
&gt;humans called you an anthro, in the few short meetings you had with them
&gt;a shapely figure born rarely from monsters, with the supposed capability of mixing together species that normally didn&#039;t mix if the legends were true
&gt;other monsters gave you a respectful distance, and most humans didn&#039;t seem to want to hunt you when you were growing up in the mountains
&gt;your mother had stayed by your side for many years, but eventually she left your cave and started a new nest elsewhere and only came to your nest for the occasional visit with small Barioth babies to watch while she hunted
&gt;you knew if you brought her your odd little younglings one day she would certainly watch them while you hunted, but you had never had a companion to share with
&gt;through your youth and onward hunters approached your cave with caution, and your mother would watch over as they spoke with you and taught you to speak their language
&gt;many wore odd garbs and carried a talisman with an odd symbol on it, but after you had learned their language and how to build what few things they could teach you, they too left you to your own life with time
&gt;many years of lonesome existing finally made you wander down the mountains, trying to and occasionally succeeding in speaking with many a scared hunter
&gt;in rare cases a nearly frozen hunter would be plucked away by you, and you would cuddle them by your fire as they rested in the happy but fearful embrace of your 8 foot tall frame
&gt;you made the friendship of a human healing hunter over time, and he did his best to teach you healing medicines for when you got hurt and needed help
&gt;pain medicine for when a tooth was broken and another was growing into place, wound sealing pastes to stop the bleeding and speed recovery, and burn salves for if you were attacked by something that spit fire
&gt;in a painfully familiar way, not long after he taught you this he disappeared, but this time was different
&gt;when he returned the next time, he was bound in chains, and a hunter with a large sword was by his side
&gt;when you approached the curious sight the swordsman walked slowly towards you, speaking softly and trying to explain what happened...
&gt;so he could get close enough to attack, and cleave your left arm off
&gt;shocked and in pain, you fought brutally and won quickly, freeing the chained man before fleeing as he yelled for you to stop so he could help
&gt;pain and fear drove you into your cave, and you used large amounts of your stored medicine to save yourself from dying that die
&gt;unfortunately, you learned that arms and teeth don&#039;t share the ability of slowly regrowing
&gt;a large scar and a nub of an arm lead you to more solitude for many years, and a pained existence followed
&gt;adjusting to the loss of your arm was slow, but you managed to get back to roughly where you were beforehand
&gt;instead of gliding you leapt with your unusually powerful legs, finding your size lead to stealthy hunting your mother had no such abilities in teaching you
&gt;this stealth was the key to experiencing the world of the lower mountains, and lead to an interesting discovery one day

&gt;a human sat in a grassy field, monsters surrounding him on all sides
&gt;surely, the hunter would soon be dead and a short fight over his body would be had by the massive beasts looming near him
&gt;it came to you as a surprise then, that the beasts surrounding him all began to sit around him when he waved at them to sit down, and he pulled out an object you couldn&#039;t see from your perch of snow
&gt;you could plainly hear his music however, carrying on the winds and causing the monster near him both young and old to sway peacefully and enjoy his company when he arrived in the mornings
&gt;not a single creature dared attack him throughout the day as he walked with a few small Felyne helpers to gather berries and fruit
&gt;months went by of him collecting, and a slowly waning audience that eventually only consisted of the youngest of monsters came close to hear his song
&gt;you did note that monsters still roamed with bobbing heads and swinging tails when his music was playing, so you just assumed they became used to his music and saw him as no threat
&gt;after he took a trip up the mountain to play one day, a Grimalkyne wandered into your cave while you were sleeping and woke you by poking you with a stick
&gt;turning over on your bed of straw and branches, it waved at you with while offering you some berries
&gt;the small bidepal lynx sat by your nearly dead fire, and it waited for you to say something to it or give it something while eating from a small bag of fruit
&gt;unsure of what it wanted, but knowing that it was probably scouting for the man from the field, you dig inside of your bed and found a small piece of parchment and a bone with ink in it
&gt;scribbling out your best remembered human writings you sent gave the tuft eared cat a note to send back to the human&#039;s village and hopefully him
&gt;&quot;Wan 2 me chu. Sea me et cabe. Look 4 ded huntas, don go pass dah Kushala Daora skeleman. Chu do gud music.&quot;
&gt;digging deeper into your bed you locate a small painted picture a human who tried to stay the night in your cave left you, of your form lied out comfortably on your bed nude and beckoning
&gt;it was a very nice gift for him to give you, and you assumed that including it would show the hunter you were serious about wanting to talk with him
&gt;after taking your note, the small feline runs out of your cave and treads snow as fast as they can, as if they knew how dangerous you were being polite after waking you
&gt;after a few days have passed, the man who makes music sent you back a note with his small fuzzy friend, telling you he would arrive again in a week
&gt;on the dusk of the seventh day you await carefully in your cave, knowing few humans dared to come near the entrance with the ghastly impromptu display decorating the exterior
&gt;skeletons you had remembered of long dead hunters that came to the areas up here to find monsters, but dying in combat or freezing while still holding weapons
&gt;you wonder if it is overkill, but he should have the bravery to not flee if he already agreed to come this far and knew they would be his marker
&gt;or so you think he would, at least

&gt;in the distance, a lone hunter approaches wrapped in the finery of a bard
&gt;&quot;What a strange man to take my offer, and dress up for the occasion...&quot;
&gt;you watch carefully from the hidden depths of the dark cave as he drags out his... 
&gt;hunting horn?
&gt;a very small one, made of metal that shined like with the intensity of the sun when light hit it
&gt;his voice carries well into your cave, though his confused appearance tells you he cannot see you as well as you gaze upon him
&gt;&quot;I have received your call! And the oddly... enticing picture you sent with it. No one else believed you serious, and though I cannot see you... I shall make my promise and signal you.&quot;
&gt;his horn plays soothing, gentle music to you, and an odd feeling of warmth engulfs you
&gt;you recognize the notes he plays, but not the order of a song you have heard before, and listen carefully as he attempts to call for you repeatedly with no halts
&gt;C# B F# D, C# B F# D, A G D B, A G D, G F# D B G, F# G A B C# D E F#...
&gt;his song is very intoxicating, and the longer you listen the more at ease you feel
&gt;how strange, no hunter before him dared use a song that made everything near him more calm before
&gt;in the heat of battle it would be useless
&gt;this man is a hunter, right?
&gt;surely no madman would dare brave the wilds to meet a Barioth in her cave, regardless of if she was an anthromorph or not
&gt;you gently rub your long gone arm, and an odd feeling washes over you that can&#039;t be described in any way that seem correct
&gt;many hunters would see an anthro as an intense danger to them, since they carried all of the power of their larger wild brethren
&gt;and yet, excitement dances over your toned body as you lay there and enjoy his song for a few spare moments
&gt;was this feeling joy?
&gt;were you excited he had the bravery to come to see you without any arms by his side?
&gt;even with your one arm, you were an intensely dangerous thing...
&gt;the music stops, and his demeanor goes from confused to sad
&gt;you realize he was serenading you for some time, and walk with a solid strut out towards him as he turns to leave
&gt;&quot;Hunter! Do not leave yet. I am sorry for not coming out sooner.&quot;
&gt;you walk slowly out into the air of the setting sun, noting he is shaking in the cold of the raw winds
&gt;&quot;The song you played for me simply made me swoon, and I had trouble keeping myself together. Please, come into my humble home.&quot;
&gt;he shivers, his voice carrying a tinge of fear behind the chattering teeth as he speaks
&gt;&quot;I-It is... the careless whisper. A song of a bard who regretted a mistake in not loving someone truly, and his sorrows paint affection into the notes of the music. The song has- well, no. Technically, the song is meant to be used when courting another human. I-I simply l-liked the tune and-&quot;
&gt;you hug the shivering human close to you, causing him to go silent, as he walks beside you down the tunnels towards the warmer nest in your cave
&gt;&quot;I found your tune enthralling, hunter. Should you come to visit me again after today, I would love to be greeted by it once more.&quot;
&gt;he slowly warms against your body, unconsciously nestling into the fur on your waist as you walk the smaller male towards your home deeper in the cave
&gt;it doesn&#039;t take long for you to walk the entire distance, the winds outside barely audible from your secluded abode
&gt;a busted chest sits in the corner, farthest from the campfire in the center of your humble abode, your bed near enough to receive ample warmth if need be but not ignite
&gt;above the fire is a large opening which smoke pours through, leading into an upper chamber that bleeds out the smoke into the air through holes in the ground
&gt;nearest the fire is a large flint a hunter had long since lost to you, and across from the flint bound in animal hides is the straw you use to feed the flames
&gt;the human still cold against your side you walk towards the flint and rake it with your claws, the fire roaring to life in front of the two of you
&gt;you walk over to your nest like bed and carefully pay for him to sit down next to you
&gt;without a single hesitation he obeys, cuddling up against you without thinking and taking as much of your warmth in as he can
&gt;a smile graces your mouth as he slowly warms himself by your side, whistling a tune to him as he warms himself slowly

&gt;when he is finally warmed, he scoots a small bit away from you, and beings to speak
&gt;&quot;This is a very nice place you have here. How did you come to own such a place as this?&quot;
&gt;you speak of your mother, and explain that she&#039;s left you alone for most of your life before you lost your arm
&gt;&quot;Oh. I apologize for their rudeness. Many humans simply attack monsters on sight as a force of habits, but I have found it much better to allow the younger creatures to get near me and realize I am no threat. It is why I always gather an audience of such powerful creatures when I play in the field! They have listened to me since they were young.&quot;
&gt;you speak kindly of his music, and ask where he learned such wonderful songs
&gt;&quot;A college of bards. Boring place, but I learned how to spin powerful notes in charms for battle. I find their music boring however, and thus I play my own choices to put meaning behind my playing.&quot;
&gt;with a blush visible just barely on your own face, you ask him if he has serenaded other lucky women with his song
&gt;&quot;N-no! I have only played the song for you, fair maiden. I would hope you find the welcoming song as beautiful as you are to me.&quot;
&gt;his blush widens to cover his entire face, and you smile in a way that bares your smaller teeth carefully
&gt;this human finds you beautiful, and has the bravery to sit on your bed beside you
&gt;perhaps he wishes to warm your bed with his presence
&gt;for a moment his gaze wanders over your sparse coverings as your thoughts wander, but as you teasingly spread your legs slightly to allow him a better view he shamefully darts away
&gt;it is painfully clear the human male is intimidated by your direct display of similar interests, but you hope you can break his polite control so he may take to you as he seemingly desires
&gt;you laugh softly, scooting around and behind him on your bed, slipping your lower coverings off slyly to tease him a bit, and move towards your chest from on top of the bed to gather food to share with your guest

&gt;you scoot to the edge of your bed, lazily extending your body over the side of the bent sapling frame and reaching to grab meat from within you chest to share with your guest; you purposefully lift your leg to gain better balance and allow the hunter to see clearly his flattery and kindness have excited you, but your somewhat fuzzy mind causes you to begin to tip off of the frame and risk falling to the floor
&gt;the bard quickly grips your hip carefully as you begin to tip over, balancing you and trying to avoid becoming overtly sexual, much to your dismay
&gt;when you lean back from the chest with two large skinned Jaggi legs, you notice that he is searching in his clothes to find utensils, after a moment of searching his coat he happily pulls two metal forks out and offers one to you as you set the meat over the fire
&gt;you gently take the fork from him, moving in front of him teasingly before sitting down again and pulling him over to your embrace as he blushes, finally realizing you were allowing his eyes to wander on purpose
&gt;looking at his hand and hoping it wanders you take note he is missing the pinky finger on it, and look to the hand that hold his fork to see that it also shares his disfigurement
&gt;a gentle simmer of something kindred burns within you as he looks up to you in confusion, his face of concern shared with yours as you lock eyes
&gt;&quot;Hunter... who took your fingers from you?&quot;
&gt;he looks away from your gaze, into the moss lining your lair, and seems almost ashamed that you took note of his wounds
&gt;&quot;It doesn&#039;t matter fair lady. You have much more to worry of then I do. What is an arm to-&quot;
&gt;you him spin in your arm to face you, and a gentle clawed finger seals his voice away gently
&gt;&quot;I misspoke, and I must apologize. You are no hunter, fair human.&quot;
&gt;you gently close in on his neck, applying a delicate kiss as you can feel his heartbeat begin to beat like a distant war drum
&gt;you slowly slide your arm down his face, down to his neck, caressing your way down his arm slowly to his hand
&gt;you take a gentle hold on it, and rub the scar where his left pinky should be, noting that his hands are covered in many more scars than you had seen at a glance
&gt;&quot;You are a musician. Your entire life comes from your hands and mouth. You breathe life into thin parchment, and make sweet the night air.&quot;
&gt;you can barely control yourself now, his deep sorrow engulfing you and taming your spark of desire as tears form in your eyes
&gt;&quot;I am but a monster. My hands claw away at life, and rip it from those that would attempt to harm me. I am a weapon, and you are a precious treasure.&quot;
&gt;for a moment you are startled as he pulls you close to himself, and the air between you begins to chill and freeze as your instincts cause your icy breath to begin to blow freely
&gt;with no fear in his body, he places his hand upon your cheek, and gives you a slow passionate kiss through the frost
&gt;your icy breath fades quickly to hot gasps, the human having turned a dying fire in your breast into a raging blaze with nary a single word said between the two of you
&gt;he continues to kiss you with a fearless passion, before breaking to whisper something to you
&gt;&quot;You must be wrong. I see no monster before me. I gaze upon the perfection of a beautiful wild goddess.&quot;
&gt;you attempt to make a joke about his song having worked, but he pulls you closely again, and you feel his breath on the nape of your neck as he throws caution to the wind and passionately nips at you
&gt;frost and heat dance in the wind before your mouth, his sudden passion causing you to shake as if you had been struck by a bolt of lightning
&gt;he continues his vicious assault upon you until you feel primal urges begin to boil inside of you, your tail wrapping around the two of you and causing the both of you to topple to the ground

&gt;he simply laughs, kissing you on the mouth for a brief moment before speaking to you
&gt;&quot;Might I have chance to warm your bed tonight, fair lady?&quot;
&gt;a devilish smirk cracks on your face as your right hand slowly rubs your wanting hot love, dragging a gentle wet smudge onto your finger as you bring it back up and put it in front of his mouth
&gt;he seems confused for a moment, smelling it, before his eyes go wide and he playfully bites your finger
&gt;a shiver runs up your spine as he licks it clean of your lustful cocktail, and kisses it when he has finished enjoying it
&gt;&quot;I guess that means I&#039;m going to do much more than that.&quot;
&gt;still enclosed by your tail, his hands slowly rise up your waist, gripping your hips firmly
&gt;&quot;I think I may have to warm you up a few degrees more. Perhaps even give you a fair amount of my own essence to keep as you wish...&quot;
&gt;you smile and try to figure out what he means as you fur goes as poofy as it has ever been when you realize what he said
&gt;a human, covering you in his hot warm love?
&gt;that&#039;s a devilish thought you wish you had the idea of asking for...
&gt;actually... no, you didn&#039;t wish you had been required to ask
&gt;it was so much more enticing that he offered to let you have it first, and oh so very directly to you
&gt;&quot;I will have to keep something to remember my gentle lover; If you tease me too much, I may be tempted to make a nest for us both to use and keep you.&quot;

&gt;with a passionate grin you maneuver your tail behind you and against the floor, acting as a surrogate bed or table you lacked the ability to be thrown on and ravaged in your spartan abode
&gt;your legs open wide and plant firmly on the ground, allowing your hand to open your lips and show to him just how much you wanted him to deliver on his teasing promise
&gt;he is quick to abandon his clothing, and his sword presses against your hot and quickly dripping lips as he grinds into you to lubricate himself
&gt;a few teasing thrusts against you and you shudder as he enters you
&gt;just days ago you only had the idea of inviting a human to your lair to have chat, and with his display and further kind words... now you were mating with one
&gt;his speed is tender at first, as if he was afraid to go fast and harm you
&gt;with a wry grin spreading you focus on making your inner muscles contract a bit with each inward thrust, dialing up your body&#039;s ability to choose when a mate is locked into you with a smile
&gt;what you didn&#039;t expect was for this to make him speed up, however
&gt;his smooth and impressively sized human member rocks faster and faster as you try your best to tease him to a halt, but your muscular control is no match for the elegant design of the human&#039;s mating instrument and the effects it is having on your body
&gt;thrust after thrust causes you to tighten more and more, and you feel you must be strangling the life from him as eh reaches his maximum speed
&gt;every single thrust feels like a war-hammer beating pleasure into you, and you can feel yourself beginning to work towards your finish as he bares his teeth in a mixture of pleasure and smugness
&gt;you are about to ask what he&#039;s so smug over when you feel his hand rubbing a particular part of your body your hand usually rested on, causing pleasure to blast you out of focus
&gt;his hands work wonders as you lose control to a small fleshy nub you normally ignored, causing a shuddering orgasm to rock you as he continues to put in work towards his own
&gt;he continues to do this for a while before reaching for your hand, and moving it towards your newly found pleasure button
&gt;after showing you how to rub it, he moves his arms to your waist and puts all of the force he has in his hips towards mating you
&gt;with little time to prepare, you can feel his member suddenly twitching in the vice grip of your hot love, and you move your hand from your button onto his shoulder as you sense he nears his finish
&gt;you wait happily in a state of near orgasmic bliss as you await for him to pull free and coat your stomach, but he never does
&gt;pressing his body&#039;s full weight on top of yours, his strong grip pulls your hips towards his as he presses forward; a geyser of hot liquid pours into you as you gasp with a mix of excitement and confusion

&gt;your gasp turns into a moan as your body forces another orgasm out of you, the mere knowledge that a potential mate was marking your insides causing long dormant instincts to gift you a final blast of intense pleasure alongside his
&gt;your strong tail still holding you up, he takes a moment after having finished to pump into you more, ensuring all that he has goes directly to your womb
&gt;your previous muscle control falters a bit as your mind wanders, but your muscles remain tight against him in the hopes of keeping all he has to offer you
&gt;when he finally stops and pulls free of you, your focus breaks so hard you almost seem to pass out from the thought of what has happened to you
&gt;instincts and muscular discipline that ensured a fellow monster&#039;s enjoyment of you in of the moment was only as much as you allowed were completely fried; they had been scrambled by the fact that a human could fill your supple form so perfectly and continue to pound away even after he was finished, and you were trying to use internal strength to keep him in place
&gt;you aren&#039;t sure if you had a continuous orgasm or if every thrust caused a microgasm to occur, but you do your best to wipe away the intoxicating thoughts of what has happened, so that you can confront him on shattering your instincts and filling you without thinking
&gt;he slides off of your tail as you prop yourself up, rubbing at your previously unknown pleasure pearl to coax some of his seed free, while you shudder with both anger and unbound and entirely uncontrollable content at the knowledge all but a few drops are sealing firmly inside
&gt;&quot;That is a very serious thing to let me have, hunter! Finishing fully within marks me with your scent... if I smell much more of you then...&quot;
&gt;he smiles at you, climbing back onto your tail as you blush and pull your hand away from your excited lower half
&gt;he begins to gently prepare his sword for another go at you as you look away, face as red as your lips from the heat of excitment
&gt;&quot;Would you allow me to prove I am serious in my devotion then? Shall I not mate this time with you, fair lady? Shall I attempt to breed you, and earn the title of your lover?&quot;
&gt;your tail grinds harshly into the floor as you gnash your teeth in hot frustration
&gt;he shouldn&#039;t tease you, this is serious!
&gt;&quot;If you mean it, then return to me as lover. Not later, but no-ahhhhhhhhhnnnnng.&quot;
&gt;you are unable to finish as you feel his presence once more, and your legs kick onto his hips of their own accord as he begins to gently rock your body back and forth

&gt;his assault is as immediate as your response is intense, claws on your hand raking into the rocks to grip better so that you can rock towards him as he does, and away when he pulls back
&gt;your head rolls back and bares your neck, your vicious hunter taking the moment to lean over you and bite down and make you shudder
&gt;you realize you aren&#039;t balancing on your feet after a moment, but a glance down shows that he has his feet firmly on the ground to balance for you
&gt;only the closest of mates would do such a thing in the heat of a moment to their other half, and it is normally something the female must ask for
&gt;your body reacts in kind to his loving abandon of caution and your love muscles constrict as taught as possible around him to choke the very essence of his body free
&gt;to a monster this might push the to the brink immediately and lock them in place, as it was causing you to do
&gt;to a human&#039;s shapely member however, it was simply a paradoxically capable slide to ram down into as it was a choking vice that nearly forced him to a halt
&gt;realizing that you have lost control of your ability to control how your body mates with him forever, you simply crack the floor viciously with your hand as you  realize your body has chosen to allow him the full experience at all times
&gt;the intoxicating thoughts burn brightly as you realize that every time from now on he would begin to mate, your normally controllable body would now tighten to it&#039;s fullest ability to give him his optimal pleasure
&gt;giving into your overpowering instincts you simply allow your mate to control your body, a strong overpowering orgasm rocking you while microgasms explode with every thrust
&gt;after minutes flow by of his crotch soaking and robbing your body of endless wetness, he finally grips your hips and unleashes all of himself he has left into you
&gt;slowly pulling forth and back to coax the small amount left in his nearly dry body out, he finds himself spent and slowly pulls free of you as your hand gets wiped on his discarded clothes so that you could plug the hole with your finger
&gt;still unable to believe the bard had the bravery to do what he has done, you rub between your engorged lips gently to allow a small amount of his donation to flow freely and lubricate a small indulgence
&gt;you find it too pleasurably to make yourself continue for long however, knowing only he would be able to make you take such pleasure filled thrusts, and free your finger gently in the hopes your slightly distended belly will drain gently until sealing itself at capacity
&gt;instead, a slow but steady stream rolls free of you and warms your lips as it rolls down them,  pooling between your thighs until your body finds it&#039;s naturally full mark and seals itself full of his remaining seed
&gt;an intense sigh rolls out of your body as you rub more and more, indulging your still freshly discovered orgasm button as his steaming seed no doubt coats your womb
&gt;&quot;You are a b-brave man, m-my lover. I ca-agh n-not believe still, you would allow yourself to t-take such me agh your own. I happily ssssubmit to being your m-mate.&quot;
&gt;you lean up into an almost kneeling position while carefully putting your feet back onto the ground, kissing your mate upon his forehead gently
&gt;&quot;I shall protect you to the best of my ability, and will accompany you wherever you wish to take me.&quot;
&gt;he kisses you back, and gently runs his hands through your mane
&gt;&quot;Even if I make you wear clothes, and go into a town?&quot;
&gt;you wrap your arm and wing around him, picking him up and walking to the pile of straw you use to normally feed your fires
&gt;&quot;Even if you make me wear nudity resistant armor, and visit hunting camps.&quot;

&gt;you grasp as much straw as you can with your tail, trying to keep the muscles in your pelvis as taut as possible to keep his remaining gift nestled inside of you firmly
&gt;using the straw in your tail, you pad out the nest for the two of you, adding depth and a small amount more side room for him to snuggle near you in
&gt;you climb in first, allowing for him to take the roll of the smaller cutlery, laughing as you note the Jaggi meat has long since crisped over the fire
&gt;&quot;In the morning I will hunt a better meal for us to both enjoy. For now we shall partake in the first night of a shared mate nest. One of many, until I assume you will move us to your house in the human camps.&quot;
&gt;a bit of worry crosses his face as he climbs into bed and is surrounded by your single wing
&gt;&quot;Would you mind if I asked you to join me in the city? Would it be too much to ask that we stay together there? Even if you wear a collar?&quot;
&gt;you groom his hair with your tongue, causing him to relax and slowly begin to drift towards dreamland
&gt;&quot;Anything for you, my lovely mate. I might even like the collar, should you only use the leash in our bedroom.&quot;
&gt;you can feel his warm blush as you close your eyes to join him, your body and heart warmed by his love as you known in your heart he has earned it
&gt;even if it meant wearing a collar and concealing your nude form from others, you would gladly do so for his sake
&gt;for your mate, and his love, you would do anything
&gt;you only hoped you could keep him as safe as you could keep him warm, keeping him as safe as you did happy
&gt;after such a lovely night as tonight, he would never be allowed far from your side, nor you from his if you could help it
&gt;such a wondrous treasure would have to be kept safe from the many dangers of the world at every moment
&gt;surely, you would make sure to hold onto his love forever</textarea>
