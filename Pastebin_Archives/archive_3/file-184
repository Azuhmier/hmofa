&gt;Your name is Anon, and maybe it is time for an explanation
&gt;Welcome to “Redwood Resort”, the high security heat management center you can trust
&gt;It all started years ago….

&gt;The problem that stood behind the facility was heat
&gt;Not normal heat, but the canine heat to be precise
&gt;Unlike the many other reproductive cycles the canine woman does not stop ovulating until she is seeded and will grow increasingly violent to achieve her goal of relief
&gt;Redwood originally started as a anthro nerve clinic, designed to cure and help the insane and stressed
&gt;With the increasingly complicated city and civilization life however the number of heat cases grew and grew
&gt;Normally a bitch in heat would just have to raise her tail and every guy in a twenty meter radius would dogpile her [2]
&gt;The slowly rising adaption of human values however shifted this much accepted relief from normal to immoral and finally close to the human opinion on drunken sex
&gt;Taking a girl in heat was soon seen as immoral and the growing population of canines threw more coal into the fire
&gt;By limiting the amount of puppies per couple to 2 the overpopulation was slowly reduced but now even married anthros had difficulties ending their heat
&gt;The only other way to find relief being the “climax your brains out” method, which many girls had difficulties following
&gt;With the amount of heat related crimes rising, fear of feralitis [3] spreading and the species relations heating up [4] the government took action
&gt;Redwood Resort was remodeled to a heat management center for criminal anthros and those that failed to deal with the problem themselves
&gt;A well structured daily plan, security and orgasms to keep the girls in check
&gt;You are Anon and this is your workplace
