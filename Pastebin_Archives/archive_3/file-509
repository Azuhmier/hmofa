Or at least you think it is.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pop on your headphones and browse Spotify for a couple minutes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;First thing that comes to mind is the Hotline Miami soundtrack</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Get through about half the trash before you remember that you had guests</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait, did they bail?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Setting aside the trash bag carefully you move around your small house</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mudroom? Nope. Living room? Nope. Bathroom? Nope.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nobody&#039;s here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quickly go to your phone and text some dude who you think came over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t really know their names, most of the time it&#039;s a friend of a friend</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Did you leave early last night? You kinda left me with a lot of trash to pick up.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thirty minutes go by, nothing. You were pretty certain that he wasn&#039;t doing anything</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Alright this is starting to freak you out. You run through and text a few more numbers but still, nothing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Suddenly, an idea. You know where one of them lives so you&#039;ll just swing by.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Quickly you throw on some clean enough clothes and take your phone and your knife</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ve learned that it&#039;s better to take your knife with you and not need to cut a rope or open a box than to not.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Outside you notice that it&#039;s completely silent. The only noise you hear are the sprinklers in your neighbors lawn.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Normally you hear some kids screaming in the pool next door, it&#039;s welcome to not hear them but it&#039;s strange.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s not a super long walk so you decide to take your time and enjoy the quiet for a little while.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;About halfway there you think you notice that the road that comes into your neighborhood just isn&#039;t there</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not even any dirt where it was, just grass.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s then that you notice that the entire neighborhood seemingly was just plopped onto the ground in the middle of nowhere.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then you start to think of all the random disappearances that have been happening around the world. At first it wasn&#039;t anything important, just some missing people.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were pretty sure that your wallet also vanished at one point.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After that it only escalated. You recall a mountain disappearing. That made headlines everywhere. Preceded only by a whole town just vanishing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Soon after that a couple of insurance companies wanted to break out vanishing insurance, but quickly decided that paying for entire towns and mountains was too much money.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Aw, shit.&quot; You can&#039;t help but say under your breath.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So after thinking about that for a while you decide to just break into a couple houses and stock up on food and water. Not like anyone&#039;s going to need it anymore.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The power was out for a lot of houses but thankfully you had decided to sink whatever money you had in solar panels. They wouldn&#039;t keep you powered all the time but you figure it&#039;d help</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After cleaning out a couple houses of food and bottled water you head back to your house to dump it all off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Seeing that it&#039;s going to get dark soon you decide to scope out the area with the last remaining bits of light.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just south of your home you see a decently sized lake. Relief fills you slightly as you now realize that you have more water, even when you run out of bottled water.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You head back inside and resume picking up your room. Might as well do something while planning out your next move.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After picking up the trash that you&#039;re pretty sure you weren&#039;t responsible for you take the garbage bag and toss it into the trash bin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You think to yourself that you&#039;ll come up with a way of handling the trash properly later. What matters now is figuring out what comes after dark.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were pretty sure before that the dude that lived across the street was in a gang. So he&#039;d have a gun even if he wasn&#039;t supposed to, right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Better check just in case you could snag something out of it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Arming yourself with a flashlight alongside your pocket knife, which you didn&#039;t know how to use properly but it at least made you feel better.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You head back outside and across the pavement. Walking past his small car you guessed probably cost only a couple hundred dollars.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reach the front door and check the handle, locked. To your left is a good sized window, you hadn&#039;t thought to bring anything to smash a window so you check around you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Spotting a brick, just laying behind one of the support pillars. Quickly you snag it and move back towards the window.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Right before you smash his living room window you look back at his car, the thought didn&#039;t even cross your mind that he&#039;d keep a gun in there but it&#039;d make sense.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smash the window anyway, and then head back to his car to figure out what all he kept in there. You try the driver side door, locked.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn&#039;t know what you expected trying the door but whatever. Taking the brick in your hands and swinging it against the window.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The car alarm goes off and you find yourself being oddly startled by the noise. Looking at the window you notice that you didn&#039;t quite break it yet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Another blow against the cracked glass seems to finally do it in. Glass shards cover the driver side seat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Quickly you scramble to find the button to pop the hood, this alarm is starting to get to you. You find it and pop the hood.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Running to the front of the car you remove the battery in hopes that it stops the alarm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn&#039;t know much about cars, just that the battery was important and so was gasoline.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thankfully the alarm stops assaulting you and your ears. Time to get back to searching.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You crack open the glovebox and all you find are some manuals for the car he has and some AA batteries, not exactly helpful.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Moving back you check under the seats, just some plastic bottles and trash. Bad luck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You crack the trunk open in hopes of finding at least something. You walk out to the back of the car and check within.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still nothing but a spare tire and a tire iron. You take the tire iron, at least now you can smash more windows.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Guessing that the car is a dead end you head back over to the porch, glass crunching slightly as you step on them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Peering within the house you notice something. You can&#039;t see shit, it&#039;s dark inside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Reaching into your pocket you pull out your flashlight. It&#039;s small and made of metal, the logo has been worn down over the years but you still remember the name, &quot;Slyde&quot;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Turning it on, a very bright beam of light quickly changes the look of the room, inside you see that the front room was fairly clean. You step through, careful of the glass that still hung from the frame.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Inside you begin to check each room with care not to break more than you need.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bedroom, nothing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bathroom, nada.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The kitchen however seemed to have different news. Inside one of the cabinets you see something just behind some boxes of cereal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pushing them aside you finally find something. It&#039;s a small revolver that could fit in your pocket.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Next to it is a box of ammo that says &quot;.38 SPL&quot;. You aren&#039;t exactly sure what that means but it looks like it belongs to the revolver.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grab them both and head home for the night, familiarizing yourself with the firearm for a while before laying down again to try and get some sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s been a couple sleepless hours so far. Most of it is just you tossing and turning in bed, thinking about what to do in the morning.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Giving up on trying to sleep you get out of bed and head toward your window to try and get a better look outside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It doesn&#039;t take long for your eyes to adjust due to the lack of light in your room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Outside you don&#039;t see anything, but you do hear something. It isn&#039;t your neighbor&#039;s sprinkler either.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It sounds like a, plane? Quickly you rush outside and sure enough, you see a green and red light in the sky.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sprint back inside and grab your flashlight, shining it at what you hope to be a plane.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It circles around the area for a little while and then it leaves, northbound.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You head back inside. Heading to the kitchen to quickly cook, something.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;More than likely you&#039;ll cook some cup ramen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still tastes good enough. You put some water on boil and then go to your cupboard for some ramen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decide on beef, as you remove the small styrofoam cup from the packaging you move yourself over to the counter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You mull over the options you have so far. Stay put and wait for someone to rescue you. Or follow the plane north. Food here isn&#039;t exactly infinite, but the water on the other hand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The sound of the kettle&#039;s switch flipping back to the off position snaps you from your thought.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Right now you guess you&#039;ll stay. No reason to abandon all this yet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pour the water into the cup and eat it, it isn&#039;t exactly the best thing you could have but it&#039;s quick and easy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Plopping yourself back into bed again you try once more to get some sleep, and it eventually comes as you drift away.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s morning again, your slumber interrupted by the shrill beeps of your alarm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s Seven AM, must&#039;ve forgotten to shut off the alarm last night.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Groggily you shuffle out of your bed and into your kitchen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anything&#039;s good, but you settle on some dry cereal for now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You think about last night and the plane, all you can do now is wait.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Head outside with a lawn chair you took from your garage.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Half naked, sitting in your lawn thinking about all the benefits of being in the middle of nowhere.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No more screaming children, no more taxes, no more cops, no more bills.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sit there for a good hour, watching the sun rise higher into the sky as you chill out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You go back inside and get dressed, sure there might not be anyone around to see you but you&#039;d rather not take that chance.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What if you somehow went back?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Doesn&#039;t matter anymore, you&#039;re here now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The thought crosses your mind that there hasn&#039;t been documentation of where you are.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you start thinking of all the horrid things that could happen to you, the sound of a helicopter in the distance interrupts you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You guess that the plane must&#039;ve seen your light and sent someone to investigate.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You set yourself up outside and start to think about where exactly you are.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The middle of a field of course but, there is no way that the people who wound up here managed to get aircraft.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thinking back to your reports you can&#039;t think of any airports or runways that were transported.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look into the distance and see it, it&#039;s a fairly large helicopter. You want to call it a &quot;Huey&quot; but you think that&#039;s not right.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait what if they aren&#039;t friendly like you&#039;d hoped?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You run back inside and put the revolver in your pocket.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You weren&#039;t exactly sure if you could fix it if it broke but you could sure as hell fire it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ve seen Die Hard enough to know how to use a gun.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Doing your best to conceal the bulge in your pants the helicopter&#039;s blades start to get much louder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You run on back outside, taking care not to get in full view of the side doors. Last thing you want to get is sniped.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It lands about fifty feet from the neighborhood and after the blades start to slow down enough one of the side doors open.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You head to your backyard and start hop the fence to greet them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you clamber over the fence you see one of the side doors open, two figures stepping out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Slipping off the top of the fence you walk over to them, you see that one of them isn&#039;t actually human.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They get closer to you, as a precaution you slide your hand down your pocket in what you hope was a casual move.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ve long stopped walking toward them after you noticed what was wrong with the picture, they close to about a seven foot distance.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Getting a better look at them you finally get to see what they are.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Leading the duo was a human, he was rather short. You&#039;d venture to guess maybe five foot seven? You couldn&#039;t really tell.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The thing following him you weren&#039;t certain as to what was but you thought it might be a dog or something like that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Except it walked on two legs, looked a little more like a human and was wearing clothes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You never were a Zoologist. But now you kinda wish you were.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The man makes his way up to you and introduces himself. &quot;Pleasure to meet you Anon. My name&#039;s Luke.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take your hand out of your pocket and extend it, in order to shake his hand. It&#039;s the polite thing to do after all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He grips your hand with a very firm grip and shakes it vigorously.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Who&#039;s that?&quot; You blurt out while pointing to the his tall canine companion with your free hand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He looks back for a second, then releases his vice like grip on your hand. &quot;That&#039;s Carolyn. She&#039;s a Blue Heeler, been with the BHA for a good four months now.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shifts in position slightly to face you better. &quot;Hello.&quot; You hear her say, albeit rather quietly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So, what exactly is going on?&quot; You ask, looking back at the helicopter behind them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well, clearly you have a lot of questions. So why don&#039;t you take us around your neighborhood while we explain.&quot; Luke says scratching the back of his head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Glancing back to the six foot beast woman you understand that this is going to take some explaining alright.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You beckon them to follow you as you make your way back to your backyard and over the fence</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Onto the road that interconnects the homes on the subdivision</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He won&#039;t stop talking, you&#039;re starting to wonder if he has to breathe.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Meanwhile his partner is listening intently. Watching you and your every move, it&#039;s starting to make you uncomfortable actually.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;An entire world just chock full of anthropomorphic animals. That&#039;s definitely going to take time to get used to.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Other than that it&#039;s mostly the same. Except now all this land is now yours and you&#039;re going to sell it for a small fortune.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wouldn&#039;t make too much from it all, mostly due to poor location. But it&#039;d still should be more than enough to get you on your feet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a while, you finish giving the tour of the area and you decide to take them to your home.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You do your best to avoid your neighbor&#039;s car and house but you&#039;re fairly certain that they noticed the glass everywhere.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That might take a little explaining as to why you smashed the windows of a car and a house in an attempt to get a gun.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe you shouldn&#039;t bring the gun up, at all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You figure you could pawn it off at some pawn shop.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s still looking at you, it&#039;s starting to unnerve you slightly but she hasn&#039;t exactly done anything yet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They offer you some fairly cheap housing near a quaint town, first two months free rent while you job hunt.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You accept and they decide to move your personal belongings for you to your apartment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s been about a day in your new apartment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You haven&#039;t gone job hunting yet but then again you haven&#039;t finished organizing all of your stuff properly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your phone begins vibrating, checking it you see an unknown number calling you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were pretty sure that you didn&#039;t give your number to the rabbit on the street corner.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whatever, you hang up and then stick the phone back into your pocket and figure you&#039;ll answer later if you get called again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The walls are starting to close in at this point. It&#039;s a surprisingly small apartment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Might as well take a stroll around the town, see what all you can find around.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You poke your head out of your room and into the hallway.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re on the fourth floor so you decide to swing over to the elevators because you can&#039;t be bothered to go down the stairs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You turn around a few corridors and eventually find your way back to the elevators.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Reaching the elevators you press the down button and wait for your ticket downstairs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a minute the elevator reaches your floor and a couple anthros leave the metal box.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Quickly you step inside, and press the ground floor button. But not before one of the two anthros that remained in the elevator presses the second floor button.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is going to take a while.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a couple minutes of waiting you finally reach the ground floor, the lobby isn&#039;t exactly filled with people. The attendant at the desk waiting for people to check in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You head outside into the relatively fresh air that the area provides, and make a walk into town.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It isn&#039;t really a long walk anyway. Occasionally you&#039;ll get an anthro who glares at you in a strange way but for the most part the walk is uneventful.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In the town there isn&#039;t much to see really, your occasional oriental restaurant and large corporate retail chains.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There are a couple of interesting sights to see, however. Such as a small fountain positioned in a small park out of the public view.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Cool place.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Halfway through walking around in the park your phone rings a second time. Taking a quick look you answer and hear on the other end.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hello? Is this Mr. Anon?&quot; You hear a soft voice on the other end.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sounds familiar actually.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uh, yes this is Anon. Who&#039;s asking?&quot; You ask.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It&#039;s Carol, I met you the other day.&quot; She replies.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Makes sense, but you thought you were done with the BHA.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Okay, so what all do I have to do now?&quot; You ask her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uh, you don&#039;t need to do anything else. I&#039;m just calling you to see how you&#039;re integrating and how you&#039;re doing.&quot; She responds.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Safe and sound from paperwork. At least so far.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yeah I&#039;m doing well so far, I haven&#039;t finished putting together my apartment yet but so far so good. How are you?&quot; You respond.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait shit you probably weren&#039;t supposed to ask back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;That&#039;s good.&quot; She responds. &quot;As for me? I&#039;m doing pretty good too I&#039;d say.&quot; She adds.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Alright then that sounds good. I&#039;m actually exploring the local area right now.&quot; You say.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You finding the locals to be treating you alright so far?&quot; She asks. Another question in an onslaught it seems.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s starting to sound like she&#039;s reading from a notepad or something like that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I haven&#039;t talked to many people around down here. I have gotten the occasional double take though. So that&#039;s good, I think.&quot; You answer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Okay, let me know how that goes. I&#039;m going to come by your house tomorrow morning to see how you&#039;re doing face to face.&quot; She says.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uh, that sounds good.&quot; You manage to spit out quickly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She did look kind of hot the last time you saw her. She had to have been 6&#039;5&quot; at least.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Bye.&quot; You hear her say.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You have a good one.&quot; You say before hanging up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh fuck you have to finish cleaning up the place and moving furniture by tomorrow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decide to stop adventuring the urban jungle and head home.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You follow the route you took to get to town and manage to get home in ten minutes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s a little rural but it&#039;s rather pleasant.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take the elevator back up to your room and do your best to pick up and move the furniture around in a pleasing way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s nearing six in the afternoon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ve spent at least four hours sorting things out with your room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re spent at this point. You decide to rest your eyes for a bit. It&#039;s well deserved, surely.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">from this point onward im fucking smashed, sorry if it&#039;s really bad</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wake up, surprisingly it&#039;s still dark outside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Checking your watch it&#039;s seven in the morning.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That sleep felt pretty good actually. The sheets kept you rather warm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Getting up you feel rather groggy and decide you better head to the kitchen for some breakfast.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Checking the pantry you see almost nothing you want to eat, but a couple of options are available.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some ramen you dug up from your old pantry that you remember getting at your old Kroger once.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You recall it being pretty good so you decide to make some.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You toss it in the microwave and head into your bedroom to throw on some clothes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ve put on some jeans and a long sleeved t-shirt you managed to dig up from the dresser.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At this point you hear the microwave beeping. Your ramen is done.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You head into the kitchen, grab the hot bowl in the microwave and sit down at your computer desk.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Living the dream.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Halfway into eating the bowl you hear a knock at your door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Heading to the door you check through the small peephole and see a dog like anthro standing on the other side.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looks like Car-, It is Carol.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hastily you open the front door, &quot;Hey Carol.&quot; You say as you open the door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She flinches and looks at you. &quot;Hi Mr. Anon.&quot; She says. &quot;Is it alright if I come in?&quot; She asks.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Right she needs to check out your place. She does look pretty different than how she looked the other day. She seems to be noticeably more talkative.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Of course, come on in.&quot; You say to her. Beckoning her into your apartment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She enters and you close the door behind her, following her into the kitchen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;This is my kitchen, not much to it so far but I&#039;m working on it.&quot; You tell her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take her to your bedroom/study and show her how you&#039;ve made do with such a small space.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A lot of explaining and her just nodding her head to what she can later and she asks. &quot;Alright, this looks good. Is it possible I can see where all you&#039;ve been in town?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Is this a date?&quot; You ask sarcastically.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see her shift in position slightly. She&#039;s uncomfortable, whoops.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uh, I wouldn&#039;t say so.&quot; She nearly stammers out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Alright you hit something, but you can&#039;t tell exactly what you hit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well just wait a moment while I quickly throw on some shoes and then we can head out.&quot; You respond carefully.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She leaves the room and waits for you outside the door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You put on your shoes and head out to the elevators with her, down into the lobby, and outside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Taking her the route that you had taken the other day you do your best to strike up small talk with her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So how long have you been working in the BHA?&quot; You ask.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I started about a month ago.&quot; She answers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That&#039;s really the only question you have, huh.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So how long does it take to get to town walking this way?&quot; She asks, staying rather close to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;About ten or so minutes at least, why do you ask?&quot; You respond.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Just wondering.&quot; She says.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decide against poking further, pushing forward into town instead.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There isn&#039;t much in town, really the only thing of note was the park, nonetheless she shows you some of the local hot spots and interesting points.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A small but real nice oriental restaurant and a pawn shop that you swear is just some dudes house just made to look like a pawn shop.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decide to take her to the park you found yesterday</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s something, right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s kind of foggy you&#039;re starting to realize, but that&#039;s fine though. You&#039;ve always kind of liked the fog.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Venturing up to a small hill that overlooks the park, you find a metal bench fit for about three people.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe one fat person.</div></li></ol>        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Wake up in your cozy twin
&gt;Fall asleep real late last night
&gt;Really late
&gt;You weren&#039;t sure exactly when but it had to have been 4am or something like that
&gt;Doesn&#039;t matter, you look over and see it&#039;s 4pm
&gt;It&#039;s a Sunday so you don&#039;t really have anything to do
&gt;You decide to hop out of bed after a few minutes
&gt;Your room is a mess
&gt;You can&#039;t even see the floor due to a thin layer of garbage coating it
&gt;That&#039;s it, today is cleaning day. Or at least you think it is.
&gt;Pop on your headphones and browse Spotify for a couple minutes
&gt;First thing that comes to mind is the Hotline Miami soundtrack
&gt;Get through about half the trash before you remember that you had guests
&gt;Wait, did they bail?
&gt;Setting aside the trash bag carefully you move around your small house
&gt;Mudroom? Nope. Living room? Nope. Bathroom? Nope.
&gt;Nobody&#039;s here.
&gt;You quickly go to your phone and text some dude who you think came over
&gt;You don&#039;t really know their names, most of the time it&#039;s a friend of a friend
&gt;&quot;Did you leave early last night? You kinda left me with a lot of trash to pick up.&quot;
&gt;Thirty minutes go by, nothing. You were pretty certain that he wasn&#039;t doing anything
&gt;Alright this is starting to freak you out. You run through and text a few more numbers but still, nothing.
&gt;Suddenly, an idea. You know where one of them lives so you&#039;ll just swing by.
&gt;Quickly you throw on some clean enough clothes and take your phone and your knife
&gt;You&#039;ve learned that it&#039;s better to take your knife with you and not need to cut a rope or open a box than to not.
&gt;Outside you notice that it&#039;s completely silent. The only noise you hear are the sprinklers in your neighbors lawn.
&gt;Normally you hear some kids screaming in the pool next door, it&#039;s welcome to not hear them but it&#039;s strange.
&gt;It&#039;s not a super long walk so you decide to take your time and enjoy the quiet for a little while.
&gt;About halfway there you think you notice that the road that comes into your neighborhood just isn&#039;t there
&gt;Not even any dirt where it was, just grass.
&gt;It&#039;s then that you notice that the entire neighborhood seemingly was just plopped onto the ground in the middle of nowhere.
&gt;Then you start to think of all the random disappearances that have been happening around the world. At first it wasn&#039;t anything important, just some missing people.
&gt;You were pretty sure that your wallet also vanished at one point.
&gt;After that it only escalated. You recall a mountain disappearing. That made headlines everywhere. Preceded only by a whole town just vanishing.
&gt;Soon after that a couple of insurance companies wanted to break out vanishing insurance, but quickly decided that paying for entire towns and mountains was too much money.
&gt;&quot;Aw, shit.&quot; You can&#039;t help but say under your breath.  
&gt;So after thinking about that for a while you decide to just break into a couple houses and stock up on food and water. Not like anyone&#039;s going to need it anymore.
&gt;The power was out for a lot of houses but thankfully you had decided to sink whatever money you had in solar panels. They wouldn&#039;t keep you powered all the time but you figure it&#039;d help
&gt;After cleaning out a couple houses of food and bottled water you head back to your house to dump it all off.
&gt;Seeing that it&#039;s going to get dark soon you decide to scope out the area with the last remaining bits of light.
&gt;Just south of your home you see a decently sized lake. Relief fills you slightly as you now realize that you have more water, even when you run out of bottled water.
&gt;You head back inside and resume picking up your room. Might as well do something while planning out your next move.
&gt;After picking up the trash that you&#039;re pretty sure you weren&#039;t responsible for you take the garbage bag and toss it into the trash bin.
&gt;You think to yourself that you&#039;ll come up with a way of handling the trash properly later. What matters now is figuring out what comes after dark.
&gt;You were pretty sure before that the dude that lived across the street was in a gang. So he&#039;d have a gun even if he wasn&#039;t supposed to, right?
&gt;Better check just in case you could snag something out of it.
&gt;Arming yourself with a flashlight alongside your pocket knife, which you didn&#039;t know how to use properly but it at least made you feel better.
&gt;You head back outside and across the pavement. Walking past his small car you guessed probably cost only a couple hundred dollars.
&gt;You reach the front door and check the handle, locked. To your left is a good sized window, you hadn&#039;t thought to bring anything to smash a window so you check around you.
&gt;Spotting a brick, just laying behind one of the support pillars. Quickly you snag it and move back towards the window.
&gt;Right before you smash his living room window you look back at his car, the thought didn&#039;t even cross your mind that he&#039;d keep a gun in there but it&#039;d make sense.
&gt;You smash the window anyway, and then head back to his car to figure out what all he kept in there. You try the driver side door, locked.
&gt;You didn&#039;t know what you expected trying the door but whatever. Taking the brick in your hands and swinging it against the window.
&gt;The car alarm goes off and you find yourself being oddly startled by the noise. Looking at the window you notice that you didn&#039;t quite break it yet.
&gt;Another blow against the cracked glass seems to finally do it in. Glass shards cover the driver side seat.
&gt;Quickly you scramble to find the button to pop the hood, this alarm is starting to get to you. You find it and pop the hood.
&gt;Running to the front of the car you remove the battery in hopes that it stops the alarm.
&gt;You didn&#039;t know much about cars, just that the battery was important and so was gasoline.
&gt;Thankfully the alarm stops assaulting you and your ears. Time to get back to searching.
&gt;You crack open the glovebox and all you find are some manuals for the car he has and some AA batteries, not exactly helpful.
&gt;Moving back you check under the seats, just some plastic bottles and trash. Bad luck.
&gt;You crack the trunk open in hopes of finding at least something. You walk out to the back of the car and check within.
&gt;Still nothing but a spare tire and a tire iron. You take the tire iron, at least now you can smash more windows.
&gt;Guessing that the car is a dead end you head back over to the porch, glass crunching slightly as you step on them.
&gt;Peering within the house you notice something. You can&#039;t see shit, it&#039;s dark inside.
&gt;Reaching into your pocket you pull out your flashlight. It&#039;s small and made of metal, the logo has been worn down over the years but you still remember the name, &quot;Slyde&quot;.
&gt;Turning it on, a very bright beam of light quickly changes the look of the room, inside you see that the front room was fairly clean. You step through, careful of the glass that still hung from the frame.
&gt;Inside you begin to check each room with care not to break more than you need.
&gt;Bedroom, nothing.
&gt;Bathroom, nada.
&gt;The kitchen however seemed to have different news. Inside one of the cabinets you see something just behind some boxes of cereal.
&gt;Pushing them aside you finally find something. It&#039;s a small revolver that could fit in your pocket.
&gt;Next to it is a box of ammo that says &quot;.38 SPL&quot;. You aren&#039;t exactly sure what that means but it looks like it belongs to the revolver.
&gt;You grab them both and head home for the night, familiarizing yourself with the firearm for a while before laying down again to try and get some sleep.
&gt;It&#039;s been a couple sleepless hours so far. Most of it is just you tossing and turning in bed, thinking about what to do in the morning.
&gt;Giving up on trying to sleep you get out of bed and head toward your window to try and get a better look outside.
&gt;It doesn&#039;t take long for your eyes to adjust due to the lack of light in your room.
&gt;Outside you don&#039;t see anything, but you do hear something. It isn&#039;t your neighbor&#039;s sprinkler either.
&gt;It sounds like a, plane? Quickly you rush outside and sure enough, you see a green and red light in the sky.
&gt;You sprint back inside and grab your flashlight, shining it at what you hope to be a plane.
&gt;It circles around the area for a little while and then it leaves, northbound.
&gt;You head back inside. Heading to the kitchen to quickly cook, something.
&gt;More than likely you&#039;ll cook some cup ramen.
&gt;Still tastes good enough. You put some water on boil and then go to your cupboard for some ramen.
&gt;You decide on beef, as you remove the small styrofoam cup from the packaging you move yourself over to the counter.
&gt;You mull over the options you have so far. Stay put and wait for someone to rescue you. Or follow the plane north. Food here isn&#039;t exactly infinite, but the water on the other hand.
&gt;The sound of the kettle&#039;s switch flipping back to the off position snaps you from your thought.
&gt;Right now you guess you&#039;ll stay. No reason to abandon all this yet.
&gt;You pour the water into the cup and eat it, it isn&#039;t exactly the best thing you could have but it&#039;s quick and easy.
&gt;Plopping yourself back into bed again you try once more to get some sleep, and it eventually comes as you drift away.
&gt;It&#039;s morning again, your slumber interrupted by the shrill beeps of your alarm.
&gt;It&#039;s Seven AM, must&#039;ve forgotten to shut off the alarm last night.
&gt;Groggily you shuffle out of your bed and into your kitchen.
&gt;Anything&#039;s good, but you settle on some dry cereal for now.
&gt;You think about last night and the plane, all you can do now is wait.
&gt;Head outside with a lawn chair you took from your garage.
&gt;Half naked, sitting in your lawn thinking about all the benefits of being in the middle of nowhere.
&gt;No more screaming children, no more taxes, no more cops, no more bills.
&gt;You sit there for a good hour, watching the sun rise higher into the sky as you chill out.
&gt;You go back inside and get dressed, sure there might not be anyone around to see you but you&#039;d rather not take that chance.
&gt;What if you somehow went back?
&gt;Doesn&#039;t matter anymore, you&#039;re here now.
&gt;The thought crosses your mind that there hasn&#039;t been documentation of where you are.
&gt;Before you start thinking of all the horrid things that could happen to you, the sound of a helicopter in the distance interrupts you.
&gt;You guess that the plane must&#039;ve seen your light and sent someone to investigate.
&gt;You set yourself up outside and start to think about where exactly you are.
&gt;The middle of a field of course but, there is no way that the people who wound up here managed to get aircraft.
&gt;Thinking back to your reports you can&#039;t think of any airports or runways that were transported.
&gt;You look into the distance and see it, it&#039;s a fairly large helicopter. You want to call it a &quot;Huey&quot; but you think that&#039;s not right.
&gt;Wait what if they aren&#039;t friendly like you&#039;d hoped?
&gt;You run back inside and put the revolver in your pocket.
&gt;You weren&#039;t exactly sure if you could fix it if it broke but you could sure as hell fire it.
&gt;You&#039;ve seen Die Hard enough to know how to use a gun.
&gt;Doing your best to conceal the bulge in your pants the helicopter&#039;s blades start to get much louder.
&gt;You run on back outside, taking care not to get in full view of the side doors. Last thing you want to get is sniped.
&gt;It lands about fifty feet from the neighborhood and after the blades start to slow down enough one of the side doors open.
&gt;You head to your backyard and start hop the fence to greet them.
&gt;As you clamber over the fence you see one of the side doors open, two figures stepping out.
&gt;Slipping off the top of the fence you walk over to them, you see that one of them isn&#039;t actually human.
&gt;What.
&gt;They get closer to you, as a precaution you slide your hand down your pocket in what you hope was a casual move.
&gt;You&#039;ve long stopped walking toward them after you noticed what was wrong with the picture, they close to about a seven foot distance.
&gt;Getting a better look at them you finally get to see what they are.
&gt;Leading the duo was a human, he was rather short. You&#039;d venture to guess maybe five foot seven? You couldn&#039;t really tell.
&gt;The thing following him you weren&#039;t certain as to what was but you thought it might be a dog or something like that.
&gt;Except it walked on two legs, looked a little more like a human and was wearing clothes.
&gt;You never were a Zoologist. But now you kinda wish you were.
&gt;The man makes his way up to you and introduces himself. &quot;Pleasure to meet you Anon. My name&#039;s Luke.&quot;
&gt;You take your hand out of your pocket and extend it, in order to shake his hand. It&#039;s the polite thing to do after all.
&gt;He grips your hand with a very firm grip and shakes it vigorously.
&gt;&quot;Who&#039;s that?&quot; You blurt out while pointing to the his tall canine companion with your free hand.
&gt;He looks back for a second, then releases his vice like grip on your hand. &quot;That&#039;s Carolyn. She&#039;s a Blue Heeler, been with the BHA for a good four months now.&quot;
&gt;She shifts in position slightly to face you better. &quot;Hello.&quot; You hear her say, albeit rather quietly.
&gt;&quot;So, what exactly is going on?&quot; You ask, looking back at the helicopter behind them.
&gt;&quot;Well, clearly you have a lot of questions. So why don&#039;t you take us around your neighborhood while we explain.&quot; Luke says scratching the back of his head.
&gt;Glancing back to the six foot beast woman you understand that this is going to take some explaining alright.
&gt;You beckon them to follow you as you make your way back to your backyard and over the fence
&gt;Onto the road that interconnects the homes on the subdivision
&gt;He won&#039;t stop talking, you&#039;re starting to wonder if he has to breathe.
&gt;Meanwhile his partner is listening intently. Watching you and your every move, it&#039;s starting to make you uncomfortable actually.
&gt;An entire world just chock full of anthropomorphic animals. That&#039;s definitely going to take time to get used to.
&gt;Other than that it&#039;s mostly the same. Except now all this land is now yours and you&#039;re going to sell it for a small fortune.
&gt;You wouldn&#039;t make too much from it all, mostly due to poor location. But it&#039;d still should be more than enough to get you on your feet.
&gt;After a while, you finish giving the tour of the area and you decide to take them to your home.
&gt;You do your best to avoid your neighbor&#039;s car and house but you&#039;re fairly certain that they noticed the glass everywhere.
&gt;That might take a little explaining as to why you smashed the windows of a car and a house in an attempt to get a gun.
&gt;Maybe you shouldn&#039;t bring the gun up, at all.
&gt;You figure you could pawn it off at some pawn shop.
&gt;She&#039;s still looking at you, it&#039;s starting to unnerve you slightly but she hasn&#039;t exactly done anything yet.
&gt;Yet.
&gt;They offer you some fairly cheap housing near a quaint town, first two months free rent while you job hunt.
&gt;You accept and they decide to move your personal belongings for you to your apartment.
 
&gt;It&#039;s been about a day in your new apartment.
&gt;You haven&#039;t gone job hunting yet but then again you haven&#039;t finished organizing all of your stuff properly.
&gt;Your phone begins vibrating, checking it you see an unknown number calling you.
&gt;You were pretty sure that you didn&#039;t give your number to the rabbit on the street corner.
&gt;Whatever, you hang up and then stick the phone back into your pocket and figure you&#039;ll answer later if you get called again.
&gt;The walls are starting to close in at this point. It&#039;s a surprisingly small apartment.
&gt;Might as well take a stroll around the town, see what all you can find around.
&gt;You poke your head out of your room and into the hallway.
&gt;You&#039;re on the fourth floor so you decide to swing over to the elevators because you can&#039;t be bothered to go down the stairs.
&gt;You turn around a few corridors and eventually find your way back to the elevators.
&gt;Reaching the elevators you press the down button and wait for your ticket downstairs.
&gt;After a minute the elevator reaches your floor and a couple anthros leave the metal box.
&gt;Quickly you step inside, and press the ground floor button. But not before one of the two anthros that remained in the elevator presses the second floor button.
&gt;This is going to take a while.
&gt;After a couple minutes of waiting you finally reach the ground floor, the lobby isn&#039;t exactly filled with people. The attendant at the desk waiting for people to check in.
&gt;You head outside into the relatively fresh air that the area provides, and make a walk into town.
&gt;It isn&#039;t really a long walk anyway. Occasionally you&#039;ll get an anthro who glares at you in a strange way but for the most part the walk is uneventful.
&gt;In the town there isn&#039;t much to see really, your occasional oriental restaurant and large corporate retail chains.
&gt;There are a couple of interesting sights to see, however. Such as a small fountain positioned in a small park out of the public view.
&gt;Cool place.
&gt;Halfway through walking around in the park your phone rings a second time. Taking a quick look you answer and hear on the other end.
&gt;&quot;Hello? Is this Mr. Anon?&quot; You hear a soft voice on the other end.
&gt;Sounds familiar actually.
&gt;&quot;Uh, yes this is Anon. Who&#039;s asking?&quot; You ask.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s Carol, I met you the other day.&quot; She replies.
&gt;Makes sense, but you thought you were done with the BHA.
&gt;&quot;Okay, so what all do I have to do now?&quot; You ask her.
&gt;&quot;Uh, you don&#039;t need to do anything else. I&#039;m just calling you to see how you&#039;re integrating and how you&#039;re doing.&quot; She responds.
&gt;Safe and sound from paperwork. At least so far.
&gt;&quot;Yeah I&#039;m doing well so far, I haven&#039;t finished putting together my apartment yet but so far so good. How are you?&quot; You respond.
&gt;Wait shit you probably weren&#039;t supposed to ask back.
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s good.&quot; She responds. &quot;As for me? I&#039;m doing pretty good too I&#039;d say.&quot; She adds.
&gt;&quot;Alright then that sounds good. I&#039;m actually exploring the local area right now.&quot; You say.
&gt;&quot;You finding the locals to be treating you alright so far?&quot; She asks. Another question in an onslaught it seems.
&gt;It&#039;s starting to sound like she&#039;s reading from a notepad or something like that.
&gt;&quot;I haven&#039;t talked to many people around down here. I have gotten the occasional double take though. So that&#039;s good, I think.&quot; You answer.
&gt;&quot;Okay, let me know how that goes. I&#039;m going to come by your house tomorrow morning to see how you&#039;re doing face to face.&quot; She says.
&gt;What.
&gt;&quot;Uh, that sounds good.&quot; You manage to spit out quickly.
&gt;She did look kind of hot the last time you saw her. She had to have been 6&#039;5&quot; at least.
&gt;&quot;Bye.&quot; You hear her say.
&gt;&quot;You have a good one.&quot; You say before hanging up.
&gt;Oh fuck you have to finish cleaning up the place and moving furniture by tomorrow.
&gt;You decide to stop adventuring the urban jungle and head home.
&gt;You follow the route you took to get to town and manage to get home in ten minutes.
&gt;It&#039;s a little rural but it&#039;s rather pleasant.
&gt;You take the elevator back up to your room and do your best to pick up and move the furniture around in a pleasing way.
&gt;It&#039;s nearing six in the afternoon.
&gt;You&#039;ve spent at least four hours sorting things out with your room.
&gt;You&#039;re spent at this point. You decide to rest your eyes for a bit. It&#039;s well deserved, surely.
 
from this point onward im fucking smashed, sorry if it&#039;s really bad
 
&gt;You wake up, surprisingly it&#039;s still dark outside.
&gt;Checking your watch it&#039;s seven in the morning.
&gt;That sleep felt pretty good actually. The sheets kept you rather warm.
&gt;Getting up you feel rather groggy and decide you better head to the kitchen for some breakfast.
&gt;Checking the pantry you see almost nothing you want to eat, but a couple of options are available.
&gt;Some ramen you dug up from your old pantry that you remember getting at your old Kroger once.
&gt;You recall it being pretty good so you decide to make some.
&gt;You toss it in the microwave and head into your bedroom to throw on some clothes.
&gt;You&#039;ve put on some jeans and a long sleeved t-shirt you managed to dig up from the dresser.
&gt;At this point you hear the microwave beeping. Your ramen is done.
&gt;You head into the kitchen, grab the hot bowl in the microwave and sit down at your computer desk.
&gt;Living the dream.
&gt;Halfway into eating the bowl you hear a knock at your door.
&gt;Heading to the door you check through the small peephole and see a dog like anthro standing on the other side.
&gt;Looks like Car-, It is Carol.
&gt;Hastily you open the front door, &quot;Hey Carol.&quot; You say as you open the door.
&gt;She flinches and looks at you. &quot;Hi Mr. Anon.&quot; She says. &quot;Is it alright if I come in?&quot; She asks.
&gt;Right she needs to check out your place. She does look pretty different than how she looked the other day. She seems to be noticeably more talkative.
&gt;&quot;Of course, come on in.&quot; You say to her. Beckoning her into your apartment.
&gt;She enters and you close the door behind her, following her into the kitchen.
&gt;&quot;This is my kitchen, not much to it so far but I&#039;m working on it.&quot; You tell her.
&gt;You take her to your bedroom/study and show her how you&#039;ve made do with such a small space.
&gt;A lot of explaining and her just nodding her head to what she can later and she asks. &quot;Alright, this looks good. Is it possible I can see where all you&#039;ve been in town?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Is this a date?&quot; You ask sarcastically.
&gt;You can see her shift in position slightly. She&#039;s uncomfortable, whoops.
&gt;&quot;Uh, I wouldn&#039;t say so.&quot; She nearly stammers out.
&gt;Alright you hit something, but you can&#039;t tell exactly what you hit.
&gt;&quot;Well just wait a moment while I quickly throw on some shoes and then we can head out.&quot; You respond carefully.
&gt;She leaves the room and waits for you outside the door.
&gt;You put on your shoes and head out to the elevators with her, down into the lobby, and outside.
&gt;Taking her the route that you had taken the other day you do your best to strike up small talk with her.
&gt;&quot;So how long have you been working in the BHA?&quot; You ask.
&gt;&quot;I started about a month ago.&quot; She answers
&gt;That&#039;s really the only question you have, huh.
&gt;&quot;So how long does it take to get to town walking this way?&quot; She asks, staying rather close to you.
&gt;&quot;About ten or so minutes at least, why do you ask?&quot; You respond.
&gt;&quot;Just wondering.&quot; She says.
&gt;You decide against poking further, pushing forward into town instead.
&gt;There isn&#039;t much in town, really the only thing of note was the park, nonetheless she shows you some of the local hot spots and interesting points.
&gt;A small but real nice oriental restaurant and a pawn shop that you swear is just some dudes house just made to look like a pawn shop.
&gt;You decide to take her to the park you found yesterday
&gt;It&#039;s something, right?
&gt;It&#039;s kind of foggy you&#039;re starting to realize, but that&#039;s fine though. You&#039;ve always kind of liked the fog.
&gt;Venturing up to a small hill that overlooks the park, you find a metal bench fit for about three people.
&gt;Maybe one fat person.</textarea>
