        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Two short, curvy cats are faced with a dilemma:
&gt;They&#039;ve heard that humans only like tall cat women.
&gt;But, one of them has an epiphany after watching some human media. One purchase of an XL trench coat later, and the two wily cats are on their way.
&gt;There&#039;s just one problem...
&gt;The one on the bottom is a bit more forward than her friend.
&gt;Imagine their unsuspecting date&#039;s shock when he feels someone unzip his fly and start licking his cock while his date is still sitting across from him and chatting away.

&gt;After scaring off their first date, the two get into a heated discussion as to what to do next time.
&gt;Decide to swap positions.
&gt;Problem with that is... the previous &quot;face&quot; isn&#039;t as strong as her pervy friend.
&gt;Their new date is convinced that &quot;she&#039;s&quot; drunk, as the duo sway and nearly topple multiple times.
&gt;Everything goes pretty well; the new face is more openly flirty and suggestive than the other, but this human seems receptive.
&gt;Everything goes great until the human gets a little handsy...
&gt;He reaches up under the coat and freaks out when his hand touches fangs.
&gt;The two promptly fall over when he runs away screaming.

&gt;After that incident, the two agree that it&#039;s probably best to swap out positions depending on the situation.
&gt;Lucy is the stronger of the two, but also more prone to shameless teasing and getting a bit too forward with their dates.
&gt;Meanwhile, Lily is more understated, getting easily flustered at any suggestive implications. However, she&#039;s the more personable of the two, and was the one to come up with the trenchcoat disguise in the first place.
&gt;Tonight, they were to meet another human for dancing. Which presented another problem...
&gt;Lucy is by far the better of the two at moving around while carrying the other...
&gt;But her dancing is godawful. She herself once described it as &quot;like a ragdoll being put through a blender that&#039;s being put into a bigger blender.&quot;
&gt;Lily, however, is far more graceful on her feet... but is nearly incapable of carrying Lucy without stumbling around.
&gt;They&#039;re stumped as to what to do...
&gt;Too late to cancel now. Lily reluctantly takes up the lower position as they head off to meet their date.
&gt;Immediately, he seems impressed by their height... well, two 4&#039; women standing on each other&#039;s shoulders would probably be pretty impressive to a 6&#039; man.
&gt;Unfortunately, he&#039;s less impressed by their wobbling, uncoordinated moves. Lily tries her best to dance with the coat obscuring her eyes and Lucy&#039;s weight bearing down...
&gt;But alas, she falls down, with her friend landing on her back roughly.
&gt;Naturally, seeing his date halve in size worries the human into calling an ambulance.
&gt;The Trenchcats end up having to scramble out of the nightclub, with Lucy shredding a nearby woman&#039;s top to serve as a distraction.
&gt;...unfortunately, the single shewolf&#039;s now-bare chest catches their date&#039;s wandering eyes in more ways than one.
&gt;Back at their shared apartment, Lucy and Lily shake their heads and sigh as the news reporters talk about a man arrested for sucking on a shewolf&#039;s breasts in public.
&gt;Better luck next time, ladies.</textarea>
