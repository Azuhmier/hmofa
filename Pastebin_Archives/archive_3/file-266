&gt;choppers meant more everything, ammo, letters, food, and sometimes bodies.
&gt;specifically fresh recruits who passed the draft
&gt;some of the boys protested under their breath, seeing a spotted triangle flying under the stripes
&gt;Camp Kinder, the hyena platoons main base.
&gt;those fresher than most stumbled off the choppers, while the commander strolled out casually and began directing the anxious staffers to the cargobays
&gt;and just as some feared, huge hyenas strolled around, some practically naked, no care for clothing like human women.
&gt;But their commander was a different story
&gt;dressed to kill in a pressed uniform and beret that hung onto one ear, almost over a cloudy grey eye
&gt;from her smile, she was already analyzing her new recruits as she marched over, flanked by two other hyenas
&gt;&quot;woo, I can still smell the lawn they cut you boy&#039;s from you&#039;re all so green! LINE UP!&quot;
&gt;a brief scramble from the privates before a perfect line was made
&gt;the hyenas moved down the line, name and rank, then where they would be stationed
&gt;until one particular man caught the commander&#039;s attention
&gt;&quot;Name&quot;
&gt;&quot;Konroy Nemo&quot;
&gt;the commander paused reading his sheet, a thin smile spreading across her muzzle
&gt;&quot;Callsign...Hyena?&quot; She snorted, looking from him to clipboard
&gt;the stone-faced private nodded &quot;Yes sir&quot;
&gt;the commander raised an eyebrow before squaring down to eye-level with him, tapping the top of his head with the clipboard as if measuring him
&gt;&quot;hmm, I dunno lad, you look pretty damn short for a Yeen, even a striped or male&quot; she grinned, baring all her teeth
&gt;&quot;whatcha think girls, he look yeen to you?&quot; She turned half to her following officers who struggled to keep a straight face

&gt;&quot; You ever tore a man&#039;s throat out? Drank his blood and snapped his spine while he drowned in his own fluids?&quot;
&gt;the new recruit&#039;s face never shifted, only a deep breath made his nostrils flare as he spoke &quot;No sir&quot;
&gt;She almost seemed impressed, or disappointed by his lack of reaction
&gt;But She would see how long he could keep the stoic act up
&gt;tapping his head again as she stood &quot;well let&#039;s see how you live up to that name then greenhorn, Road Burners, Tent 5&quot;
&gt;then the list kept moving, until she heel turned back to the line of men and women &quot;Alright Meat, make us proud, dismissed!&quot;
&gt;and the scurry began
&gt;most fled to their assigned duties, some dragged their feet
&gt;it was obvious who was pulled into the fight and who had some sense of duty to it
&gt;The commander watched as &quot;Hyena&quot; dutifully marched to his assigned tent
&gt;she briefly wondered why such a scrawny body would earn that particular callsign, before moving to address orders and moving to the map tent

&gt;Tent 5 was barely even a tent, more a circus of equipment and a large drape over everything
&gt;several large hyenas stared him down as he approached, all in various states of undress and longuing on top of their equipment
&gt;&quot;Look, new meat&quot;
&gt;Konroy smirked, and snorted &quot;You ladies look like you&#039;ve had enough Meat for 10 of me
&gt;all of them sat up
&gt;&quot; Well, well, this meat has a mouth&quot;
&gt;&quot;think you&#039;re funny Meat?&quot;
&gt;another hard snort &quot;No, I can&#039;t be funny, your faces alone would outdo any joke
&gt;one rolled her eyes, the others let out a growl with a smile full of fangs
&gt;&quot;Meat, we could rape you into the mud and leave you to die, you got a lot of nerve&quot;
&gt;Konroy snapped, a full stupid smile, almost showing every crooked, stained tooth in his mouth as he started laughing, deep chest laughter that left a little vibration in his chest
&gt;&quot;I am...I&#039;m sure you could! But I wouldn&#039;t mind if it got me out of this goddamn army!&quot; Barely managing to talk behind his laughter
&gt;they weren&#039;t sure what to make of him, but they hadn&#039;t even noticed how he had slipped through them until he disappeared into the tent
&gt;The inside was much like the outside, everything patched together and makeshift
&gt;And a bit of hyena fur here and there
&gt;tables, chairs, beds, all easily broken down junk
&gt;&quot;Hope you like junk Meat, it&#039;s how we move&quot; the women pushed past him, shoving him out of the way.
&gt;&quot;Sarge says nothing we can&#039;t remake when we get there, otherwise it&#039;s too heavy&quot;
&gt;Konroy smirked &quot;Pragmatic&quot;
&gt;&quot;yeah we&#039;ll see how you feel about it when you&#039;re walking through the jungle and you lose your bed&quot;
&gt;the group groaned and shook their heads almost collectively, moving around to their respective junk pile
&gt;one hyena with large sunglasses waved him over, a large rifle disassembled on the table before her &quot;so, Name?&quot;
&gt;Konroy
&gt;&quot; Hmm, Shades&quot; she grunted, then started pointing her thumb at the others, naming them.
&gt;&quot;Rot, Vomit, Echo, Shock and you already know Sarge&quot; 
&gt;Konroy blinked stupidly, looking and trying to memorize names to faces before he realized the Commander was standing in the tentflap
&gt;&quot;Right, however Hyena, you are to address me as Leader, Matriarch or just Queen if you&#039;ve fucked something up&quot; 
&gt;immediately she walked over to him, picking him up by his skull and lifting him off the ground to her level
&gt;&quot;You WILL keep up, or you will die here no one will come back for You, understood?&quot;
&gt;Konroy bit his lip, blood trickling down his chin &quot;Yes...sir&quot;
&gt;the Commander smirked and put him down gently before turning to the room &quot;This is Hyena, he will be our new blood since the pencil pushers don&#039;t like an entire hyena squad, keep your claws in and if I hear of any roughhousing without my consent, you&#039;ll get to deal with me&quot;
&gt;her voice was as cold as ice and he swore he saw two of them shiver before saluting &quot;Yes Ma&#039;am!&quot;
&gt;Konroy dug his nails into his palms, wincing 
&gt;Shades, closest to him, noticed before Commander walked away
&gt;&quot; You nervous?&#039;
&gt;he jumped and smiled &quot;its...a nasty habit, gotten me in trouble with humans a lot..&quot;</textarea>
