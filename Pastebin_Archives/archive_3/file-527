With her thick white eyebrows and dopey smile she reminds me of the shiba my family owned when I was a child</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hi! Hi! Hi!&quot; she repeats as she continues to invade my personal space with her snout</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I barely hear another door open before a cold authoritative voice shouts &quot;Steph! Down girl!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A big red ball goes whizzing through the air above my head attracting Steph&#039;s attention before making it&#039;s way down the stairs with her in hot pursuit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I turn to thank my savior, a feline about my height with black glossy fur from head to toe, long black hair tied in a ponytail, and a condescending smirk on her face.

That big ball of sweet and stupid you just ran into is Stephanie. She&#039;s a nice girl, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll like her. Me on the other hand? I&#039;m not so nice.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She chuckles to herself, seemingly very satisfied with how that came across</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I see you&#039;ve got some fun-killing spray there.

She&#039;s not too smart to let you come here all by your lonesome.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;A-a girlfriend&quot; I manage to stammer out as she sashays closer, flicking her tail around me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">-----------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well, I&#039;m sure she&#039;s a very lucky woman&quot; she says placing a hand on my shoulder</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Now, you should probably hide away in your room before our neighbors return.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uh..yeah, thanks...&quot; I say as I reach for my keys</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;wait, where are they?

If you ever nee-&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;mid-sentence Misty&#039;s interrupted by a loud howl from the remaining occupied apartment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her eyes go wide and she quickly shouts &quot;OKGOTTAGOBYE&quot; before shooting into her room with a speed I didn&#039;t know was possible.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">------------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;taking my cue from Misty I try to quickly unlock my apartment, I&#039;m not sure I want to know what made that howl that scared her so badly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I hear heavy footsteps moving towards the remaining door as I desperately fumble with the keys in growing panic</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;before I can get the damned things in the lock the door behind me flies open and a huge shadow overtakes me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I smell fresh meat!&quot; a husky booming voice cries</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A huge grey-furred hand grabs my shoulder and spins me around to come face-to-chest with a massive wild-looking wolfess</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she leans onto my door, her powerful muscular six-foot-something frame looming over me as she leans in to get a good whiff of me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;due to the size difference this also nearly presses my face into her chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Mmmm, you smell delicious little man.

        <textarea class="textarea">Apartment in Heat

&gt;just moved across the country for a new job
&gt;left the girlfriend at home to finish packing and moving out, I had to arrive early to start work
&gt;we decided that it would be a good idea to save up as much as possible so we could afford a home in our new city, so we rented an apartment in the &quot;bad&quot; part of town
&gt;well, not bad per se, but not entirely human. Plenty of people are still pretty prejudiced, but it means the rent here is great so I&#039;m not complaining too much
&gt;The apartment is in an old brick building, only a few stories tall and in good condition all things considered.
&gt;I enter and see a bear of a man - quite literally - slumped against the wall waiting for me
&gt;As I enter he stands tall and approaches, paw outstretched for a handshake
&gt;&quot;Hello, new friend, I am landlord Alexei! Velcome to new home! I hev key right here.&quot;
&gt;He looks around expectantly and his smile begins to fade
&gt;&quot;vait, you said it vas two, you and girlfriend, is wrong?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh, sorry, I must&#039;ve forgot to mention. She&#039;s still across the country getting everything ready for the move. I had to come early for my job.&quot;
&gt;Alexei frowns deeply
&gt;&quot;Is...is that a problem?&quot;
&gt;&quot;No, is no problem, except...Ve hev girls here who live alone and are in that time of year.&quot;
&gt;I don&#039;t understand what he means and the look on my face must make that plain
&gt;&quot;Heat, my friend, heat. If you hev girlfriend here she has scent on you and is no trouble, but if you are alone...&quot;
&gt;Alexei holds his finger up to say &quot;one moment&quot; and disappears into a small room that looks to be a storage closet of some kind
&gt;When he returns he&#039;s carrying a spray bottle with what looks like a large green apple on it
&gt;&quot;Here, I give this to you. You spray around door every day. EVERY day. No trouble. I must go now, wife does not like me to be at property for long time.&quot;
&gt;He shoves the bottle and key into my hands and quickly walks out the door, shouting &quot;GOOD LUCK MY FRIEND&quot;
--------------------------------------
&gt;clutching the spray Alexei gave me, I walk up the stairs to the second floor where my apartment is
&gt;this being a rather small building there appear to only be four apartments per floor, two on each side
&gt;Almost the instant I step up onto the floor a small bang emanates from one of the doors and it soon flies open
&gt;&quot;NEW PERSON!?&quot; I hear an obviously excited and high pitched voice shout
&gt;A head pokes out of the door and looks about frantically before spotting me
&gt;My new neighbor squeals in delight as she bolts out the door to greet me...and smell me
&gt;She&#039;s about 5&#039;1&quot; with distinct orange and peach markings, a stocky build, and breasts much too big for her stature. With her thick white eyebrows and dopey smile she reminds me of the shiba my family owned when I was a child
&gt;&quot;Hi! Hi! Hi!&quot; she repeats as she continues to invade my personal space with her snout
&gt;I barely hear another door open before a cold authoritative voice shouts &quot;Steph! Down girl!&quot;
&gt;A big red ball goes whizzing through the air above my head attracting Steph&#039;s attention before making it&#039;s way down the stairs with her in hot pursuit.
&gt;I turn to thank my savior, a feline about my height with black glossy fur from head to toe, long black hair tied in a ponytail, and a condescending smirk on her face. In contrast to Stephanie&#039;s stocky and stacked build, this girl is lithe and petite.
&gt;&quot;Welcome to the neighborhood, new guy. That big ball of sweet and stupid you just ran into is Stephanie. She&#039;s a nice girl, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll like her. Me on the other hand? I&#039;m not so nice.&quot;
&gt;She chuckles to herself, seemingly very satisfied with how that came across
&gt;&quot;I see you&#039;ve got some fun-killing spray there. Got a girlfriend? A wife? She&#039;s not too smart to let you come here all by your lonesome.&quot;
&gt;&quot;A-a girlfriend&quot; I manage to stammer out as she sashays closer, flicking her tail around me
-----------------------------------
&gt;&quot;Well, I&#039;m sure she&#039;s a very lucky woman&quot; she says placing a hand on my shoulder
&gt;&quot;Now, you should probably hide away in your room before our neighbors return.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Uh..yeah, thanks...&quot; I say as I reach for my keys
&gt;wait, where are they? I could&#039;ve sworn I just had them
&gt;&quot;Looking for these?&quot; the cat says with a grin creeping across her face, twirling the keys around her finger
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t really need to use keys to get where I want, so you can have them back.&quot;
&gt;she tosses the keys to me and turns, running her tail along my chest and then my chin
&gt;&quot;Just be careful I don&#039;t steal you away too - I&#039;m Misty by the way. If you ever nee-&quot;
&gt;mid-sentence Misty&#039;s interrupted by a loud howl from the remaining occupied apartment.
&gt;her eyes go wide and she quickly shouts &quot;OKGOTTAGOBYE&quot; before shooting into her room with a speed I didn&#039;t know was possible.
------------------------------------
&gt;taking my cue from Misty I try to quickly unlock my apartment, I&#039;m not sure I want to know what made that howl that scared her so badly
&gt;I hear heavy footsteps moving towards the remaining door as I desperately fumble with the keys in growing panic
&gt;before I can get the damned things in the lock the door behind me flies open and a huge shadow overtakes me
&gt;&quot;I smell fresh meat!&quot; a husky booming voice cries
&gt;A huge grey-furred hand grabs my shoulder and spins me around to come face-to-chest with a massive wild-looking wolfess
&gt;she leans onto my door, her powerful muscular six-foot-something frame looming over me as she leans in to get a good whiff of me
&gt;due to the size difference this also nearly presses my face into her chest
&gt;&quot;Mmmm, you smell delicious little man. I could just eat. You. Up.&quot;
&gt;With this she snaps her jaws just inches from my face, causing me to flinch
&gt;&quot;Hahaha, I love the timid ones. I think you and I are going to have a lot of fun.&quot;
&gt;She roughly grabs my junk, eliciting a squeal at a pitch higher than I thought I could make
&gt;&quot;What say we skip the foreplay and just get right down to business, hmm?&quot;
&gt;Finally snapping out of my &quot;dear-in-a-headlights&quot; routine, I push her hand away and slink out from under her
&gt;&quot;Actually, I have a girlfriend, so-&quot;
&gt;&quot;I wasn&#039;t asking if you had a girlfriend little man!&quot; the wolf shouts as she crouches down, hands raised like she&#039;s about to pounce me, &quot;I was telling you. You and Valerie are gonna have some fun.&quot;
&gt;scared out of my mind but finally remembering the bottle in my possession, I spray it at her face as she slowly approaches
&gt;&quot;OH, JESUS FUCK&quot; she cries, recoiling and holding her snout
&gt;&quot;FUCKING ALEXEI AND HIS FUCKING BULLSHIT SPRAY GOD DAMNIT&quot;
&gt;She shakes her head about wildly trying to rid herself of the scent as a familiar voice approaches from the stairs
&gt;&quot;Hey! Leave him alone!&quot; I hear Stephanie shout as she gets between me and Valerie
&gt;the two of them start trading growls, howls and insults as I take the opportunity to finally unlock my apartment and slink inside
&gt;Seven days until my girlfriend arrives and, according to Alexei, I can relax.
&gt;It&#039;s going to be a rough week.
