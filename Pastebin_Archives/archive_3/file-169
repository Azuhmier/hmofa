&gt;Ae Anon.
&gt;Be soldier.
&gt;Be Canadian in Afghanistan.
&gt;Be 20** or whatever year.
&gt;Fucking towelhead central.
&gt;First tour and it’s shit.
&gt;You expected to be a Bagram or some other kind of base that was nice and safe.
&gt;Nope.jpg
&gt;Stuck in the middle of a fucking desert with a single road for supplies and the odd raggo that got lost.
&gt;Hescos all around the outside with another trench-line twenty meters out with a secondary frag-wall right behind it.
&gt;Not getting shot at will drive you insane with boredom.
&gt;We already ran out of crayons.
&gt;We have crates, fucking crates, of cigarettes being shipped in with each supply run.
&gt;One of the guys tried to convince some of the engineers to run a network cable out here.
&gt;At this point, we don’t even have our pimarys loaded.
&gt;There’s no point.
&gt;We keep the eight secondaries, for twelve people, loaded and racked but fuck everything else.
&gt;We had a mortar pit in the center of the compound that we took over.
&gt;We run rounds though it every now and again but literally nothing else.
&gt;Again, this shit sucks.

&gt;Right on the border of blue turf.
&gt;Also, nothing of value to either side here.
&gt;The last time that we got shot at was three months ago.
&gt;Not that you mind but FUCK!
&gt;Some excitement is always nice.
&gt;Mostly we just fuck around and “hold the line” as we were ordered.
&gt;We don’t mind though.
&gt;We get enough acton. 
&gt;Not all of it from RPGs and trigger-pulling either.
&gt;We get more anthro pussy here than the entire battalion.
&gt;Anthros.
&gt;Anthros everywhere.
&gt;Since they were not even thought of as people in this area they were heavily abused.
&gt;Some were feral but most were just trying to get by.
&gt;The great part?
&gt;Most of them were female. Like 80-10 female to male anthro ratio.
&gt;Probably because of towelhead slavery or some shit that made the males favorable to keep.
&gt;The best part?
&gt;After a few of the boys had introduced these girls to human cock, they could not get enough.
&gt;Lots of species in all different shapes and sizes.
&gt;You’re not too big into the equines and you’ll never be able to get the sound of an orgasiming camel out of you mind.
&gt;The canines, though, are out of this world.
&gt;Tall, lithe and sexy all over.

&gt;But sadly, you were on guard this evening.
&gt;In one of the two guard towers that are at opposite corners of the compound.
&gt;There’s a .50 in the other.
&gt;You get nothing except for a few extra ammo cans and a case of beer that someone stashed up here.
&gt;It’s already been drank.
“Motherfucking bullshit.” You mutter.
&gt;You can hear your BB, Riley, having his way with a couple of wildcat sisters that stopped by to hock shit that they stole.
&gt;Fucking gypsies.
&gt;You spy an Afghan hound anthro, one that frequents you, being admitted into the walls and making a B-line for you.
&gt;You’re sitting beside one of the only two human females in the FOB.
&gt;Her name is Cassandra and she’s telling you about the plight of women in the world.
&gt;”The sounds that they’re making are serving to only enforce his distorted view of masculinity and-”
“Shut the fuck up.”
&gt;”How dare you-”
“No, actually shut the fuck up. I have been listening to you for three hours. I have been on guard for two. Shut up. I swear to god, I will perform an autopsy on your still conscious body!”
&gt;”Why are you such a misogynist, oh my god, check your privilege.”
&gt;You stand up.
&gt;You turn to the ramp leading out of the tower.
“Out.”
&gt;”What do you mean out? You can’t force me out.”
&gt;You grab the zipper to your fatigues.
&gt;It’s a little difficult to get to from the mountain of bullshit kevlar and magazines in your way.
&gt;”What the fuck are you doing?”
“I’m getting a blowjob. You?”
&gt;She quickly picks up her shit and nearly sprints down the ramp.

&gt;The hound let you name her.
&gt;You call her Sierra
&gt;”Hey!” she calls up to you.
“Hey Sierra! Come on up. Remember the rules?”
&gt;”I remember. Head below the sandbag, don’t take anything and when the shooting starts, lay flat and don&#039;t move till you get me.”
“Excellent! Come on up here.”
&gt;She’s wearing a hemp cloth tunic and a skirt of some bright red fabric.
&gt;They contrast quite nicely off her light-beige fur.
&gt;She has blonde hair that blends seamlessly with the fur on her ears and bright green eyes.
&gt;When she got up the ramp, she ducked her head below the wall, hiked up her skirt past her knees and dropped.
&gt;She quickly began crawling toward you.
&gt;You got one of those shitty folding chairs and set it as close as you can to the reinforced wall and sat down.
&gt;She got in between your legs with her hands on your thighs, eagerly looking at you.
&gt;You fumble and fuck with your fatigues until you could spring your cock out.
&gt;Picking up your C7, you set the hand guard on the top of the wall and press the butt into your shoulder.

&gt;Sierra instantly engulfs your dick, right to the base.
&gt;Her throat tightly constricts around your length and you gasp in pleasure.
&gt;She moans as she quickly bobs on your dick, rolling her tongue along the base and gently grinding her teeth on the root of your cock.
&gt;She’s good, as she pulls back and gives a hard pull on the head before sliding it back down her throat.
&gt;She pulls it out of her throat and then uses her mouth to suck and rub all over your shaft while the back of her tongue massages the top of your second head.
&gt;She continued for a time, gently bobbing, sucking and massaging before she picked up the pace.
&gt;You could feel your shaft twitching in her mouth.
“Hey, Sierra? I’m going to cum.”
&gt;She tried to lift off your shaft.
“Nope. You stay right there.”
&gt;She seemed to like that as her grip on your body tightened and her sucking got harder and faster.
&gt;Sierra pushed your shaft down her throat again, sucking hard and that’s when it happened.
&gt;You came with the power you didn’t think possible.
&gt;You pulsed and could feel the cum rising up your dick.
&gt;The first rope comes out so fast the dog chokes.
&gt;Then the second, basting her throat.
&gt;Ten more pulses and ten more shots of sticky human semen coat her throat, mouth and tongue.
&gt;Then she sucks one more time and you can feel a little extra cum being sucked out of you.
&gt;You sit back and give her some scratchies.
“You’re a good girl Sierra. Good job. That was fucking incredible.”
&gt;She pops your dick out and begins putting it away.
&gt;”No problem. I love how you taste! When are you done?”
“Few hours left still. I’m out when the sun goes down.”
&gt;”Do you mind if I stay here with you?”
“Not in the tower, you’re not.”
&gt;”I meant here. In the base.”
“I don’t have a problem but you’ll have to ask the Cap.”
&gt;”Alright. I’ll see you tonight, then.”
&gt;She crawls her way out of the tower and you follow her with your eyes.
&gt;At the last moment, she flips her skirt up and you can see that she’s not wearing any underwear.

&gt;Tonight’s going to be a good night indeed.</textarea>
