Imagine that? Sending out for swordwork, just to get your hands on fine drink.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re not sure you understand - &quot;We aren&#039;t here for the soldiers?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She offers a warm chuckle, and amidst her leather, you can&#039;t help but notice the gentle bounce of her massive breasts - you try to push the thought aside for now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We always are. But it&#039;s the brew we were sent for. Men will die so other men will drink. The most northern thing I&#039;ve encountered in all my years in these sunsoaked </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">lands.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You clasp the sword tight, like it might reveal some additional wisdom</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The thought is strange, but death is trivial to you now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even then, the exsanguination of foes was a holy lesson amongst the Swordkeepers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now their own soldiers would die by the lesson</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Perhaps some of the stuff is lost during combat,&quot; you say</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If there&#039;s one thing you learned about Agwyn, she loved her drink</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Another warm chuckle, and her hand comes to grip the greatsword&#039;s hilt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You kneel and offer it dutifully, while she nudges you playfully</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We might just &#039;lose&#039; the whole batch and barrel.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Morning brought tides of blood and scream</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are only a keeper of weapons, not a soldier, so you are left to watch, and watch you do</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The brutalization of men through violence is its own terrible philosophy, one you try not to think much on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But it plays out much the same - bodies are hewn and limbs separate like snapped branches</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Blossoms of scarlet mist erupt from the once living</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Stink and entrails litter the once calm grass below, and fire springs out in searing pillars</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Solarian loyalists are caught off guard, and Agywn&#039;s mercs do their bloodwork with such casual, efficient indifference</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Agwyn is something else - a terror in her own right</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She swings the ugly flank of black metal with horrifying ease and each foe caught in its proximity simply turns to fleshy tendrils</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can&#039;t see too much from the brush, but you&#039;re quite sure one of her swings bifurcates a man from shoulder to groin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Despite all the testaments and preachings, you find that all sword work is the same; there&#039;s no holiness to it, not as the Swordkeepers said</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Soon, it&#039;s over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It seems to have gone by in a flash, and you&#039;re grateful</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You return to camp, prepping supplies to clean the litter of blood-drenched weapons</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to ignore all the death, and think of one thought which always brings you comfort: Agwyn in her tent, prone and nake, nursing a mug of brew</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The mercs take their time coming back - most are cheery, having carried off bags and kegs of loot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The promised brew is among them, and you notice many cherish the fat barrels with greedy desire</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some, you overhear, are protesting with Agwyn, wishing to keep the stuff</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She is insistent, however, the job be done as instructed, much to the chagrin of her quarry</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But, she adds with a tempting smile that not *all* barrels were found during the assault</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This leads to cheers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are glad, even though you do not much partake; you&#039;re simply pleased to see Agwyn pleased</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While you tend to your work, wrapping swords in scrolls of testament parchment, she finishes talking with the squads of men and women</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Soon, she comes to you, and you feel yourself excite at her approach - she has always been fond company</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The northmare casts you a fine grin, and she lodges her mighty titanshredder into the heard</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her snowy gray fur is spatterd with splashes of crimson, and her leathers are torn in a few places</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can spy her cleavage, shown in excess, hardly held by the remains of her attire, while her thigh is quite exposed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shiver, but not from the cold chill</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;A fine fight?&quot;

        <textarea class="textarea">THE MARE WITH THE BLACK BLADE
By Laz Briar

&gt;You are the bladekeeper of the northmare Agwyn
&gt;Long have you been dutiful to her, and the titanic weapon
&gt;Months have transpired and your job is the same: care for her armaments and, by doing so, care for her
&gt;At first, you were promised to the great Brightswords of Sol Solaria, but internal conflict threw you into the service of the mare and her mercenary band
&gt;Now you spend your days at her side, administrating care to her greatsword
&gt;Today is especially important, as the mercenaries will take strike at a small camp of Solarian loyalists
&gt;Thus, you must make sure the greatsword is in fine order, along with all of Agwyn&#039;s supplies

&gt;Morning has scarcely breached the dull, grassy horizon, but you&#039;re hard at work
&gt;Within a hastily drawn tent, you&#039;ve laid out the flank of obsidian metal, oiling it carefully
&gt;It&#039;s a terrifying object, easily your size, where the head is terminated without point - rather flat, as an executionior&#039;s blade might be
&gt;It takes a mighty wielder to swing this dread object, and such is Agwyn
&gt;Even with your time spent with her, you&#039;re still bewildered at her strength and stature
&gt;She claims lineage from the cold, desperate northern lands of Vyskaal
&gt;It&#039;s a terrifying place, you&#039;re told, littered with giants and wolfmen and the ruinations of old gods
&gt;As such, it makes sense she could possess this weapon
&gt;Like the sword, she&#039;s hands higher than you, eclipsing you with a size perhaps eight feet
&gt;Her horsehair is a dismal ash grey sporting a black mane and cut tail
&gt;You liken her to an old parable: &quot;her buttocks could break backs and her breasts were like battering rams&quot;
&gt;You never say this aloud, of course
&gt;But she isn&#039;t just a warrior of the north, she&#039;s also a mare, and one you sometimes think too much of
&gt;You shake your head, losing yourself in thought again
&gt;This wasn&#039;t a time for games - you had to make sure the weapon was ready for service
&gt;You shiver inside the small tent, the morning whipped with a fine chill
&gt;Soon, the band would prepare to strike, and Agwyn would expect you to report to her
&gt;Spending some time, you finish cleaning the greatsword, even muttering a few Solarian prayers to bless the damned metal
&gt;Morning has come, and so has death

&gt;Finding Agwyn isn&#039;t difficult, considering her stature and reputation
&gt;She&#039;s atop the grassy hill, hiding amongst brush, gazing down at the camp of loyalists
&gt;You, with all strength, carry the greatsword to her, as though a knight might care for a child
&gt;She does not look to you when you arrive at her side - she finds your company as natural as breathing at this point
&gt;You remain silent too - you&#039;ve been chastised enough to know not to break her peace
&gt;Finally, she glances down to you
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s the brew they want, did you know that?&quot;
&gt;You aren&#039;t certain what she means - &quot;The brew?&quot;
&gt;A smirk tugs her lips - &quot;Aye, quite. Rare stock, vintage, so I&#039;m told. Rare, fermented blackberries you can only find in the southlands. Pilfered em&#039; straight off the 

rabbit folk.&quot;
&gt; &quot;Oh.&quot; You knew little of alcohol and meads and drink - the holy attendance of swords was more your trade
&gt; &quot;More than oh, anon. Imagine that? Sending out for swordwork, just to get your hands on fine drink.&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re not sure you understand - &quot;We aren&#039;t here for the soldiers?&quot;
&gt;She offers a warm chuckle, and amidst her leather, you can&#039;t help but notice the gentle bounce of her massive breasts - you try to push the thought aside for now
&gt;&quot;We always are. But it&#039;s the brew we were sent for. Men will die so other men will drink. The most northern thing I&#039;ve encountered in all my years in these sunsoaked 

lands.&quot;
&gt;You clasp the sword tight, like it might reveal some additional wisdom
&gt;The thought is strange, but death is trivial to you now
&gt;Even then, the exsanguination of foes was a holy lesson amongst the Swordkeepers
&gt;Now their own soldiers would die by the lesson
&gt;&quot;Perhaps some of the stuff is lost during combat,&quot; you say
&gt;If there&#039;s one thing you learned about Agwyn, she loved her drink
&gt;Another warm chuckle, and her hand comes to grip the greatsword&#039;s hilt
&gt;You kneel and offer it dutifully, while she nudges you playfully
&gt;&quot;We might just &#039;lose&#039; the whole batch and barrel.&quot;

&gt;Morning brought tides of blood and scream
&gt;You are only a keeper of weapons, not a soldier, so you are left to watch, and watch you do
&gt;The brutalization of men through violence is its own terrible philosophy, one you try not to think much on
&gt;But it plays out much the same - bodies are hewn and limbs separate like snapped branches
&gt;Blossoms of scarlet mist erupt from the once living
&gt;Stink and entrails litter the once calm grass below, and fire springs out in searing pillars
&gt;The Solarian loyalists are caught off guard, and Agywn&#039;s mercs do their bloodwork with such casual, efficient indifference
&gt;Agwyn is something else - a terror in her own right
&gt;She swings the ugly flank of black metal with horrifying ease and each foe caught in its proximity simply turns to fleshy tendrils
&gt;You can&#039;t see too much from the brush, but you&#039;re quite sure one of her swings bifurcates a man from shoulder to groin
&gt;Despite all the testaments and preachings, you find that all sword work is the same; there&#039;s no holiness to it, not as the Swordkeepers said
&gt;Soon, it&#039;s over
&gt;It seems to have gone by in a flash, and you&#039;re grateful
&gt;You return to camp, prepping supplies to clean the litter of blood-drenched weapons
&gt;You try to ignore all the death, and think of one thought which always brings you comfort: Agwyn in her tent, prone and nake, nursing a mug of brew

&gt;The mercs take their time coming back - most are cheery, having carried off bags and kegs of loot
&gt;The promised brew is among them, and you notice many cherish the fat barrels with greedy desire
&gt;Some, you overhear, are protesting with Agwyn, wishing to keep the stuff
&gt;She is insistent, however, the job be done as instructed, much to the chagrin of her quarry
&gt;But, she adds with a tempting smile that not *all* barrels were found during the assault
&gt;This leads to cheers
&gt;You are glad, even though you do not much partake; you&#039;re simply pleased to see Agwyn pleased
&gt;While you tend to your work, wrapping swords in scrolls of testament parchment, she finishes talking with the squads of men and women
&gt;Soon, she comes to you, and you feel yourself excite at her approach - she has always been fond company
&gt;The northmare casts you a fine grin, and she lodges her mighty titanshredder into the heard
&gt;Her snowy gray fur is spatterd with splashes of crimson, and her leathers are torn in a few places
&gt;You can spy her cleavage, shown in excess, hardly held by the remains of her attire, while her thigh is quite exposed
&gt;You shiver, but not from the cold chill
&gt;&quot;A fine fight?&quot; you query, smiling
&gt;It&#039;s not needed, her soaked weapon is story enough
&gt;&quot;AYE!&quot; she bellows. &quot;Solarian southmen aren&#039;t as hard as a stallion&#039;s cock, but they fight like stubborn bras on a wenches teat!&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s riled, you can tell, almost nickering
&gt;&quot;Far better than those paltry Gallers we caught off the river. These southers, ah! Had blades that&#039;d make me father blush!&quot;
&gt;She laughed, and her heaving tits wobbled a bit - you did your best to look busy then, finishing your work
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll feast on the finest hay and drink their blackmead, I will!&quot;
&gt;Oddly, a twinge of pride radiates in your chest - you like to see her succeed. . . even if it means the ruination of other men
&gt;&quot;You are a fine warrior, maestress Agwyn.&quot;
&gt;She made a face, pushing you 
&gt;&quot;Ahh FYE to that, anon! Agwyn, Ag, even mare! But never maestress! I&#039;ll cut yer tongue for such formality!&quot;
&gt;She roiled with a chuckled, though part of you wondered if she was serious
&gt;You relax, nodding &quot;Right, of course!&quot;
&gt;You want to say something else - you don&#039;t often get to catch her in fine, talkative moods
&gt;But she rolls her shoulders, turning - &quot;Anon, I&#039;ll trust you to take care of Her? She sung like all the bitch wolves of Vyskaal!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Her&quot; meaning the blade, and you nod &quot;Of course! My service is to it, and to you.&quot;
&gt;Agwyn smirked - &quot;Good lad.&quot;
&gt;She saunters off, and your eyes snag on her thick, plump buttocks, which even through leathers is quite noticeable
&gt;You block the thoughts because if you don&#039;t, you&#039;ll have another &quot;sword&quot; to attend to

&gt;Evening settlings in an obscenely peaceful fashion
&gt;Down the hill, carrion vultures and murders have set upon the entrails of the dead
&gt;Yet crickets and fireflies and pond frogs are dancing and singing
&gt;It&#039;s still a bit cold, but nothing a massive campfire can&#039;t settle
&gt;All the cutthroats are singing merry and drinking their weight in brew
&gt;You are snagged into the mess, forced to share mugs with rose faced brutes and narrow-eyed ladies
&gt;You don&#039;t mind though, and the ale helps you loosen a bit
&gt;The Swordkeepers were always so stifling and dutiful, pious about their traditions, hardly ingesting except for the occasional ritual wine
&gt;So, you aren&#039;t used to it, but you manage a horn or two, the liqud tasty, yet better, bearing a strange heat to it
&gt;They are strange, you find, so full of cheer despite the incarnations of earlier violence
&gt;These bands come from all stretches of Sol Solaria; vixens from the Shadewood, men from borders of Dagados, dogs of the Dying Sands
&gt;And you, a friend among them, a traitor to Solaria
&gt;You let yourself sing with them, bad as you are
&gt;Eventually, you find somewhere to sit, nursing another mug of brew
&gt;Someone approaches not too long after, a man with a pale white beard split into three tendrils
&gt;&quot;Oh anon, dun be squarin&#039; off to soon, the Mare wants to seez ya&quot;
&gt;You look up, surprised
&gt;&quot;Agwyn has asked for me?&quot;
&gt;He grins, showing off rows of gold teeth, sloppy in his motions
&gt;&quot;Oh yah, don&#039; keep er&#039; waitin, Mare ain&#039;t one for slowfoots.&quot;
&gt;He wasn&#039;t wrong; you thank him as he returns to the festivities, and you stagger up
&gt;You can&#039;t imagine what she wants so close to twilight
&gt;But you dare not keep the northmare waiting, so head to her tent, fever of the night rolling over you

&gt;You reach the massive set up, far larger and more luxurious than others
&gt;Entering, the nightfire and chill set aside as your eyes try to adjust to the light
&gt;It&#039;s difficult to see at first, as only a small cinder-born fire lingers 
&gt;&quot;Aaaahh, anon, good lad.&quot;
&gt;You see Agwyn
&gt;No, you SEE Agwyn, and your heart stops
&gt;She isn&#039;t in leathers or armors or ANYTHING
&gt;No, she is nake, lying prone on the floor at her side, nursing a frothing wooden mug of blackmead
&gt;She bears a grin, her cheeks are flush, and her immense, supple tits rest together, tented with nips as dark as the night sky
&gt;&quot;W-what? Agwyn?&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re at a loss, as it seems the idle thoughts of your dreams have coalesced before you
&gt;You&#039;re allowed to ogle her shapely form, which bears all curves of a mature, mother-made lady, yet carved with delicate sinew of tempered muscle
&gt;&quot;Aye, Agwyn. Stop ya starin&#039; and get in, swordcoach, been wantin&#039; you for a bit now.&quot;
&gt;You aren&#039;t about to argue with your leader, yet at the same time you&#039;re at a loss
&gt;Was it... the drink? She appeared quite tipsy
&gt;Yet, a part of you - actually - all of you, don&#039;t know that it cares, you could see where this was going
&gt;&quot;Yes?&quot; You step forward, closing the flaps behind you, and your loins already tent from the sight
&gt;&quot;Mmmmmm,&quot; she casts another smirk, eyeing your crotch, taking a long sip of the mug before tossing it away
&gt;&quot;You been doin&#039; fine, fine work, anon. Told you that She sang today. Not a hint of rust on the ol Girl. You&#039;re skilled. . .&quot;
&gt;Again, she referred to the titancutter, but your thoughts were distracted by her renewed motions
&gt;She sprang to all fours, crawling to you, licking her soft, plush lips
&gt;&quot;Now, I need to take care of you, eh? After all, ya&#039; gotta sword yourself.&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re stunned, watching the object of your affections and lusts shift toward you, thick hips swaying as she came to you
&gt;&quot;I. . . Agwyn. . . I don&#039;t know what to say. . .&quot;
&gt;You truly are at a loss - not that you plan on going anywhere, but no words from your teachings could possibly describe THIS
&gt;&quot;Ahhh don&#039;t be sayin&#039; nothin&#039; unless it&#039;s more, welp. Shut up and let the captain have her sword!&quot;
&gt;She cackled, and at once came to your tunic, snatching it down in one brisk motion
&gt;Your cock sprang free, and you were allowed to appreciate the true difference in size between you to, as even on fours, she was quite massive compared to you
&gt;&quot;Gah! Maest-&quot;
&gt;She abruptly gripped your cock and squeezed, staring up at you with an expression that could stop a devil
&gt;&quot;I told ya welp! Anything but THAT. Try mare why don&#039;tcha!&quot;
&gt;You wanted to nod, but couldn&#039;t as your shaft was enveloped by warm lips, wrapping around your tip with practiced ease
&gt;Agwyn mumbled in coaxing pleasure as she kisses at the crown, her tongue lapping in seductive, worship fashion, procuring pleased groans from you
&gt;She even granted your stones a gentle smooch, nuzzling them, breathing on them, letting her long pink rug lap away and cover them with sticky saliva
&gt;&quot;Oh fye by every sword, mare, gods, do not stop! Do more!&quot; you yell
&gt;She grins, hands to your waist, assaulting your cock with another barrage of suckles, slowly bobbing her head with rises and dives
&gt;She suckles the sides as well, kissing, leaving trails of saliva as your sex dribbles
&gt;&quot;Ain&#039;t much a sword, more like a spear. You&#039;re quite the big one for such a welp.&quot;
&gt;You shuddered, uncertain if she was truthful or just stroking your ego - either way, you cared little
&gt;Especially as she shoved the tip into her cheek, running it across her lips, drinking your scent
&gt;&quot;Good lad,&quot; she rumbled, pulling you again, now shoving you to the blanketed ground
&gt;You grunt, but don&#039;t move, astounded, ready to see what she had in store
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ve never wanted a thing so much in my life,&quot; you say, as she comes to you again, at your loins
&gt;this time, her thick, frothy tits come about to smother your pike, and you wince from astounding pleasure
&gt;&quot;Aye? Hah! What a thing for a welp to say. Probably losin&#039; your little mind. What was it then? Wanting to watch me fat arse bounce off that cock? Or maybe you lick your prick like I was servin&#039; a god? Precious.&quot;
&gt;The words rattle you with profound truths, and your mind is flooded with desire
&gt;Soon, the mare begins pressing her fat bust together, utterly crushing your mast with her plump front, stroking it with her grey cushions
&gt;Again, she sucks at your crown in between motions, while your gaze is treated to the labor of her bouncing front, the warm horsehair like hot silk
&gt;Instinctively you grind into the motions, helpless, desperate to sate this tingling urge radiating through your loins
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s it, swordboy. Might make a proper pole outta&#039; you!&quot;
&gt;Your hands toss out to grip her breasts, chancing - she only laughs, shoving them into your palms, where you twist and flick the black, hard nips
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ve never seen... tits so large!&quot;
&gt;Indeed, they were likely twice the side of your dome, and here they were, wobbling on your cock
&gt;She grins, and this sends you into overdrive - a surge of heat bursts from your bellend, and suddenly spurts of hot white issue flood between her pillows
&gt;&quot;AGGGGH!&quot;
&gt;Your body jerks and twists in ways you didn&#039;t know possible, a siege of harsh pleasure gripping your mast; it doesn&#039;t help that the mare continues to work you over, adding a twist of pain to the orgasmic pleasure
&gt;Agwyn laughs, and the axis of her breasts are soaked with your male essence
&gt;She rolls a finger over your tip, though you aren&#039;t quite softened
&gt;&quot;Not bad for a lad who polishes nothin&#039; but swords. Well, not done thankin&#039; ya yet.&quot;
&gt;By the gods, what else could she mean?
&gt;Now, the towering body of powerful mare looms over you, and her frame encompasses your own
&gt;You gasp, feeling her thick rump cheeks coax your pole between them, wiggling the veiny flesh as if to tease you
&gt;And it works
&gt;Her soft, black, sodden snatch rolls against your own, testing it with cleft kisses, while she pins you down by the shoulders
&gt;&quot;Hope I don&#039;t break ya&#039;, lad.&quot;
&gt;You are concerned? But also excited
&gt;&quot;What do you me-&quot;
&gt;You dare to question, but you&#039;re cut off as she sinks her hips over yours
&gt;You let loose a guttural, pleased groan as her tight, sodden walls snugly grip yours; you&#039;ve never felt anything quite so pleasantly comfortable as this
&gt;&quot;Aghnn, sword fits the sheath!&quot;
&gt;For a moment, she holds, enjoying the sight of you writhe within her, trying to buck into the plump pussy
&gt;You are, of course, at her mercy, being that she is so large
&gt;It is hardly a concern, however, as the mare begins battering your loins with a gentle barrage of heavy grinds
&gt;Her fat, plump buttocks wiggle with each slap, and you find yourself reaching for any part of her to grip
&gt;Her cunt is practically drooling with pre and saliva, allowing for quick, smooth motions, creating puddles of sex beneath your coupling
&gt;Her lips nip at your ear, and her hot moans twist into your brain, causing you to hump and groan in tandem
&gt;&quot;G-gods!&quot;
&gt;You have barely any words to muster; and how could you?
&gt;The mare quickens pace, how hammering her hips and thighs against your own
&gt;You&#039;re almost afraid she&#039;ll break something, as the power of her bouncing rises and dives is sexually terrifying
&gt;She hastens, to the point where things become a blur of fucking
&gt;You can&#039;t hold out, though, as you&#039;re not quite used to the temptations of flesh
&gt;Surprisingly, you feel a rush of nectar pour over your cock, but it&#039;s not you
&gt;&quot;AGH!&quot; Agwyn bellows with a moan, loud enough you&#039;re afraid someone might here
&gt;But no, she reaches peak and floods the coupling with her own juices
&gt;You hit yours as well, with surprisng gusto, bursting with a renewed river of seed
&gt;You clench her close, and she seems content to allow this, letting you rut into her satin cunt
&gt;After a while, the orgasm fades, followed by serene afterglow and panting breaths
&gt;&quot;Well aren&#039;t you full of surprises, lad?&quot;
&gt;Carefully, Agwyn rises, her pussy leaking with floods of seed and honey
&gt;You&#039;re quite battered and worn, watching her saunter to a table as she pours another mug of mead
&gt;You&#039;re winded, yet she hardly looks bothered
&gt;&quot;I can see why She&#039;s in such good hands. But I might have you at closer attendance from now on, eh?&quot;
&gt;You struggle to raise yourself, nodding
&gt;&quot;Yes, of course. I&#039;d serve you well.&quot;
&gt;Agwyn laughs, bending over, wiggling her thick, gray rump and spreading thighs
&gt;&quot;That so? Well, serve again. Get over here and start fucking, welp.&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re in disbelief, surely she wasn&#039;t serious?
&gt;But a quick flash from her devious eyes tells the story, and you dare not decline
&gt;Besides, you don&#039;t want to
&gt;Trembling, you steady yourself and rise once more, going to her thick haunches and working yourself to get hard again
&gt;Before you know it, you&#039;re desperately humping into that thick, fat buttocks, quite a challenge considering difference in size
&gt;It was going to be a long night

&gt;The night fizzled out in ways you dared not expect
&gt;Agwyn&#039;s appetite for you was insatiable, forcing you to fuck for most of twilight
&gt;Thank goodness for the blackberry mead
&gt;At some point, you fall asleep
&gt;In the arms of a goddess, no less
&gt;You&#039;re quite content

&gt;When morning comes, the first thing you see is the mare with the black blade
&gt;She&#039;s stroking along it with - as far as you can see - one of your holy cloths
&gt;When she notices you stir, she looks to you wrapped in blankets
&gt;She&#039;s still nake
&gt;&quot;Anon? Sleep well? Good. Come show me how you tend to Her. I want to see it first hand.&quot;
&gt;Though you ache, the pains are blissful
&gt;&quot;Of course, uh, Mare.&quot;
&gt;She casts you a smirk as you come to her
&gt;You spend the morning in her grasp, her breasts on your shoulders, her arms wrapped around you, watching you work with patient attention
&gt;The life of a traitor might not be so bad after all</textarea>
