class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Strange guns.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hope they’re lethal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Because if your escape fails,

fast.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is possible.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your progress, and you

class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;More time passes by.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can make him take a step.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A single step at a time, but you know he isn’t going all out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He smiles</div></li><li class="li1"><div

class="de1">&gt;You have to think about it, in the brief moments of the fight</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well no shit it’s Mia.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She really does mean a lot to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It may be just because you’ve been down here for so long, but..</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Dare you

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You keep your footing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He smiles at you again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”We’re done here.” He says, turning towards the door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”There is plenty more I can teach you, but I think it would be better if you teach yourself from this point forward. May our paths cross again, Mr. Anon.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You never did learn his name.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He left the room, and you are left in silence.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What is this sense of loss?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It is the same feeling that you had when you left home</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are grown, and you must make your own way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel emotion stir within you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hated him initially.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nothing but training and being beaten</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But each day was a lesson</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nonverbal, but it was a lesson.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Don’t be rash.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Be hardy and prepared.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Don’t think. Act.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He may have been being paid</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you feel as if you have the upper hand, now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re told to practice some more.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They gave you a few different practice dummies</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Punching bag, wing chun dummy, targets, the sorts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is where another realization comes to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can visualize attacks coming from these dummies, if you thought about it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was more than just practice, then.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This was training, even now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were eventually sent back to be with Mia.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;However, Mia seemed to be roughed up as well.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her dress was off in another side of the room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was attempting to turn on the showerhead so that she could clean herself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And her hands were coated in blood</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Mia.” You call to her, shocked.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her eyes widen, and her ears fold down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Mia..

Mia, who did you fight?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She doesn’t do anything for a moment, then writes:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Similar”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia then points to herself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It takes you a moment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then it hits you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Similar?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There are others like Mia?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Mia.” You take a deep breath</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She seems scared about your reaction</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”There are others like you?” you ask, looking up at her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anxiety fills you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia is risking her life.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She is fighting for her life.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is survival of fittest for her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What will happen to you if she dies?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your worries multiply.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Being so caught up in thought you forget Mia is still right in front of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look into her eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’m glad you’re alright, Mia.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your voice falters, and you go to hug her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She moves to return the hug, but stops</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Probably the blood on her hands.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You end up helping Mia wash down, and talk to her a lot more than usual.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her about human life.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;this seems to upset her slightly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once she dries off, and both of you finish eating, she puts the gown you made back on, and you willingly let her hold you as she lays down to rest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She really is like a big pillow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At least when she’s like this.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s the following day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your attitude has shifted dramatically</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With the risk of Mia dying at any moment, or during any day, you’ve began thinking about your escape plan.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have been cooperating long enough that you believe they don’t suspect you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;However this has hundreds of risks.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;First: You have no means to convey a plan to Mia, if you had one.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Second: You don’t know how far down you are. You are only aware of the elevator.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Said elevator is a fair size for the sake of easily moving construction materials or furniture. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;However there is likely a stairwell for the event of an elevator failure or fire hazard.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At least your logic tells you this.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You cannot be one-hundred percent sure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Today they decided they’d let you get your hair cut, and shave off any facial hair.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You just get your usual.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After this, you return to training.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While training, you realize something</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have been pushing your body for months, went through grueling punishment and martial arts training by that monk for what you would think was half a year</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yet your body does not fully reflect this.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While training, you call out:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Why does my body look like this, even after all of this training and practice?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Silence for a moment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear a man respond. Not lark, but his answer will do.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Muscle density. You are not a bodybuilder, you are a weapon.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Muscle density?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Explain further, please.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You continue your routine</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There is silence, and then the man speaks again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Given your diet and the exercise, your muscles are denser and generate more strength than a person who only cares about the SIZE of their muscles. If we were to compare you to someone like Phil Heath… Your muscle is more function, less for looks.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fair enough.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your day continues as normal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You return to the room, anxiety filling your

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re relieved.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia..</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You find yourself going over to her and hugging her instinctively, even if she is soaked with water.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You surprise her, but she returns the affection.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Again, you spend a lot of time talking to her, and you rest in her embrace</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;However, before going to sleep, you try to convey your ideas.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get her attention, but you don’t know if she particularly understands</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You restart to writing

you feel her heart skip a beat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That is reason enough for you think she understood you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;More time passes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually it seems hopeless.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t know where

class="de1">&gt;Even then there are guards with those strange weapons </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lark seems to never lighten up on you, either.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But eventually there was a slipup.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You and Mia see each other in the white hallways.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s cuffed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There are guards with her, too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is probably a safety protocol given last time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your eyes widen, and all it takes is one shout:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is the chance.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now or never.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Freedom or doom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”MIA!!!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your voice seemingly booms in the hallways.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In a split second, Mia’s fur seems to stand on end.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You think you see her muscles ripple beneath her fur</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And with a single, sudden pull, she snaps the chains of her cuffs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You spin on your feet, and send an overhand right punch into one of the two guards that were accompanying you </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your training comes to fruition.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The guard is sent back a few feet and falls over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You presume he is knocked out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You follow up the second guard with a kick to his side</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can feel and hear his ribs break through your kick</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No time to feel bad.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your blood is freezing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re horrified, and excited.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia has swiftly taken care of the guard detail that were following her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks at you expectantly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With no time to waste, you tell her to follow you and break into a full sprint.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You already feel free</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But it’s not enough.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You and Mia tear your way through an office room, quickly dispatching other guards that are caught off guard.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hit the elevator button to call the elevator to you, and sprint, looking for a stairwell</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia is following you, but looks a bit confused.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It has to be one or the other</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A stairwell would be better but you best prepare the elevator just in case</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Soon, you hear alarms going off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fuck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You snarl to yourself in agitation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was going to happen eventually.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You manage to find a stairwell, but the doors seem to have automatically locked</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Fuck!” you shout in anger</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; A robotic voice calls over the intercoms:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Dispensing airborne narcotic.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your heart plummets</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Mia, take a deep breath and hold it!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She does exactly this.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You proceed to run back to the elevator, but it seems to have stopped</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You start beating on the door in a defiant fury</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia calmly pushes you aside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;huh?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she then pries the elevator doors open</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well shit, you could’ve done that!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia reaches out and grabs you, holding you close</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What happened next caused you to almost shit yourself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia began leaping on the inside of the elevator shaft, climbing upwards.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you look down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The facility goes hundreds of feet deep</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And there are more just like Mia…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The thought makes you shiver.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You also realize that it was a multi lift system, now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were on a singular elevator previously.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Meaning-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s a clear fucking sprint for the exit! </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your heart races with excitement</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia seems to know what to do from this point</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She is almost flying at breakneck speeds up this shaft, and once she reaches the top, she slams shoulder-first into the elevator door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The alarm is still blaring, but Mia take no time to look around</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you’re glad she didn’t </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Soldiers were scrambling, and Mia caught them off guard</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The colors almost blur and you and hear and now tearing through more hallways</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And there it is!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Metal shutters were closing on windows</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nonono!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;NO!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Go, Mia!” You shout, in some unfamiliar tone that you had never yelled out before.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia is closing in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Suddenly, she covers you with her other hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel her suddenly fall, and hear glass shattering.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Another moment later, Mia has you grab onto her back as she starts sprinting on all fours</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quickly look around in disbelief.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Middle of nowhere</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Technically speaking, you are in a forest of sorts, but there is no civilization for miles. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel the wind in your hair</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear Mia sprinting</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It worked</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re free.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Atta girl, Mia!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your heart lightens</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Again, you find yourself shouting</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Though this time, in victory, and happiness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia has been sprinting for hours, though there is no sign of you being chased</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She eventually stops, only to signal for you to feel the nape of her neck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You do so, and you find small, stuff spot.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”What’s this?” You ask her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia then signals for you to hit her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”What?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She urgently repeats the motion</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Confused, you do so</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And hear a snap</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She seems relieved</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And she continues to sprint more</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it’s sunset, and Mia has finally stopped</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But to what avail</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see that her face has gone partially pink, and that she is panting, giving you a strange look.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Mia… Are you alright?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have a bad feeling building in your stomach</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She comes closer to you, still panting</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were leaning against a tree, getting ready to sleep</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gets on her hands and knees as she gets close </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your heart starts pounding</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;ohgodohgod</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She seems to stop for a moment, before leaning forward and giving you a full-on kiss</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Mmh!?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You physically panic for a moment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But why is it that you’re so happy?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;’Mia- this isn’t what I-‘</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You interrupt your own thoughts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is exactly what you were wanting</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had fallen for her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s not even human</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Is it wrong that the knowledge of that kind of excites you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s sweet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s smart</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fun to be around.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; You can understand how she feels.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had known her for so long, yet you wouldn’t dare realize these feelings given where you were.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you continue the list in your mind, you’ve taken your hands up to the sides of her head and return the kiss</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Considering how much bigger she is compared to you, it’s a bit sloppy, but the emotion behind it is still the same.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She slowly reaches to take one of your hands and move it to her breasts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You squeeze and feel in slow, fluid motions</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She whines quietly in support of your action.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quickly reach full mast</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually, Mia breaks the kiss and brushes your pants with a hand, looking at you expectantly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You, of course, strip down, your erection in clear view</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You blush, and scratch the back of your head, a bit confused as for the next course of action</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia, on the other hand, gropes herself and shutters, letting out a long breath, with a pleased look on her still pink face and her tail wagging.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her inner thighs are wet, you notice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She notions for you to sit back down, which you do.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She then affectionately nuzzles your neck, just below your jaw.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You respond by petting her, and rubbing her ears.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles and then moves down to your phallus</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel your face heat up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks up at you, and lets out what you are assuming was a giggle, before opening her mouth, taking your length into it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Holy hell.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia’s mouth is so warm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could process the factors of why, but you quickly sum it up to her being bigger, and thus producing more heat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She slowly moves her head up and down your shaft, using her tongue in ways you had never thought previously possible</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your body shudders with pleasure, as you let out a gasp and moan</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reach to take hold of her head, increasing pace</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But soon after this she pulls away, gazing into your eyes and licking her lips</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In an almost sensual way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She likes the way you taste.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She reaches out for your hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You let her take it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia pulls you closer as she leans down on her back, presenting herself to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reach and manage to take hold of her hips, and align yourself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia is yours.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You press yourself into her, and she lets out a pleased whimper in response</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Despite the size difference, she feels amazing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You start off slow, moving back and forth with gentle motions</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia continues to moan and give you lustful looks, egging you on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Giving in to the requests, you pick up your pace, and thrust harder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia seems to gasp, and grabs one of her breasts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Ahhn…” she lets out a whine</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You continue at this pace, and she seems to quickly reach her climax</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shudders for a moment, and reaches to pull you close, propping herself up with her arms</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You then feel her gush onto your length</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”A-Annhhhh!” she almost howls, having to muffle herself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You affectionately rub her belly and then reach for a breast</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Is this your first time?” You ask in a sweet tone of voice</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks into your eyes, with some embarrassment setting in, she nods, looking away.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You continue, now starting a full-on assault on her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her arms shake but she manages to barely keep herself held up as she watches you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Ahh.. Ahh..” she whines and whimpers, panting.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The lewd sound of your nethers colliding with her wetness egg you on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Alongside her submissive whimpers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get to a point where she starts to quiver ever so slightly with each thrust</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She climaxes again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One of her arms gives out, and she has to place it over her mouth as she moans loudly, a bit of drool seeping from her maw</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t stop, still going</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You start to feel familiar pressure build up as well.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shakes and quivers as you begin to urgently thrust into her faster and harder than before.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She seems to know</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She reaches to put her arms around you, pulling you closer, </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With one final thrust, you go balls deep into her, releasing into her your pent-up load.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shivers as this happens, letting out one long whine, and slowly leans back onto the ground, pulling you up to her breasts, and laying you on her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re spent, what else is there to say?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your legs feel like wet noodles</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mia is petting you, panting</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile, and look up into her eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she was busy catching her breath, but she notices you and returns the gaze</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’ve loved you for a while, you know?” you manage to weakly speak</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her eyes soften, and she nods</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You, too?” You ask</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods again, now wrapping her arms around you in a big hug.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You return the hug, but quickly fall asleep in her embrace.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">=========================END=============================================</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">----------------------------------------EPILOGUE----------------------------------------------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">----------------------POV: ANDY “AXEL” HOLDT-----------------------------------</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anon has been missing for almost a year.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nobody seems to help.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had suddenly woken in your house again, and Anon was gone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had realized chances are he got caught by the big man, but what were you supposed to do?

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Be anon, in current year.
&gt;You work your ass off at a job so that you manage to go from check to check with little spending money.
&gt;Your friend calls you one day after work
&gt;Tells you that he&#039;s throwing a party, that it&#039;s on the weekend, and that he knows you can go.
&gt;And that he knows you have nothing better to do anyways.
&gt;&quot;Axel-&quot; you begin to complain
&gt;&quot;Ohhhh no you don&#039;t&quot; he quickly cuts you off
&gt;&quot;You have weekends off and do nothing but sit your ass on your computer, anyways.&quot;
&gt;He wasn&#039;t wrong.
&gt;&quot;but it&#039;s the little peace time I get, dude..&quot; you reply
&gt;In the end, he convinces you to go, telling you that there are gonna be some girls, and that you need a little someone.
&gt;You mostly did it because he&#039;s a good friend, and that you can take home some food that is laying around.

&gt;The day of the party 
&gt;You started walking to Andy &quot;Axel&quot;&#039;s house
&gt;You had known him since your childhood, lived within a mile of him, too.
&gt;Both of you were troublemakers, though you typically just followed him for the fun of it, pitching in your own little pinch of delinquency to whatever he came up with.
&gt;Lot has changed since then. You got a job, and he became the cool guy.
&gt;Course you two still speak to each other and hang out, he just tends to be busy most of the time.

&gt;You reach his house.
&gt;At least fifteen cars were parked there.
&gt;And two vans. One of which you could see some people hotboxing in before they went in for the party.
&gt;His place wasn&#039;t massive, so to speak.
&gt;With this many people, it was likely going to be cramped.
&gt;You approach his front door, and just walk in.
&gt;Music was already blaring, and people were already fucked up beyond belief.
&gt;&quot;Hey-ey-ey! My man Anon!&quot; Axel was warming up to some girl on the overlook.
&gt;Already? Lucky asshole.
&gt;Though he quickly leaves the girl in the dust has he jogs his way down a flight of stairs to greet you.
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s up, Anon!? I was thinking you were gonna bail on me, glad you made it!&quot; he swiftly hugs you and pats your back
&gt;to which you awkwardly return before breaking it
&gt;&quot;Y-yeah, figured I should have a change of pace, loosen up in a different way, right?&quot;
&gt;He smiles and nods &quot;Yeah!&quot;
&gt;He pats your back again &quot;Want a drink? good way to start the night.&quot; he gives you a questioning look
&gt;he sounds like he&#039;s about to sell you something.
&gt;&quot;sure, what&#039;s on the table?&quot; 
&gt;He grins when you take his offer &quot;You know what, How about a bourbon? It&#039;ll warm you up and you&#039;ll start breaking out of that social shell of yours.&quot;
&gt;You never really were a drinker, guess there is always a first.

&gt;Damn, he really meant it when he said it&#039;ll warm you up.
&gt;fuck it, what&#039;s so hard about dancing? you&#039;re here to have fun!
everything seems to become a slight blur, as if time is passing a bit faster.
You recollect yourself in front of a girl
&gt;&quot;Hey?&quot; she asks, a puzzled look on her face
&gt;you&#039;re a bit dumbfounded, it&#039;s been perhaps five minutes since you came in that door, and you can safely tell yourself you cannot hold a drink for the life of you.
&gt;&quot;H-hm?&quot; you realize you were standing there like an idiot
&gt;she doesn&#039;t seem to pay any mind &quot;You&#039;re friends with Axel, right?&quot;
&gt;&quot;yeah?&quot; you swear, if she is about to use you to hook up with him-
&gt;&quot;Might you be Anon? As in Anon in the 8th grade that helped Axel pack a smoke bomb with cinnamon and blinded a quarter of the cafeteria?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Smoke bomb was Axel, he wanted to smoke the whole place out, but we wouldn&#039;t be able to sneak in that many. I added the cinnamon to blind and freak people out.&quot; you quickly added
&gt;her facial expression glows for a moment &quot;So that was you! I&#039;m Sarah! Sarah Quibell!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ohhhhhhh!&quot; you nod, remembering the name
&gt;Fuck.
&gt;She&#039;s the daughter of some CEO. it surprised you that she didn&#039;t go to private school for rich kids.
&gt;You never talked to her because you felt like you were being watched and that your life was in danger.
&gt;She always talked to you, though.
&gt;Hence why you know the feeling
&gt;Nice girl, though.
&gt;&quot;Sarah! how have you been?&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re doing your best to not slur your words
&gt;she is kinda.. /very/ attractive, though her wealth kinda shows in her clothing.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m so glad I met you here! great party, right?&quot; she ask
&gt;&quot;Y-Yeah!&quot; you respond, your drink taking control for a moment and causing you to stutter.
&gt;&quot;What have you been doing all these years?&quot;
&gt;Uh... Bullshit mode activated
&gt;&quot;Things. I have a dog, saving money for college, working a decent job.&quot;
&gt;Two of those things were bullshit.
&gt;&quot;I was wondering if you wanted to... perhaps have breakfast with me sometime?&quot;
&gt;Hm. 
&gt;You haven&#039;t seen her in years, you suddenly see her at a party, and she wants to go on a date.
&gt;she is the daughter of a CEO-
&gt;You shake your head furiously at that thought. You&#039;re not like that.
&gt;&quot;No?&quot; She seems upset
&gt;F u c k.

&gt;She&#039;s frowning
&gt;&quot;Wait, nonono, it&#039;s not like that!&quot;
&gt;&quot;oh really?&quot; her tone definitely tells you that you just hurt her
&gt;&quot;I work on weekdays, and next weekend I have a meeting!&quot; Meeting part was a lie, you just didn&#039;t want to make any arrangements at the moment. you&#039;ll probably say it was cancelled and go along with her anyways.
&gt;She doesn&#039;t seem to be buying in
&gt;You sigh &quot;Listen, I&#039;ll give you my cell number, and you can call me to set a date, alright?&quot;
&gt;she looks away for a moment, still frowning
&gt;&quot;Fine..&quot; she replies
&gt;Oh thank god.
&gt;You two exchange numbers, and she texts you on the spot to make sure it wasn&#039;t a phony number.
&gt;To which you reply, and she seems content
&gt;that being said, she then turns and walks off to do her own thing.
&gt;Though you are still drunk, that was a bit of a wake up call.
you find your way to the snack bar and chow down for a minute, looking to see if you recognize anyone else.
&gt;you hear the some people come in- likely the stoners that were in that van- come in, shouting together: &quot;TIME TO PARTYYY!!&quot;
&gt;One of them has a fucking smoke machine on their shoulder, quickly looking for a place to hook it up.
&gt;&quot;Hey dude!&quot; you turn to your side to see a guy approaching you with a solo cup in hand. speaking in a bro/jock accent
&gt;&quot;Yeah?&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Axel has told me some of the crazy shit you two have done! why don&#039;t you stick around him any more?!&quot;
&gt;His face is red, likely blacked out already.
&gt;&quot;Grew up, decided to-&quot;
&gt;&quot;LAME!&quot; the guy interrupts you, and puts a hand on your shoulder
&gt;&quot;This is your prime, Anon! you&#039;re supposed to fuck, and get fucked!&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Yeah I-&quot;
&gt;&quot;In two different ways, I mean.&quot; he interrupts you again, in a calmer voice
&gt;&quot; My point is, as a friend of Axel&#039;s to another friend of Axel&#039;s: enjoy yourself!&quot; and... back to the bro accent
&gt;You kinda have an urge to go home, but you feel like you&#039;d be insulting your best friend.
&gt;In order to shake the guy off, you take his shoulder, and start nodding &quot;You know what, Yeah!&quot;
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s the attitude! Someone get a keg!&quot; this seems to work the guy up
&gt;&quot;Yeah! Get me- wait, what?&quot;
&gt;&quot;We got a stiff that needs breaking in!&quot;
&gt;Plenty of people can hear this guy shouting, and they start cheering.
&gt;Oh boy, too late to turn back now.

&gt;A few minutes pass, and sure enough, you find yourself on the receiving end of a keg, about to chug as much beer as you can. 
&gt;Axel is in on this, and he brought himself to be the one to pour.
&gt;&quot;CHUG! CHUG! CHUG!&quot; A crowd had gathered, and has started chanting 
&gt;You dont recall Axel&#039;s place turning into a fraternity house.
&gt;Axel smirks &quot;Can&#039;t turn back now, everyone wants a show!&quot; he starts lifting the keg, and with the help of you and one other, they start pouring it, with you drinking as fast as you can.
&gt;You were used to chugging from gallon jugs and 2 liter bottles but never something like this
&gt;needless to say, you got to what you guessed was about one third through before giving in. this was a decently sized keg, the size of a medium cooler, at least.
&gt;You got some cheers for your attempt, as far as they knew you were a stiff anyways.
&gt;Axel helps you stand up and starts rooting &quot;Anon! Anon! Anon!&quot;
&gt;Good pal.
&gt;&quot;Alright...&quot; you mutter out, you wanna get home before all this hits you and you end up stranded at his place.
&gt;&quot;Hm?&quot; Axel turns his head to you
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m gonna head out, it was fun.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Awwww, c&#039;mon dude.. it&#039;s been....&quot; he checks his watch &quot;an hour.&quot;
&gt;Hour? you thought it was thirty minutes. all the more reason to get home.
&gt;&quot;Yea, it&#039;s been fun, but I need to get home. I have a dog I need to feed and let out before he shits on the floor, and-&quot;
&gt;Axel seems a bit disappointed, but he nods.
&gt;&quot;Fair enough, Anon. Lemme at least get you a container for you to take some food home with ya. a little party to go, eh?&quot; He smiles as he leads you to the door, but props you on the wall to it
&gt;&quot;yeah, mmhm..&quot; you lean against the wall for a moment while Axel goes to pack you your &#039;party to go&#039;

&gt;Walking home
&gt;You weren&#039;t much of a party guy, it really was some fun, but next time you shouldn&#039;t get plastered so quickly and actually participate.
&gt;About halfway home, you have a really big urge to piss, like a liquid bowling ball just suddenly filled your bladder.
&gt;Taking your bag with a container and a few bags of junk food of what Axel gave you along for the ride, you jog into the remains of a path that you and Axel had cut out in your early years. it&#039;s starting be be overgrown, but you know where to walk.
&gt;Using your phone as a flashlight, and setting the food aside you go deep enough in to make sure nobody will see you and your Johnson.
&gt;One of the best pisses of your life.
&gt;as you finish and zip back up, you hear rustling behind you.
&gt;You&#039;re ready to fight something.
&gt;you quickly turn around to see that your food is gone, but you can hear the bag making noise as whoever took it starts to run
&gt;&quot;You fucker!&quot;
&gt;This SOB is tryna steal your cheetos!
&gt;You break into a sprint to chase whatever was making off with your extra $25 of food
&gt;Damn, whoever this is, they are really fucking fast.

&gt;You begin to lose your breath, the sound of the bags was beginning to just be an echo anyways.
&gt;slowing down and eventually coming to a stop, you take your breath and look around
&gt;Fuck
&gt;You had chased this thing for at least five minutes
&gt;You realize that you&#039;re lost
&gt;Pull out your phone
&gt;No service
&gt;Welp, Nobody can &quot;hear you now&quot;

&gt;After a minute or two of having a mild mental breakdown and catching your breath, you try your best to re-trace your steps
&gt;Instead of finding a way out- and thus, back home, you find the remnants of your bag. torn open, and a trail of broken containers, junk food bags, and portions of the food spewed across the ground.
&gt;&quot;God damn- fucking hobos!&quot; you call out in an agitated fit, kicking one of the containers.
&gt;Though with you being drunk you mostly kick up dirt and tumble the container slightly.
&gt;you hear some more rustling from a tree off to your right
&gt;big tree, too. surrounded by bushes.
&gt;Now isn&#039;t the time for gawking at some plant.
&gt;&quot;You son of a bitch!&quot; you call out, making a sprint for the bushes, expecting to get into a fistfight with some bearded homeless guy
&gt;Only if it was.

&gt;As you make a leap towards the bushes, for a moment you see a massive open palm swing towards you.
&gt;with you being in the middle of a leap, you cant really do much about it.
&gt;You&#039;re sent tumbling away, only some overgrowth to cushion your travel and slow you down.
&gt;Dumbfounded, you quickly recover yourself and stand up, partially afraid of whatever just fucking turned you into a baseball
&gt;&quot;W-What the fuck?&quot;
&gt;You hear growling, and you see it&#039;s figure, struggling to focus on it
&gt;But sure enough you do, and your blood runs cold, adrenaline filling your veins.
&gt;you want to yell, you want to run, but you&#039;re paralyzed on the spot
&gt;Fight or flight doesn&#039;t exist right now.
&gt;It&#039;s tall, at least 15 feet.
&gt;it snarls as it moves closer
&gt;Holy fuck.
&gt;You wanted to think it was some sort of mutant bear.
&gt;Bears don&#039;t walk on twos in such a familiar fashion
&gt;Even closer
&gt;That&#039;s a wolf&#039;s muzzle
&gt;with Human features all over
&gt;fur all over
&gt;female in form.
&gt;You began to think it was a werewolf
&gt;Not real.
&gt;ONLY EXPLANATION, MIND!

&gt;you fall on your ass as it approaches
&gt;&quot;W-w-Wait!&quot; you cower and close your eyes
&gt;The snarling grows closer, and you brace for what you assume is death
&gt;You can hear the wind as it swipes
&gt;There is a sudden wimper, and you jolt as you hear a collision with the ground next to you
&gt;you open your eyes, and sure enough, there is a massive, fur-covered hand there
&gt;you slowly look over to the massive she-werewolf, whom is looming over you
&gt;it&#039;s bleeding from it&#039;s side
&gt;That&#039;s a bulletwound
&gt;Hard to make out, but with the location and shape of the blood-covered fur, you quickly take that assumption
&gt;You attempt to make a run for it, but found yourself quickly pinned to the dirt.
&gt;You call out in fear as you are then lifted by the collar of your clothing
&gt;Good thing you pissed earlier.
&gt;you&#039;re brought eye-to-eye with your predator
&gt;&quot;A-AAAH!&quot; you again call out, assuming you&#039;re about to be bent in half and eaten
&gt;But no.
&gt;The she-wolf points at you.
&gt;And then to the wound
&gt;&quot;W-What?&quot;
&gt;again, it points to you, and then to the wound
&gt;It.. wants... help?

&gt;You look over towards the wound
&gt;You learned how to perform CPR but that&#039;s about it.
&gt;You have a pair of tweezers back at home your bathroom cabinet
&gt;That&#039;s how the movies do it, right?
&gt;&quot;U-uh.. I-I have pair of tweezers back at-&quot;
&gt;Angry growl
&gt;No go
&gt;She sets you down, and sits, turning their wound towards you, raising an arm, and looking at you expectantly
&gt;How the hell
&gt;You check your pockets
&gt;Nothing
&gt;&quot;haha..&quot; you chuckle nerviously
&gt;&quot;Grrr..&quot; Not happy.
&gt;&quot;Alright alright!&quot;
&gt;You slowly step forward, looking up and fear somewhat hurries you, with her glaring at you like that.
&gt;You start to part blood-soaked and sticky fur
&gt;A wimper followed by a growl
&gt;&quot;W-wait! I have to do this!&quot; you quickly attempt to reassure your captor
&gt;She huffs, still watching you.
&gt;Your guess was correct, a bullet wound
&gt;Looks bad too. they&#039;ve been moving a lot, as far as you know.
&gt;You have no idea what kind of round, though.
&gt;you think to yourself: &#039;Now how the hell am I expected to remove it?
&gt;With nothing else on your person, it leaves you with one decision
&gt;Use what you&#039;ve been given: your hands.

&gt;&quot;Uhm.... This is going to hurt.&quot;
&gt;She simply looks at you and lets out another huff. 
&gt;You interpret this as a &quot;whatever&quot;
&gt;having zero medical expertise, you begin debating how to work this out
&gt;You decide on testing the waters using your pinky, try to get a feel for where the bullet is
&gt;You&#039;re met with the she-wolf tensing up and you immediately stop
&gt;your doctor always told you not to tense up when getting a shot
&gt;&quot;R-Relax, it&#039;s going to hurt even worse if you tense up.&quot;
&gt;You receive a growl in response
&gt;It dawned on you that you&#039;re managing to communicate with a giant fucking wolf
&gt;You shake your head and continue your below-ignorant levels of medical expertise
&gt;it takes you a solid minute of you sucking up your fear and slowly feeling into the wound using a single finger
&gt;You&#039;ve never seen this done.
&gt;If anything this is going to make the wound worse, right?
&gt;you bite your lip for a moment, and then your pinky collides with something hard
&gt;and the wolf wimpers, then huffing at you again
&gt;&quot;alright, alright!&quot; you quickly exclaim
&gt;&quot;Worst part is now&quot;
&gt;How the fuck are you gonna A-Team this without a knife, at the least?
&gt;Fuck it.
&gt;She can just put up with it.
&gt;You&#039;re likely going to die either way.
&gt;You use some force to slide your finger around the back end of the bullet and next to it
&gt;She does not like this
&gt;she growls, but doesn&#039;t tense up
&gt;you close your eyes
&gt;Seems that fear kinda sobered you up.
&gt;Focusing on your finger, you do your damndest to hook it wound and slowly work your way to getting it out
&gt;takes you a few moments, but you manage to get it out.
&gt;The wolf then feels at their side and huffs for a few moments.

&gt;Fear sets back in now that you don&#039;t know what is going to happen next.
&gt;She looks at you, and huffs, making a &quot;Go away.&quot; motion with her muzzle
&gt;Oh thank fucking hell
&gt;Without a second thought, you run. 
&gt;Don&#039;t Know where to, but its away from her
&gt;Wait, she needs a bandage.
&gt;DONT FUCKING CARE, BRAIN!
&gt;NO SUCH THING AS A BANDAGE THAT BIG!

&gt;It takes you at least forty-five minutes before you find a way out.
&gt;You got out of the frying pan and into the fire.
&gt;You know exactly where you are, but you&#039;re seen by a pair of guys in a large &quot;Animal Control&quot; truck
&gt;Shit man, this isn&#039;t your blood
&gt;you don&#039;t think this can pass for you being wounded

&gt;One of them gets out and approaches you, dressed up in khaki overalls 
&gt;&quot;Hey, you alright!?&quot; He calls as he approaches you with a smile
&gt;You want to turn and run again, but then you&#039;ll be seen as suspicious and you may get reported to the police.
&gt;You stand your ground.
&gt;for the better or worse.
&gt;&quot;I-I&#039;m just fine, I&#039;ve just been lost all day..&quot;
&gt;You fall to your knees. this was another lie. But the relief of being out of those woods makes you somewhat believable. 
&gt;&quot;You aren&#039;t in good shape buddy..&quot; the man replies as he comes up to you, kneeling
&gt;Are you hurt? you&#039;ve got blood all over your hands..&quot;
&gt;&quot;I got myself cut up by thorns and a damn wolf tried to make me into dinner.
&gt;Nobody would believe you.
&gt;You knew this and just said the more reasonable explanation. 
&gt;&quot;Hm.&quot; is all he says in response, before reaching to help you stand up
&gt;&quot;C&#039;mon, lets get you home pal. you reek of alcohol. and tell us about that &#039;wolf&#039;, too. We&#039;ve got a few reports of attacks around these parts.&quot;
&gt;you cooperate and follow him over to the truck.
&gt;Lucky for you, it&#039;s a four-seater.
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s your address, kid?&quot;
&gt;The man asks you this as he gets into shotgun, and as you fasten your seatbelt
&gt;&quot;uhm... 123 Example Circle.&quot;
&gt;The other man- the driver- nods and starts off
&gt;Halfway into the drive it finally gets to you
&gt;Wait.. 
&gt;Other attacks?
&gt;If they knew about how large this thing is, then they wouldn&#039;t be calling animal control-
&gt;Oh.
&gt;That is why your town has become popular.
&gt;You thought it was just a tv show based on nothing.
&gt;This has been going on for at least Two months, spanning over your state.
&gt;Or at least the TV shows tell
&gt;you never watched them, but you remember the premiere of it.
&gt;Does it mean this has been going on for longer?
&gt;Oh no...
&gt;This is exactly like MIB
&gt;Excluding the suits. these two fit in perfectly, they look exactly like animal control.
&gt;&quot;Tell us about this &#039;wolf&#039;&quot; the Man riding shotgun asks
&gt;Play along, perhaps you&#039;re just paranoid.

&gt;&quot;It was a wolf, nothing else to say about it.&quot; you reply in a meek tone, still playing on your previous story.
&gt;&quot;Color of the fur? size? any distinct features?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t know! it was trying to kill me and it was dark out, I couldn&#039;t catch the details!&quot;
&gt;You pseudo-loose your temper
&gt;&quot;Well plenty of people have been attacked, but you&#039;ve either lost a lot of blood, or that wolf looks even worse.&quot;
&gt;He says this in a matter-of-fact way.
&gt;Has he called your bluff?
&gt;you say nothing
&gt;A few moments of silence pass before he speaks up again
&gt;&quot;Listen, we just want to know what we can so we can get rid of this problem and protect people, alright?&quot;
&gt;you sigh
&gt;&quot;It was deep in, I was running for forty or so minutes after I had fought it. I was lucky that it decided to let me run away. Even luckier that I found my way out. I had been lost in there all day&quot;
&gt;&quot;Hm. Lucky indeed.&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re eventually brought to your house, they tell you to be careful and to stay away from the woods for now.
&gt;You think &#039;No shit.&#039;
&gt;You shower that night and have a nightmare of your experience.

&gt;it is the following day
&gt;Sunday
&gt;Bitch of a hangover alongside the stress of what you know
&gt;You sit your ass in front of your computer after your routine
&gt;You attempt to distract yourself by browsing image boards and watching youtube.
&gt;Doesn&#039;t work, your brain refuses to forget about last night.
&gt;&quot;How the hell..&quot; you think aloud
&gt;Decide to google about it
&gt;You got what you expected
&gt;Almost all of them are related to the TV shows going on in your state.
&gt;Some of them are even paying for leads.
&gt;four to five digits.
&gt;God damn.
&gt;you move on to check images
&gt;typical bigfoot-style, you get blurs, some of them are nothing to what you have seen, but some are similar.
&gt;If the big man IS involved, they&#039;re having the search engines keep a tight zipper on it.

&gt;Lets go back.
&gt;What the fuck?
&gt;No.
&gt;you stop arguing with yourself, reach to check your phone, and see that Axel had been messaging you the entire time that you were gone
&gt;You reply and tell him that you just got lost in the woods last night when you went to take a piss.
&gt;You set your phone back down and lean back, actually contemplating the previous idea
&gt;You nearly died, who&#039;s to say that she wont kill you this time?
&gt;She&#039;s wounded
&gt;When you remember this, you google bullet wounds.
&gt;See that doctors may or may not remove bullets depending on the location for various reasons, including blood loss
&gt;Well shit
&gt;You cant- in good conscience- leave that be.
&gt;For a change in your usual routine, you&#039;re going to be leaving on the weekend.

&gt;You take a satchel and start packing it with medical supplies that you kept in a cabinet.
&gt;you originally planned to use this satchel for when you go to college
&gt;Preparing early pays off
&gt;you take a few bottles of water and pack a lunch for yourself
&gt;Just a basic sandwich. 
&gt;you then put on your shoes and head out
&gt;Right into suicide
&gt;You find where you entered, and look around, doing a more sober attempt of retracing your steps.
&gt;You get it right, at least half right.
&gt;take about ten minutes before you see the familiar area of bushes and the massive tree
&gt;You still wonder why that hasn&#039;t become a state monument

&gt;As you approach you immediately start to feel regret
&gt;What a stupid reason to jump back into death
&gt;&#039;You did it wrong&#039;? 
&gt;Too late now
&gt;You walk slowly over to the bushes
&gt;Massive fucking den
&gt;Holy hell you can park a car in that thing
&gt;you see a large furry back
&gt;haha...
&gt;you take a few steps back, making some noise on purpose
&gt;&quot;H-Helloooo..&quot; your voice cracks from nervousness
&gt;First there was nothing
&gt;within a few seconds you hear snarling as the figure heaves up from it&#039;s den, quickly scanning before locking their eyes onto you
&gt;With it being daytime now, you can easily get more details
&gt;Black with various shades of brown and lighter colors on her muzzle, chest, and stomach
&gt;Speaking of.
&gt;Tits.
&gt;Literally and in the other way.

&gt;She slowly approaches, snarling.
&gt;she likely recognizes your smell, if anything, and this is why she hasn&#039;t killed you yet
&gt;&quot;Wait a moment!&quot; you quickly raise your satchel
&gt;She stops, but is still growling, with her ears folded back
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re still hurt, right?&quot; you ask nervously
&gt;Still growling
&gt;You look over to her side, where you had removed the bullet
&gt;&quot;I-I&#039;m just here to properly care for it.&quot;
&gt;She takes a hand and simply points &quot;away&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Now I dont know why you&#039;re violent. But allow me this. You&#039;re the only reason why people are here. if you can get better that means more peace for me.&quot;
&gt;She steps closer, leaning her head down to yours, still growling.
&gt;Probably to remind you who is the predator here.

&gt;&quot;You&#039;ll likely bleed out if that isn&#039;t treated.&quot;
&gt;Implying whatever you can do will stop that
&gt;You can still fucking try.
&gt;she looks at you for a long while, before letting out a huff, and sitting down again, turning her wounded side towards you
&gt;&quot;Thank you.&quot;
&gt;You set your bag down and open it, taking out a bottle of  isopropyl alcohol, and get to work on disinfecting
&gt;She tenses up and gives you a growl
&gt;&quot;Can&#039;t let it get infected.&quot;
&gt;Another huff
&gt;&quot;do you have a name?&quot; you ask
&gt;She glances over towards you like you&#039;re stupid, and then shakes her head.
&gt;&quot;So... Question: The government is after you, aren&#039;t they?&quot;
&gt;She looks at you again, and shakes her head slowly before putting a palm over her face
&gt;&quot;Can you speak?&quot;
&gt;She gives you a long hard look, before tapping her chin, thinking over the question, and then reaching to flick your head gently.
&gt;She doesn&#039;t know her own strength, it was more like you got hit with a foot ball that was thrown directly at your head
&gt;Lucky for you, you&#039;re used to stuff like this, given your history at school and getting into fights.
&gt;You&#039;re already started applying gauze and using medical tape to keep it down, avoiding fur as much as you can
&gt;Isn&#039;t easy, but you get it done.
&gt;You then take one of the bottles of water and walk around to her front 
&gt;She continues looking at you. 
&gt;As in investigating if you&#039;re &#039;okay&#039; or not
&gt;You sit in front of her, and look over her yourself.
&gt;The tits make you uncomfortable, but you manage to deal with it.
&gt;&quot;Try not to move too much. give that would time to heal&quot;
&gt;She simply gestures towards her &#039;den&#039;
&gt;&quot;Oh, right.&quot;
&gt;Nameless beast that is on the run from the government.
&gt;A name hits you
&gt;&quot;How about.... Mia?&quot; 
&gt;She gives you an inquisitive look
&gt;&quot;Your name&quot;
&gt;She just kinda rolls her eyes
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s a play on words since you&#039;re on the run.&quot;
&gt;Another eye roll
&gt;&quot;I mean, you cant speak, but-&quot;
&gt;Abruptly, her ears perk up, and she looks to her left- your right.
&gt;She moves to make a &quot;shhh&quot; gesture and then reaches to grab you.
&gt;You want to complain, but you comply, considering her size.
&gt;She swiftly carries you to her den, cautious of her wound.
&gt;You are 110% confused.
&gt;She sets you in the back and pulls on some of the bushes, covering the entrance.
&gt;She proceeds to lay down with her back towards the entrance, facing you.
&gt;There isnt much room
&gt;You&#039;re inches from her torso, her breasts, and face, all in one
&gt;It kinda suprises you that she fits in here, let alone both of you
&gt;You begin to hear whirring and the sound of a helicopter.
&gt;You furrow your brow, but keep quiet
&gt;whirring... whirring...
&gt;Drones?
&gt;They&#039;re scanning with drones.
&gt;Helicopter is either a coincidence or where everything the drones are seeing is being sent.
&gt;Wouldn&#039;t a van be a better idea?
&gt;you stop thinking about the big man to look over and see that the big woman has emptied out your bag
&gt;And ate your sandwich
&gt;Might as well have been bite-sized for her.
&gt;You open your mouth to complain, but stop yourself
&gt;You sigh instead
&gt;Seeing your displeasure, she reaches and pats your head
&gt;Probably some sort of &#039;thank you&#039; from this amazon.
&gt;Fitting description, but taller than what most people would think when they think of a amazon.
&gt;And also a lot furrier, too.

&gt;She is staring at you, though one of her ears is turned, listening for the drones to go away.
&gt;She could have just left you there and hid on her own.
&gt;Probably knows things would be bad if you were spotted.
&gt;Also probably because it&#039;s inconvenient for her to lose someone who isn&#039;t hunting her down.
&gt;Either way, you have an urge to reach out and feel her stomach
&gt;Her eyes narrow on you as if she knows your intentions, but doesn&#039;t move
&gt;You reach out anyways.

&gt;Soft.. really soft.
&gt;Soft as it can get.
&gt;Considering she has been on the run and likely hasn&#039;t washed in a while.
&gt;She doesn&#039;t look too happy, almost as if you&#039;re taking advantage of her due to the situation
&gt;After you&#039;re done feeling her, you scratch the back of your head and mouth &#039;sorry&#039;
&gt;She rolls her eyes.
&gt;the whirring begins to fade away, but she doesn&#039;t move.
&gt;Superior hearing, duh.
&gt;With slight movements, she notions towards your bag, with it&#039;s contents on the ground.
&gt;with the sound fading away, you look over and whisper: 
&gt;&quot;Want me to take my things?&quot;
&gt;She makes a thumbs up
&gt;And then makes a small &quot;leave&quot; motion by pointing behind herself with it.
&gt;You nod
&gt;She still doesn&#039;t move, which stops you from getting your things.
&gt;Knowing that she&#039;ll move when she deems it okay to, you decide to whisper some more
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll perhaps visit some more, alright?&quot;
&gt;She narrows her eyes on you
&gt;Stares at you for a moment
&gt;Then rolls her eyes and shrugs before rolling over to exit the den
&gt;Slow and cautious of her would
&gt;&#039;whatever&#039; 
&gt;You fill in the blanks in your head.
&gt;You begin to gather your things and walk away, stopping partway to look at her and say &quot;Later, Mia.&quot;
&gt;She facepalms and crawls back into her den

&gt;You make your way out of the woods and you see that familiar animal control vehicle parked with the driver&#039;s side facing you
&gt;almost immediately you&#039;re seen by the driver, who turns away, probably talking to his buddy.
&gt;Ah fuck.
&gt;You start up the road like this is a normal day
&gt;&quot;Hey!&quot;
&gt;Aaahhh fuck. x2
&gt;you turn around to see the same guy approaching you
&gt;&quot;Didn&#039;t we see you last night? you need to stay away from the woods.&quot;
&gt;You tap on your chin like you&#039;re trying to remember.
&gt;You know how to bullshit a lot.
&gt;&quot;Oh! you&#039;re the two that got me out of the woods last night!&quot;
&gt;He nods &quot;Yeah. why were you back in there?&quot;
&gt;Uhh..
&gt;You adjust your bag to bring attention to it
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m a writer on the side, I dropped my bag last night. Has my laptop and stuff in it.&quot;
&gt;he opens his mouth but you quickly intervene
&gt;&quot;Also, I want to apologize if I was rude last night, I was at a party beforehand and I don&#039;t hold a drink very well.&quot;
&gt;The man seems a bit agitated, but sighs
&gt;&quot;Just don&#039;t go in there, that wolf is dangerous.&quot; he says, quickly adding:
&gt;&quot;at least not till we catch it.&quot; 
&gt;You nod &quot;Will do. Thank you for your work to help keep us safe.&quot; 
&gt;The man nods and turns around, going towards his vehicle
&gt;You turn around and start off again
&gt;Holy hell that was close.
&gt;You catch something about an &quot;ID&quot; from the two talking to each other, but pay no mind.
&gt;You&#039;re free.

&gt;You make your way back home and waste the rest of your day, though Mia occasionally comes to mind.
&gt;Not to mention her rack
&gt;She isn&#039;t even human, but as a dude you cant really ignore that factor forever.
&gt;You start to think about if it&#039;s possible to make some sort of clothing for her
&gt;You take a few minutes to lean in your chair and think about it
&gt;Why? Better than what you&#039;d usually do.
&gt;It would be impossible to find anything large enough
&gt;It would have to be hand-made.
&gt;Hmm..
&gt;You could just... take two sheets and stitch them together
&gt;You&#039;ve never sown before in your life.
&gt;How hard can it be?
&gt;You decide to look up some videos on how to stitch
&gt;Feels weird to do this, but perhaps it&#039;ll come in handy later on in life.

&gt;The day flies by and your dinner consists of some frozen burger paddies and some corn.
&gt;You&#039;ll have to stop by the mall to get a sowing kit on your way home after work.
&gt;You suddenly ask yourself why you&#039;re putting all of this effort towards a large she-beast-wolf person
&gt;Kinda cool, you guess.
&gt;Someone could sketch her onto a heavy metal album
&gt;You play vidya for the next few hours before showering and going to sleep

&gt;Following day
&gt;You wake up to your alarm clock
&gt;Ugh work
&gt;You get up, and get dressed.
&gt;You work for Mike, a friend of your parents who owns the restaurant you work at.
&gt;Good connection considering it is one of your first jobs.
&gt;He&#039;s tough on you, but appreciates what you do.
&gt;You go between cleaning, and organizing take-out bags.
&gt;&quot;Anon! Just the guy I was looking for!&quot; he calls as you enter
&gt;Oh boy
&gt;&quot;Yeah, boss?&quot; you reply
&gt;&quot;Had a spill in the kitchen, I&#039;d like you to hop on that.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sure thing.&quot;
&gt;Turns out the &#039;spill&#039; was just someone that ended up knocking over a pot that was filled with boiling vegetables.
&gt;You throw them out begrudgingly.
&gt;You could just wash them and take them home, but this is work.
&gt;This was more or less ran by Mike&#039;s family, excluding you.
&gt;Two sons, a daughter, his wife, and him.
&gt;John and Michael were cool guys, though you never really took time to get to know them.
&gt;Sasha, Mike&#039;s wife, is kind and occasionally lets you take out leftover food that is laying around in the kitchen
&gt;Alex and you haven&#039;t ever made contact besides passing messages, but you think she is pretty.
&gt;Mondays are always slow days for work.
&gt;You don&#039;t complain because once you finish wiping tables you get to sit and just keep an eye out
&gt;&quot;Anon, have you been doing well?&quot; Mike asks while you&#039;re sitting
&gt;&quot;Yeah, went to an old friend&#039;s party the other night.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh? how was it?&quot; you can tell he is smirking
&gt;&quot;Exactly the kind of party you&#039;d expect, Mike.&quot;
&gt;He laughs
&gt;&quot;Everyone having their own fun?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Mmhm!&quot;
&gt;&quot;What do you think about that wolf?&quot; Michael adds from the kitchen, cleaning dishes
&gt;&quot;The one that has attacked people?&quot; Sasha asks
&gt;&quot;Yeah, that one!&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Well, I steer clear of woods anyways, though I have read on it.&quot; you reply
&gt;No reason to add onto the lie of you being attacked.
&gt;&quot;People online say it&#039;s massive, like one you would see in a movie of sorts!&quot; Michael seems to exaggerate &#039;massive&#039;
&gt;&quot;I just hope animal control catches it. It&#039;s a danger to our community.&quot; Sasha says.
&gt;&quot;Yeah.&quot; Mike and Michael say this at almost the same time
&gt;&quot;Yeah...&quot; only moments after saying this you catch the sympathy in your tone, though nobody else seems to haven noticed.
&gt;&quot;Actually, you head home early today, Anon, I&#039;ll give you your usual hours.&quot; Mike says out of the blue
&gt;&quot;Huh?&quot; you turn to look towards him.
&gt;He is in the kitchen as well, but you can see him through a window. 
&gt;&quot;we&#039;re gonna have family visit soon, and I&#039;d figure it&#039;d be a family thing. No offense.&quot;
&gt;You shake your head.
&gt;You&#039;ll be getting getting your usual hours, anyways.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s fine sir, I understand.&quot;
&gt;He smiles &quot;Thanks.&quot;
&gt;You gather your things, and everyone tells you &quot;have a good day!&quot; though each of them says it at a different time, with Sasha starting it off.
&gt;Lucky you
&gt;You get to stop by the mall early and perhaps visit Mia.

&gt;You stop by the mall, buy the sewing kit and few sheets.
&gt;Make sure they&#039;re uniform in color
&gt;You get home and have lunch, while re-watching/listening to those sewing videos you previously watched
&gt;You realize you&#039;re gonna need to at least double the thread you&#039;re using so she doesn&#039;t break it so easily.
&gt;Fuck it, just do quadruple the thread.
&gt;Keeping her figure in mind, you get to work.
&gt;Doing this out in those woods would be even more painful
&gt;Still painful, but not as painful
&gt;Two or so hours later, and you&#039;ve got it done.
&gt;It&#039;s more or less a gown of sorts.
&gt;You&#039;ve sewn up the sides so that there is plenty of room for her arms
&gt;It&#039;s long enough to likely cover her lower bits, as well.
&gt;You blush for a moment but quickly shake it off
&gt;You proceed to fold it up, and put it into your bag
&gt;still has your medical stuff in it
&gt;Might as well swap out the bandage while you visit.

&gt;You take your bag and start out to the woods
&gt;Usual of hour of walking later, you find the tree again 
&gt;&quot;Psssssst, Mia.&quot; you call out 
&gt;Not quite calling out, you used the normal way you talk
&gt;Quiet for a moment, but she peeks out and sees you.
&gt;You hear a &quot;Swish&quot; before she climbs out, moving over to you
&gt;She immediately looks to your bag, using her muzzle to notion towards it.
&gt;&quot;I didn&#039;t bring any food today, sorry.&quot;
&gt;She looks away in a &quot;Hmph&quot; fashion
&gt;You chuckle &quot;let me look at the bandage.&quot;
&gt;She nods and sits down, moving her arm so you can see to it.
&gt;It&#039;s covered in blood, and she wimpers as you remove it
&gt;&quot;Sorry, sorry..&quot;
&gt;it&#039;s not bleeding as bad, at least.
&gt;Another &quot;hmph&quot;
&gt;You apply some more isopropyl to it.
&gt;A long whine comes out 
&gt;&quot;Almost done.&quot;
&gt;You hold down the gauze with one hand as you tape it down
&gt;Avoiding fur as you did last time
&gt;&quot;Done!&quot; you step back and give her a smile
&gt;Hmph.
&gt;&quot;With that being done, I do have something else for you&quot;
&gt;You turn around and open your satchel, taking out the gown
&gt;You see her tail wag in a singular motion, but she then looks confused
&gt;&quot;Its so you can cover yourself.&quot;
&gt;She looks even more confused
&gt;&quot;Like stuff that I wear. so i&#039;m not naked.&quot;
&gt;She seems to understand this and then shakes her head
&gt;&quot;As a human, I request that you wear this because seeing your breasts and private areas is embarrassing to me.&quot;
&gt; She looks at you, smirks, and then grabs her breasts, taunting you.
&gt;You feel your face heat up and you look away.
&gt;You hear what you assume is her laughing before she takes it from you
&gt;&quot;Oh wait you probably don&#039;t know how to-&quot;
&gt;Nevermind then.
&gt;She put it on properly.
&gt;You thought she&#039;d be clueless to stuff like that.
&gt;She looks at over and it is obvious enough that she feels a bit uncomfortable wearing it.
&gt;She then looks to you
&gt;&quot;Thank you. it looks nice.&quot;
&gt;It kinda does, considering you had to use a few different thread colors to make the thicker thread so that it wont break as easily.
&gt;She reaches to pat your head
&gt;And then leans her head over towards you
&gt;You&#039;re confused for a moment, but then realize that she wants you to pet her
&gt;You also figure she knows about this because people that initially raised her pet her as a reward
&gt;You do so.
&gt;As you pet her, her tail wags slowly, which only speeds up as you scratch her head and behind her ears
&gt;She smiles and reaches to pull you close.
&gt;&quot;W-Woah!&quot; this took you off guard
&gt;She just holds you
&gt;Now that she&#039;s wearing the gown, she is quite literally like a pillow
&gt;You lean into her, reaching up to scratch her chin.
&gt;She really likes this, you hear her tail wagging furiously
&gt;&quot;Must be scary, being all alone as you have been.&quot;
&gt;&quot;mmh.&quot; she huffs out.
&gt;You figure she wanted someone to trust, and decided that person is you.
&gt;&quot;They&#039;re going to find you eventually.&quot;
&gt;She doesn&#039;t respond to this, she instead just kinda pulls you closer
&gt;You actually feel bad for her now
&gt;She is probably some experiment
&gt;Lived in confinement for most of her life
&gt;Broke out into an unimaginably large and open world
&gt;She is all alone
&gt;Was all alone. &#039;was&#039;
&gt;&quot;We&#039;ll be alright, Mia.&quot;
&gt;no response, but you can see tears welling in her eyes
&gt;it was probably difficult to trust you as quickly as she has.
&gt;But then again you are probably the only human that has been this kind to her since her adolescence.

&gt;You lean back and reach to scratch her chin again
&gt;To which she smiles and wipes away her tears
&gt;You sit in silence after this.
&gt;Thinking
&gt;Of any way to help her
&gt;This ends in failure, of course.
&gt;There is nothing you could do to hide her
&gt;You wouldn&#039;t dare to show her to your friends. Even Axel may be tempted by a reward.
&gt;You move to stand up
&gt;Her grip on you tightens
&gt;&quot;Calm down, Mia. I&#039;ve gotta go home.&quot;
&gt;She wines
&gt;&quot;I can&#039;t stay long, you know this.&quot;
&gt;She looks away and lets out a huff
&gt;But loosens her grip
&gt;You pet her again before getting your satchel and starting away
&gt;Taking the time to wave and say &quot;Bye Mia, I&#039;ll see you tomorrow.&quot;
&gt;She looks sad, but smiles and waves at this notion
&gt;If not for her large body, you&#039;d think it was cute.

&gt;You make it out of the woods.
&gt;No animal control this time around.
&gt;Good.
&gt;For multiple reasons.
&gt;You make your way home, have dinner, and find yourself staying up late on your computer.
&gt;Gaming, of course. 
&gt;But partially thinking about Mia.
&gt;They&#039;re either going to kill her, or take her back to their lab.
&gt;Both of those thoughts horrify you.
&gt;You get a message on your phone that breaks you out of your trance.
&gt;It&#039;s Axel

&gt;Axl: You awake?
&gt;Ano: Yeah.
&gt;Ano: What&#039;s up?
&gt;Axl: Nothing much. Just checking in on ya. How was that hangover?
&gt;Ano: A pain. Of course.
&gt;Axl: Pffhaha
&gt;Axl: You&#039;ll get used to it if you party a bit more!
&gt;Ano: Naaah. I&#039;ve gotta keep this job.
&gt;Axl: Booring.
&gt;Ano: I gotta make a living.
&gt;Axl: Fair enough.
&gt;Axl: I tried stopping by your place earlier to surprise you, but you weren&#039;t home. Where have you been?
&gt;Shit.
&gt;Sorry Axel..
&gt;Ano: I&#039;ve been going for walks, getting into better shape.
&gt;Axl: Ohhhhhhhhh, I see
&gt;You hate lying, but you&#039;ve ended up doing it so much recently
&gt;Axl: is it a girl?
&gt;Ano: what? no. It&#039;s not.
&gt;Axl: IT TOTALLY IS!
&gt;Axl: WHAT&#039;s HER NAME?
&gt;Axl: WHAT DOES SHE LOOK LIKE?
&gt;Axl: WHAT DOES SHE DO!?
&gt;Ano: Calm down Axel.
&gt;Axl: YOOOO YOU DON&#039;T HAVE TO HIDE THIS FROM ME MAN!
&gt;Ano: it really isn&#039;t, axel.
&gt;Axl: Alright alright, you keep your secrets... 
&gt;Axl: I was just checking on you. Goodnight, Anon.

&gt;That ends your short chat with him
&gt;You finish up your gaming
&gt;Take a shower
&gt;And go to bed

&gt;You wake up to your alarm clock
&gt;You regret staying up late, but compensate by having an extra cup of coffee this morning.
&gt;Proceed to get dressed, and see that you have some extra time.
&gt;Decide to read the news 
&gt;Nothing particularly catches your eye besides a PSA for your area telling people to be careful about the woods due to a dangerous wolf.
&gt;And that the local animal control are doing their best to track down and capture the animal so that they can move it to a safer location
&gt;You doubt that
&gt;Decide you shouldn&#039;t get yourself bothered and just leave for work

&gt;You show up a bit early but start cleaning off tables
&gt;Mike and company greet you
&gt;You return the greetings, of course.
&gt;During the day you recognize the two animal control guys
&gt;They come in for an afternoon meal
&gt;But they&#039;re in suits.
&gt;Black suits like businessmen
&gt;They&#039;re chatting and laughing
&gt;You get a pit in your stomach
&gt;Seeing them like this makes you worried.
&gt;You do your best to continue working.
&gt;You wipe down tables after people leave.
&gt;You swear you can feel gazes shifting towards you
&gt;Do they recognize you?
&gt;You keep quiet and continue doing your part.
&gt;They eventually leave
&gt;Which is a relief to you
&gt;Though anxiety still lingers in the back of your mind
&gt;This makes the day pass a bit faster for you
&gt;You&#039;re mopping the bathroom minutes before closing time
&gt;&quot;Hey Anon!&quot; You hear Sasha suddenly call from the kitchen
&gt;&quot;Yes Ma&#039;am?&quot; you reply
&gt;&quot;Come here! I&#039;m gonna send some leftovers home with you!&quot;
&gt;Sweeeeet.
&gt;You make your way over to the kitchen and she already has a bag with a few take out boxes in it.
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s a lot.&quot;
&gt;Sasha smiles &quot;Think of it as a thank you for your work.&quot;
&gt;You smile back &quot;Thank you, Ma&#039;am.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Be sure to tell your mother I said hello, Anon.&quot;
&gt;You nod &quot;Will do. I think they plan to visit here next month. Got an idea for any place to take them to eat?&quot;
&gt;You smirk
&gt;She starts laughing 
&gt;Mike comes to  the  kitchen with this commotion being heard
&gt;&quot;Huh, what&#039;s so funny?&quot; He asks
&gt;&quot;Anon was being funny.&quot; Sasha looks at him, still giggling
&gt;&quot;What&#039;d he say?&quot;
&gt;&quot;His parents are gonna visit, and he asked me if I knew a good place to take them to eat&quot;
&gt;Mike gives you a &#039;Really?&#039; look before chuckling 
&gt;&quot;If they do visit, whatever food will be on the house.&quot; Mike addresses the part about your parents visiting
&gt;This is true, they do plan to visit.
&gt;&quot;Anyways, go ahead and check out for the day, anon.&quot; Mike tells you
&gt;&quot;Yes sir, have a good evening. you as well, Ma&#039;am&quot;
&gt;&quot;You too, Anon.&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Be safe.&quot; Sasha replies

&gt;You make your way home, change into a normal set of clothes and start towards the woods again
&gt;Taking your satchel and the leftovers with you
&gt;Another thirty minute walk later, you reach the tree, and you call for her while shaking the bag &quot;Miaaaa!&quot;
&gt;A moment later and she excitedly crawls out of her den, and comes over to you, her tail wagging in swift motions.
&gt;&quot;I brought food this time.&quot;
&gt;She drools slightly when you say that
&gt;She is still wearing the gown you made
&gt;Though it is a bit dirty from her laying in dirt
&gt;Speaking of
&gt;You don&#039;t see any blood on it, so you guess that the bleeding from the wound has stopped 
&gt;You set your satchel down and sit down in front of her
&gt;She sits down as well
&gt;You look into the take out boxes and hold one up to her
&gt;It was a steak with some A1 already on it
&gt;She takes it and stiffs for a moment
&gt;Hey eyes widen and she devours it in under a minute
&gt;You start laughing at this
&gt;&quot;Hahahah! I-Aha! I-I&#039;m glad you like it, Mia.&quot;
&gt;She looks at you expectantly
&gt;You decide to give her another box
&gt;Which leaves one for you
&gt;She&#039;s big and needs to eat more, so you don&#039;t mind.
&gt;She starts licking the remaining A1 out of the first box as you offer her the second one
&gt;It has some amount of sauteed shrimp
&gt;She quite literally just pours the contents of the box into her mouth and eats mouthfuls at a time
&gt;You chuckle and open the last one that you decided to keep for yourself
&gt;It was a burger and fries
&gt;Basic enough for you. And you didn&#039;t bring any utensils to eat with anyways.

&gt;She reaches to pat your head
&gt;Another &#039;thank you&#039;
&gt;You smile &quot;You&#039;re welcome, Mia.&quot;
&gt;You finish your burger and are about halfway through the fries when you hear &quot;WOAAAH!&quot;
&gt;Mia turns, snarling
&gt;Your head jerks soon after
&gt;Fuck
&gt;It&#039;s Axel
&gt;Mia shifts as if she&#039;s about to get up
&gt;&quot;MIA STOP!&quot; you yell at her
&gt;This catches her off guard, she looks at you, and she almost seems hurt, but her growling continues as she turns towards Axel
&gt;&quot;Mia, don&#039;t do anything.&quot;
&gt;Axel seems too amazed to be scared right now
&gt;&quot;Mia, it&#039;s okay.&quot;
&gt;Her growling quiets down, but she keeps her eyes on him
&gt;&quot;Axel, why are you here?&quot; you turn and ask in an agitated tone
&gt;&quot;Wha-oh. Well... I saw you got home from work, but I saw you leave carrying this stuff. I saw the food and I figured you really were seeing a girl and were going to eat dinner with her or something. I wasn&#039;t going to interrupt if it was true, but holy shit...&quot;
&gt;&quot;She looks like she belongs on a metal cover!&quot;
&gt;Mia growls slightly
&gt;&quot;Axel. You need to leave.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Why?&quot; he asks &quot;This is cool as fuck!&quot;
&gt;&quot;The government are looking for her.&quot;
&gt;Not 100% sure but you have reason to suspect this.
&gt;&quot;And? Not the first time I would have the feds on me.&quot;
&gt;You sigh
&gt;&quot;Axel, I am risking my ass with this as is. I don&#039;t want you getting into any trouble.&quot;
&gt;He makes a pouting face
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re my best friend, Axel. But listen to me this once, go home, don&#039;t come here, and don&#039;t tell anyone.
&gt;He goes quiet for a minute
&gt;&quot;Fine! but I am soooo going to draw her for a album cov- ow!&quot;
&gt;He feels at his back
&gt;His eyes roll and then he falls over
&gt;Mia Snarls and you turn to see her looking around, ready to attack.
&gt;Her movements slow down and you see her fall over as well.
&gt;What the fuck?
&gt;You turn to Axel again
&gt;He has a dart in his back
&gt;Motherfucker!
&gt;You run to Mia, and start shaking her to the best of your ability.
&gt;&quot;Mia! Mia wake up!&quot;
&gt;fuckity fuck shit.
&gt;&quot;Mia!-Tch!&quot; 
&gt;You feel a prick on your back.
&gt;You turn around, and see quite a few men start approaching you
&gt;A few of them are in suits.
&gt;Others are armed
&gt;Your vision begins to spin
&gt;You struggle to keep standing
&gt;You try to raise your fists
&gt;But you fall side first into Mia
&gt;And then everything goes black.

-----------------------PART 1 FIN-----------------

&gt;Your name is Thomas Lark.
&gt;You are a part of the equalizer program.
&gt;The subject that had previously escaped was re-captured, alongside one man who was directly involved with her.
&gt;Report says there was another man involved, but evidence shows he did not know of the subject for long.
&gt;And he was returned home.
&gt;You are to interrogate a man by the name of Anon.
&gt;Short for Anonymous. 
&gt;He was suspected by a few agents and he was tracked to keep note of his location.
&gt;His phone consistently lost connection near woods that were being looked over by drones.
&gt;You&#039;re organizing papers for the interrogation.
&gt;He should be waking up soon enough.
&gt;Once you finish organizing the papers, your take a clipboard, pencil, and start off to the interrogation room.

&gt;The guard standing outside of the room lets you in.
&gt;You walk in and He (anon) glares at you
&gt;He his handcuffed to a table that he is sitting at
&gt;&quot;Hello to you too.&quot; You politely respond
&gt;You say this as you move to sit across from him, adjusting your suit.
&gt;&quot;Where is she?&quot; he asks in an agitated tone
&gt;&quot;Whom?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Mia. Where. is. Mia.&quot;
&gt;Mia?
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t know a Mia. Unless you are talking about the other man at the location when you were captured. He was delivered to his home.&quot;
&gt;This seems to relieve him slightly, but his tone still stands firm
&gt;Not him. The wolf. The werewolf whatever. Mia. Where is she?&quot;
&gt;Hmm.. So he gave her a name.
&gt;You write this down before responding
&gt;&quot;Remember the situation you find yourself in, Mr. Anon.&quot;
&gt;He stays silent before you make eye contact with him and continue
&gt;&quot;She is fine. Being held till further notice.&quot;
&gt;He seems to relax noticeably after this
&gt;You note that he seems to have a relationship of sorts with her.
&gt;Time to properly start the interrogation
&gt;&quot;So, Anon, How long have you known about her?&quot;
&gt;He holds his silence for a few seconds before answering.
&gt;&quot;A few days.&quot; he answers.
&gt;&quot;Specifics.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Three or four days.&quot;
&gt;Hm.
&gt;You write this down
&gt;&quot;When and/or what circumstances did you meet her?&quot;
&gt;Again, silent for a moment.
&gt;&quot;I was on my way home from a friend&#039;s party. I was carrying some leftover food that he told me to take. I was walking.&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re writing it down as he says it
&gt;&quot;I had to take a piss, so I stepped into the woods for a moment to do so, and I set down the food behind me.&quot;
&gt;&quot;She must&#039;ve been nearby and smelled the food, so she took it.&quot;
&gt;You laugh inside your head, but keep a straight face.
&gt;&quot;I chased her for a while, but she quickly lost me.&quot;
&gt;&quot;And so I ended up getting lost. And as I wandered I found her.&quot;
&gt;&quot;She was not friendly. to say the least.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh? what happened, then?&quot;
&gt;&quot;She initially began to attack me, but ended up stopping partway to tell me to help her.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Tell you? and help her in what way?&quot;
&gt;&quot;She used her hands to tell me to remove a bullet from a wound she had.&quot;
&gt;So that is why she had that bandage on her body.
&gt;It was very poor, but  at least the wound was not infected.
&gt;&quot;Out of fear for my life, I did so. I had no tools on my person to remove it in an easy way, so I had to use my hands.&quot;
&gt;One report can confirm this; he was seen with bloody hands first night of contact.
&gt;&quot;Once I had removed it, she let me leave.&quot;
&gt;Why did he return to her, even though she initially showed hostility?
&gt;&quot;Why did you continue to visit her repeatedly, after that night?&quot; You ask
&gt;He sighs
&gt;&quot;I looked into bulletwounds, and I didn&#039;t want to leave it as is.&quot;
&gt;Stupid reason, but you write it down.
&gt;&quot;She eventually came to trust me&quot;
&gt;Trust?
&gt;Probably some Stockholm syndrome or suspension bridge effect happening.
&gt;Anon is pale, fear of his situation likely setting in
&gt;&quot;If  you cooperate enough with us, you may be let off easily.&quot;
&gt;He glances at you
&gt;&quot;Why didn&#039;t you contact authorities?&quot; You ask
&gt;&quot;I figured nobody would believe me if I told them what I saw&quot;
&gt;Solid reason, but doubtable.
&gt;&quot;What are you going to do with her?&quot; he asks
&gt;&quot;She will be fine.&quot; You shoot down his question.

&gt;This seems to make Anon more anxious
&gt;You continue with the interrogation
&gt;&quot;You said that she got friendly with you. Care to elaborate?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Why does it matter, it&#039;s not like-&quot;
&gt;&quot;It matters more than you think.&quot;
&gt;Anon goes quiet for a moment and then sighs
&gt;&quot;Since I was visiting on a regular basis, she started being happy to see me, and even hid me inside her den when she heard drones approaching.&quot;
&gt;Hm.
&gt;She was previously known for being aggressive towards staff.
&gt;&quot;Speaking of, how did you find out?&quot;
&gt;&quot;We tracked your phone.&quot;
&gt;&quot;What? I thought-&quot;
&gt;&quot;You thought since Snowden called us out, we would stop?&quot;
&gt;You chuckle
&gt;&quot;Even though your phone kept losing connection around the woods, we had a general location of your area.&quot;
&gt;&quot;And we tailed your friend.&quot;
&gt;Anon furrowed his brow in an angry fashion
&gt;&quot;You are to be held here while administration takes note of the facts and deals out a suitable punishment.&quot;
&gt;His skin flushes
&gt;&quot;Not in this room, of course. you&#039;ll have a cell. on-site.&quot;
&gt;You stand up &quot;That is all.&quot; 
&gt;And exit the room.

&gt;You step to the door and the guard lets you out.
&gt;You take a few steps and you&#039;re approached by a few coworkers
&gt;They&#039;re involved with the investigation as well.
&gt;Shannon, Forensic scientist
&gt;Christopher, Who looks over all evidence and evaluates it
&gt;And of course yourself, who has to interrogate and gather some evidence.

&gt;&quot;He doesn&#039;t seem to be lying, it adds up.&quot; Christopher opens up
&gt;&quot;Yeah, but he has a weak reason to have returned, if she did attack him.&quot; you respond
&gt;&quot;I believe the part about her attacking, given her past, but that is questionable.&quot; Christopher shrugs
&gt;&quot;We did find shoeprints in the den that match up to him.&quot; Shannon crosses her arms
&gt;You nod
&gt;all of this is pretty straightforward
&gt;Just have to go through the usual.
&gt;&quot;This seems simple enough, I&#039;m going to forward this to administration. Have him taken to the cell.&quot;
&gt;You turn and start off towards your office 
&gt;&quot;Have a good one.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You too.&quot; they both respond

&gt;You make your way to your desk 
&gt;Sit down
&gt;And start typing an email to administration
&gt;Halfway through you stop to organize all of the papers into a folder
&gt;You&#039;ll be giving this to your supervisor, who will check through it and forward it to administration.
&gt;&quot;Hey Lark.&quot;
&gt;Speak of the devil
&gt;You turn to your right to see said supervisor approaching you
&gt;Rachel Mccgough
&gt;Bossy, but has good intentions.
&gt;&quot;Yes Ma&#039;am?&quot;
&gt;She smriks &quot;I told you to just call me Rachel.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Rachel&quot;
&gt;&quot;Good enough. How are things coming with our nosy guy?&quot;
&gt;You finish up the folder and respond &quot;Everything was straightforward. I&#039;m typing the email for administration and here is the folder for you to check.&quot;
&gt;You offer it to her
&gt;She seems pleasantly surprised.
&gt;&quot;Oh? nice and quick.&quot;
&gt;&quot;And accurate.&quot; you add
&gt;She nods &quot;Of course.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re wanted at the second level to see the subject&quot;
&gt;You?
&gt;You&#039;re confused. &quot;May I ask why?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t know. something about her activity has changed. Or something along those lines. they want you to see and confirm something.&quot;
&gt;You shrug &quot;Very well then. I&#039;ll go after I finish this email.&quot;
&gt;Rachel nods and walks away, already reading over the papers you gave her.

&gt;You finish and send the email to administration.
&gt;You then stand up and make your way to the elevator
&gt;This was an underground facility. 
&gt;Made so that it is less likely to be seen from the surface.
&gt;Equalizer is a bioweapon program
&gt;With all efforts surrounding the subject
&gt;All previous attempts to make something similar to her have failed.
&gt;Nobody has managed to recreate her, either.
&gt;The subject is intended to be a last resort weapon.
&gt;Though she has a long way to go.
&gt;Chances are she&#039;ll just be a stepping stone for the intended product.

&gt;The elevator dings as you reach the second level. 
&gt;You make your way to the observatory
&gt;You are met by the usual scientists, but there is a large crack in the window
&gt;Which is bulletproof.
&gt;&quot;What is that from?&quot;
&gt;&quot;The subject jumped and slammed into it.&quot; an assistant responds
&gt;Damn...
&gt;The subject&#039;s holding room was large, but for her to jump and actually damage the window..
&gt;Surprising.
&gt;&quot;Mister Lark, Can you please come here?&quot;
&gt;A balding man beckons you over
&gt;You pass by the main window, looking through it and noting the cracks.
&gt;The subject was unconscious on the ground.
&gt;&quot;She had to be stopped before any damage happened. we&#039;re going to replace the glass and restrict her movement.&quot;
&gt;You nod
&gt;&quot;What did you need?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well.&quot; The man starts
&gt;&quot;She is different. but instead of just letting this out, I want you to see this. You&#039;ve seen her previous activity and I want you to decide what action is to be taken next.&quot;
&gt;He offers you a tablet, with a paused recording
&gt;&quot;This is the subject minutes after she initially woke.&quot;
&gt;You play the video
&gt;There are already scratches and a few dents in the walling.
&gt;She is furiously pacing back and forth, growling and wimpering
&gt;She&#039;s crying, on top of it all.
&gt;She&#039;s in distress.
&gt;She throws punches at the wall
&gt;She howls occasionally 
&gt;At one point, she crouches on all fours, and leaps, body-slamming into the window
&gt;What the fuck?
&gt;The video stops shortly after this

&gt;You look to the balding scientist
&gt;&quot;What do you think, Mr. Lark?&quot;
&gt;You look out the cracked window, at the subject
&gt;You refuse to believe it
&gt;&quot;She&#039;s just mad because we caught her. Reinstall the GPS chip while she is under.&quot;
&gt;Last time she had managed to crush it while escaping.
&gt;The man nods &quot;It was already planned, rest assured it will be done.&quot;
&gt;You nod 
&gt;&quot;Administration says to hold any tests until the interloper is properly dealt with. focus on one thing at a time.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I caught the message, sir.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Good. I was saying so just in case.&quot;
&gt;You look back to the man
&gt;&quot;I am sure her attitude will shift back to what we are used to.&quot;
&gt;He nods
&gt;&quot;Is that all?&quot; you ask
&gt;&quot;Yes sir.&quot; the man responds
&gt;You nod &quot;Keep up the good work&quot;
&gt;You then turn and leave, going back to the first level and to your desk.

----------POV CHANGE: ANON-------

&gt;This is terrifying
&gt;Sometimes, in the back of your head, you think to yourself that you regret returning to Mia
&gt;But you quickly shake the idea out of your mind
&gt;You&#039;re in a cell.
&gt;One bed, a nightstand, a tiny bathroom, and a small window that is on a metal door.
&gt;You have no idea where you are.
&gt;There is a guard standing right outside your door
&gt;Your heart is in your stomach
&gt;You wonder what is scarier: what they&#039;re going to do to Mia, or what they are going to do to you.
&gt;You have nothing to do but lay around.
&gt;You decide to do just this.
&gt;You have a feeling that even if you did ask for anything, you wouldn&#039;t get even a book.

&gt;You lay around for a few hours and you hear activity out your door.
&gt;&quot;Stay in your bed.&quot;
&gt;A rough voice from outside the door commands you
&gt;You sit up, but remain in the bed
&gt;The door opens, and a man carries in a tray with food.
&gt;He sets it on the nightstand, and then promptly leaves.
&gt;The door closes and is locked.
&gt;You look at the tray
&gt;You guess they don&#039;t have any facilities here
&gt;It&#039;s a bag of fast food.
&gt;Simple burger, fries, and a bottle of water.
&gt;You begrudgingly begin eating
&gt;Not like you have a choice, given your situation.
&gt;Once you finish eating, you shower. 
&gt;It feels weird to shower and get back into what you were already wearing
&gt;At least they gave you a towel.
&gt;After you put your clothes back on, you realize that they took your phone and satchel.
&gt;Ugh..
&gt;That sours your mood even further.
&gt;Even though you&#039;ve been knocked out, you&#039;re starting to feel tired, so you simply lay back down on the bed.
&gt;You hope Mia is okay
&gt;Your anxiety continues to grow
&gt;What about the job?
&gt;Your parents?
&gt;Your home?
&gt;Your consecutive login streak reward?
&gt;Hundreds of worries flood your mind until you turn to your side and do your best to sleep.
&gt;Forget all of it. At least till you wake up.

&gt;You find yourself in some woods.
&gt;They&#039;re familiar, but different.
&gt;You&#039;re speeding past trees
&gt;You look down
&gt;You&#039;re riding something
&gt;You immediately recognize it:
&gt;It&#039;s Mia.
&gt;She&#039;s running on all fours.
&gt;You&#039;re holding onto some fur on her back as she&#039;s running
&gt;You can feel the wind rushing past you
&gt;you lean down, holding on as tight as you can
&gt;It&#039;s scary, going this fast with only your own hands holding you down.
&gt;But you also feel safe.
&gt;You&#039;re also curious as to where you&#039;re going with her.
&gt;As you think this, she begins slowing down, changing from her four-legged sprint
&gt;To a two-legged sprint
&gt;Down to a two-legged jog
&gt;And she eventually stops, catching her breath.
&gt;You have no idea why or where she stopped due to her standing up, but you climb down to a point and eventually jump off of her back.
&gt;You look around
&gt;She stopped at a river
&gt;It&#039;s a freshwater river, at that.
&gt;Regardless of your own will, you go up to the river, get down on your knees, and start drinking handfuls of the water
&gt;In your mind you know this is unsafe.
&gt;Mia comes up alongside you and begins drinking as well, mimicking you.
&gt;You smile at her
&gt;But you feel heartbroken
&gt;Why?
&gt;Why do you feel so sad?
&gt;Mia leans her head close to you
&gt;You hold her muzzle, petting the top of her head
&gt;You want to cry
&gt;Something isn&#039;t right
&gt;None of this is right.
&gt;She pulls away
&gt;And draws a heart in the mud using her finger.
&gt;You feel pressure on your face
&gt;You want to cry so badly
&gt;But it refuses to come out
&gt;You chuckle, and reach to scratch the bottom of her chin
&gt;Mia, of course, starts wagging her tail
&gt;And in that moment
&gt;It all seems to get blown away by a breeze.
&gt;All of the colors begin to mix and move in one direction, as if blown on by something.
&gt;It then goes black
&gt;And you open your eyes
&gt;Tears flowing down the sides of your face.
&gt;Waking to this realization only hurts you more.
&gt;You ball your hands into fists.
&gt;You sit up and bang the wall of your cell with the side of a fist.
&gt;You want Mia back.
&gt;You barely knew her for a few days, but you want her back.

&gt;You manage to calm yourself and wash your face.
&gt;Though the fear still sits in the back of your mind
&gt;it&#039;s quiet, though.
&gt;You look out the window of the door, and see that the person guarding your door has changed, and that they are sitting, and reading a book next to your cell.
&gt;You aren&#039;t tired, so you decide to make an attempt to speak to them.
&gt;&quot;Hey.&quot; You calmly announce yourself
&gt;They continue reading their book
&gt;&quot;What is this place?&quot; you ask
&gt;He sends a glare at you, but answers.
&gt;&quot;An underground facility.&quot;
&gt;&quot;For what?&quot;
&gt;&quot;None of your business. Go to sleep.&quot;
&gt;Worth a try.
&gt;You step back and sit on the bed.
&gt;&quot;Can I get the time?&quot;
&gt;&quot;No.&quot;
&gt;Sigh.
&gt;You hear footsteps.
&gt;&quot;Sir.&quot; the guard speaks
&gt;You think you hear them stand up
&gt;&quot;Open the door, they&#039;re to be seen by administration. follow us.&quot;
&gt;A familiar voice.
&gt;There is silence for a second or two
&gt;&quot;A=Ahem&quot; you hear the guard clear their throat
&gt;&quot;Yes sir.&quot;
&gt;you see the man move in front of your door
&gt;Then the jingling of keys.
&gt;And the door opens
&gt;The guard motions towards you
&gt;&quot;Come on.&quot;
&gt;You stand up and nervously approach the doorway
&gt;You then see the other person speaking
&gt;It&#039;s the man who interrogated you.
&gt;What an asshole.
&gt;&quot;Lucky you that it&#039;s being concluded so quickly.&quot;
&gt;Lucky? you could die.
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t make any sudden movements, and stay behind me.&quot; he firmly says, before walking away
&gt;It catches you off guard, but you follow.
&gt;With the guard following behind you.
&gt;More dread sinks in
&gt;What do they plan to do?

---------- POV: ? ? ? -------------------

&gt;&quot;Come here!&quot;
&gt;A soft voice calls for you
&gt;There is a man squatting, in a lab coat, beckoning for you to come to him
&gt;You run up to him, and he pets your head
&gt;&quot;Good!&quot;
&gt;He smiles
&gt;Papa has always been kind to you
&gt;&quot;Ready for the day?&quot;
&gt;You nod agressively
&gt;&quot;Even better!&quot;
&gt;He takes you by your hand, and leads you out of your bedroom
&gt;His friend always follows both of you
&gt;His friend never speaks though
&gt;Papa&#039;s hand is so much bigger than yours
&gt;He says that you&#039;re very important 
&gt;And that you&#039;re special
&gt;You look different from papa, and you want to ask why, but you don&#039;t know how
&gt;Doesn&#039;t matter though, because you know that papa is papa!
&gt;Papa and his friend lead you to the &quot;playground&quot;
&gt;&quot;Go and play for a bit, okay?&quot;
&gt;He smiles and points to the entrance to the playground
&gt;You frown, tugging on his coat
&gt;He nods &quot;I know, you want me to come with, but Papa has to do something important, okay? I&#039;ll join you in a few minutes.&quot;
&gt;This makes you smile, and you go into the playground
&gt;The playground is fun
&gt;You get to run around, jump on things, and throw stuff around
&gt;Right as you start getting bored, papa walks in
&gt;&quot;Okay! whaddya wanna do?&#039;
&gt;He sends you a toothy grin
&gt;You get excited and collect some of your favorite things
&gt;You first give papa the soccer ball
&gt;&quot;Catch?&quot; he asks, raising an eyebrow
&gt;You nod, running back a few feet before looking at him
&gt;He smiles and tosses the ball
&gt;&quot;Catch!&quot;
&gt;He throws it across the room
&gt;You manage to run and catch it.
&gt;&quot;Nice one! Toss it back, now!&quot;
&gt;You nod, and toss the ball back to papa
&gt;He isn&#039;t too good at catching.
&gt;He tries to catch it, but it goes past him and lands on the floor
&gt;&quot;ahhk..&quot; He complains as he chases it and picks it up
&gt;You play catch with papa for a while, before he sits down, catching his breath
&gt;&quot;That was fun, but papa is tired.&quot;
&gt;You nod and go to sit with papa
&gt;He chuckles and hugs you
&gt;&quot;Very good.&quot;
&gt;You smile at him, and hug him back
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re growing so quickly.&quot;
&gt;You nod
&gt;&quot;Before you know it, you&#039;re gonna be bigger than papa!&quot;
&gt;He laughs
&gt;You giggle
&gt;&quot;Go play a bit more, then we can go onto the next part of the day&quot; Papa says
&gt;You nod and run around more, papa watching with a smile on his face.
&gt;You eventually get tired, and go over to papa
&gt;&quot;You ready?&quot; he asks, pulling out a bottle of water and giving it to you
&gt;You nod, and quickly gulp it down
&gt;Papa then takes you by your hand again, and leads you out of the playground, his friend following, of course.
&gt;He then takes you to a fun part
&gt;You get to press buttons and watch stuff!
&gt;Papa watches with you
&gt;You learn about a lot of things 
&gt;Like animals!

&gt;After following papa around for the day, he takes you back to your bedroom, and eats with you
&gt;Eating with papa is nice, he makes you laugh by making silly faces
&gt;Papa also helps wash you
&gt;Papa also makes warm air blow on you to dry you off, it feels nice!
&gt;He then tells you it&#039;s bedtime, and reads from a book for you till you fall asleep.

&gt;You wake up later, and papa is nowhere to be seen
&gt;This is normal, papa says he is busy.
&gt;You play a bit in your bedroom before you hear the door open
&gt;It&#039;s not papa
&gt;The man smiles and beckons for you 
&gt;&quot;C&#039;mere.&quot;
&gt;You shyly approach him, and he puts something around your neck, and then pulls on a chain attached to it
&gt;&quot;Come.&quot;
&gt;You resist, looking around for papa
&gt;You try your best to make the man know you&#039;re looking for papa
&gt;He ignores you and pulls on the chain again
&gt;&quot;I said come.&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re scared
&gt;Where is papa?
&gt;This man is mean.
&gt;When you don&#039;t follow, the man hits your head
&gt;&quot;Come!&quot;
&gt;You put your hands on your head
&gt;That really hurt..
&gt;You follow the man, sniffling
&gt;You go to some strange room
&gt;They tell you to do things you haven&#039;t done before
&gt;They hurt you when you&#039;re confused
&gt;You start crying but they don&#039;t stop
&gt;You want papa back
&gt;You&#039;re scared
&gt;They take you to other strange rooms and make you do strange tests
&gt;Again, they hurt you when you&#039;re confused and end up doing nothing
&gt;They poke you with things
&gt;People are hitting you
&gt;At the end of the day, you never saw papa, not even once.
&gt;The food is weird and gross
&gt;You have to wash by yourself
&gt;And you don&#039;t know how to dry off properly
&gt;You cry as you lay in your bed, and sleep, begging in your thoughts for papa to return tomorrow.

&gt;You wake up the following day to someone yelling at you
&gt;&quot;GET OVER HERE!&quot;
&gt;It&#039;s not papa
&gt;Where is papa?
&gt;You already feel tears welling in your eyes
&gt;You obey and follow the mean man
&gt;He puts the thing around your neck and pulls you along
&gt;You do more tests, and no matter how much you cry they won&#039;t get papa
&gt;They keep hitting you with things
&gt;They make you run until you&#039;re tired and then hurt you when you try and catch your breath
&gt;You bruise 
&gt;You bleed
&gt;They wont stop for anything, no matter how much you try and plead
&gt;Everything hurts
&gt;By the time everything is over, you&#039;re tired, beaten, bruised, sore, and afraid.
&gt;The food is horrible
&gt;Washing stings your cuts
&gt;Drying is horrible, you just want to lay in bed
&gt;You start crying
&gt;Begging for papa to come back
&gt;Thinking to yourself &quot;Papa please come back I&#039;m scared and all alone&quot;
&gt;Various thoughts like that.
&gt;You eventually dry off and sleep.

&gt;It&#039;s been quite some time since then.
&gt;You&#039;ve slept plenty of times
&gt;You&#039;re now about the size papa was.
&gt;You haven&#039;t seen him since that last day.
&gt;You&#039;ve done everything enough so that they no longer hurt you
&gt;it&#039;s just strenuous daily activity.
&gt;You still feel sad, but you manage to hold it in
&gt;They make you attack &quot;dummies&quot; occasionally
&gt;The food is horrible, but you&#039;ve eaten it so much that you&#039;ve forgotten what it tastes like.

&gt;More time passes
&gt;You&#039;re weary
&gt;At this point every day is repetitive.
&gt;You&#039;re bigger than everyone.
&gt;You occasionally remember papa.
&gt;Other than that you&#039;ve long forgotten a sense of affection from anyone
&gt;Why are you here?

&gt;Even more time passes.
&gt;Repeat tasks every day.
&gt;You hate everyone here.
&gt;Something is strange about this place.
&gt;You feel that there is much more than you see
&gt;You&#039;ve seen places that you&#039;ll barely fit in
&gt;You&#039;re at least twice the size of the humans.
&gt;You&#039;ve been paying attention to where everyone is.
&gt;Perhaps you could make a run for it.

-----------------POV: ANON--------------------

&gt;You&#039;ve been delivered to a medium sized room.
&gt;A few middle-aged men are sitting together and look at you
&gt;&quot;Mr. Anon.&quot; one of them blandly calls to you
&gt;You look to him
&gt;&quot;You are here due to your intervention against something that you should not have seen.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Then you shouldn&#039;t have let it out. and even then, you shouldn&#039;t have taken so long to find it.&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t get a reaction out of him, he just looks at you
&gt;&quot;Given the importance of the matter, I spent all of yesterday debating this with my colleagues here.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I still disagree.&quot; another one scoffs.
&gt;The man who interrogated you is behind you, and there are at least four guards.
&gt;&quot;Mr. Anon, We will give you a decision.&quot;
&gt;You make eye contact that you were previously avoiding
&gt;&quot;And do choose carefully.&quot;
&gt;You continue making eye contact, and he returns it for a moment, before looking at a sheet of paper in front of him
&gt;&quot;Mr. Anon. You can choose to serve a set amount of prison time for your interloping, or you can serve here until the project is concluded.&quot;
&gt;You feel The interrogator&#039;s eyes burning a hole in the back of your head
&gt;&quot;What does the serving ensue?&quot; you ask after a moment of silence
&gt;&quot;Exactly what you expect and want, Mr. Anon.&quot;
&gt;Your heart skips a beat
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll be with Mia?&quot;
&gt;The man laces his fingers together &quot;If that is what you wish to call her, yes.&quot;
&gt;&quot;The other choice is to serve a sentence and continue your normal life.&quot;
&gt;This is really a chance.
&gt;&quot;Do choose carefully. You cannot change your mind partway through.&quot;
&gt;Mia, of course. you&#039;ll be sacrificing yourself but she won&#039;t have to be alone.

&gt;&quot;Mia. I choose to work with her.&quot;
&gt;Lark speaks up &quot;Now just because you get to work here doesn&#039;t mea-&quot;
&gt;&quot;Lark.&quot; one of the mean speak up
&gt;He goes quiet
&gt;Lark.. probably a last name.
&gt;&quot;Evidence shows he will be the best to work with her. we made a mistake last time, now is a chance to better it.&quot;
&gt;Mistake?
&gt;Lark keeps his silence
&gt;&quot;Now, Mr. Anon. do know you will be acting according to our rules and regulations. you will have a strict regimen and will be undergoing training. Are you sure?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes, of course I&#039;m sure.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Very well, then. You&#039;re to undergo a physical checkup before your... &#039;Reunion&#039;&quot;
&gt;Eh, at not that bad.

&gt;You&#039;re taken to an on-site medical facility where you have your physical.
&gt;Escorted by Lark and a few guards
&gt;You can hear Lark grinding his teeth
&gt;They even take your measurements
&gt;Slightly uncomfortable, but you have no reason to complain
&gt;For your convenience they give you a digital watch
&gt;At least you have some way to keep track of time.
&gt;They then force you to take a shower, and give you a clean set of slothes
&gt;It&#039;s a pair of jeans and a white t-shirt
&gt;They tell you that your old clothes will be washed and kept in storage for you.
&gt;Whatever.
&gt;You&#039;re then taken through an elevator  and brought to a fairly long hallway.
&gt;they bring you to a door, where Lark has to bring out a keycard and open it
&gt;And there she was
&gt;She was laying on the ground
&gt;&quot;Is she-&quot;
&gt;&quot;Out cold, we had to put her under because she was attempting to break out.&quot;
&gt;that brings a wave of relief over you
&gt;You enter the room and approach mia
&gt;She&#039;s no longer wearing the gown you made
&gt;&quot;What about the clothing I gave her?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Not needed.&quot; is his response
&gt;You sigh
&gt;&quot;Can I at least get that?&quot;
&gt;&quot;She doesn&#039;t need to wear it.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Listen, she has tits.&quot;
&gt;Lark stares at you for a moment, before breaking out into laughter
&gt;You feel your ears start burning
&gt;&quot;BWAHAHAH&quot;
&gt;The guard has a smirk on his face, but eventually lark gathers himself
&gt;&quot;You make a fair point. with her being your only contact here, we don&#039;t need you getting..... desperate.&quot;
&gt;It sounds like he is mocking you, but he has a straight face
&gt;Your embarrassment is eternal, now etched into your brain
&gt;&quot;Get comfortable, your bed is in the back&quot;
&gt;With that, lark and the guard leave the room
&gt;You look around and see that there are cameras watching every angle of the room
&gt;Makes you shiver.
&gt;-The idea of being watched 24/7
&gt;A necessary sacrifice.
&gt;You see the bed, it&#039;s a small mattress with a pillow and a sheet.
&gt;There is a shower head attached to a hose.
&gt;No means of letting out what you took in, though. not that you can see.
&gt;You approach Mia.
&gt;She is asleep, as Lark said.
&gt;Overcome by happiness, you get on your knees and hold her to the best of your ability.
&gt;This seems to actually wake her ever so slightly
&gt;Her eyes start to open, with a whine escaping her mouth
&gt;&quot;Mia.&quot; you gently speak
&gt;She looks at you.
&gt;Tired, if not exhausted.
&gt;Her eyes widen, and she shakes her head while sitting up
&gt;You make sure to move out of the way
&gt;She stares at you
&gt;&quot;I know.. I shouldn&#039;t be here, but They gave me an ultimatum: to serve time elsewhere, or to stay here until the project is over.&quot;
&gt;She balls a hand into a fist and shakes her head
&gt;&quot;Of course I couldn&#039;t just leave you alone, Mia. Are you okay?&quot;
&gt;She stares at you for even longer, before she begins to frown
&gt;And then tears well in her eyes
&gt;She takes you up into her arms and hugs you
&gt;She&#039;s sobbing
&gt;To your human ears its strange, but she&#039;s sobbing.
&gt;&quot;Shhh, shhh... I&#039;m here, Mia.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ahhnnnn...&quot; She whines, you feel a few of her tears drop onto you
&gt;You open your arms and hold her
&gt;&quot;There there... I&#039;m happy to see you too. I thought you were tough, hmm?&quot; You tease, patting her back.
&gt;She sets you down and wipes away her tears, before reaching to noogie you
&gt;&quot;Ahh!&quot; you pseudo-complain, holding your head before chuckling
&gt;She smiles at you
&gt;You finish explaining what has happened up to this point
&gt;Mia is both happy and agitated with the fact that you&#039;re here.
&gt;And now, like in all of those movies, you need to plot your escape.
&gt;Both of them.
&gt;Of course you don&#039;t plan to sit here for a better part of your life!
&gt;And you don&#039;t plan to abandon Mia, either.
&gt;There is also the question of &quot;How?&quot;
&gt;this facility likely has numerous security measures.
&gt;Though in your mind, you are willing to bet they are to stop Mia.
&gt;There is likely minimum security for personnel.
&gt;But you have your priorities.
&gt;Looking around again, you see that there is a one-way window at the ceiling
&gt;you spot the cameras, again.
&gt;Ventilation shafts
&gt;Probably how they put Mia under when she was causing problems for them.
&gt;If you do plan to escape, detail is everything.

&gt;You spend the rest of the day talking with Mia.
&gt;When you do get food, Mia’s food looks disgusting.
&gt;Not even dog food.
&gt;It’s some kind of slop.
&gt;You decide to share some of your food with her, at least to coat whatever ungodly taste it has.
&gt;Though yours isn’t much better.
&gt;Yours is probably nutrient-focused.
&gt;Once you are done eating, you go and lay in the bed that Lark previously mentioned.
&gt;It’s a mattress with a sheet, and two pillows.
&gt;You have no idea why it’s here, Mia would never fit on this.
&gt;You’re trying to get comfortable, when Mia taps on your shoulder
&gt;You turn to look at her “Hm?”
&gt;She notions towards the hose with the showerhead attached to it
&gt;It takes you a moment, but you realize she wants you to wash her
&gt;There’s no soap, but if she wants you to, you’ll do so.
&gt;”Alright, let’s wash you down.”
&gt;You get up and walk over, she follows you, her tail wagging a few times.
&gt;You take the showerhead, and there is a button on it
&gt;There is a slant to the flooring over in this area. It leads to a drain
&gt;Mia sits in front of you, with her back to you.
&gt;You point the showerhead away from you, and press the button.
&gt;As you expected, this turned it on, and water starts flowing out of it.
&gt;You feel the water
&gt;It’s warm, but barely.
&gt;”You ready?” You ask her
&gt;She smiles and nods
&gt;Seeing her smile melts your heart slightly.
&gt;You proceed to start washing her back
&gt;Though it’s more like rinsing.
&gt;Though you do wash dirt off of her
&gt;Unable to stop your urge, you reach to scratch her back while doing this
&gt;It helps loosen any dirt on her back, and she seems to absolutely love it
&gt;So much so you have to take hold of her tail so it stops hitting you
&gt;You rinse her tail as well, though you decide not to scratch there…
&gt;Her fur is a lot darker when it’s wet
&gt;It’s to be expected
&gt;It goes from red, brown and white to an almost black, dark red, and grey color.
&gt;She turns her side towards you
&gt;Your decision just sets in
&gt;You’re going to wash her stomach and legs, too.
&gt;You feel a blush setting in, and you struggle to hide it.
&gt;”H-Hey.”
&gt;She looks at you with a questioning look on her face
&gt;”Can you wash your front and legs by yourself?” You ask, looking away
&gt;She looks disappointed, but nods
&gt;You feel bad, but you have some dignity to hold on to.
&gt;You reach out with the showerhead in hand
&gt;She takes it, and with her hands being bigger than yours, she has some initial problems getting a grip on it.
&gt;You step away, turning your back
&gt;”Just get my attention when you’re done” you say
&gt;You hear a grunt in response.

&gt;A few minutes later, you hear another grunt
&gt;You turn
&gt;She is holding the showerhead towards you, with it still on.
&gt;You can also see her entire soaked front
&gt;Breasts and all
&gt;Good thing there is a bit of extra fur down below.
&gt;You approach, blushing.
&gt;You take the showerhead and turn it off, then set it down
&gt;You clear your throat.
&gt;”N-Now, is there any way for you to dry yourself off?”
&gt;She shakes her head
&gt;What a pain.
&gt;She points to the bed
&gt;&quot;Hm? what is it?&quot;
&gt;She points to you, and then the bed
&gt;&quot;You want me to go to sleep?&quot;
&gt;She nods
&gt;She probably means &#039;it&#039;s fine if you want to go sleep&#039;.
&gt;You look into her eyes for a moment
&gt;&quot;Alright then. I&#039;ll see you tomorrow, Mia.&quot;
&gt;She smiles and nods at you, reaching to pat your head with a wet hand
&gt;You proceed to go and lay down.
&gt;Using a pillow to cover your head so the light doesn&#039;t bother you
&gt;It&#039;s annoying to do so because you aren&#039;t used to sleeping while clothed, but you eventually sleep.

&gt;It is the next day.
&gt;Breakfast was brief. 
&gt;You&#039;re running laps in some sort of gym
&gt;You feel as if your lungs are going to collapse
&gt;&quot;DON&#039;T SLOW DOWN! SLOW DOWN AND YOU&#039;RE GOING TO BE REMOVED FROM THIS PROGRAM!&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t see them, but they&#039;re shouting at you.
&gt;Half hour passes
&gt;Fear had kept you from stopping
&gt;They finally tell you that you can stop.
&gt;You fall on your ass, gasping for air
&gt;Your legs feel like soggy noodles.
&gt;&quot;Ten minutes, then we move to abdomen.&quot;
&gt;fuuck.
&gt;The ten minutes seem to pass so quickly.
&gt;You&#039;re then doing sit-ups.
&gt;Two hundred of them
&gt;You feel as if your back is going to give out.
&gt;You fear that whoever is yelling at you plans to keep their word if you don&#039;t make it
&gt;Your body is screaming at you to stop
&gt;But your heart is screaming for you to keep going.
&gt;Mia was left in the room, though she was unhappy to see you leave.
&gt;Some time later, you&#039;ve finished and thrown your shirt off so you can sweat without your shirt sticking to you
&gt;You&#039;re given fifteen minutes to cool down this time
&gt;Your body is hell.
&gt;It still feels too short.
&gt;You&#039;re then told to start doing pull-ups.
&gt;No specific amount, just go.
&gt;You&#039;ve done pull-ups before, but are nowhere near prepared for this.
&gt;Its like every muscle in your body is being torn apart.
&gt;You keep going
&gt;And going
&gt;And going
&gt;You eventually fall.
&gt;Your arms refuse to move
&gt;Your vision blurs and then fades to black
&gt;You soon then wake up to water being poured onto your face
&gt;Gasping for air, you manage to roll over onto your side
&gt;You manage to turn your eyes to look at whoever did this.
&gt;It&#039;s lark.
&gt;&quot;You did well enough, now for tactical training.&quot;
&gt;Oh no.

&gt;With minor assistance, you put your shirt back on and are brought to a room with a TV and a desk. Like ones you would see in high school.
&gt;You are sat there and then everyone leaves the room.
&gt;You are briefly told to pay attention.
&gt;Lucky you. All you have to do is watch some training videos this time. 
&gt;You sit there for a few hours. your body begins to feel sore, and your legs are still unstable.
&gt;You appreciate the time to cool down, though.
&gt;soon enough, the video stops, and you&#039;re brought a piece of paper and a pencil.
&gt;A quiz on the video?
&gt;Seems almost childish, but you fill it out.
&gt;you finish, and announce as such.
&gt;Turns out there is a guard that was ready to pick it up, and he takes it.
&gt;Silence then sets in.
&gt;&quot;We are looking it over, be patient.&quot;
&gt;That was Lark.
&gt;You lounge in your seat and wait
&gt;You guess that ten minutes or so pass.
&gt;Eventually lark speaks again:
&gt;&quot;Good enough, break for lunch. Stay there, your food will be brought to you.&quot;
&gt;Huzzah, more lazing around.
&gt;You&#039;re brought two bottles of water, and a tray of food similar to what you had for dinner yesterday.
&gt;Your hunger then catches up with you and you devour your meal.

&gt;Once you were finished with lunch, you&#039;re given some time to allow your food to digest.
&gt;You are then told to work out more. 
&gt;But this time it is freeform.
&gt;Or choose what you want to do.
&gt;Eugh.
&gt;You spend the rest of your day doing just that.
&gt;when the afternoon comes, they take you to a shower room and give you a clean set of clothing.
&gt;Its exactly the same.
&gt;White t-shirt, jeans.
&gt;You are then taken back to Mia&#039;s chamber.
&gt;You weakly smile at her as you enter
&gt;She is ecstatic to see you
&gt;She quickly comes up to you and hugs you, wagging her tail.
&gt;You return the hug and pat her, before pulling away
&gt;She makes eye contact and notices your exaustion
&gt;Her mood seems to droop a bit, but she softly smiles at you, and pulls you close.
&gt;She sits and leans you into her
&gt;&#039;Oh hey. She is wearing her dress..&#039; You think to yourself
&gt;You didn&#039;t notice this till now
&gt;&#039;That&#039;s nice..&#039;
&gt;&#039;And Soft..&#039;
&gt;You know you should stay awake for dinner, but you end up falling asleep on Mia.
&gt;Mia wakes you up when food does arrive, though.
&gt;Your drowsily eat your meal, and then go to lay down.
&gt;Mia follows you, and then lays down next to your bed.
&gt;Remembering that all of this is for her, allows you to rest a bit better.

&gt;The following two months were a nightmare.
&gt;Every day is training physical and then a variety.
&gt;Your body has little time to recover.
&gt;Everything gets more and more intense.
&gt;Run.
&gt;Incline treadmill.
&gt;Core exercise.
&gt;Knee-to-elbow.
&gt;Pull-ups.
&gt;Hanging sit-ups.
&gt;Push-ups.
&gt;Lift weights.
&gt;Eventual CQC training.
&gt;You see the fruits of your training.
&gt;Soon after this, you were brought an instructor.
&gt;You’re being taught martial arts.
&gt;First thing you notice is the calluses this man has on his knuckles
&gt;And then that he is a monk of sorts.
&gt;Every day you’re being beat to shit by this man.
&gt;The first time you actually managed to block a blow, you were swiftly knocked on your ass by something you couldn’t see.
&gt;”What good are your muscles if you cannot properly use them?” He asks
&gt;His comments piss you off.
&gt;”You attack, but your spirit does not follow.”
&gt;What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
&gt;”Why do you fight?”
&gt;”Fuck off!” you shout, throwing a punch
&gt;Your attack is deflected and in a split second, you’re hit in your stomach.
&gt;First, all the air is knocked from your lungs
&gt;You grasp at your abdomen, stumbling backwards,
&gt;And then you vomit your lunch.
&gt;”HURAGHH”
&gt;”Come, we are not done yet.” His tone does not change. No matter what.

&gt;Mia tries her best to help you relax.
&gt;You don’t know what she does, but she is always in the room when you return.
&gt;You show your appreciation, and talk with her a bit.
&gt;You’ve started skipping dinner, letting Mia take it.
&gt;She seems to dislike this change, but eventually starts eating it.
&gt;It has gotten to the point where she holds you as you sleep.
&gt;You sleep in your bed, but you wake up in her arms
&gt;It makes you smile, just a little bit.
&gt;She’s warm, and soft.
&gt;This is all for her.
&gt;Remembering her, and this fact, seems to relieve you, even if it is by some small amount.
&gt;You’ve been paying attention to the hallways
&gt;You have the initial hallways memorized.
&gt;You can occasionally hear the elevator arrive.
&gt;The guards are armed.
&gt;Strange guns.
&gt;You hope they’re lethal.
&gt;Because if your escape fails, you are doomed. 
&gt;Tranq darts would only make it worse.
&gt;Worse for both of you and it would spell both of your dooms.

&gt;You’ve began to lose track of time.
&gt;Your master is pleased.
&gt;You’ve begun to respect him, even though you never asked for this training.
&gt;He says you have been improving
&gt;You think so as well.
&gt;More weeks pass
&gt;you manage to block one attack
&gt;Then two
&gt;Three
&gt;And reset
&gt;He changes his rhythm.
&gt;One
&gt;Two
&gt;Three
&gt;Your eventually get that down.
&gt;”Retaliate.” He says.
&gt;You attempt to throw a punch
&gt;Deflected
&gt;Knocked on your ass
&gt;It..
&gt;Hurts less.
&gt;You get back up and continue again
&gt;You can see his movements
&gt;Before, they were too fast.
&gt;This is possible.

&gt;Your progress, and you actually manage to retaliate to some extent.
&gt;You never land an attack, but you can reliably attempt to do so without repercussion. 

&gt;More time passes by.
&gt;You can make him take a step.
&gt;A single step at a time, but you know he isn’t going all out.
&gt;He smiles
&gt;”You’ve found your reason for fighting.” He says this while you’re sparring
&gt;Have you?
&gt;You have to think about it, in the brief moments of the fight
&gt;Well no shit it’s Mia.
&gt;She really does mean a lot to you.
&gt;It may be just because you’ve been down here for so long, but..
&gt;Dare you say you love her?
&gt;You have mixed feelings about this realization.
&gt;”Don’t falter.” He says
&gt;Your thinking has you caught off guard, and you’re kicked to the side
&gt;You don’t fall, however.
&gt;You keep your footing.
&gt;He smiles at you again
&gt;”We’re done here.” He says, turning towards the door
&gt;”There is plenty more I can teach you, but I think it would be better if you teach yourself from this point forward. May our paths cross again, Mr. Anon.”
&gt;You never did learn his name.

&gt;He left the room, and you are left in silence.
&gt;What is this sense of loss?
&gt;It is the same feeling that you had when you left home
&gt;You are grown, and you must make your own way.
&gt;You feel emotion stir within you
&gt;You hated him initially.
&gt;Nothing but training and being beaten
&gt;But each day was a lesson
&gt;Nonverbal, but it was a lesson.
&gt;”Don’t be rash.”
&gt;”Be hardy and prepared.”
&gt;”Don’t think. Act.”
&gt;He may have been being paid
&gt;But you feel as if you have the upper hand, now.

&gt;You’re told to practice some more.
&gt;They gave you a few different practice dummies
&gt;Punching bag, wing chun dummy, targets, the sorts.
&gt;This is where another realization comes to you
&gt;You can visualize attacks coming from these dummies, if you thought about it.
&gt;It was more than just practice, then.
&gt;This was training, even now. 

&gt;You were eventually sent back to be with Mia.
&gt;However, Mia seemed to be roughed up as well.
&gt;Her dress was off in another side of the room
&gt;She was attempting to turn on the showerhead so that she could clean herself.
&gt;And her hands were coated in blood
&gt;”Mia.” You call to her, shocked.
&gt;She looks at you
&gt;Her eyes widen, and her ears fold down.

&gt;”Mia.. What’s happened?” you ask, stepping towards her
&gt;She looks down at her hands, and scrambles to turn on the showerhead
&gt;”Mia!” you call again, louder.
&gt;she drops the showerhead, and slumps.
&gt;She sits down and huffs
&gt;”What happened?” you repeat your question, getting closer
&gt;She averts her gaze from you
&gt;”MIA!” you shout, losing your patience in a mix of fear and agitation
&gt;This seems to make her jump and she cowers slightly, but using the blood on her hands she writes:
&gt;”Fight”
&gt;It’s sloppy, but you can read it.
&gt;”Fight? Mia, who did you fight?”
&gt;She doesn’t do anything for a moment, then writes:
&gt;”Similar”
&gt;Mia then points to herself
&gt;It takes you a moment
&gt;Then it hits you
&gt;Similar?
&gt;There are others like Mia?
&gt;”Mia.” You take a deep breath
&gt;She seems scared about your reaction
&gt;”There are others like you?” you ask, looking up at her
&gt;She nods
&gt;Anxiety fills you
&gt;Mia is risking her life.
&gt;She is fighting for her life.
&gt;This is survival of fittest for her.
&gt;What will happen to you if she dies?
&gt;Your worries multiply.
&gt;Being so caught up in thought you forget Mia is still right in front of you
&gt;You look into her eyes
&gt;”I’m glad you’re alright, Mia.” 
&gt;Your voice falters, and you go to hug her
&gt;She moves to return the hug, but stops
&gt;Probably the blood on her hands.

&gt;You end up helping Mia wash down, and talk to her a lot more than usual.
&gt;You tell her about human life.
&gt;this seems to upset her slightly.
&gt;Once she dries off, and both of you finish eating, she puts the gown you made back on, and you willingly let her hold you as she lays down to rest
&gt;She really is like a big pillow.
&gt;At least when she’s like this.

&gt;It’s the following day
&gt;Your attitude has shifted dramatically
&gt;With the risk of Mia dying at any moment, or during any day, you’ve began thinking about your escape plan.
&gt;You have been cooperating long enough that you believe they don’t suspect you.
&gt;However this has hundreds of risks.
&gt;First: You have no means to convey a plan to Mia, if you had one.
&gt;Second: You don’t know how far down you are. You are only aware of the elevator.
&gt;Said elevator is a fair size for the sake of easily moving construction materials or furniture. 
&gt;However there is likely a stairwell for the event of an elevator failure or fire hazard.
&gt;At least your logic tells you this.
&gt;You cannot be one-hundred percent sure.
&gt;Today they decided they’d let you get your hair cut, and shave off any facial hair.
&gt;You just get your usual.
&gt;After this, you return to training.
&gt;While training, you realize something
&gt;You have been pushing your body for months, went through grueling punishment and martial arts training by that monk for what you would think was half a year
&gt;Yet your body does not fully reflect this.
&gt;While training, you call out:
&gt;”Why does my body look like this, even after all of this training and practice?”
&gt;Silence for a moment
&gt;You hear a man respond. Not lark, but his answer will do.
&gt;”Muscle density. You are not a bodybuilder, you are a weapon.”
&gt;Muscle density?
&gt;”Explain further, please.”
&gt;You continue your routine
&gt;There is silence, and then the man speaks again
&gt;”Given your diet and the exercise, your muscles are denser and generate more strength than a person who only cares about the SIZE of their muscles. If we were to compare you to someone like Phil Heath… Your muscle is more function, less for looks.”
&gt;Fair enough.
&gt;Your day continues as normal.

&gt;You return to the room, anxiety filling your heart
&gt;But also newfound purpose.
&gt;Mia is fine, she is washing again however.
&gt;You’re relieved.
&gt;Mia..
&gt;You find yourself going over to her and hugging her instinctively, even if she is soaked with water.
&gt;You surprise her, but she returns the affection.
&gt;Again, you spend a lot of time talking to her, and you rest in her embrace
&gt;However, before going to sleep, you try to convey your ideas.
&gt;You get her attention, but you don’t know if she particularly understands
&gt;You restart to writing on her fur with your fingers
&gt;’ESCAPE’
&gt;’SOON’
&gt;You think you feel her heart skip a beat
&gt;That is reason enough for you think she understood you.

&gt;More time passes. 
&gt;Eventually it seems hopeless.
&gt;You don’t know where they take Mia, or what happens.
&gt;You’ll both have to be out of your shared room in order to even make an attempt.
&gt;Even then there are guards with those strange weapons 
&gt;Lark seems to never lighten up on you, either.
&gt;But eventually there was a slipup.
&gt;You and Mia see each other in the white hallways.
&gt;She’s cuffed.
&gt;There are guards with her, too.
&gt;This is probably a safety protocol given last time.
&gt;Your eyes widen, and all it takes is one shout:
&gt;This is the chance.
&gt;Now or never.
&gt;Freedom or doom.
&gt;”MIA!!!”
&gt;Your voice seemingly booms in the hallways.
&gt;In a split second, Mia’s fur seems to stand on end.
&gt;You think you see her muscles ripple beneath her fur
&gt;And with a single, sudden pull, she snaps the chains of her cuffs.
&gt;You spin on your feet, and send an overhand right punch into one of the two guards that were accompanying you 
&gt;Your training comes to fruition.
&gt;The guard is sent back a few feet and falls over
&gt;You presume he is knocked out.
&gt;You follow up the second guard with a kick to his side
&gt;You can feel and hear his ribs break through your kick
&gt;No time to feel bad.
&gt;Your blood is freezing.
&gt;You’re horrified, and excited.
&gt;Mia has swiftly taken care of the guard detail that were following her.
&gt;She looks at you expectantly.

&gt;With no time to waste, you tell her to follow you and break into a full sprint.
&gt;You already feel free
&gt;But it’s not enough.
&gt;You and Mia tear your way through an office room, quickly dispatching other guards that are caught off guard.
&gt;You hit the elevator button to call the elevator to you, and sprint, looking for a stairwell
&gt;Mia is following you, but looks a bit confused.
&gt;It has to be one or the other
&gt;A stairwell would be better but you best prepare the elevator just in case
&gt;Soon, you hear alarms going off
&gt;Fuck
&gt;You snarl to yourself in agitation
&gt;It was going to happen eventually.
&gt;You manage to find a stairwell, but the doors seem to have automatically locked
&gt;”Fuck!” you shout in anger
&gt; A robotic voice calls over the intercoms:
&gt;”Dispensing airborne narcotic.”
&gt;Your heart plummets
&gt;”Mia, take a deep breath and hold it!”
&gt;She does exactly this.
&gt;You proceed to run back to the elevator, but it seems to have stopped
&gt;You start beating on the door in a defiant fury
&gt;Mia calmly pushes you aside
&gt;huh?
&gt;she then pries the elevator doors open
&gt;Well shit, you could’ve done that!
&gt;Mia reaches out and grabs you, holding you close
&gt;What happened next caused you to almost shit yourself
&gt;Mia began leaping on the inside of the elevator shaft, climbing upwards.
&gt;you look down
&gt;The facility goes hundreds of feet deep
&gt;And there are more just like Mia…
&gt;The thought makes you shiver.
&gt;You also realize that it was a multi lift system, now.
&gt;You were on a singular elevator previously.
&gt;Meaning-
&gt;You look up
&gt;It’s a clear fucking sprint for the exit! 
&gt;Your heart races with excitement
&gt;Mia seems to know what to do from this point
&gt;She is almost flying at breakneck speeds up this shaft, and once she reaches the top, she slams shoulder-first into the elevator door.
&gt;The alarm is still blaring, but Mia take no time to look around
&gt;And you’re glad she didn’t 
&gt;Soldiers were scrambling, and Mia caught them off guard
&gt;The colors almost blur and you and hear and now tearing through more hallways
&gt;And there it is!
&gt;Metal shutters were closing on windows
&gt;Nonono!
&gt;NO!
&gt;”Go, Mia!” You shout, in some unfamiliar tone that you had never yelled out before.
&gt;Mia is closing in
&gt;Suddenly, she covers you with her other hand
&gt;You feel her suddenly fall, and hear glass shattering.
&gt;Another moment later, Mia has you grab onto her back as she starts sprinting on all fours
&gt;You quickly look around in disbelief.
&gt;Middle of nowhere
&gt;Technically speaking, you are in a forest of sorts, but there is no civilization for miles. 
&gt;You feel the wind in your hair
&gt;You hear Mia sprinting
&gt;It worked
&gt;You’re free.
&gt;”Atta girl, Mia!”
&gt;Your heart lightens
&gt;Again, you find yourself shouting
&gt;Though this time, in victory, and happiness.

&gt;Mia has been sprinting for hours, though there is no sign of you being chased
&gt;She eventually stops, only to signal for you to feel the nape of her neck.
&gt;You do so, and you find small, stuff spot.
&gt;”What’s this?” You ask her
&gt;Mia then signals for you to hit her
&gt;”What?”
&gt;She urgently repeats the motion
&gt;Confused, you do so
&gt;And hear a snap
&gt;She seems relieved
&gt;And she continues to sprint more

&gt;it’s sunset, and Mia has finally stopped
&gt;But to what avail
&gt;You can see that her face has gone partially pink, and that she is panting, giving you a strange look.

&gt;”Mia… Are you alright?”
&gt;You have a bad feeling building in your stomach
&gt;She comes closer to you, still panting
&gt;You were leaning against a tree, getting ready to sleep
&gt;She gets on her hands and knees as she gets close 
&gt;Your heart starts pounding
&gt;ohgodohgod
&gt;She seems to stop for a moment, before leaning forward and giving you a full-on kiss
&gt;”Mmh!?”
&gt;You physically panic for a moment
&gt;But why is it that you’re so happy?
&gt;’Mia- this isn’t what I-‘
&gt;You interrupt your own thoughts
&gt;This is exactly what you were wanting
&gt;You had fallen for her.
&gt;She’s not even human
&gt;Is it wrong that the knowledge of that kind of excites you?
&gt;She’s sweet
&gt;She’s smart
&gt;Fun to be around.
&gt; You can understand how she feels.
&gt;You had known her for so long, yet you wouldn’t dare realize these feelings given where you were.
&gt;As you continue the list in your mind, you’ve taken your hands up to the sides of her head and return the kiss
&gt;Considering how much bigger she is compared to you, it’s a bit sloppy, but the emotion behind it is still the same.
&gt;She slowly reaches to take one of your hands and move it to her breasts
&gt;You squeeze and feel in slow, fluid motions
&gt;She whines quietly in support of your action.
&gt;You quickly reach full mast
&gt;Eventually, Mia breaks the kiss and brushes your pants with a hand, looking at you expectantly
&gt;You, of course, strip down, your erection in clear view
&gt;You blush, and scratch the back of your head, a bit confused as for the next course of action
&gt;Mia, on the other hand, gropes herself and shutters, letting out a long breath, with a pleased look on her still pink face and her tail wagging.
&gt;Her inner thighs are wet, you notice.
&gt;She notions for you to sit back down, which you do.
&gt;She then affectionately nuzzles your neck, just below your jaw.
&gt;You respond by petting her, and rubbing her ears.
&gt;She smiles and then moves down to your phallus
&gt;You feel your face heat up
&gt;She looks up at you, and lets out what you are assuming was a giggle, before opening her mouth, taking your length into it
&gt;Holy hell.
&gt;Mia’s mouth is so warm
&gt;You could process the factors of why, but you quickly sum it up to her being bigger, and thus producing more heat.
&gt;She slowly moves her head up and down your shaft, using her tongue in ways you had never thought previously possible
&gt;Your body shudders with pleasure, as you let out a gasp and moan
&gt;You reach to take hold of her head, increasing pace
&gt;But soon after this she pulls away, gazing into your eyes and licking her lips
&gt;In an almost sensual way.
&gt;She likes the way you taste.
&gt;She reaches out for your hand
&gt;You let her take it
&gt;Mia pulls you closer as she leans down on her back, presenting herself to you
&gt;You reach and manage to take hold of her hips, and align yourself
&gt;Mia is yours.

&gt;You press yourself into her, and she lets out a pleased whimper in response
&gt;Despite the size difference, she feels amazing.
&gt;You start off slow, moving back and forth with gentle motions
&gt;Mia continues to moan and give you lustful looks, egging you on
&gt;Giving in to the requests, you pick up your pace, and thrust harder.
&gt;Mia seems to gasp, and grabs one of her breasts
&gt;”Ahhn…” she lets out a whine
&gt;You continue at this pace, and she seems to quickly reach her climax
&gt;She shudders for a moment, and reaches to pull you close, propping herself up with her arms
&gt;You then feel her gush onto your length
&gt;”A-Annhhhh!” she almost howls, having to muffle herself
&gt;You affectionately rub her belly and then reach for a breast
&gt;”Is this your first time?” You ask in a sweet tone of voice
&gt;She looks into your eyes, with some embarrassment setting in, she nods, looking away.
&gt;You continue, now starting a full-on assault on her.
&gt;Her arms shake but she manages to barely keep herself held up as she watches you
&gt;”Ahh.. Ahh..” she whines and whimpers, panting.
&gt;The lewd sound of your nethers colliding with her wetness egg you on
&gt;Alongside her submissive whimpers.
&gt;You get to a point where she starts to quiver ever so slightly with each thrust
&gt;She climaxes again
&gt;One of her arms gives out, and she has to place it over her mouth as she moans loudly, a bit of drool seeping from her maw
&gt;You don’t stop, still going
&gt;You start to feel familiar pressure build up as well.
&gt;She shakes and quivers as you begin to urgently thrust into her faster and harder than before.
&gt;She seems to know
&gt;She reaches to put her arms around you, pulling you closer, 
&gt;With one final thrust, you go balls deep into her, releasing into her your pent-up load.
&gt;She shivers as this happens, letting out one long whine, and slowly leans back onto the ground, pulling you up to her breasts, and laying you on her

&gt;You’re spent, what else is there to say?
&gt;Your legs feel like wet noodles
&gt;Mia is petting you, panting
&gt;You smile, and look up into her eyes
&gt;she was busy catching her breath, but she notices you and returns the gaze
&gt;She smiles back
&gt;”I’ve loved you for a while, you know?” you manage to weakly speak
&gt;Her eyes soften, and she nods
&gt;”You, too?” You ask
&gt;She nods again, now wrapping her arms around you in a big hug.
&gt;You return the hug, but quickly fall asleep in her embrace.

----------------------------------------EPILOGUE----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------POV: ANDY “AXEL” HOLDT-----------------------------------
&gt;Anon has been missing for almost a year.
&gt;Nobody seems to help.
&gt;You had suddenly woken in your house again, and Anon was gone.
&gt;You had realized chances are he got caught by the big man, but what were you supposed to do? Dial 911?
&gt;Guilt had driven you to the brink of insanity.
&gt;Your best friend could be dead
&gt;His Family came to you, asking about him, but they would think you’re insane if you told them about that.
&gt;His house was wiped clean and a “FOR SALE” sign was placed out front
&gt;It’s like he never existed.

&gt;But now
&gt;Now the tone has changed.
&gt;You have noticed a sketchy looking vehicle sitting in your neighborhood. 
&gt;Anon appeared on the news
&gt;He’s apparently one of the most wanted now.
&gt;Bunch of bullshit.
&gt;”Treason” “Murder” “Robbery”
&gt;He must’ve gotten out.
&gt;But you can barely recognize him.
&gt;He is.. different
&gt;Not only has he physically changed, but with the look on his face
&gt;He looks like he’s been in a war
&gt;Or that there is going to be a war.
&gt;You’ve been keeping your cool.
&gt;You’re likely suspect due to your relationship to him.
&gt;All you can do is bide your time, hope the best for him, and if he wants it, to help him.
&gt;I’m here for you, buddy.</textarea>
