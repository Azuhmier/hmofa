Inside, it smelled like a hospital. The combination of sickly sweet smelling lemon cleaner and antibacterial soaps made it uncomfortably clinical.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I had been checked into a methadone clinic, called &quot;Gateway To Prevention&quot;, whatever that&#039;s supposed to mean. I&#039;ll admit, I fucked up. After having my usual customers come around for their fix, I decided to have me a nice Friday night, and I suppose I took a little bit more H than I should have. I woke up in the ER with my (now) ex-girlfriend Kris standing by my hospital bed, with a look of sadness at how pathetic I must have been laying there after almost dying from an overdose. Kris had gotten into AA, got clean about five months ago, and I guess having a junkie loser heroin dealer for a boyfriend was dragging her down. She said she did this out of good will or something to the effect, and that we were threw. The next thing I knew after speaking with the doctor, I got checked into here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So I guess this is what rock bottom&#039;s like?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I wouldn&#039;t have lasted at all in AA, I&#039;ve been doing H for as long as I&#039;ve dealt it, twelve years. It&#039;s been in my system so long that if I quit cold turkey, or even weened off of it, the dope sickness would kill me. So now I&#039;m here, on what they call &quot;replacement therapy&quot;, trading in one drug for another. Looking back, I kinda wished Kris hadn&#039;t taken me to the ER. I deserved to die that night, I&#039;d been wanting to do it myself for a while, but couldn&#039;t find the energy to put my Glock to my temple from being so strung out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I didn&#039;t deserve to be clean. I&#039;d flushed all my opportunities in life down for sweet Miss Heroin. I dropped out of college, quit my job working part time at a bank, alienated myself from my family. I did it all for her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I&#039;m no Nostradamus, but I know exactly how things were gonna play out here: They&#039;d give me the methadone, I&#039;d go through the motions of taking it, saying I&#039;m clean, they&#039;d keep tabs on me probably, and I&#039;d be back with her. I&#039;d relapse, and hopefully, I wouldn&#039;t come back from it. I&#039;d done enough damage in the world already.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">My morose thoughts were interrupted by a nurse walking in. I had to say, she was quite the sight. She looked to be a rat-anthro, but was easily the prettiest girl I&#039;d ever seen. She was short, maybe about 5&#039;2&quot;, if I&#039;m being generous. She had wide hips, as she turned to close the door, I saw she had a nice tight ass to go with them. Her chest was just as impressive, her bust jutting out from her white uniform, with a couple buttons undone at the top to give me a view of her cleavage. Her face was warm, she had ocean blue eyes, long, blonde hair, and light grey fur. She even wore one of those cute little hats you&#039;d see nurses wear in old-timey movies.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She walked over to my bed, and sat down in the chair next to me. The skirt that was a part of her uniform was tight, and showed off a good amount of her legs. Her thighs were supple, and when she crossed one leg over the other as she sat, I noticed that she was wearing red heels.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hi Greg, my name&#039;s Debra, and I&#039;ll be your nurse while you stay with us here at Gateway.&quot; She gave me another warm smile, the way she looked at me, was not like some kind of junkie freak, but as a person that needed to be helped, and it really pulled at my heartstrings. Her voice...it was melodious, sweet, and had a sing-song tone. She held out her small paw for me to shake my hand, it was soft, her soft fur immediately put me at ease when I held it, but I made sure not to hold onto her paw too long as to not freak her out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Debra got out a pen as she asked some questions about me. Height, weight, age, all the typical things. Writing them down, but always looking me in the eyes with intent as she did. Then when she moved onto the more personal questions, I froze up a bit. To be honest, I was embarrassed about how much of a colossal fuck-up I was. But she grabbed my hand once more, comforting me, being my savior that I could tell anything to.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">After giving her my story, Debra got up, telling me that she would get the methadone ready for me by tomorrow after my doctor saw me. I&#039;d be taking a liquid form of it, which was apparently more fast acting and even a stronger shock to the system than methadone already was. I felt trepidation at the thought of it, but with Debra there with me, it didn&#039;t seem like something I couldn&#039;t overcome.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">  +</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">+++++</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">  +</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I was able to get up and move around a bit throughout the day after the Doctor saw me. He was a nice enough guy, a fellow human, older dude. But he didn&#039;t really tell me anything new that I hadn&#039;t heard from Debra. I went for a walk around the clinic, getting a tour of my temporary sanctuary. I&#039;d sometimes see Debra in other patients&#039; rooms, with other guys, and as I watched her, I saw she didn&#039;t have that same warm look that did when she was with me. It was more business-like, and to the point.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Did that mean she was falling for me? Was I falling for her? If I was being realistic, we had only known each other for maybe an hour, but maybe love at first sight did exist...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">  +</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">+++++</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">  +</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The next day, my nurse Debra came in, holding a small cup of what I presumed was the methadone. Once again, she gave me that same warm smile. Fuck heroin, I could get addicted to how her eyes looked into mine, how her bright hair shined. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Alright Greg, this is pretty powerful stuff, I don&#039;t know how you&#039;re going to react to it, but I&#039;m gonna be here with you the whole time, Okay?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Then I think I&#039;ll survive, if you&#039;re here.&quot; I said, smiling back at her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Debra brought the small cup to my mouth, gently bringing it to my lips. I took a test sip; what a surprise, it tasted awful. It was like sludge going down the back of my throat, it had no real discernible flavor other than gross. It was like the worst cough syrup ever, but as I almost choked it up to get it out of me, Debra held onto my hand, and I pressed on, drinking it all. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">I began shaking violently, convulsing. Sweat began building up on my brow, my whole body became hot. The room started to spin as I felt like wanting to scream, to yell out to make it stop, but nothing came out of my mouth. With my eyes fluttering, everything went dark.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">#############</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">When I woke up, I came back to reality slowly. I looked up at the ceiling of my room, and noticed it was dark, with the only light coming from a lamp on the nightstand by my hospital bed. My bed had been fixed to where I was able to sit up a little while I laid in it, and when I looked to my right, my nurse, Debra, was still there sitting in her chair, still holding onto my hand. I started chuckling, looking into my savior&#039;s bright blue eyes. She started laughing too, we both knew I&#039;d just come out of quite the ordeal from the methadone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">When we calmed down, we kept looking into each other&#039;s eyes. I noticed little details about Debra&#039;s face; how cute her pink nose was, how she had full womanly lips, with red lipstick. Her large ears each had little gold rings in them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You know Greg...I normally don&#039;t do this with most patients, but you&#039;re a special case. I think I need to give you full treatment for your recovery~&quot; Debra said in a sultry voice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She got up from her chair, and hopped onto my bed, moving her legs over my hips, and grabbing onto my shoulders with her lithe hands, as her thin fleshy tail flicked to and fro. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Debra pulled me in for a kiss, and I greatly obliged. It was like fireworks went off in my head as our lips met; I sucked on her lower lip a little as she brought her tongue into my mouth to wrestle with mine. We kept at it until we were both out of breath, looking at each other deeply, with shallow bated breath.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She began unbuttoning the rest of her uniform, I helped out by taking off her hat, tossing it on to the chair. I got quite the surprise to see she wasn&#039;t wearing a bra, and got to see her bare chest on full display. The fur on her stomach and chest was even lighter than the rest of her grey coat; but only better showed off her assets. She had a delicious amount of pudge on her midriff, just enough to grab onto. I put my hands on her thighs, then moved them up to her stomach, caressing it, then snaked my hands up to her bosom. Her breasts were the size of grapefruits, and were fuzzy in a way that was pleasant to the touch. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her nipples were a bright shade of pink, contrasting with her grey breasts. I teased them by rubbing a thumb over each of them as they hardened. Debra let out a soft moan as I massaged her beautiful tits, grinding her rear into my pelvis as she did. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">After keeping up the foreplay for several minutes, I was immediately rock hard, from the combination of the sight of my nurse, the feeling of her grinding into me, and the scent of her; sweet, like rose petals. Lightly, she grabbed onto my hands and removed them from her chest,  wrapping her skinny rodent fingers around hand, intertwining our fingers. She then knelt down, bringing me into another kiss. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">But as we kissed, she moved her hands down to the bed, removing her skirt and panties, tossing them to the middle of my room.

I woke up with a throbbing ache in my brain, to bright lights of the ceiling, laying in a strange bed that wasn&#039;t mine. 

The room I was in was small, four white walls, with a little window to the outside world. Inside, it smelled like a hospital. The combination of sickly sweet smelling lemon cleaner and antibacterial soaps made it uncomfortably clinical.  

I had been checked into a methadone clinic, called &quot;Gateway To Prevention&quot;, whatever that&#039;s supposed to mean. I&#039;ll admit, I fucked up. After having my usual customers come around for their fix, I decided to have me a nice Friday night, and I suppose I took a little bit more H than I should have. I woke up in the ER with my (now) ex-girlfriend Kris standing by my hospital bed, with a look of sadness at how pathetic I must have been laying there after almost dying from an overdose. Kris had gotten into AA, got clean about five months ago, and I guess having a junkie loser heroin dealer for a boyfriend was dragging her down. She said she did this out of good will or something to the effect, and that we were threw. The next thing I knew after speaking with the doctor, I got checked into here.

So I guess this is what rock bottom&#039;s like?

I wouldn&#039;t have lasted at all in AA, I&#039;ve been doing H for as long as I&#039;ve dealt it, twelve years. It&#039;s been in my system so long that if I quit cold turkey, or even weened off of it, the dope sickness would kill me. So now I&#039;m here, on what they call &quot;replacement therapy&quot;, trading in one drug for another. Looking back, I kinda wished Kris hadn&#039;t taken me to the ER. I deserved to die that night, I&#039;d been wanting to do it myself for a while, but couldn&#039;t find the energy to put my Glock to my temple from being so strung out.

I didn&#039;t deserve to be clean. I&#039;d flushed all my opportunities in life down for sweet Miss Heroin. I dropped out of college, quit my job working part time at a bank, alienated myself from my family. I did it all for her.

I&#039;m no Nostradamus, but I know exactly how things were gonna play out here: They&#039;d give me the methadone, I&#039;d go through the motions of taking it, saying I&#039;m clean, they&#039;d keep tabs on me probably, and I&#039;d be back with her. I&#039;d relapse, and hopefully, I wouldn&#039;t come back from it. I&#039;d done enough damage in the world already.

My morose thoughts were interrupted by a nurse walking in. I had to say, she was quite the sight. She looked to be a rat-anthro, but was easily the prettiest girl I&#039;d ever seen. She was short, maybe about 5&#039;2&quot;, if I&#039;m being generous. She had wide hips, as she turned to close the door, I saw she had a nice tight ass to go with them. Her chest was just as impressive, her bust jutting out from her white uniform, with a couple buttons undone at the top to give me a view of her cleavage. Her face was warm, she had ocean blue eyes, long, blonde hair, and light grey fur. She even wore one of those cute little hats you&#039;d see nurses wear in old-timey movies.

She walked over to my bed, and sat down in the chair next to me. The skirt that was a part of her uniform was tight, and showed off a good amount of her legs. Her thighs were supple, and when she crossed one leg over the other as she sat, I noticed that she was wearing red heels.

&quot;Hi Greg, my name&#039;s Debra, and I&#039;ll be your nurse while you stay with us here at Gateway.&quot; She gave me another warm smile, the way she looked at me, was not like some kind of junkie freak, but as a person that needed to be helped, and it really pulled at my heartstrings. Her voice...it was melodious, sweet, and had a sing-song tone. She held out her small paw for me to shake my hand, it was soft, her soft fur immediately put me at ease when I held it, but I made sure not to hold onto her paw too long as to not freak her out.

Debra got out a pen as she asked some questions about me. Height, weight, age, all the typical things. Writing them down, but always looking me in the eyes with intent as she did. Then when she moved onto the more personal questions, I froze up a bit. To be honest, I was embarrassed about how much of a colossal fuck-up I was. But she grabbed my hand once more, comforting me, being my savior that I could tell anything to.

After giving her my story, Debra got up, telling me that she would get the methadone ready for me by tomorrow after my doctor saw me. I&#039;d be taking a liquid form of it, which was apparently more fast acting and even a stronger shock to the system than methadone already was. I felt trepidation at the thought of it, but with Debra there with me, it didn&#039;t seem like something I couldn&#039;t overcome.

I was able to get up and move around a bit throughout the day after the Doctor saw me. He was a nice enough guy, a fellow human, older dude. But he didn&#039;t really tell me anything new that I hadn&#039;t heard from Debra. I went for a walk around the clinic, getting a tour of my temporary sanctuary. I&#039;d sometimes see Debra in other patients&#039; rooms, with other guys, and as I watched her, I saw she didn&#039;t have that same warm look that did when she was with me. It was more business-like, and to the point.

Did that mean she was falling for me? Was I falling for her? If I was being realistic, we had only known each other for maybe an hour, but maybe love at first sight did exist...

The next day, my nurse Debra came in, holding a small cup of what I presumed was the methadone. Once again, she gave me that same warm smile. Fuck heroin, I could get addicted to how her eyes looked into mine, how her bright hair shined. 

&quot;Alright Greg, this is pretty powerful stuff, I don&#039;t know how you&#039;re going to react to it, but I&#039;m gonna be here with you the whole time, Okay?&quot;

&quot;Then I think I&#039;ll survive, if you&#039;re here.&quot; I said, smiling back at her.

Debra brought the small cup to my mouth, gently bringing it to my lips. I took a test sip; what a surprise, it tasted awful. It was like sludge going down the back of my throat, it had no real discernible flavor other than gross. It was like the worst cough syrup ever, but as I almost choked it up to get it out of me, Debra held onto my hand, and I pressed on, drinking it all. 

I began shaking violently, convulsing. Sweat began building up on my brow, my whole body became hot. The room started to spin as I felt like wanting to scream, to yell out to make it stop, but nothing came out of my mouth. With my eyes fluttering, everything went dark.



#############



When I woke up, I came back to reality slowly. I looked up at the ceiling of my room, and noticed it was dark, with the only light coming from a lamp on the nightstand by my hospital bed. My bed had been fixed to where I was able to sit up a little while I laid in it, and when I looked to my right, my nurse, Debra, was still there sitting in her chair, still holding onto my hand. I started chuckling, looking into my savior&#039;s bright blue eyes. She started laughing too, we both knew I&#039;d just come out of quite the ordeal from the methadone.

When we calmed down, we kept looking into each other&#039;s eyes. I noticed little details about Debra&#039;s face; how cute her pink nose was, how she had full womanly lips, with red lipstick. Her large ears each had little gold rings in them.

&quot;You know Greg...I normally don&#039;t do this with most patients, but you&#039;re a special case. I think I need to give you full treatment for your recovery~&quot; Debra said in a sultry voice.

She got up from her chair, and hopped onto my bed, moving her legs over my hips, and grabbing onto my shoulders with her lithe hands, as her thin fleshy tail flicked to and fro. 

Debra pulled me in for a kiss, and I greatly obliged. It was like fireworks went off in my head as our lips met; I sucked on her lower lip a little as she brought her tongue into my mouth to wrestle with mine. We kept at it until we were both out of breath, looking at each other deeply, with shallow bated breath.

She began unbuttoning the rest of her uniform, I helped out by taking off her hat, tossing it on to the chair. I got quite the surprise to see she wasn&#039;t wearing a bra, and got to see her bare chest on full display. The fur on her stomach and chest was even lighter than the rest of her grey coat; but only better showed off her assets. She had a delicious amount of pudge on her midriff, just enough to grab onto. I put my hands on her thighs, then moved them up to her stomach, caressing it, then snaked my hands up to her bosom. Her breasts were the size of grapefruits, and were fuzzy in a way that was pleasant to the touch. 

Her nipples were a bright shade of pink, contrasting with her grey breasts. I teased them by rubbing a thumb over each of them as they hardened. Debra let out a soft moan as I massaged her beautiful tits, grinding her rear into my pelvis as she did. 

After keeping up the foreplay for several minutes, I was immediately rock hard, from the combination of the sight of my nurse, the feeling of her grinding into me, and the scent of her; sweet, like rose petals. Lightly, she grabbed onto my hands and removed them from her chest,  wrapping her skinny rodent fingers around hand, intertwining our fingers. She then knelt down, bringing me into another kiss. 

But as we kissed, she moved her hands down to the bed, removing her skirt and panties, tossing them to the middle of my room. She then helped me shirk off my pants and underwear, my cock standing proud as it was removed from its clothed prison.

Debra got up from me, and looked down at it hungrily. She bit her lip, grabbing onto it with her dainty fingers, rubbing her plump pussy against it, the warmth and wetness of her folds sending jolts of electricity up through me.

After teasing me like this for a minute, Debra got up slightly from the bed, and positioned my dick at the entrance of her mound. 

Taking a deep breath, she fell back down into my lap, taking my entire length in her. I froze up as she did, my entire body locked up from the amount of dopamine rushing through me, her tight folds choked my cock, and after getting comfortable with the feeling of it inside her, Debra began moving her hips, up and down.

After getting used to the sensation of my dick being sheathed in her, I also got into the rhythm of it, plunging my hands into her fat rear, massaging it in circles with my hands, thrusting upward into Debra&#039;s tight pussy.

I started grunting from the building intensity of our fucking, the tempo increasing as we enjoyed the feeling of being connected to each other.

As I looked up at her, I knew I was in love with her. And she loved me. My nurse, my Debra, was showing me how much she loved me as we got lost in the ecstasy of each other&#039;s bodies. When I got out of here, I was gonna make sure that she would come with me. I&#039;d go back to school, I&#039;d get a good job, and my life was going to turn around, all because of the nurse I loved. 

Debra slammed down onto my pelvis as we both approached orgasm, her moans becoming loud enough for the whole clinic to hear, but she didn&#039;t care, and neither did I. I kept up her pace, meeting each thrust with my own. 

Eventually the pressure inside my cock was too much, and with one final push, I plunged myself as deeply as I could into her. I got as close inside of her as I could, my member exploded with cum, covering her insides in it, and continuing to plunge even as my orgasm resided, and my cock softened.

Debra fell back down onto me as she came, holding me as tightly as she could, screaming into my mouth as she kissed me. She wrapped her legs around mine, her breathing erratic, as she came down from the high of cumming.

We looked each other in the eyes once more, those eyes I loved, blue and as deep as the ocean, the words came out of my mouth automatically.

&quot;I love you.&quot;

&quot;I love you too.&quot; She said softly, bringing her head down into my chest. I played with her blonde locks for a bit, sliding them through my fingers before sleep beckoned me as well. I smiled, knowing that from now on I was going to be a changed man. I was going to marry Debra, I&#039;d start anew, finally having a purpose in my life.


All because of the nurse who loved me.

I woke up once more, but immediately noticed that Debra wasn&#039;t in bed with me. I guess that made sense, it&#039;d be quite unprofessional if someone caught her laying in bed with one of her patients. I smiled as I thought about her, about last night, and about our future together.

But when she walked into my room, I immediately saw something was different about her. She wasn&#039;t wearing her usual nurse outfit, instead just regular blue scrubs...like all nurses wear now that I thought about it. I beamed at her, smiling brightly as she walked in, she smiled back, but her eyes darted off to the side as she did, as if she wasn&#039;t sure why I was so happy to see her.

Whatever, I&#039;m sure once we got talking we could figure everything out, what we&#039;d do, all that stuff...

&quot;Hey, Debra, I wanted to just say, about last night...I wanted to thank you for that, that was the best night of my life.&quot; I said, smiling up at her.

Debra looked at me uncomfortably, as if she didn&#039;t know what I was talking about.

&quot;Uhh, okay, but once I gave you the methadone, you went into a coma for twenty-four hours, I left as soon as the doctor got in and we knew you&#039;d be stable and went home. Whatever you think happened last night, I think that was a coma induced dream, Greg.&quot; She said, trying to give me a reassuring smile.

My brow furrowed at what she had said. Did that mean...it was all just a dream? Everything, how she touched me, how she smelled, how she felt as we made love...it was just my imagination? It couldn&#039;t have been, it-it felt so real...

&quot;W-well, still, there is something I-I wanted to ask you Debra, you&#039;re really beautiful, I gotta say, and I was wondering uh...maybe once I got out of here, you&#039;d like to maybe go get coffee, or something..?&quot; I asked, with a pleading look on my face.

Debra merely giggled a little, and sighed, pointing to a silver band on her ring finger. &quot;I&#039;m sorry Greg, but as flattering as that is to hear, and even though you&#039;re a pretty decent looking guy too, I&#039;m engaged. But, I have enjoyed your company here, it&#039;s nice to have someone to talk to. Anyway, I have other patients I need to go see, so I&#039;ll tell the doctor that you&#039;re awake, and we&#039;ll move on with your rehab, okay?&quot;

And with that, she gave me a little pat on the shoulder with her delicate hands that I&#039;d come to love, and walked out the door, closing it gently behind her.


I merely sat in the bed, with a smile on my face, as tears started to well up in my eyes and run down my face.
