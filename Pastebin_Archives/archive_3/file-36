        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;You are Anon, Ex military man turned Stay at home father
&gt;Times were going great for you and your friends, Chick had flown you to meet Jasmine&#039;s parents as well
&gt;Never one to let someone else shoulder all the festivities, you offered to host the New years party at your house
&gt;In the days since returning home you had taken Clara shooting with her new Makarov
&gt;At first when she shot it her fur poofed up adorably, her paws unused to recoil
&gt;You showed her the right holding techniques, how to reload and how to clean it
&gt;In the end she was visibly excited to have a gun of her own
&gt;&quot;I wanna make them! I think it&#039;ll be fun do you think I can?&quot; she said as she practically vibrated next to you as you drove home
&gt;You always encouraged her to toy with new hobbies so you found a gun-smithing class at a nearby college and Used your GI Bill to enroll you both in the classes
&gt;To think being shot at a few times meant free college
&gt;Clara was ecstatic to hear about the classes
&gt;Emi offered to Babysit Lucatiel while you were both in class
&gt;But that didn&#039;t matter right now as you cleaned the house
&gt;So much to be done for the party
&gt;Replace the sheets and wash the blankets of the guest room bedroom, clean the Cats litter box etc
&gt;You didnt mind being a stay at home husband at all
&gt;How could you? you got time to explore your various hobbies and take care of Lucatiel
&gt;Your bedroom was stop number 1 in your cleaning rampage
&gt;The sheets and blankets stripped from your bed, you begin putting new sheets on
&gt;But as you tuck the sheets under the mattress on your wife&#039;s side you feel something
&gt;You sigh
&gt;She didnt need to hide her various toys
&gt;Honestly it not like you arent used to it by now
&gt;You grip the thing but its not one of her toys
&gt;Pulling it out from under the mattress reveals a notebook, big enough to write on easily but small enough to fit into a purse
&gt;You turn it over and see the words &quot;Da book of Grudges&quot; written in what appears to be Crayon
&gt;Huh? What the fuck?
&gt;You open it and flip through a few pages
&gt;LOTS of names and descriptions of how they had wronged her 
&gt;And how she got revenge or planned too
&gt;Some were crossed out and some were circled
&gt;They varied from &quot;Ate my Lunch at work, add extra hot wasabi to his lunch whenever the chance arises&quot;
&gt;To &quot;Stole my favorite parking spot, pour cat piss on brake pads&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re actually proud she did that one, you taught her it after all
&gt;If you pour piss on someones brakepads, every time they stop their car it smells like burnt piss
&gt;But you did wonder where she would get the cat pee, the thought of the litter box hidden in one of the closets floats through your head
&gt;You flip through it lazily, most of the stuff was childish, both in action and revenge
&gt;However a few names pop out to you
&gt;&quot;Bingle :Ruined the one chance I had to get with Jasmine&quot; He had a whole page to himself which was covered in tiny drawn skulls
&gt;&quot;Chick: Took Jasmine off the dating market!&quot;
&gt;What came after that made you laugh
&gt;&quot;He gets death!&quot; thats scratched out followed by &quot;I cant kill him maybe hubby will&quot; followed by &quot;Hubby is too good of friends with him&quot; followed by &quot;Ok I like him he&#039;s forgiven&quot; followed by &quot;QUIT FLIRTING WITH MOMO!&quot; and a bunch of tiny drawn skulls
&gt;You snap the book shut and set it on her pillow
&gt;You&#039;re gonna have to ask about this later
&gt;The cleaning continues before you jump into your jeep and head to the store
&gt;You needed to get Alamo beer for Chick and some Voodoo ranger beer
&gt;Whats a new years party without beer?
&gt;As well you needed party food plus ribs, steak and oysters
&gt;Its gonna be great!

&gt;Shopping was quick and easy because you were still able to get onto the Base nearby
&gt;The exchange and Commissary had everything you needed
&gt;The drinks were in the fridge, the party food spread out
&gt;The grill was ready to go too, you know that Lilith likes her ribs done a certain way that only the mechanic can get right
&gt;Clara would be home soon with Emi, after all they worked together as nurses
&gt;Plus Momo was still looking after Lucatiel so you didn&#039;t have to worry about her
&gt;When you tried to tell her how to handle Lucatiel&#039;s fits she shooed you away
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ve raised more cubs than you have Anon!&quot; she said
&gt;Well you had to give her that one
&gt;As you go around finishing putting finishing touches on everything and picking up the last few things you hear the door open
&gt;&quot;Hey Babe we&#039;re home!&quot; You hear Clara call out
&gt;You head to the door and see Clara and Emi in their nurse scrubs setting their purses and such on the front hall table
&gt;&quot;Hey babe how was work?&quot; you say as you walk up to Clara and Give her a quick kiss
&gt;&quot;Aww wheres my kiss?&quot; Emi pouts 
&gt;You look to Clara who smiles and winks at you
&gt;Whatevers clever 
&gt;You give Emi a quick kiss as well
&gt;&quot;Work was fine, Some idiot managed to stab himself with a replica Master sword&quot;
&gt;You smile
&gt;Their stories for how people hurt themselves in creative ways were always interesting
&gt;&quot;Let us change real quick Babe. When are the others going to arrive?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Uh soon, Chick and Jas will be here soon I know, the mechanic and Lil will come a bit later&quot;
&gt;She smiles at you then pulls Emi to the bedroom
&gt;&quot;Come on you silly tiger, lets change!&quot;
&gt;You they disappear around the corner you hear Emi&#039;s protests
&gt;&quot;I got covered in blood and bile let me shower Clara!&quot;
&gt;After that a door slams and you only hear muffled words and a shower kick on
&gt;God those two cats would be the death of you
&gt;You sit down an start playing some bloodborne
&gt;One of your viewers from your streams requested a specific weapon only run
&gt;It just happened to be a weapon you hated
&gt;God dam you had to edit this footage so much
&gt;It was literally you getting murdered over and over
&gt;WHY THIS WEAPON!? It&#039;s a god dam walking stick
&gt;As you get more and more frustrated your door bell rings
&gt;You hear muffled talking before you open the door
&gt;&quot;-terally says do not ring cub sleeping! You want him to show up at our place and ring the doorbell when we have our cubs!?&quot; you hear Chick talking to Jasmine about the &quot;knock please&quot; sign taped above your doorbell
&gt;Chick and Jasmine are here and it looks like they took Jasmine refurbished Volkswagen
&gt;&quot;No beat up Pontiac today Chick?&quot; you Chide as they walk in
&gt;&quot;Fuck off it&#039;s better than that Chevy piece of shit&quot;
&gt;You laugh as you close the door behind them
&gt;&quot;whatever man, I got the Alamo stuff you like in the fridge, Jasmine I have water and the &quot;preggo special&quot; that Clara liked when she was pregnant&quot;
&gt;Clara drank pickle juice when she was Pregnant, which was a bit weird to you but you also recall reading it was good for muscle soreness
&gt;Jasmine smiles at you and hugs you &quot;Thanks for having us over Strong&quot;
&gt;&quot;Hey Chick I gotta thank you mother-in-law, Clara loves her little Makarov and wants us to make guns together, so I signed us up for a class&quot;
&gt;He looks up over the door of your fridge, eye patch glowing from the light
&gt;&quot;Make guns? You mean you&#039;ll be able to do that?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Chicky don&#039;t get TOO excited! he said he&#039;s gonna take a class on it not that he&#039;s gonna be an expert&quot;
&gt;Chick closes the door, a beer in his hand
&gt;&quot;Oh please! The last time he said he&#039;s gonna take a class on something he turned into a master ammo loader, he doesn&#039;t do mediocre BS&quot;
&gt;You frown slightly
&gt;&quot;What?! I like what I do and I do what I like! just because I enjoy making bullets doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m the best&quot;
&gt;Chick frowns and almost physically brushes your words aside
&gt;&quot;Ever since you&#039;ve been out of the military all you do is make everyone else in the field look like amateurs, that&#039;s why I get ammo from you&quot; 
&gt;You sigh and sit back on your couch
&gt;&quot;Hey Chick how good are you at Bloodborne?&quot;
&gt;He laughs as your character gets eaten by a Giant fish man &quot;I&#039;m decent but it&#039;s more fun to watch you fuck up&quot;
&gt;Fuck 
&gt;You give up playing with the stupidest weapon in the game and put on a Big-O, an old favorite of yours
&gt;God dam those pile bunker fists made you want to punch stuff
&gt;&quot;Ooooo I LOVE this show!&quot; Jasmine says as she throws herself on your couch a jar of pickle juice held in her paws
&gt;You smile and look to chick who is still in the kitchen inspecting the steaks and ribs
&gt;&quot;Hey may not be able to get that perfect Texan Marinade right but I can still make them good! The grill is ready if you wanna make them perfect for you and Jasmine&quot;
&gt;Grilling is an art, and you knew everyone had specific ways they wanted things grilled
&gt;So how better to get food perfect than to let your guests perfect their own food?
&gt;having learned the specific marinade for each group you had 4 bags of steaks in marinades
&gt;One for you and Clara, one for Mechanic and Lilith one for jasmine and Chick and one for Emi
&gt;Jasmine sits wide eyed as Big-O punches another robot, Chick busies himself with the Grill and you head to the bedroom to get Clara and Emi
&gt;When you enter Clara is sitting on the bed with her book in her lap, the sound of the hairdryer going tells you Emi is almost ready 
&gt;&quot;How much of this did you see Anon?&quot; Clara asks with a few tears in her eyes
&gt;&quot;Uh enough, Look Clara I don&#039;t care if you hold a few grudges but refrain from writing you wanna murder them, honestly even chick killed people for GOOD reasons, not they kill them because they cockblocked you&quot;
&gt;Whats the female term for cock block?
&gt;Vag dammed? Clam Jam? Taco blocko?
&gt;Whatever!
&gt;&quot;But I have some really personal stuff in here Anon! I Love Chick but he hit on my mom!&quot;
&gt;You clear your throat 
&gt;&quot;Uh I think Momo was hitting on him Clara, besides everyone holds grudges, just not everyone has them written in a book&quot;
&gt;Clara eyes you momentarily
&gt;&quot;Promise you arent Mad about it?&quot;
&gt;You scooch forward onto the bed and give her a quick kiss &quot;Promise&quot;
&gt;She smiles at you, &quot;Don&#039;t worry you aren&#039;t in it!&quot; 
&gt;Before long, Emi Emerges from the the bathroom looking fluffier than normal
&gt;&quot;OH Anon! I didn&#039;t know you would be here! Otherwise I would have grabbed a towel&quot;
&gt;She is totally nude, as you look her up and down
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s fine Emi, Jasmine and Chick are here and I still need to introduce you to them&quot;
&gt;She smiles half-heartedly
&gt;&quot;You sure you want to introduce me to them? I don&#039;t know if your friends will like that I&#039;ve slept with you both&quot;
&gt;You wave your hand brushing her excuses aside
&gt;&quot;Clara already told them of our unique situation and so have I, they accept our lifestyle&quot;
&gt;She shuffles a bit on her footpaws
&gt;&quot;You sure Anon?&quot;
&gt;Heh usually she&#039;s much more bold than this
&gt;&quot;Yes I&#039;m sure, I&#039;ll go tell them you&#039;re BOTH getting ready&quot;
&gt;You shoot a sideways glance to Clara, who hastily shoves her book under the mattress again
&gt;Leaving the bedroom you hear Emi shuffling through the closet for some cloths 
&gt;You can already smell The steaks Chick is grilling as you hear Jasmine cheering &quot;big O big O!&quot;
&gt;Before long Emi and Clara emerge from the bedroom together
&gt;You stand up and give Clara a quick Hug before taking Emi By the Paw and leading her over to Jasmine
&gt;&quot;Jasmine This is our friend Emi; Emi, this is Jasmine&quot;
&gt;Emi nervously shuffles on her paws  
&gt;&quot;Emi? OH! That Emi! Hi Emi its nice to finally meet you!&quot;
&gt;Jasmine is already standing and bounds forwards a bit to shake Emi&#039;s Paws happily
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s nice to meet you too Jasmine, Clara has told me so much about you! Your fur is so pretty!&quot;
&gt;You beam as they both sit on the couch chatting, Clara joins them 
&gt;Emi is of course very interested in Jasmines pregnancy, girl stuff you figure
&gt;There is a slight knock from the door so you answer it revealing The Mechanic and Lilith
&gt;&quot;Hey guys glad you could make it! Beer is in the fridge, Mech the ribs and steaks for you are labeled&quot;
&gt;Lilith gives you a quick hug before zooming past you to join Clara Jasmine and Emi
&gt;You give a slight fist bump to the mechanic as he walks in carrying a box of fireworks
&gt;The door closes on its own behind you and you go to introduce Mech to Emi
&gt;&quot;Hey Emi this is the Mechanic and Lilith!&quot;
&gt;Lilith waves excitedly &quot;Hi Emi! Nice to meet you!&quot;
&gt;Emi Smiles and waves
&gt;&quot;Hi its nice to meet you all! uh Why do you go by Mechanic?&quot;
&gt;Mech scratches his head, and sets the box down
&gt;&quot;You ever notice how like everyone is Named Anon? I don&#039;t have a fancy Nickname so I just went with my job&quot;
&gt;Chick comes in carrying a plate with His and Jasmine&#039;s Steaks
&gt;&quot;Hey Mech. Grills all cleaned and ready for you&quot;
&gt;As Chick sets the plates down Jasmine puts a padded fingers to her chin
&gt;&quot;Hm now that you mention it a lot of people from your world are named Anon, at least the ones I meet anyway&quot;
&gt;Chick nods and sits next to her as Clara gets up from the couch to grab a Diet coke
&gt;&quot;It was one of the most popular names for many years. People are fickle. At least we aren&#039;t all named Earl. Or John. Or Hugo.&quot;
&gt;Jasmine sips from her jar of pickle juice and Chick eyes it
&gt;&quot;Is that stuff really good Jas?&quot;
&gt;Clara plops down next to him on the couch and answer for Jasmine
&gt;&quot;Yea I couldn&#039;t get enough of the stuff when I was Preggo! Try it Chick!&quot;
&gt;Jasmine hands him the jar and He sips it reluctantly
&gt;The face he pulls makes you choke on your drink because of how funny it looks
&gt;&quot;Well that was...interesting. Can you grab me another beer, I need to wash that taste out of my mouth&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sure thing&quot; you laugh as you grab a beer from the fridge
&gt;&quot;Catch&quot; 
&gt;You toss it to him casually
&gt;He attempts to catch it but misses
&gt;The beer makes a solid *THUNK* as it hits him in the head
&gt;&quot;Oh Fuck are yo-&quot;
&gt;He nonchalantly picks up the beer and opens it 
&gt;Fizzy beer sprays everywhere as he tries to drink
&gt;&quot;Chicky? You ok? What happened?&quot;
&gt;He sets the beer on a coaster
&gt;&quot;My depth perceptions a bit off&quot; he says pointing to his eye patch
&gt;You mentally slap yourself
&gt;&quot;What happened anyway Chick? Did jasmine get you again?&quot; Lilith asks in confusion as the Mechanic heads outside with a plate of ribs and Steaks
&gt;Jasmine&#039;s fur Poofs out
&gt;&quot;I DID NOT!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sureeee you didn&#039;t Jas. Look at all those other scars he has from you&quot; Clara says rubbing a paw on one of the scars on Chick&#039;s arm
&gt;Jasmine angrily buries her face the jar of pickle juice, muffled Russian is heard as she yells angrily into it
&gt;Clara giggles at this causing even more angry yelling
&gt;Emi to the rescue though, scavenging the whole situation
&gt;&quot;Hey Jasmine how do you get your fur so white? I&#039;ve wanted to dye my fur like that or like a golden tiger, but no dyes I&#039;ve used can cut it&quot;
&gt;Jasmine pulls her muzzle out of the Jar and licks away any residue from it
&gt;&quot;Oh uhm, its this way naturally, I&#039;m a Hybrid Emi, my mom is a tiger and my father is a Mountain Lion, this is my natural fur color&quot;
&gt;you watch as Emi eyes Jasmine up and down
&gt;&quot;Your fur is so Exotic looking and pretty, I had hoped you could point me in the right direction for Dyes&quot;
&gt;Lilith interjects
&gt;&quot;Oh oh I know some good fur dyes!&quot;
&gt;everyone looks at her
&gt;she shrugs
&gt;&quot;What? I had a rebellious streak when I was in foster care! If they can dye MY fur they can dye yours Emi&quot;
&gt;She motions to the black portions of her fur 
&gt;You lean against a wall and sip your beer watching your best friends in the world talk
&gt;A beautiful scene to say the very least
&gt;You think back to your time in the military, your higher ups telling you to go out more
&gt;Your workmates telling you not to volunteer for every deployment possible, telling you to live life
&gt;So this what they meant?
&gt;After your family died a void had filled your heart, and you thought you could fill it with patriotism
&gt;But seeing everyone told you that it hadn&#039;t
&gt;Chick, Jasmine, Lilith, the Mechanic, Emi and Clara
&gt;You didnt feel it anymore, the void finally full
&gt;But you had one more thing to do before you cooked the steaks for you Clara and Emi
&gt;&quot;Hey hey! We need to say hi to Armas and Faye in the mythical land of Finns&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh right! Timezones! Ok lets says hi&quot; says Clara as she bounces happily next to Emi
&gt;You smile as you hook up everything
&gt;The webcam is ready and you click the video call button on your laptop
&gt;A few moments later and Armas and Faye anwser, speech totally synchronized
&gt;&quot;HEEEELLLOOO From the world of Tomorrow!&quot; Faye yells as we waves violently
&gt;&quot;Hello from the world of Yesteryear&quot; Jasmine says with a smile
&gt;&quot;Hey all just checking in! How was Christmas and how are Mikael and Aura?&quot; Clara asks
&gt;&quot;one sec&quot;
&gt;The camera on their end turns revealing a large Christmas tree and the children passed out on the couch
&gt;&quot;they tried to make it to midnight but no luck! You actually called right as he was going to carry them to bed&quot; Faye says off camera
&gt;You smile as the camera pans back around
&gt;&quot;Anyway we gotta go! Thanks for checking in!&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Bye!&quot; Lilith says with a wave
&gt;The call ends and everyone goes back to their spot on the couch


&gt;The food was great, the count down to the new year came and went
&gt;The New year Started and you were sure that it would be great
&gt;You had your best friends with you to start it out
&gt;But you could see them all starting to get tired
&gt;Beer, champagne, other various drinks all weighed down their eyelids
&gt;The Mechanic and Lilith already turned in
&gt;&quot;Babe can we do that cuddle thing again with Emi this time?&quot; Clara asks with a yawn
&gt;You look to Jasmine and chick
&gt;&quot;We don&#039;t have a nest bed, but we can pull the Mattresses into the living room here&quot;
&gt;Clara&#039;s eyes light up and she bounces slightly
&gt;&quot;That OK with you guys?&quot; you ask to Jasmine and Chick
&gt;&quot;Ok! I wouldn&#039;t mind! What about you Chicky?&quot; 
&gt;Chick had a few more beers and drinks that you and was sitting with a smile on his face, watching Jasmine talk 
&gt;&quot;Mmmkay, Jas have I told you how beautiful you look? And also you guys are the best&quot;
&gt;You suppress a laugh as Clara and Emi swoon
&gt;&quot;Yes you have Chicky but thank you&quot;
&gt;Clara swats you with a fluffy paw
&gt;&quot;How come you never say things like that?&quot;
&gt;You look at her with disbelief on your face
&gt;&quot;I tell you that EVERY day&quot;
&gt;She stomps her footpaw 
&gt;&quot;Yea but not like that! Its not the same!&quot;
&gt;This Snep
&gt;You decide to drop it and get the things needed for the cuddle bundle that was incoming
&gt;&quot;Girls if I could have your help moving the Mattresses from the master bedroom and the guestroom&quot;
&gt;Clara and Emi nod at you and head to the bedroom
&gt;&quot;Can i Help too?&quot; Jasmine says looking from you to a very inebriated Chick
&gt;&quot;No moving heavy stuff why Pregnant Jasmine, just keep Loverboy here company while we set up&quot;
&gt;&quot;Mmmf screw you Strong&quot; Chick mumbles as he snuggles into Jasmine
&gt;You smirk and head to the bedroom and begin the process of moving the mattresses
&gt;Luckily with Emi and Clara helping it doesn&#039;t take too long
&gt;2 king size mattresses lay side by side on the floor, with plenty of Blankets and pillows for everyone
&gt;even your cat which seems to have taken a liking too Chick, more so than usual
&gt;Clara opens a window slightly to let a little bit of brisk winter air in as you all get into bed
&gt;You lay with Emi to your right, cuddled up to you with a paw on your Chest
&gt;Clara to your left with her muzzle in the the crook of your neck, her paw on top of Emi&#039;s
&gt;Jasmine is next to her Spooning Chick happily with her content purring
&gt;you catch a peek of Clara&#039;s and Jasmines tail intertwining with each other
&gt;And lastly Chick asleep being the small spoon to Jasmine
&gt;Your Cat laying on his feet
&gt;You smile as you slowly drift off to sleep with the sound of Emi&#039;s soft breathing, and Clara&#039;s purring in your ears
&gt;This year was going to be great
&gt;A whole new year with all new fun</textarea>
