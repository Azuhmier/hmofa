This was simply written for fun at the request of a few posters
Enjoy


&gt;you&#039;re cornered, your plan backfired terrifically
&gt;Steve&#039;s hounds surround you, barking and growling as you fend them off with a firepoker from the nearby fireplace
&gt;you&#039;re in Steve&#039;s &quot;trophy&quot; room
&gt;might as well be a morgue
&gt;and it was probably going to be your grave
&gt;You could hear him coming
&gt;not amount of pleading from your Aunt would save you this time
&gt;you were between him and his prey, his prize, his trophy
&gt;Freja is Behind you, whimpering and trying to dig into the carpeted floor
&gt;but goddamit you weren&#039;t going down without a fight
&gt;you bring the poker down onto one of the hounds earning a pained whimper
&gt;normally you would hate to hurt a dog but you would make an exception this time
&gt;as you swung your makeshift weapon you prayed to every deity you know
&gt;&quot;let me protect her, let her escape, i dont care if i die! SHE doesnt deserve this&quot;
&gt;Steve burst through the doorwith his double barrel shotgun in hand
&gt;he studied the situation for a moment before grinning 
&gt;this must be perfect for him, get rid of you AND get his prize
&gt;he levels his shotgun at you calmly
&gt;&quot;Goodbye Anon, I would say I&#039;m going to miss you, but that would be lying&quot;
&gt;but it seems one of the gods heard you
&gt;a flash of blinding light, a loud bang
&gt;the hounds scatter, you hear Steve swear angrily 
&gt;you cover your eyes for fear of being blinded, Freja hides behind you
&gt;when at last the light and sound die down you uncover your eyes to..
&gt;a Man? No.. not a man, a giant standing at 7 feet tall easily
&gt;He stands looking at a watch on his wrist, wearing a pitch black suit and tie with a black helmet that reminded you of a knights helmet, except with horns; the word &quot;titan&quot; in green lettering on the side
&gt;he looks away from his watch and turns his head so his neck cracks and pops and you hear a faint sigh
&gt;a finger to his ear and his helmet just dissolves into nothing
&gt;he breathes in deep, eyes closed
&gt;&quot;terra&quot; you make out a mumble from him
&gt;a Gunshot resonates, tearing you away from the spectacle before you


&gt;you are Titan, the giant human raised by Anthros
&gt;you didn&#039;t know WHY they chose you for this
&gt;something about your Augs and steam vents able to handle this travel
&gt;whatever
&gt;you were told of a man doing the unthinkable
&gt;Hunting down Anthros for sport
&gt;SPORT of all things
&gt;the second they said that you signed on, anger flowing through you
&gt;&quot;lets enjoy this&quot; said the little voice in your head
&gt;you agreed with it wholeheartedly
&gt;your combat suit donned and your helmet ready you were transported via some science you didn&#039;t understand
&gt;might as well be space magic for all you understood
&gt;but what you knew was it worked
&gt;you were in the middle of a room looking at a human male with a fox anthro behind him
&gt;he had a firepoker pointed at you, his knees trembled but he stood fast
&gt;hmmm how brave
&gt;you click your helmet and feel it dissolve and breathe in
&gt;&quot;Terra&quot; you murmur
&gt;you had never been on the homeworld and it meant everything to you
&gt;even if it was some weird alternate universe or something
&gt;you&#039;re enjoying the freshest air you&#039;ve ever tasted when you hear it
&gt;a gunshot
&gt;you feel what is equivalent to a child punching you in the back
&gt;snapped out of your trance you turn to the source
&gt;an elderly man stands before you, double barrel shotgun pointed at your chest
&gt;you frown and look around the room
&gt;animal heads lined the walls
&gt;your eyes settle on a pair of Anthro foxes
&gt;how could you not recognize Anthros? they raised you
&gt;anger envelops you like a lover
&gt;he HUNTED them? for SPORT?! you had hoped it was a joke, no one was that heartless
&gt;but then your mind drifts to Maggie, how she was hunted and murdered
&gt;you rush the man down 
&gt;he fires of the second shell of he shotgun into your chest earning him nothing but more anger
&gt;a quick knee to his stomach makes him double over, dropping his weapon
&gt;the discarded weapon is now in your hands
&gt;&quot;you think THIS is fun&quot; you gesture to the room, the soulless eyes stare down on him
&gt;you bend the shotgun into a pretzel and overcharge your Augs throwing it full force through the wall above him
&gt;&gt;&quot;ill show you fun, you have 10 seconds&quot;
&gt;the man whimpers at your feet trying to comprehend
&gt;&quot;w-what?&quot;
&gt;you scowl
&gt;&quot;Run&quot;
&gt;he tries, he really does
&gt;desperation is great motivation
&gt;but he cant outrun you
&gt;you catch him before he can even leave the house
&gt;dragging him by the throat, you stomp back into his &quot;trophy&quot; room
&gt;you feel the floorboards cracking beneath your boots
&gt;the young man stands petrified but unwavering before you as you drag the old man into the room
&gt;&gt;the eyes of the fallen are on him
&gt;you look up into the eyes of the Fox Anthros and you feel your heart sink
&gt;a quick glance an the fox behind the young man told you these were her parents
&gt;you scowl
&gt;&quot;hurt him&quot; says the voice
&gt;you dont hesitate
&gt;his head is slammed into the wall beneath the poor anthros, your hand trying to crush every bit of life from him
&gt;He crumples, a bleeding laceration on the back of his head
&gt;you stand over him frowning
&gt;a look up at the two fox heads, one&#039;s twisted in terror, the other in anger
&gt;a peek at the one behind the young man
&gt;&quot;you know what to do&quot; says the voice &quot;just like always&quot;
&gt;you pick the man up by his neck once more and slam him into the wall
&gt;Cracks form in the plaster as you slam him face first into the wall beneath the fallen foxes
&gt;you then look at the man, bleeding and struggling in vain
&gt;some how still alive
&gt;a full lunge downwards with all your body weight and strength, smashes him into the floor
&gt;&quot;time for our signature move&quot;
&gt;you raise a heavy foot over his bloodied face
&gt;&quot;Look at those foxes, and tell me it was worth it, that it was fun&quot; you growl
&gt;he doesnt get a chance to respond as you Overcharge your Augs again and Slam your heel through the floor
&gt;all thats left now is a headless body and you prying your leg out of the carpet and floor beneath it
&gt;you turn to the young man
&gt;&quot;take care of her&quot; is all you say before pressing a button and zipping back to your timeline

&gt;Be Anon
&gt;somehow you were saved
&gt; whats left of steves body lay on before you, broken on the floor
&gt;his head somewhere beneath the house, probably turned to pudding from that giant earthshaking stomp
&gt;Freja whimpers behind you
&gt;&quot;i-is it over?&quot;
&gt; you drop the fire poker and run your fingers through your hair
&gt;&quot;i..i think so&quot;
&gt;you hug her close 
&gt;&quot;i think so&quot;</textarea>
