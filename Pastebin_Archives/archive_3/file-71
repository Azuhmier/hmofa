Washington Daves?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He was named after a State and hated snakes for some reason.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn&#039;t hate Snakes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In fact, there was a lovely village of Anthro snakes that helped you on one of your past expeditions.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But for now, you&#039;re deep in the Amazon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;About 3 days ago you got dropped off at a dirt airstrip on the outskirts of the jungle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you had first chartered the plane you imagined one of those nifty pontoon boats.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Instead you you found a man calling himself &quot;Mr. Worldwide&quot; with a beat up plane.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Is that an Italian Plane from Fucking WWII?&quot; you had asked in disbelief.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He had nodded vigorously, his bald head reflecting sunlight like a weird mirror.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yessir!

WORLDWIDE!&quot; and taking off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;From there, you went from town to town.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At one of the towns some of the locals pointed you in this direction:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A Village of Tribal Anthros, Jaguars apparently.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They have contact with the outside world but prefer their life in the rainforest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had to admit it, had a certain appeal to it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No Modern day stresses, no bills...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Too much work, though.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This tribe could supposedly guide you to a long lost treasure of the Mayans.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Inside a pyramid that was inside a giant cave.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This would be your greatest discovery by far!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But first, you had to find the village and convince one to lead you there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You re-adjust your rucksack and keep forging ahead.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As much as you loved the rainforest, you didn&#039;t want to get caught outside at night either.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was steadily approaching...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...Well, not steadily- but it was almost 1800hrs and the sun was due to set at 2000hrs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Checking your map and compass as you walk, you make sure you&#039;re still on track.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could use a GPS to find it too, but that should be reserved for emergencies.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No place to charge it in the middle of the jungle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But, voices cause you to stop.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Voices!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Village!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You trudge through the green leaves of the rainforest towards the lively sounds of civilization...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...Well, civilization in a way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A large leaf is pushed out of your way, and you&#039;re staring at the village...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jaguar anthros stare at you in confusion and curiosity.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It must be pretty strange for a random human to just kinda wander into their village.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A male approaches you, pointing a spear at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You immediately raise your hands.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uh, Hello! English?&quot; you say with a smile, Making sure not to show any teeth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Is it dogs or cats that don&#039;t like teeth being shown?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You weren&#039;t going to chance it either way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear a few of the anthros talking in their language...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Similar to Mayan, so you barely understand it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But, also mixed with what sounds like Spanish and Portuguese...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Jaguar male stands with his spear pointed at you while one of the anthros runs off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesus, he&#039;s at least 7 foot tall!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They are all much bigger than you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stand with your hands up, no need to piss them off at all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After all, you only wanted their help, not to get killed by them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before long a group of anthro runs up, followed but a much smaller, much poofier anthro.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;HELLO!&quot;, it calls out to you in a very feminine voice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Guess its a female.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uh, hi, can I not be impaled please?&quot; you say to her with a pleading smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stops in front of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What do you want, outsider?&quot; She puts her hands on her hips in a very western kind of way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to remain courteous...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Just want some help finding some old ruins and not getting impaled, please.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your smile is both fake and genuine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As much as you didn&#039;t want to get stabbed in the face, you also didn&#039;t want to talk to someone while a spear was in your face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The little anthro studies you for a moment before barking something in the language you don&#039;t understand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The other anthros talk back in their tongue, causing the small anthro to fold her ears...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...But thankfully, the spear is lowered and the Jaguars suddenly begin to ignore you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lower your hands and look to the small anthro cat in front of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uh, hi...I&#039;m Anon, Professor Anon. To whom do I owe the pleasure?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You extend a hand cautiously to the maybe 5 foot tall feline...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles earnestly and takes your hand into her paw.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hi Proficcccer Anon! I Am Jani!&quot; she says, as she shakes your hand vigorously.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uh, you can just call me Anon.&quot; you say, taking note of her inability to say &quot;professor&quot; correctly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gives a toothy smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;OK Anon! Come with me!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still holding your hand with her paw she practically drags you away.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So uh, Jani, right? How do you speak English so well?&quot;, you ask as she drags you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She dances along, pulling your through the village.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Jani trades with the local towns a lot! Had to learn!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look left and right as you&#039;re pulled along...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The huts these Jaguar anthros live in are getting scarcer and scarcer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This was a fairly large village, yet for some reason you&#039;re being led away from it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All the while Jani babbled about &quot;Modern&quot; stuff.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Jani just saw that there is a such thing as COLOR Television! How do they get those people so tiny to fit in it?!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Color television?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Didn&#039;t that come out in the 70s?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you walk and Jani talks you notice something...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There aren&#039;t anymore huts and you&#039;re well outside the village.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just one ahead of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Plus, now that you&#039;re not distracted by the scenery, you take notice of Jani...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s wearing next to nothing, a small loincloth and a simple chest wrap around her modest bust.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Brownish red hair flows from on top of her head and down her back, a simple gold band encircles her left upper arm...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Golden fur with brown spots encircled by black rings and a white tummy...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A happy smile covers her muzzle and her hazel eyes light up as shes pulls you along.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;The others in the tribe said you can&#039;t stay in the village, so you&#039;ll have to stay out here! Do you have any of that modern food!? Jani loves modern food!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She comes to a stop in front of a small fire outside a simple hut, letting go of your hand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The other huts looked a bit more refined, like they would have 2 or three rooms.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This one looked like it could fall over at any moment, large branches holding it up...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...As well the clay used on the walls wasn&#039;t nearly as well compacted as the other huts had been.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Huh, maybe they had visitors more often than you thought.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Obviously, this was a hut for guests.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not even a proper door, just some cloth covering the entrance.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Can&#039;t say you&#039;re quite surprised.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You walk into the hut, pushing past the cloth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A slight &quot;Meep!&quot; is heard from Jani, but you ignore it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The hut is not much more than you expect.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No windows, a small bed made up of pelts, a few odd trinkets around.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looks like who ever stayed previous to you had tried to make a furnace...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Failed at it, but tried.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jani enters after you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh, uh OK!

Come, come!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She grabs the 4 fish and plops down firmly in your lap.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Eat! We will need our strength for tomorrow!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She bites into one of her fish as the sun starts to set.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The sound of drums permeates the air and you can see torches in the distance burning.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shadows of anthros walking and dancing, and singing in their language.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jani bounces happily in your lap while rocking side to side.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What is going on out there, Jani?

&gt;It should be around here somewhere.
&gt;They said it was, why would they lie to you?
&gt;Well, besides the fact that you&#039;re an outsider wandering through the amazon and they could kill you and steal your stuff...
&gt;...But hopefully that&#039;s just your overactive imagination getting the best of you.
&gt;You are Professor Anon, Archaeologist.
&gt;Like a real Archaeologist, not like that crazy madman from the movies.
&gt;What was his name?
&gt;Montana James? Washington Daves?
&gt;He was named after a State and hated snakes for some reason.
&gt;You didn&#039;t hate Snakes.
&gt;In fact, there was a lovely village of Anthro snakes that helped you on one of your past expeditions.
&gt;But for now, you&#039;re deep in the Amazon.
&gt;About 3 days ago you got dropped off at a dirt airstrip on the outskirts of the jungle.
&gt;When you had first chartered the plane you imagined one of those nifty pontoon boats.
&gt;Instead you you found a man calling himself &quot;Mr. Worldwide&quot; with a beat up plane.
&gt;&quot;Is that an Italian Plane from Fucking WWII?&quot; you had asked in disbelief.
&gt;He had nodded vigorously, his bald head reflecting sunlight like a weird mirror.
&gt;&quot;Yessir! I&#039;m Mr. Worldwide and this is my 305!&quot;
&gt;Always interesting characters to be met on expeditions...
&gt;...But whatever, it flew.
&gt;Although you swore you heard &quot;Mr. Worldwide&quot; mumbling in Spanish the entire flight.
&gt;When he dropped you off he gave a small wave and put on some bad sunglasses before shouting &quot;MR. WORLDWIDE!&quot; and taking off.
&gt;From there, you went from town to town.
&gt;At one of the towns some of the locals pointed you in this direction:
&gt;A Village of Tribal Anthros, Jaguars apparently.
&gt;They have contact with the outside world but prefer their life in the rainforest.
&gt;You had to admit it, had a certain appeal to it.
&gt;No Modern day stresses, no bills...
&gt;Too much work, though.
&gt;This tribe could supposedly guide you to a long lost treasure of the Mayans.
&gt;Inside a pyramid that was inside a giant cave.
&gt;This would be your greatest discovery by far!
&gt;But first, you had to find the village and convince one to lead you there.
&gt;You re-adjust your rucksack and keep forging ahead.
&gt;As much as you loved the rainforest, you didn&#039;t want to get caught outside at night either.
&gt;It was steadily approaching...
&gt;...Well, not steadily- but it was almost 1800hrs and the sun was due to set at 2000hrs.
&gt;Checking your map and compass as you walk, you make sure you&#039;re still on track.
&gt;You could use a GPS to find it too, but that should be reserved for emergencies.
&gt;No place to charge it in the middle of the jungle.
&gt;But, voices cause you to stop.
&gt;Voices!
&gt;The Village!
&gt;You trudge through the green leaves of the rainforest towards the lively sounds of civilization...
&gt;...Well, civilization in a way.
&gt;A large leaf is pushed out of your way, and you&#039;re staring at the village...
&gt;Jaguar anthros stare at you in confusion and curiosity.
&gt;It must be pretty strange for a random human to just kinda wander into their village.
&gt;A male approaches you, pointing a spear at you.
&gt;You immediately raise your hands.
&gt;&quot;Uh, Hello! English?&quot; you say with a smile, Making sure not to show any teeth.
&gt;Is it dogs or cats that don&#039;t like teeth being shown?
&gt;You weren&#039;t going to chance it either way.
&gt;You hear a few of the anthros talking in their language...
&gt;Similar to Mayan, so you barely understand it.
&gt;But, also mixed with what sounds like Spanish and Portuguese...
&gt;The Jaguar male stands with his spear pointed at you while one of the anthros runs off.
&gt;Jesus, he&#039;s at least 7 foot tall!
&gt;They are all much bigger than you.
&gt;You stand with your hands up, no need to piss them off at all.
&gt;After all, you only wanted their help, not to get killed by them.
&gt;Before long a group of anthro runs up, followed but a much smaller, much poofier anthro.
&gt;&quot;HELLO!&quot;, it calls out to you in a very feminine voice.
&gt;Guess its a female.
&gt;&quot;Uh, hi, can I not be impaled please?&quot; you say to her with a pleading smile.
&gt;She stops in front of you.
&gt;&quot;What do you want, outsider?&quot; She puts her hands on her hips in a very western kind of way.
&gt;You try to remain courteous...
&gt;&quot;Just want some help finding some old ruins and not getting impaled, please.&quot;
&gt;Your smile is both fake and genuine.
&gt;As much as you didn&#039;t want to get stabbed in the face, you also didn&#039;t want to talk to someone while a spear was in your face.
&gt;The little anthro studies you for a moment before barking something in the language you don&#039;t understand.
&gt;The other anthros talk back in their tongue, causing the small anthro to fold her ears...
&gt;...But thankfully, the spear is lowered and the Jaguars suddenly begin to ignore you.
&gt;You lower your hands and look to the small anthro cat in front of you.
&gt;&quot;Uh, hi...I&#039;m Anon, Professor Anon. To whom do I owe the pleasure?&quot;
&gt;You extend a hand cautiously to the maybe 5 foot tall feline...
&gt;She smiles earnestly and takes your hand into her paw.
&gt;&quot;Hi Proficcccer Anon! I Am Jani!&quot; she says, as she shakes your hand vigorously.
&gt;&quot;Uh, you can just call me Anon.&quot; you say, taking note of her inability to say &quot;professor&quot; correctly.
&gt;She gives a toothy smile.
&gt;&quot;OK Anon! Come with me!&quot;
&gt;Still holding your hand with her paw she practically drags you away.
&gt;&quot;So uh, Jani, right? How do you speak English so well?&quot;, you ask as she drags you.
&gt;She dances along, pulling your through the village.
&gt;&quot;Jani trades with the local towns a lot! Had to learn!&quot;
&gt;You look left and right as you&#039;re pulled along...
&gt;The huts these Jaguar anthros live in are getting scarcer and scarcer
&gt;This was a fairly large village, yet for some reason you&#039;re being led away from it.
&gt;All the while Jani babbled about &quot;Modern&quot; stuff.
&gt;&quot;Jani just saw that there is a such thing as COLOR Television! How do they get those people so tiny to fit in it?!&quot;
&gt;Color television?
&gt;Didn&#039;t that come out in the 70s?
&gt;As you walk and Jani talks you notice something...
&gt;There aren&#039;t anymore huts and you&#039;re well outside the village.
&gt;Just one ahead of you.
&gt;Plus, now that you&#039;re not distracted by the scenery, you take notice of Jani...
&gt;She&#039;s wearing next to nothing, a small loincloth and a simple chest wrap around her modest bust.
&gt;Brownish red hair flows from on top of her head and down her back, a simple gold band encircles her left upper arm...
&gt;Golden fur with brown spots encircled by black rings and a white tummy...
&gt;A happy smile covers her muzzle and her hazel eyes light up as shes pulls you along.
&gt;&quot;The others in the tribe said you can&#039;t stay in the village, so you&#039;ll have to stay out here! Do you have any of that modern food!? Jani loves modern food!&quot;
&gt;She comes to a stop in front of a small fire outside a simple hut, letting go of your hand.
&gt;The other huts looked a bit more refined, like they would have 2 or three rooms.
&gt;This one looked like it could fall over at any moment, large branches holding it up...
&gt;...As well the clay used on the walls wasn&#039;t nearly as well compacted as the other huts had been.
&gt;Huh, maybe they had visitors more often than you thought.
&gt;Obviously, this was a hut for guests.
&gt;Not even a proper door, just some cloth covering the entrance.
&gt;Can&#039;t say you&#039;re quite surprised.
&gt;You walk into the hut, pushing past the cloth.
&gt;A slight &quot;Meep!&quot; is heard from Jani, but you ignore it.
&gt;The hut is not much more than you expect.
&gt;No windows, a small bed made up of pelts, a few odd trinkets around.
&gt;Looks like who ever stayed previous to you had tried to make a furnace...
&gt;Failed at it, but tried.
&gt;Jani enters after you.
&gt;&quot;Oh, uh OK! Yeah! Modern stuff, Jani, I have some, uh, cliff bars I can share with you...&quot; you say, looking around.
&gt;You hear footpaws tapping on the ground slightly as she bounces on her tiptoes.
&gt;&quot;Yay! Jani wants to try them all!&quot;
&gt;You take off your pack and set it down before sitting on the &quot;bed&quot;.
&gt;Grabbing a few cliff bars from it, you pull them out and look at up Jani...
&gt;Only to see her stripping in front of you.
&gt;You cover your eyes and feel your face getting flushed.
&gt;&quot;Uh, Jani, why are you getting naked?&quot;
&gt;When she answers, you can hear the confusion in her voice.
&gt;&quot;Clothes are for outside! Not for inside silly!&quot;
&gt;That doesn&#039;t make you feel better.
&gt;&quot;If I give you cliff bars will you put your clothes back on?&quot; you ask, already knowing the answer.
&gt;&quot;Nope! Gimme!&quot;
&gt;You feel clawed paws pull your hands away from your face.
&gt;Tiny, grabby paws...
&gt;&quot;Now give me those food bars, Jani wanna taste the modern world!&quot;
&gt;Taste the modern world?
&gt;Jani furiously tries to pry your fist open to get the cliff bars.
&gt;Aside from the feeling of claws you also feel her soft fur and pressure on either side of your arm.
&gt;You relent and open your eyes to a sea of gold fur and 2 white furred mounds engulfing your arm.
&gt;&quot;OK, OK! I&#039;ll give you the bars! Just let go!&quot;
&gt;She lets you, and you pull your arm away then hand her 3 different bars.
&gt;&quot;Oh, oh! DIFFERENT COLORS! What do they mean prof?&quot;
&gt;She literally said &quot;prof&quot;.
&gt;&quot;Just call me Anon, and they&#039;re different flavors, they say so on the packaging.&quot;
&gt;Her ears fold back as she looks at the different colored snacks...
&gt;&quot;Oh, uh.. Jani can&#039;t read.&quot;
&gt;Wow, now you feel like a dick.
&gt;You point out each one...
&gt;&quot;This one is White Chocolate Macadamia, this one is Pumpkin Spice, this one is Mint Chocolate.&quot;
&gt;She looks them all over...
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s a pumpkin? And what&#039;s YOUR favorite one?&quot; she says, her hazel eyes lighting up as she looks at you.
&gt;You point to the White Chocolate Macadamia bar as you explain
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s my favorite, A pumpkin is a bright orange vegetable.&quot;
&gt;She tears into the packaging and takes a large bite out of the bar.
&gt;&quot;OOOO Ish shweet!&quot;, Jani says with her mouth full.
&gt;You smile as you dig through your pack more.
&gt;&quot;So Jani, I need help finding a ruin inside a cave...&quot; you say, as you pull out your map.
&gt;You unroll it on the ground.
&gt;&quot;Would you happen to know where it is?&quot;
&gt;Jani comes around behind you and you feel her lean against you, her breasts on your back.
&gt;You point to various spots on the map, trying to ignore the obvious nipples you feel through your shirt...
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s supposed to be in a cave behind a waterfall that has rainbow colored water.&quot; you say, pointing to various spots on the map.
&gt;Jani puts more of her weight on you as she looks over the map.
&gt;&quot;You mean the sacred falls? Jani Knows where that is!&quot; She says suddenly, bits of the cliff bar falling out of her mouth.
&gt;You feel your heart jump into your throat.
&gt;She KNEW where it was!
&gt;Jani slides off your back and sits next to you.
&gt;&quot;C-can you show me where it is?&quot;, you stammer out.
&gt;She puts a padded finger to her chin.
&gt;&quot;Uhmmm, Jani is not supposed to take outsiders there, you will have to do something for me.&quot;
&gt;She would probably just want more Cliff bars!
&gt;&quot;Sure! Whatever you want!&quot;, you say with a smile.
&gt;She smiles broadly back at you.
&gt;&quot;OK! Jani will take you tomorrow!
&gt;You can feel you hands trembling as you look at her.
&gt;&quot;Really?!&quot;
&gt;She cocks her head to the side.
&gt;&quot;Jani said she would, didn&#039;t she?&quot;
&gt;You feel like you could hug her.
&gt;Fuck it.
&gt;&quot;Thank you, Jani!&quot;
&gt;You wrap your arms around her in a hug.
&gt;Her body tenses up and her paws lock up at her sides...
&gt;You break away immediately.
&gt;Fuck! Was there some kinda taboo against hugging?
&gt;Did you just like, insult her ancestors?
&gt;&quot;Jani, sorry, sorry I ju-&quot;
&gt;She pounces on you with a hug.
&gt;&quot;JANI NEVER GETS HUGS! THANK YOU PROF ANON!&quot;
&gt;Holy shit, for a cat her size, she gives a crushing hug.
&gt;Her supple breasts are pressed against your face as she hugs you.
&gt;&quot;Jani! Lemme go, I can&#039;t breathe!&quot;, you choke out past the sea of fur.
&gt;&quot;Sorry! We need to eat and then go sleep! Jani will get some food real quick!&quot;, she says as she lets you go.
&gt;She puts on her loincloth and chest wrap, then darts out the door in a bounding skip.
&gt;What have you gotten yourself into?
&gt;You study your map for about 15 minutes before Jani comes running back into the hut with 4 fish on a spear.
&gt;&quot;Jani caught dinner!&quot; she says with a toothy grin, showing you the fish.
&gt;You&#039;re pretty sure at least one of those is endangered, but you aren&#039;t gonna press it.
&gt;She beckons you outside...
&gt;You follow her and find her setting the fish up by the firepit.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s not modern food, but it&#039;s good!&quot;, Jani says sitting down on a log near the fire.
&gt;You sit next to her and look around.
&gt;&quot;Thanks for letting me stay outside the village, but I&#039;m sure your family is expecting you back home, Jani.&quot;
&gt;This point is so far removed from the village it&#039;s no wonder it was used for outsiders.
&gt;Jani cocks her head at you.
&gt;&quot;Jani has no family, this is my home.&quot;, she says, motioning to the hut...
&gt;Your heart sinks.
&gt;This tiny beat up hut was her home? You assumed it was a little place for outsiders or traders
&gt;&quot;Wha? Where is your family, Jani? Why are you so far outside the village?&quot;
&gt;She draws in the dirt with a stick, looking away.
&gt;&quot;Jani is...different, not pure blood Like the rest of the tribe.&quot;
&gt;Pure blood?
&gt;You feel you shouldn&#039;t pry, though.
&gt;Maybe one more question and you&#039;ll leave it be.
&gt;&quot;What do you mean, Jani?&quot;
&gt;She points to the gold band on her arm.
&gt;Are those...African symbols?
&gt;&quot;Father was from outside, across the still river...what is word...Ocean? He was a different kind of cat, not a jaguar. Mother was a Jaguar shaman here, she died giving me life.&quot;
&gt;You stare at her for a moment.
&gt;She&#039;s a hybrid? That explains why she&#039;s smaller...
&gt;&quot;But now is time for food! Come, come!&quot;
&gt;She grabs the 4 fish and plops down firmly in your lap.
&gt;&quot;Eat! We will need our strength for tomorrow!&quot;
&gt;She bites into one of her fish as the sun starts to set.
&gt;The sound of drums permeates the air and you can see torches in the distance burning.
&gt;Shadows of anthros walking and dancing, and singing in their language.
&gt;Jani bounces happily in your lap while rocking side to side.
&gt;&quot;What is going on out there, Jani? What are they singing about?&quot;, you ask as you pick up your own fish on a stick.
&gt;It doesn&#039;t look all that bad, plus in your travels you&#039;ve eaten much MUCH worse than cooked fish.
&gt;This is actually pretty tame, considering.
&gt;&quot;They are doing ritual dances for a good hunting year and that many healthy cubs are born; They sing for peace with the locals and for the river to have plenty of fish.&quot;
&gt;There is a hint of sadness in her voice.
&gt;&quot;I usually spend nights alone...but you entered my home! So now I have responsibility to take care of you! You were supposed to sleep out here, though.&quot;
&gt;What?
&gt;You forced your way into her house and now she has to take care of you?
&gt;Wow, you feel like a dick again.
&gt;You eat and watch the shadows in the distance while Jani hums to herself.
&gt;Her happy rocking as she eats almost makes you forget that she&#039;s wearing next to nothing.
&gt;THAT thought causes a slight stirring in your trousers...
&gt;You try to ignore the pressure from Jani, but when she leans back against you and begins purring...
&gt;...Well, that was more than you bargained for.
&gt;Hopefully, your thick pants would keep her from noticing.
&gt;Judging from how she keeps humming along with the music, you&#039;re gonna say she hasn&#039;t.
&gt;Only when she looks back at you and smirks do you think she&#039;s doing it on purpose...
&gt;...But her happy smile kills that thought quickly.
&gt;&quot;Come come Prof! We must go to sleep!&quot;, she stands suddenly and pulls you into the hut.
&gt;You have to admit, it was nice to see someone so energetic.
&gt;You go to your rucksack and pull your sleeping bag off the top of it and unroll it on the other side of the hut away from Jani&#039;s bed.
&gt;&quot;Why you going over there? Get over here next to Jani!&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s stripped naked again and is patting the earth next to her &quot;bed&quot;.
&gt;Right, clothes are for outside.
&gt;Sighing and wondering what this will entail, you drag your sleeping bag next to Jani and get into it.
&gt;&quot;Night, Jani.&quot;
&gt;You turn away from her and close your eyes...
&gt;A tugging as the sleeping bag zipper causes you to turn back around.
&gt;&quot;Let Jani in! It is my responsibility to take care of you!&quot;
&gt;You try to shoo her away; &quot;It&#039;s fine Jani, you&#039;ve done enough for me.&quot;
&gt;She shows you her razor sharp claws.
&gt;&quot;Let Jani in or Jani will let herself in!&quot;
&gt;FUCK.
&gt;You unzip the sleeping bag only to have her slide into it next to you and zip it closed.
&gt;Try to NOT think about the small naked woman pressed against you...
&gt;The feeling of a rough tongue going through your short hair breaks your concentration.
&gt;&quot;Jani...what are you doing?&quot;, you ask, both confused and afraid of the answer.
&gt;&quot;It is *lick* customary *lick* for a host to groom *lick* her guest&quot; she says, licking your hair.
&gt;&quot;You are easy to groom, though.&quot;
&gt;You sigh.
&gt;&quot;Can you at least put your clothes on, then?&quot;
&gt;She lets out a cute and angry &quot;HUFF&quot;.
&gt;&quot;No.&quot;
&gt;She then continues licking your hair.
&gt;Might as well accept your fate.
&gt;You close your eyes and try to ignore the licking tongue of Jani and the drums of the village.
&gt;Before long, the licking stops and furry arms wrap around you, a slight purring vibrates your core.
&gt;Finally, you fall asleep.
&gt;Tomorrow will start the rest of your life.
 
 
 
Chapter 2: Easy
 
 
&gt;You awake to whiskers tickling your nose.
&gt;Whiskers? What?
&gt;Why are you purring?
&gt;You open your eyes and remember why.
&gt;Jani is curled up around you in your sleeping bag.
&gt;Her head rests on your shoulder and her arms are wrapped around you.
&gt;Soft purring fills your ears.
&gt;She&#039;s actually quite cute...
&gt;But you had to get up and get going to the &quot;Sacred falls&quot;.
&gt;&quot;Jani, Jani wake up.&quot;, you says softly, trying to rouse her gently.
&gt;She slowly opens her hazel eyes and stares at you for a moment...
&gt;&quot;Hmm, o que está acontecendo? Quem é você?&quot;
&gt;She blinks a few times in confusion...
&gt;&quot;OH! PROF! Good Morning! You&#039;re comfy to sleep on!&quot;, she says with a big smile.
&gt;She yawns loudly, showing off her fangs.
&gt;You wish you could unzip the sleeping bag, but you&#039;re currently being held captive by a small naked feline girl.
&gt;In any other situation, you wouldn&#039;t be complaining.
&gt;And technically, you still aren&#039;t.
&gt;But you have places to be today.
&gt;&quot;Jani, let&#039;s get going, ok? Can you let me go so we can get going?&quot;, you say, trying to squirm out of her tight embrace.
&gt;As you squirm, you can feel her nipples pressed against you...
&gt;She gives another loud yawn and lets you go.
&gt;&quot;OK Prof! Jani wants to try the other two bars you gave me anyway!&quot;
&gt;You quickly unzip the sleeping bag and begin packing your gear up for the trek ahead.
&gt;How far was it to the falls? Jani didn&#039;t say.
&gt;You don&#039;t care either way, as long as this wasn&#039;t a wild goose chase.
&gt;Jani munches happily on a Pumpkin Spice Cliff Bar and watches you roll up your sleeping bag
&gt;&quot;That snuggle bag is comfy! You&#039;re also comfy!&quot;, she says, talking with her mouth full.
&gt;Making a &quot;raised in a barn&quot; or &quot;raised by wolves&quot; just  doesn&#039;t seem right.
&gt;You nod as you pull out a Cliff Bar for yourself to eat.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s very useful when I go on expeditions.&quot;
&gt;You look at her and see her eyes light up.
&gt;&quot;Expeditions?! You travel like this all the time, Prof?&quot;
&gt;You nod once more.
&gt;&quot;Yeah, I go on these from time to time. This might be the most profitable one yet!&quot;
&gt;She cocks her head to the side while she chews.
&gt;&quot;Profitable?&quot;, she asks before shoving the rest of the bar into her mouth.
&gt;Thinking about it makes you smile.
&gt;Many of the artifacts would be sent to a museum.
&gt;Some of it, you could keep and sell though.
&gt;Nothing historically significant!
&gt;But some gold coins would augment your living expenses and fund this trip.
&gt;&quot;Yeah, some of these help me live a comfortable life in the US.&quot;, you say absentmindedly.
&gt;Jani quickly eats the other cliff bar and smiles.
&gt;&quot;I can&#039;t wait to see it all!&quot;, she says excitedly.
&gt;Yeah, someday she might see it all, but you doubt she will.
&gt;If she hasn&#039;t left this village by now, she never would.
&gt;Even though it looked like the other villagers treated her badly...
&gt;Not your problem.
&gt;You slip your rucksack onto your back calmly.
&gt;&quot;Ready to go, Jani?&quot;, you say, looking to her.
&gt;She smiles as she puts on her simple garments.
&gt;&quot;Ready!&quot;
&gt;She pushes past her &quot;door&quot; and you follow her calmly.
&gt;Sunlight streams through the foliage of the forest and sprinkles of rain hit you.
&gt;A beautiful day in every sense of the words.
&gt;&quot;This way Prof!&quot;, Jani says, skipping ahead of you.
&gt;You follow quickly as she leads you to the village.
&gt;But as soon as you both reach the huts, she visibly shrinks back, her ears folded down.
&gt;She slows down and waits for you to catch up, then grabs your arm.
&gt;She tries her hardest to hide under it as you walk through the village.
&gt;You look around and see the other the Anthros looking at her with what you assume is disgust.
&gt;&quot;Dabe!&quot;, you hear one hiss as she passes by.
&gt;She shrinks down more.
&gt;An insult?
&gt;Jesus, she should have left this place years ago.
&gt;You frown.
&gt;She didn&#039;t ask to be born like this, so why do they hate her?
&gt;You look down at her and see you must&#039;ve put and arm around her and pulled her close.
&gt;Protective you guess, even though you didn&#039;t realize you did it.
&gt;When you reach the other side of the village, she livens back up.
&gt;It&#039;s like night and day, seeing her in the village and out of it.
&gt;Jani once again skips ahead happily.
&gt;&quot;This way, Prof! We have a ways to go!&quot;, she says, bouncing along happily.
&gt;You can&#039;t help but ogle her a bit.
&gt;Yeah, you have seen her naked and have slept with her- well, she slept with you.
&gt;But seeing everything bounce is both hypnotic and jaw dropping.
&gt;She leads you through the jungle, occasionally stopping and waiting for you.
&gt;She&#039;s much faster than you are.
&gt;After all, she&#039;s not carrying a huge pack.
&gt;And she&#039;s used to this jungle.
&gt;The whole time Jani is excited and skipping while asking about modern things.
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s a plane? How do they fly? How do they get tiny people into the TV? Are those people on that island still stuck there?&quot;
&gt;She must&#039;ve seen a bit of Gilligan&#039;s Island.
&gt;You don&#039;t mind answering the questions, but it&#039;s a bit tricky explaining TV.
&gt;You aren&#039;t 100% sure how they work either, and you don&#039;t want to confuse her.
&gt;But you knew enough about planes and fluid dynamics to explain how they worked.
&gt;For about 3 hours Jani leads you, talking about how she can&#039;t wait to see the world.
&gt;The tell tale sounds of a waterfall distracts you from her cheery bubbling, though.
&gt;You push forward, feeling reinvigorated.
&gt;&quot;The sacred falls are here, Prof!&quot;, Jani says as she disappears behind from foliage.
&gt;Moving the branches and vines out of the way, you finally see it...
&gt;A waterfall with dim rainbow hues dancing across it.
&gt;Strong wind constantly blows in the opposite direction of the water.
&gt;Huh, the wind must kick up water droplets which refract the light, coloring the falls with a permanent rainbow.
&gt;Neat.
&gt;It&#039;s not too tall, maybe 150 feet tops, with cliff-faces of white stone decorated with colorful flowers and plants.
&gt;Exotic birds nestle throughout.
&gt;&quot;This way, Prof!&quot;, Jani calls out as she walks along a ledge.
&gt;As much as you wanted to sight see, you also didn&#039;t want Jani to run off without you.
&gt;Quickly rushing after the bubbly feline, you make sure not to look down.
&gt;You follow her along the thin rocky ledge, the roaring waterfall getting closer and closer.
&gt;It really is pretty up close.
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t fall, Prof! We&#039;re almost there!&quot;
&gt;Jani disappears behind the waterfall with a wave.
&gt;You dash to catch up and follow her behind the roaring water.
&gt;The rocks are a bit slick as you walk carefully.
&gt;Your fuzzy tour guide is waiting there for you.
&gt;&quot;OK, Prof! Do you have one of those thingies? Uh...light stick?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Flashlight.&quot;, you say as you grab it from the shoulder pouch on your rucksack.
&gt;You turn it on and see Jani&#039;s hazel eyes widen in amazement.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s like you have the sun in your hands, Prof! It&#039;s so bright! The fires in the village aren&#039;t even this bright!&quot;, She says, circling around you like an over excited anime girl.
&gt;You notice she&#039;s careful not to get in the beam of it, though.
&gt;Cute.
&gt;&quot;Lets go, Jani.&quot;, you say with a small smile.
&gt;Luckily, it doesn&#039;t look like she needs to lead anymore because it&#039;s just a tunnel at this point.
&gt;She stays behind you as you walk down the tunnel.
&gt;&quot;You need a fire here, though!&quot;, she says, tugging your shoulder and pointing at a sconce.
&gt;A quick rummage through your pack and you have an old weathered butane lighter.
&gt;A few flicks and a small flame dances in the reflection of Jani&#039;s eyes...
&gt;She&#039;s pressed close to you, her ears folded down.
&gt;&quot;Jani does not like the dark.&quot;
&gt;She grips your hand and guides the flame to the sconce and lights it.
&gt;The flame traces down a line, lighting it quickly.
&gt;You watch as it shoots forwards and reveals a giant temple in the cave...
&gt;Your mouth drops open as you eye it.
&gt;It&#039;s really real!
&gt;A gorgeous temple made of intricately carved limestone!
&gt;Within, you can see golden relics and jewels glinting in the firelight!
&gt;This was going to make you rich!
&gt;AND it was a huge historical find for you!
&gt;Why wouldn&#039;t it be?
&gt;Everything you knew about ancient anthros was fascinating!
&gt;Ever since you got pulled to this world, they had been amazing!
&gt;And this would top it all off!
&gt;A fully preserved temple, hidden from water erosion and biting winds...
&gt;You walk forwards and feel Jani wrap her furred arms around your arm.
&gt;&quot;Uh...normally outsiders would not be allowed here...&quot;, she says hesitantly, &quot;...but Jani doesn&#039;t care anymore, since Jani is leaving the village!&quot;
&gt;You smile at that, the memory of how those jaguars treated her stung the back of your mind.
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s great Jani, thank you for bringing me here.&quot;
&gt;She looks up at you and smiles happily.
&gt;&quot;Yep it is!&quot;
&gt;You walk to the temple, trying hard to stay calm.
&gt;So much gold, so much knowledge...
&gt;As you approach you can see so much.
&gt;Including what appears to be a chest.
&gt;A chest? Chests weren&#039;t made here in South America. That was...a European thing?
&gt;The temples torches blaze as you walk in and push the chest open.
&gt;Doubloons, millions of dollars worth of Spanish doubloons...
&gt;Cortez must not have been able to win in this timeline.
&gt;You would have to read up on history later.
&gt;But this gold was yours! Everything else here could go to museums, but these were yours1
&gt;You pick up handfuls and let it rain through your fingers.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m rich! Jani! You&#039;ve made my life so much easier! Thank you!&quot;
&gt;Jani bounces next to you happily.
&gt;&quot;You&#039;ve made mine better too, Prof! When are we going back to the modern world?&quot;
&gt;You blink for a moment, your mind drawing a blank.
&gt;&quot;What?&quot;
&gt;Jani hugs you.
&gt;&quot;You said you would do anything if Jani lead you here! So please; Take me with you!&quot;, she says with a happy smile.
&gt;But...you thought she wanted cliff bars...Not this.
&gt;Her Hazel eyes glint the firelight as she pulls against you.
&gt;&quot;Jani needs to get out of the village, they are mean! Please, Prof!&quot;
&gt;You open and shut your mouth a few times then turn away...
&gt;...Could you?
&gt;You promised and she did lead you here.
&gt;Your eyes focus on the gold in front of you.
&gt;Could you take this poor Hybrid girl from her village?
&gt;She was nice and friendly.
&gt;A bit clingy, but seductive and snuggly...
&gt;Yeah...you could take her away.
&gt;Just thinking about how badly she was treated made you sick.
&gt;But this was gonna take a lot of bureaucratic power.
&gt;You turn back to Jani.
&gt;&quot;OK Jani, I&#039;ll take you with me.&quot;

Chapter 3: I Could Be Anything

&gt;You stand by the dirt airship, waiting impatiently
&gt;Mr. Worldwide said he would be here 3 hours ago
&gt;You didn&#039;t like waiting, especially when you paid good money for this
&gt;After Jani had lead you to the temple, you did many many things
&gt;Load up on as much gold as possible
&gt;Mark the location on a GPS system for the university that hired you to find it
&gt;And call a few friends
&gt;while in your head getting Jani into the US was easy, bureaucracy is a bitch and a half to deal with
&gt;How do you get a non-citizen of any country into your country?
&gt;She wasn&#039;t exactly legal in any sense of the word
&gt;No records, no birth certificate, no nothing
&gt;You had tried to reach out to a few contacts with your satellite phone but those things were always kinda sketch
&gt;Jani however is over joyed, bouncing around you happily and you stand stocic waiting for the old WWII plane to arrive
&gt;&quot;What are we doing here Prof?! Are we talking one of those metal boxes? Do you have any more food?!&quot;
&gt;the hyperactive hybrid, dug through your pack, climbed you, hugged you while crying and purred loudly as you both walked back to the airstrip
&gt;She also described how her fellow tribesmen treated her
&gt;Her mother died during childbirth, and the villagers only gave her the bare essentials of life
&gt;Not because of any sin she committed, in fact it seemed her mother was highly respected in the village and IF she had lived Jani would have been their next seer
&gt;But fate had other ideas
&gt;When Jani was born, the villagers killed her father, saying it was his fault their shaman died
&gt;And since then she was treated not as a child of the shaman but as an outcast
&gt;It broke your heart, thinking about a tiny Jani, a cub, alone in that hut you slept in, crying to herself
&gt;Silent tears ran down your face as she described it to you
&gt;You didn&#039;t let her see the tears of course
&gt;The far away buzz of a propeller causes you to focus back on the horizon
&gt;An old 305 appears above the canopy of the forest, causing Jani to gasp
&gt;&quot;A metal Bird?! How does it work!?&quot;
&gt;Your mind briefly wanders to airfoils and pressure differentials and how little you knew about them
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll tell you later Jani, for now just know that it will take us to the &quot;modern world&quot;&quot; you say with a calm yet annoyed smile
&gt;He should have been here a while ago and you had phone calls to make
&gt;Granted you didn&#039;t have time zones to worry about but still this would take time
&gt;The plane lands and slows to a halt in front of you before the canopy opens and you get the now familiar shout of &quot;MR.WORLDWIDE!&quot;
&gt;You frown at the bald man and clamber into the plane 
&gt;&quot;I thought you were going to be here hours ago, what happened?&quot; you ask as you set your bag at your feet
&gt;&quot;Mr.Worldwide couldn&#039;t remember where you were! also I see you made a friend&quot;
&gt;Jani looks apprehensively at you and the plane, bouncing on her foot paws gently
&gt;&quot;Jani gets into that?&quot; she says finally, eyeing the propeller and the plane as a whole
&gt;You nod calmly
&gt;&quot;Come on Jani, it&#039;ll take us to the modern world&quot;
&gt;You extend a hand calmly out of the small plane, a promise of a better life with you
&gt;Jani looks at it, seemingly torn
&gt;You knew what she was thinking about, more than she knew
&gt;She was leaving the only life she knew behind, every person she had ever known
&gt;While yes they treated her badly, that was all she knew
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s ok&quot; you carefully encourage
&gt;You knew she deserved better than that life, and ever since she told you how she had been treated you had decided that you were going to make her life better
&gt;She could travel with you around the world, or just relax and enjoy life as a wealthy anthro
&gt;Even if hybrids were somewhat shunned in the world, you now had all that gold
&gt;Rich people aren&#039;t treated badly, too many people want to suck up, become a fake friend in the hopes of getting something from it
&gt;You watch her Hazel eyes go from your hand to the plane and back again
&gt;&quot;OK Prof&quot; she says finally, placing her small paw in your hand
&gt;You pull her, gently and firmly to the plane
&gt;As much as you wanted her to have her own seat, the 305 wasn&#039;t big enough for that
&gt;So for the next few hours, you would have the hyper hybrid in your lap
&gt;You just hope she doesn&#039;t have a major (or minor for that matter) freak out about flying
&gt;Those claws of hers were deadly looking
&gt;She&#039;s climbs into the plane and therefore into your lap with a certain unease
&gt;Not that you can blame her
&gt;Weird man shows up with a weird metal bird and some guy you just met invites you into it
&gt;But she trusts you enough to listen to you
&gt;&quot;Stay calm, don&#039;t panic Jani&quot; you whisper as the canopy closes around you both
&gt;Her breathing grows rapid as the plane roars and begins moving faster than she&#039;s ever moved in her life
&gt;When it takes off finally, you ignore Mr.worldwide&#039;s mumbles in spanish
&gt;Mainly because you have about ten sharp claws digging through your pants into your lags
&gt;&quot;Up up up up! Jani is so High up!&quot;
&gt;Jani hyperventilates as she looks down as the world drops away from her
&gt;You grip her paws, feeling her claws dig into your hands
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s ok Jani, this is part of the Modern world&quot; you gasp as you feel those razor sharp claws dig into your flesh
&gt;A few short breaths and wild eyes looking at you
&gt;Quickly you pull your arms around her,a hug of your arms and hers
&gt;You read somewhere that animals like being wrapped up
&gt;While Jani wasn&#039;t an animal, she might like being swaddled in your arms
&gt;You feel her breathing eventually slow, her claw retract out of your skin and she breaths slow
&quot;Jani is flying....Jani is FLYING!&quot; she finally spouts
&gt;Your arms bleed a bit as the 305 flies
&gt;When the plane finally landed you paid Mr.Worldwide with a few gold coins
&gt;Fuck that was probably enough to keep his business going for years
&gt;Now you stand in the middle of a modern airport
&gt;Not an international airport by any means, more a local one
&gt;Dozens of different propeller planes sit in the tarmac
&gt;Jani is Latched onto you, her face covered in both wonder and fear
&gt;&quot;Th-they all can fly Prof?&quot;
&gt;Her voice is higher than normal, and quieter
&gt;You pet her reddish hair softly with your free hand
&gt;&quot;These are small planes Jani, where you were wasn&#039;t quite caught up with the rest of the world&quot;
&gt;She stares up at you in confusion
&gt;&quot;What do you mean Prof?&quot;
&gt;You walk her quickly across the airstrip, explaining the modern world
&gt;Planes that can carry hundreds, how everyone is connected to each other
&gt;Cell phones!
&gt;She stares in awe as you pull out your smart phone, take a picture of her and show it to her
&gt;&quot;OH! That is Jani! How is Jani in the tiny box?!&quot; she exclaims  while trying to snatch your phone away
&gt;While you don&#039;t know how cameras work really, you try to explain as you lead her through the city you landed in
&gt;Along the way you explain cars, highways, and various other things
&gt;Even when you lead her into the hotel room she stares around, confused
&gt;You notice all the stares you&#039;re drawing from people
&gt;Why wouldn&#039;t you draw attention? you were covered in dirt and leading a small cat wearing next to nothing through a five star hotel lobby
&gt;&quot;Room for 2 please&quot; you say to the small Anthro lizard at the check in desk
&gt;Ignoring the look it gives you (Honestly you can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s male or female) you pulls Jani a bit closer to you
&gt;While she is clearly loving the modern world, she&#039;s poofed up in fear
&gt;As soon and the lizard gives you the keys you have to lead / drag Jani to the elevator and bribe her with food to get her onto it
&gt;When it started moving she wrapped herself around you and dug her claws through your shirt and skin
&gt;New scars from this adventure....
&gt;Finally the elevator stops and you can pull Jani into the room
&gt;&quot;Is this your Home Prof?&quot; Jani remarks as she finally pulls her claws out of your arm and begins looking around the room
&gt;&quot;No this is like a..temporary home, like a modern campsite&quot; you explain while shedding your rucksack
&gt;Jani has already stripped of her clothes and it poking one of the beds
&gt;&quot;What are these soft things Prof?!&quot; she exclaims before climbing onto it and jumping on it
&gt;No reason to spare expenses now
&gt;While your gold coins were a secret, you also were paranoid of would be thieves
&gt;You explain hastily what beds are to Jani as she bounces on the bed, all of her bits jiggling
&gt;What a show...
&gt;But you had other things to worry about now as you use the hotels phone to call a familiar voice
&gt;&quot;Hello this is Jasmine with the BHA!&quot; a Cheerful voice sounds off
&gt;You smile at her cheerfulness
&gt;Ever since she found that guy, whats his face, duckman? turkeyman? some kind of poultry; she had been so much happier
&gt;&quot;Hi Jasmine! It&#039;s Professor Anon. I have a slight issue that I hope you can help me with&quot; you say through the phone, mesmerized by Jani&#039;s bouncing
&gt;Jiggly bits.....
&gt;&quot;Really Professor? Again with customs? What are you trying to smuggl-&quot;
&gt;You cut her off, while not wanting to be rude, you had a small hybrid girl to contain
&gt;&quot;I found an anthro, a hybrid feline, that wants to come with me to the US from here in the amazon, what do I do?&quot;
&gt;Jasmine&#039;s voice changes instantly
&gt;&quot;A hybrid? From there?! Uh..&quot;
&gt;You hear papers shuffle as she speaks
&gt;&quot;Well according to this, if you&#039;re married to her, and its via tribal means, you can bring her home with you&quot; Jasmine says with a bit of uncertainty
&gt;While you are quite fond of the Tigress, this wasn&#039;t something you wanted to fuck up
&gt;&quot;Can I, or can I not bring her back with me? I Promised her...She was treated like shit back in her village&quot; 
&gt;More paper shuffles and a much more confident voice
&gt;&quot;If you are with her then the US will let her in as a citizen&quot; 
&gt;Ok so pretend you&#039;re married to her?
&gt;Are you willing to do that?
&gt;She literally made you a millionaire so yea you are
&gt;&quot;Alright Jasmine, thanks&quot; you exclaim calmly
&gt;&quot;No problem Professor!&quot; she says with a happy charm you aren&#039;t used to
&gt;Heh that guy must&#039;ve done a lot for her 
&gt;As you hang up the phone you look over to the tiny hybrid feline jumping from bed to bed
&gt;You get rooms with two beds when you arrive at hotels out of habit
&gt;2 beds meant a bigger room and a &quot;bench&quot; to put your luggage
&gt;But now Jani was bouncing  back and forth between the two happily
&gt;&quot;Is all Modern stuff this Fun!?&quot; she Chirps as she sails through the air like a tiny bird
&gt;You shake you head &quot;not everything but most of it&quot;
&gt;The modern world did have something you had missed though
&gt;Showers, and you needed one badly 
&gt;All the towns you visited didn&#039;t have running water and you can only get SO clean in a river full of fish
&gt;Not to mention Piranha anthros were not the nicest bunch
&gt;&quot;Jani I&#039;m going to shower really quick, please don&#039;t break anything&quot;
&gt;This causes her bouncing to immediately stop
&gt;&quot;Whaa? whats shower Prof?&quot;
&gt;You motion her to you with your hand and lead her into the large bathroom
&gt;Hotels nowadays always had Anthro friendly showers and large hairdryers
&gt;Nozzles from every direction to spray warm water and large bottles of anthro shampoo
&gt;&quot;This is a shower&quot; you explain as you turn on the water and let her see it
&gt;&quot;We use these to get clean&quot;
&gt;Gently you guide a shivering paw under one of the jets of water
&gt;She touches it a bit and pulls back, then pushes her paw deeper into the stream
&gt;&quot;Warm! How is it warm!?&quot;
&gt;You think about explaining water heaters to her but opt to not confuse her more
&gt;&quot;It just is Jani, do you want to shower first?&quot; You ask with a knowing smile
&gt;&quot;NO!&quot; 
&gt;Her response startles you a bit before she explains
&gt;&quot;Prof has to shower with Jani! Jani groomed Prof when he was in her home, you must do the same!&quot;
&gt;Fuck
&gt;The determined look on Jani&#039;s muzzle tells you that there was no way to get out of this
&gt;Sighing, you strip down to your boxers and begin to get into the shower only to be pulled back
&gt;&quot;NO!, Clothes are for outside Prof! Those off!&quot; Jani says pointing to your undergarments
&gt;Well you tried
&gt;You strip off your boxers and get into the shower before Jani can place anymore demands on you
&gt;Jani Stares to you for a moment then sees the claw marks on your arms from her
&gt;&quot;Did Jani do that to you Prof?&quot; 
&gt;You extend a hand to her
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s fine Jani, come on&quot;
&gt;Her tiny paw meets your hand and you pull the feline into the shower
&gt;&quot;Warm and wet! Jani likes this!&quot;
&gt;You squirt a bit of Shampoo into your hands and begin lathering up Jani&#039;s fur
&gt;This was a whole new thing for you
&gt;Granted you had been with Anthros before, how could you not on your travels, but this was new
&gt;This was close and intimate as Jani&#039;s vibrating purrs overpower the sound of the water
&gt;You dig your fingers through her thick fur, washing away the dirt from the jungle
&gt;The water going to the drain is a dirty brown as years of grime get pushed away by your hands and long fingers
&gt;Carefully you wash her extremities, being certain to make sure she&#039;s clean
&gt;Her back was pretty dirty too, chances are she never had anyone to help her clean up in a river or where ever her tribe cleaned themselves
&gt;The ever present purring intensifies as you wash her lower back, your fingers parting her fur like waves of golden grain
&gt;Although you hesitant at her round ass, you remind yourself that this was for getting her clean and not sexual
&gt;Yep totally non sexual, nothing sexy about turning her so she can face you and press her large breasts against your body
&gt;Nothing sexual, just snaking your fingers through her red hair down her curvy, fit body
&gt;Gently pressing your fingers and short nails through the fur covering her round glorious ass you wash away the dirt from all of the years
&gt;Jani looks up at you with her big hazel eyes as she purrs happily
&gt;&quot;This feels sooooo Good Prof! Don&#039;t forget my front!&quot;
&gt;You smile as you continue washing and massaging a bit
&gt;She turns away from you and grabs your hands, placing them on her white furred breasts, &quot;Clean here too Prof!&quot;
&gt;Wew lad this is more than you bargained for
&gt;But you comply, gently cleaning her white fur
&gt;Thankfully she handles her nethers herself as you wash her tummy
&gt;She beams at you as you quickly clean yourself
&gt;&quot;Prof! You are MUCH better at grooming than Jani is, we should do this a lot!&quot;
&gt;You actually have to agree with her on this
&gt;&quot;Yea Jani we should do this more&quot; you say as you turn off the water
&gt;&quot;Ohh chilly!&quot; She squees softly as you usher her into the blow dryer
&gt;Anthro blow dryers are basically like this big air tunnels
&gt;You shut the door to it after you step in with Jani
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s gonna be a bit loud, don&#039;t panic&quot;
&gt;You click the &quot;on&quot; button and with a loud WHOOSH, warm air billows around you and Jani
&gt;The water in her fur is wisped away as she grips your hands with her paws
&gt;Before long both of you are dry and stepping out of the dryer
&gt;&quot;Do you like the modern world so far Jani?&quot;
&gt;She nods frantically with a large smile on her muzzle
&gt;&quot;Yes! Although Jani is unsure why people wear so much clothes!&quot;
&gt;That sends a new thought your way
&gt;Jani needs clothes, although you doubt she will want to wear much
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s just our culture Jani, we should get you some today for the flight back home&quot;
&gt;She looks at you confused
&gt;&quot;More flying?&quot;
&gt;You nod as you pull on some of your cleaner clothes
&gt;&quot;More flying to get back to my home, hopefully you&#039;ll like it&quot;
&gt;Jani&#039;s fur is still puffed out spectacularly as you look at her with a smile
&gt;&quot;We should get you dressed to go get some clothes&quot; you say as you dig through your pack
&gt;Finally you dig out an oversized shirt and hand it to her
&gt;&quot;Put this on Jani, and I&#039;ll show you some of the city&quot;
&gt;You hand the shirt to her which she sniffs a few times then looks at
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s wrong with Jani&#039;s old clothes?&quot; she says finally, looking up to you in confusion
&gt;The torn and ragged Loincloth and chest wrap Jani used to wear are on the ground, looking less like clothes and more like rags used to clean parts of an automobile engine
&gt;Of course you don&#039;t want to outright insult Jani saying that
&gt;&quot;Uh...I thought you would want more MODERN clothes&quot; 
&gt;Instantly Jani&#039;s eyes go wide and light up in excitement
&gt;&quot;YES! Jani wants That Prof!&quot; she cheers happily as she attempts to put the shirt on
&gt;However it doesn&#039;t appear she really knows how to put on a shirt because she&#039;s trying to put her head through the sleeve
&gt;You chuckle a bit and walk over to help her
&gt;When you finally get the shirt on her right she looks up at you with a cheerful smile
&gt;Cute doesn&#039;t even begin to describe her now
&gt;Tiny cat in a large t shirt that goes to her mid-thighs 
&gt;You smile back and fish for some boxers in your pack
&gt;&quot;Ok now put these on Jani&quot;
&gt;You hand the undergarments to her only to have her look at them, then chuck them towards a window with a short &quot;NOPE!&quot;
&gt;She probably intended for them to go out the window honestly
&gt;&quot;Jani is fine with just this!&quot; she says cheerfully, twirling in the t-shirt
&gt;You frown slightly 
&gt;Clothes shopping was going to be interesting
&gt;But you relent for now, even if she was going commando
&gt;Hopefully she keeps her tail down
&gt;&quot;Alright come on Jani! Let&#039;s get you modern clothes!&quot; you say as you usher her out
&gt;Thankfully the scratches on your arms have stopped bleeding as you lead your tiny hyperactive cat through the hotel and back to the outside world
&gt;Your cat? Is she really yours?
&gt;Well Jasmine did say you had to be &quot;married&quot; to her to fulfill your promise
&gt;She holds your arm as you both walk down the street, wide eyed and asking about every little thing
&gt;It&#039;s actually cute explaining fire hydrants, parking meters, traffic lights etc to her
&gt;Before long though you find just what you need
&gt;Tourist towns ALWAYS have a type of clothes shop near the hotels
&gt;This one was no different
&gt;You lead her inside and go to the woman&#039;s Anthro section
&gt;How does this work...you know how to buy Male clothes
&gt;&quot;Uh... Jani anything you like here?&quot; you ask her as she looks around
&gt;Her paw has a firm hold of your hand as she pulls you to the mens section 
&gt;&quot;These!&quot; she says with a cheery toothy smile
&gt;Shes led you to more oversized t-shirts
&gt;&quot;These are Men&#039;s Clothes Jani, Female clothes are over there&quot; you say a bit downtrodden, pointing back where you came from with her
&gt;&quot;NO! Jani wants just these if she has to wear clothes!&quot;
&gt;You rub your temples a bit
&gt;Was this a fight you wanted to have with her?
&gt;Fuck it was probably one you weren&#039;t going to win anyway
&gt;&quot;Fine pick a few you want Jani&quot;
&gt;She busies herself happily, digging through the various Shirts
&gt;After a little while she brings you about seven oversized shirts
&gt;&quot;Jani Likes these!&quot;
&gt;She would pick one with a bunch of wolves howling at the moon
&gt;Whatever
&gt;&quot;Ok Jani, come on Let&#039;s Pick out some underwear now&quot; you say leading her back to the female anthro section
&gt;Luckily there is a wide variety for her to pick from, and hopefully she wouldn&#039;t mind these over your boxers
&gt;&quot;NO! Jani Doesn&#039;t Like these!&quot;
&gt;Fuck, she yelled that loud enough to get people&#039;s attention
&gt;&quot;Jani will NOT wear these&quot; She Hisses before pressing against you and pull your arm between her breasts
&gt;&quot;Hmmm Maybe Jani will wear them if Prof puts them on her&quot; she suddenly purrs
&gt;You look to her then around at the rest of the store
&gt;People are staring at you with wide eyes
&gt;Also NO BONER
&gt;She&#039;s just unsure of how to put them on you tell yourself
&gt;But her purring tells you otherwise
&gt;NOPE
&gt;&quot;Alright fine we&#039;ll skip the underwear&quot; you murmur in defeat
&gt;But you have one more thing to try
&gt;You lead her to the swimsuit section
&gt;She is used to loincloths and chest wraps, maybe she&#039;ll be ok with a swimsuit?
&gt;&quot;These are uhm...Modern clothes like you had&quot; you lie through your teeth to her
&gt;Her eyes widen at the selection
&gt;&quot;Modern clothes like Jani used to wear!&quot;
&gt;She lets go of your hand and searches through the selections of brightly colored fabrics
&gt;&quot;I LIKE THIS ONE PROF!&quot; She exclaims holding out a neon pink Sling bikini
&gt;You stare at it at a loss for words
&gt;It looks like it would cover her nipples and her pussy but not much else beyond that
&gt;Beggars can&#039;t be choosers though
&gt;&quot;Ok Jani. Try it on and we&#039;ll see&quot;
&gt;You instantly regret your words as she begins taking off the shirt
&gt;&quot;Whoa WHOA! Hol&#039; up!&quot; you rush over to her, and pull the shirt back down
&gt;Jani gives you a confused and annoyed look
&gt;&quot;Prof told Jani to try it on! Jani is trying it on!&quot;
&gt;You pull her to a dressing room
&gt;&quot;Try in on in there&quot;
&gt;She looks at the dressing room then to you
&gt;&quot;Nope, not without Prof to help&quot;
&gt;Again this was not a battle you would win so you enter the dressing room and motion for her to follow you
&gt;Now Jani Happily bounds into the dressing room 
&gt;&quot;It is tight in here Prof! Help Jani with her clothes!&quot;
&gt;Bossy little feline
&gt;You grip the hem of the shirt and pull it up and over her, causing her long hair to floof out a bit
&gt;&quot;Ok let&#039;s get this on you&quot; you say as you attempt to get the bikini on her
&gt;her excited bouncing doesn&#039;t help 
&gt;Neither does the bouncing of her breasts 
&gt;&quot;Stay still Jani&quot;
&gt;Your hands trace up and down her fur spreading the fabric across her body
&gt;When you finally get it on, you back away as far as the confined space will allow you to
&gt;A Simple &quot;V&quot; of pink fabric about 2 inches wide traces up her body
&gt;&quot;JANI LIKES IT! THANK YOU PROF!&quot;
&gt;Jani pounces on you with a hug, causing you to fall back out the door of the dressing room and onto the floor
&gt;And of course Jani lands on top of you with a big toothy smile
&gt;Also the whole store is looking at you, on the floor while you have a poofed out Jagcelot in a Bikini on top of you
&gt;Hastily you get Jani off you and get up, then help her up quickly
&gt;Time to go!
&gt;You grab Jani&#039;s paw and go the counter, where you pay for everything 
&gt;&quot;Jani is now Hungry, where can we hunt for food?&quot;
&gt;Oh you poor sweet feline! The future is now!
&gt;&quot;We don&#039;t have to hunt Jani, come on&quot; you lead her to a large food stand as the sun begins to set
&gt;Jani, still wearing her sling bikini, holds your arm tight as you order 
&gt;What the meal is called you don&#039;t know, but its rice, shrimp, a few veggies and some fish filets on top of it
&gt;You carry the meals and a few drinks to a table then set it all down 
&gt;&quot;Welcome to the modern world Jani! Try it&quot; you say with a smile as you hand her a fork
&gt;A quick demonstration of how to use a fork and she&#039;s digging in, happily purring as she eats
&gt;No manners at all but what do you care
&gt;&quot;Here try this&quot; you say as you slide an open can of Refreshing Dr.Pepper™ to her
&gt;In all of your worldly travels, both between this one and the one you lived in previously, no other drink came close to Dr.Pepper™
&gt;You sip your own as Jani tries it meekly, then chugs the Whole can
&gt;You&#039;re honestly impressed
&gt;&quot;GOOOO *urp* OOD! she squees with a slight burp
&gt;You smile as you eat quickly
&gt;&quot;Jani wants more!&quot;
&gt;You smile and hand her a few dollars
&gt;&quot;Just go up there and ask for it, them give them these&quot; you explain
&gt;She looks at the paper money
&gt;&quot;You can trade paper for Stuff!?&quot; she says with a wide smile
&gt;You weren&#039;t about to try to explain economics to her
&gt;&quot;Uh, special paper, yes. Now go get use both more food, you silly Kitty&quot;
&gt;With a large smile Jani bounds off as you check your phone 
&gt;The University is sending people to begin cataloging and getting the artifacts from the temple ready for transport
&gt;Anonymous people were appearing more frequently
&gt;Other unimportant news
&gt;As you look through your phone you open the picture you had taken of Jani 
&gt;The difference in her fur was much more visible now as you look over the top of your phone
&gt;She stands bouncing on her footpaws, waiting excitedly for the food
&gt;With her fur now clean, its beautifully shiny
&gt;Strands of bright golden fur like sunlight, her reddish hair like autumn leaves
&gt;Free of all that dirt and grime
&gt;And free of that village
&gt;You watch as she carries the food trays happily
&gt;&quot;Jani has more food!&quot;
&gt;You nod and smile at her
&gt;&quot;Alright then Jani, let&#039;s go back to the hotel, we have a busy day tomorrow!&quot;
&gt;She skips along next to you as you carry the clothes 
&gt;&quot;Yum yum yum, good good food!&quot; She hums as she bounces along
&gt;You can&#039;t help but smile at her happiness
&gt;Sure people might be staring at you and her, but what do you care?
&gt;They were probably just jealous because they DIDN&#039;T have a happy feline in a bikini
&gt;Even as you go through the hotel and back up to your room you can&#039;t help but feel that maybe Jani is just what your life needed
&gt;You open the hotel room door and set the bags down as Jani slides out of her bikini
&gt;&quot;Lets eat Prof! The mister at the food place said they gave us something different!&quot;
&gt;You take a quick look at the food ad see that its basic fish and chips
&gt;Jani picks out a fry and eats it cautiously before giving you a excited smile
&gt;&quot;YUUUM!&quot;
&gt;Once again she eats quickly as you eat slowly
&gt;Then when she finishes her food, she begins trying to take yours too
&gt;&quot;Hey hey! You had your own&quot; you laugh as you attempt to body block her away from your food
&gt;&quot;Give Jani yummies Prof!&quot; She retorts as she wraps her arms around your sides, trying to reach your fries
&gt;This goes on for a bit as you laugh and play keep away with her
&gt;Eventually though you relent and share with her
&gt;She purrs happily as she sits crossed legged on the bed, munching on one of the fried fish filets
&gt;As she finishes, she crawls over to you as you look at your phone once again
&gt;&quot;What is that in the hand box Prof?&quot; she asks, placing her chin on your shoulder and pressing against you
&gt;&quot;We have a flight back home tomorrow Jani, was just checking when we have to leave&quot; 
&gt;You reach one hand up and scratch her head gently
&gt;&quot;We should get some sleep Jani, we&#039;re gonna need it&quot; you say with a short yawn
&gt;Quickly you pull off your shirt and pants and climb into bed under the covers
&gt;&quot;Prof! Clothes are for outside only!&quot; 
&gt;Jani slides into the bed next to you and presses her furry body against you
&gt;&quot;What? you are naked Jani&quot;
&gt;You feel a clawed pad pulling at your boxers waistband
&gt;Oh no..She doesn&#039;t mean you too does she?
&gt;&quot;OFF!&quot; she demands, snapping the elastic against your skin
&gt;Fine whatever
&gt;You can think of hundreds of worse things to happen besides getting naked with a Nudist Hybrid feline
&gt;With a quick flourish, you slide them off fling them into the pile of clothes
&gt;&quot;Happy now?&quot; 
&gt;Jani&#039;s purrs are your only response as she wraps herself around you
&gt;Guess that&#039;s a yes
&gt;You lay on your back with Jani pressed against your side her head resting on your shoulder
&gt;Before long you close your eyes and drift off to sleep with your arm around her
&gt;The last thing you think is how happy you are that you took her from that village

Chapter 4: Sit Next To Me

&gt;A gentle smooth melody from your phone makes you open your eyes slowly
&gt;You never were a huge fan of loud buzzing alarms, a quiet one was enough for you 
&gt;The smol purring feline latched onto you also starts to stir as the music gets louder
&gt;The music lyrics makes you smile a bit as you start to get up
&gt;&quot;~So take me to the paradise&quot;
&gt;&quot;~It’s in your eyes&quot;
&gt;&quot;~Green like American money&quot;
&gt;&quot;~You taste just right&quot;
&gt;&quot;~Sweet like Tennessee honey&quot;
&gt;You smirk a bit at the last part as you get out of bed
&gt;Ah Borns, your lyrics never cease to amaze your inner lust
&gt;Jani purrs with a happy smile on her face as she opens her eyes and watches you start to get dressed
&gt;&quot;Prof, we are going to your home? Will Jani like it?&quot;
&gt;You nod as you pull on a shirt
&gt;&quot;You will Jani&quot;
&gt;The words of Jasmine float back to you as you pull your head through the hole in the top
&gt;&quot;If you&#039;re married to her, and it’s via tribal means, you can bring her home with you&quot;
&gt;You would have to let Jani know to keep up the charade
&gt;But as you watch her get out of the bed and begin pull on one of the oversize shirts you bought her yesterday you can&#039;t help but think one thing
&gt;&#039;Jani would probably be a great wife&#039;
&gt;Why wouldn’t she be? From what you can tell she’s friendly, happy and loves being with you
&gt;&quot;Jani&quot; you say calmly as she rushes over to you in a hug
&gt;&quot;Yes Prof?&quot; 
&gt;You look down at her and see her big hazel eyes looking up at you
&gt;There is so much joy in them, so much hope
&gt;Hope of leaving the hell she lived in before
&gt;And joy (at least you hope) that it was with you
&gt;&quot;When we get to my home, people may ask you if we are married, do you know this word?&quot;
&gt;Jani looks at you with a paw to her chin, a confused look on her face
&gt;&quot;I do not Prof, What is married?&quot; she asks, her ears flicking calmly 
&gt;That makes things easier at least
&gt;&quot;Married means we are together&quot; you explain without going into detail &quot;so if they ask say that we are ok?&quot;
&gt;Easier that way
&gt;She gives you a big toothy smile 
&gt;&quot;Ok Prrrrrrrof!&quot; she purrs while swishing her oversized t-shirt around
&gt;Cute
&gt;You pack up everything, including your large amount of gold coins that are in your rucksack
&gt;The university would bring the rest back to the US
&gt;They were yours, you let the university know that ahead of time
&gt;Honestly the discovery itself would fund them for years
&gt;But you, you wanted to be free of financial burdens
&gt;It’s so much easier to enjoy life when you didn’t have to worry about bills
&gt;They might say &quot;Money doesn&#039;t buy happiness&quot; but those fucks just didn&#039;t know what to do with the money
&gt;Not having to worry about bills meant you could do anything
&gt;Any hobby, any place you ever wanted to go to, anything you wanted to do
&gt;With money you could do it
&gt;Idiots
&gt;They just spent it on drugs and irresponsibility
&gt;You knew what to do with money and stay happy
&gt;Just keep doing what you were doing
&gt;Travel and help people see history
&gt;Jani smiles happily as you help her pack her stuff into a spare bag of luggage
&gt;Honestly if she always travels this light it would be easy for you
&gt;But you still think you need to convince her to not go commando everywhere
&gt;An argument for another time perhaps
&gt;Right now you were just happy to get her wearing clothes 
&gt;A quick call to a cab and you&#039;re heading downstairs for a hotel provided breakfast
&gt;Jani is amazed at the selection
&gt;Bacon, eggs, sausages and most importantly: Waffles
&gt;Any place that let you make your own waffles in one of those fancy swivel waffle makers was a good one
&gt;Waffles were the fucking best
&gt;Jani demolished her food and the majority of yours before you told her that it was all you can eat
&gt;After that she loaded up with as much bacon and eggs as she could
&gt;Where does she even store it all?
&gt;The grin on her muzzle was priceless and adorable
&gt;&quot;Food! Jani Loves this stripy food!&quot; she exclaims through a mouthful of bacon
&gt;You can’t help but smile as she munches happily on her food
&gt;Bacon was amazing and you can&#039;t hold loving it against her
&gt;But you and her had places to be
&gt;When she finished eating you took her paw and lead her outside, where a cab was waiting for you
&gt;At first she was a bit hesitant about getting into it
&gt;But when you slid in and offered a hand she happily jumped in and climbed into your lap with buzzing purrs
&gt;She was amazed by how fast the car went and you could see the Cab driver, an Anthro parakeet smiling when he drove faster
&gt;Each time Jani would make a loud &quot;WOWWW!&quot; while positively vibrating against you
&gt;Taking her to an international airport was interesting... for lack of a better word
&gt;While Jani had no metal on her besides her arm band, she insisted on looking at everything
&gt;You almost had to drag her away from the metal detectors
&gt;Much to your annoyance, you also had to keep telling her to keep her tail down
&gt;There was no need to show off everything! 
&gt;Her bikini was stashed somewhere in her luggage
&gt;As much as you wanted her to wear it WITH her T-shirt, it was a no go
&gt;She didn&#039;t like wearing any more than the bare minimum
&gt;But even know as you lead her onto the plane, you couldn’t help but feel this was the easy part
&gt;Some random country in South America wouldn&#039;t care about passports
&gt;They cared about money, which you luckily had a surplus of now
&gt;So you and Jani sat in first class, her with a window seat
&gt;When the plane took off she watched as the earth disappeared below her, her claws digging into your sleeve (while in the airport you purchased and put on a long sleeve shirt)
&gt;The rumble of the takeoff set her on edge too
&gt;&quot;Prof! How high up are we! Jani only see clouds below us!&quot;
&gt;You aren&#039;t sure how high the plane was cruising at, or that she would even understand the number that you told her
&gt;She has no context for it after all
&gt;But you might as well try
&gt;&quot;Picture the tallest mountain you’ve seen Jani, we are probably about 7 times higher than that&quot;
&gt;Her big hazel eyes light up in amazement
&gt;You knew that this flight would be a decently long one and that you should get some shut eye
&gt;But Jani probably would not sleep, and the last thing you wanted to do is leave her alone on a plane
&gt;&quot;Prof Come here! Jani wants you to tell me what these things are&quot;
&gt;She found one of those catalogs that has all those overpriced knickknacks in them
&gt;zyou lean a little closer to her to see what she’s pointing out
&gt;&quot;That’s a- OOF&quot;
&gt;As you get close she bounces into your lap 
&gt;&quot;Prof is the best seat! These chairs hurt my butt!&quot;
&gt;You feels you face go flush as a few other passengers on the plane look you way
&gt;Wait what do you care what they think? Not like you were ever going to see them again
&gt;So you focus on the small feline in your lap pointing at various objects in the catalog
&gt;While you explain the things to her you feels her purring start and her tail wrapping around your waist
&gt;Wait
&gt;If her tail is there that means....
&gt;The thought of her bare ass pressing against you would make you blush except the blood is going somewhere else 
&gt;Jani sees to not notice though thankfully
&gt;You continue pointing things out and explaining everything
&gt;Jani presses further back onto you and begins grinding her hips on you
&gt;She gives a smug smile
&gt;&quot;Proffff, Jani feels something poking her booty&quot; She whispers up at you
&gt;Damage control! DAMAGE CONTROL!
&gt;&quot;S-sorry Jani! It won&#039;t ha-&quot;
&gt;She gives you a quick wink
&gt;&quot;Jani Likes it&quot; she cuts you off, nuzzling against your chin
&gt;You weren&#039;t going to complain about that at all
&gt;After all you had seen her naked and even slept with her
&gt;Fuck it she was your hybrid feline! And your &quot;wife&quot;
&gt;You put and arm around her which makes her squeak happily
&gt;She continues her happy grinding on you as you near the end of the catalog
&gt;For the rest of the flight however, you&#039;re able to convince her to watch movies with you
&gt;First class had its perks and you were able to pick out a few to watch
&gt;When you asked the flight attendant for headphones made specially for Anthros she gave you a disapproving look as Jani sat in your lap happily munching on a sandwich or as she called them &quot;food books&quot;
&gt;How she got that name for them you don’t know but whatever 
&gt;You spend the rest of the flight watching movies with Jani, while occasionally pausing them to explain things to her
&gt;No they aren&#039;t really super powered
&gt;Yes cities like New York exists
&gt;No it wasn&#039;t attacked by aliens
&gt;Things like that
&gt;Even as the plane lands and rolls to the gate you&#039;re explaining things to her, although for the landing she had to get out of your lap
&gt;She was not happy about that part
&gt;Of course though, when the fasten seat belt turns off, everyone stands and attempts to push their way off the plane 
&gt;Filthy degenerates, pushing and shoving won&#039;t get you out of her faster
&gt;As such, you and Jani stayed seated and waiting for the majority of the crowd to filter out
&gt;Although Jani happily waves to almost everyone who looked at her, you can&#039;t help but think it’s cute
&gt;But still you know what’s coming
&gt;Customs would not be happy with you Bringing Jani into the US
&gt;You walk out of the airplane and down those tunnel things into the main section of the airport
&gt;Yep there they are, a goon squad of suits, a group of 3 humans staring at you
&gt;&quot;Mr. Anon?&quot; the first one says from behind dark glasses
&gt;Honestly, it looks stupid to wear sunglasses at 6 at night INSIDE, this isn’t a snazzy song!
&gt;&quot;That’s Professor Anon, thank you. What do you want?&quot;
&gt;&quot;We received information that you were bringing both large sums of gold and an undocumented immigrant to the US, Looks like that was true&quot; another one says
&gt;Great they have a hive mind
&gt;&quot;During my travels I happened to marry this Anthro, so she is a legal US citizen&quot; you answer with a frown
&gt;Jani Latches onto your side and tries to hide behind you
&gt;&quot;Do you have documents from the country you were in?&quot; a third one says stepping forwards
&gt;You can see Jani&#039;s reflection in his stupid looking mirrored glasses
&gt;&quot;It was a tribal marriage, as well I declared the gold I brought with customs&quot; you says calmly, keeping yourself between Jani and the goon squad
&gt;The three Men look at each other for a moment then nod
&gt;&quot;We&#039;re going to take her with us, and question her&quot; the lead one says moving forwards
&gt;&quot;Not you’re not, I am aware of my rights and HER rights&quot; you say keeping her behind you
&gt;The three spread out around you
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t make a scene, it will be easier for you&quot; one says as he walks, trying to get behind you
&gt;You could take on one you knew, in some of your expeditions locals taught you how to fight with different styles
&gt;But taking on 3 was different, although you’re sure Jani could also hold her own
&gt;The lead man Lunges, only for you to shove him back, but that was the opening they needed
&gt;One of them grabs a hold of Jani yelling &quot;COME QUIETLY&quot;
&gt;You had heard animals freak out before, when they panicked or thought they were going to be killed
&gt;That was nothing compared to the shrieks and screams that exploded forth out of Jani
&gt;&quot;NONONO JANI WILL NOT GO, JANI STAYS WITH PROF! GO AWAY MEAN PERSON!&quot;
&gt;Her claws dig deep into your arm as she holds on tight
&gt;A sharp &quot;OOF&quot; is heard over the din that Jani is causing and you see the man who grabbed her fall back, his glasses shattered from you assume was a kick from Jani
&gt;You’re prepared to keep this up but a familiar voice cuts through
&gt;A voice that right now sounds more beautiful than an angels
&gt;More wondrous than a choir
&gt;More melodious than Elvis
&gt;The lovely voice of Jasmine the tiger
&gt;&quot;STOP ALL OF THIS AT ONCE&quot;
&gt;The goon squad, seeing the large tiger run up showing off her &quot;BHA&quot; badge, back off
&gt;Was her fur always white? You hadn&#039;t seen Jasmine in a while so maybe she dyed it for poultryman
&gt;What was his name again? A though for another time
&gt;Jani wraps herself around you and eyes the tiger as she scrolls though her phone
&gt;&quot;According to section 8A subsection 2 Of the Anthro Immigration act, the US will honor &quot;Tribal Anthropomorphic Marriages&quot; as true Marriages, you are not only violating Professor Anon&#039;s 4th Amendment rights but also those of this Bride&quot; She Chastises the trio
&gt;They shrink back visibly from the tiger, as she gets their Names and Badge numbers 
&gt;You on the other hand, tend to comforting Jani, who looks in near tears as she holds onto you whimpering that she wants to stay with you
&gt;You rub her ears gently as you pull her closer to you
&gt;&quot;You aren&#039;t going anywhere without me Jani. Don&#039;t worry&quot;
&gt;She holds you tight as you look back to Jasmine who has finished dealing with the suits
&gt;&quot;I thought there might be a few problems here, so I decided to come. Plus I wanted to see your bride&quot; she says with a chiding smile
&gt;You Smile back and turn so Jani can see the tiger
&gt;&quot;Hi there, I&#039;m Jasmine! Sorry about the rough welcome to the US!&quot;
&gt;She holds out a paw to Jani, who hesitantly shakes it
&gt;&quot;My Name is Jani, does Jani have to leave Prof?&quot; she whimpers fearfully
&gt;&quot;No! In fact you can stay with him as long as you want&quot; Jasmine reassures her with a motherly smile
&gt;Jani looks from her to you quickly then releases you from her grasp to hug Jasmine
&gt;&quot;Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Jani never wants to leave Prof!&quot;
&gt;Jasmine seems shocked for a moment than pats Jani&#039;s head gingerly
&gt;&quot;You don’t have to thank me Jani, Us Hybrids have to stick together after all&quot; she says with a smile
&gt;Jasmine is a hybrid? News to you, but then again you never asked
&gt;Jasmine then gives you a quick look and a frown
&gt;&quot;Professor... Why is Jani only wearing a T-shirt?&quot; she asks, with a judging look on her muzzle
&gt;You frown
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re more than welcome to try to get her to wear more Jasmine, I haven&#039;t had any luck, she tried throwing the underwear I gave her out a window&quot;
&gt;Jasmine gives a short laugh as Jani goes back to you and holds your hand in her paw
&gt;&quot;Fair enough. Come on, I&#039;ll give you and your blushing bride a ride home!&quot;
&gt;She was really hammering this bride thing hard
&gt;Together with Jasmine and Jani, you go grab your luggage then head to the BHA SUV waiting 
&gt;Jasmine drives and you sit in the back with Jani, who looks out the window wide eyed
&gt;&quot;So Many lights! So Pretty! What’s that?&quot;
&gt;She points to a restaurant &quot;Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Chicken-venture&quot; 
&gt;&quot;OH ready for your first meal in the US Jani!?&quot; Jasmine says with a wide smile as she pulls into the drive through
&gt;You order almost everything off the menu and pay, refusing to let Jasmine pay a cent after saving your ass at the airport
&gt;Jani demolishes the food as you eat your single chicken sandwich
&gt;But the ride had to come to an end at some point
&gt;Jasmine pulls up in front of your house as Jani stares at it wide eyed
&gt;The sun has set as you grab the luggage out of the back of the SUV
&gt;&quot;Thanks for the save Jasmine and for the ride! I owe you one!&quot; you call out to the tigress
&gt;&quot;You don&#039;t owe me anything Anon, Just take care of that girl ok!&quot;
&gt;You nod as you wave her off and turn back to your house
&gt;Home sweet home!
&gt;A simple 2 story house
&gt;Well not simple, it was one of those &quot;modern&quot; looking houses that was more rectangular and covered in white metal
&gt;Large windows view the street
&gt;The house far enough to be removed from the main city and the suburbs, but close enough to still be convenient
&gt;You approach the front door, struggling to carry everything and unlock it
&gt;But you finally manage and push the door open
&gt;&quot;Welcome to your new Home Jani&quot; you say with a smile as you flick on the lights
&gt;Jani walks in, toe claws clicking softly on the tile floors as she looks around
&gt;&quot;This is your home?&quot; she says finally, looking at you as you close and lock the door
&gt;You shake your head at her
&gt;&quot;No, this is OUR home&quot; 
&gt;A huge smile crosses her face
&gt;&quot;Promise Jani can stay?&quot; she says as she leaps into your arms
&gt;You nod and pull her close for a hug
&gt;To think that you had originally planned to just leave this girl in her village!
&gt;Now you have a gorgeous Feline living with you!
&gt;&quot;Come on Jani, I’ll show you around!&quot;
&gt;You spend a little bit showing Jani around her new home, pausing occasionally to show her how things work
&gt;As well you home is littered with relics and artifacts from around the world
&gt;Samurai swords, ancient marble columns, Jewelry and other Knick knacks given to you by the cultures you visited
&gt;There was even a Shed skin from the Princess of the Snake Anthros (apparently it was a great honor to be given it) 
&gt;When the tour is finally over she stares at you for a moment, then pulls her shirt off
&gt;&quot;Clothes are for outside!&quot;
&gt;You weren&#039;t going to complain
&gt;&quot;Help me unpack Jani&quot; you say going back to the front hall
&gt;The luggage had been left discarded, so you carry it upstairs and unpack as Jani explores the her new bedroom
&gt;You clear out a draw or 2 for her meager amount of clothes and grab your dirty clothes and toss them in a hamper
&gt;No way were you doing laundry tonight
&gt;And finally you secure the gold in your safe
&gt;When at last you finish, you have a very sleepy feline laying on your bed
&gt;That fast food must&#039;ve made her sleepy, plus you both had a rough day
&gt;Plane rides, and fighting government goons
&gt;You strip down silently, knowing that if you tried to wear underwear Jani would tear them apart
&gt;So you get into your familiar bed, nuzzling Jani as she wraps her tail around your leg and her arms around your neck
&gt;&quot;Prof?&quot;
&gt;Her large Hazel eyes look at you, deep as the ocean
&gt;&quot;Yes Jani?&quot; 
&gt;After a bit of hesitation she lets out a quiet &quot;Thank you&quot; then kisses you
&gt;So this is what a kiss with an Anthro is like
&gt;Warmer, fuzzier, whispers tickle your face and nose before you part from her
&gt;&quot;You don&#039;t need to thank me Jani, I&#039;m Happy to have you hear with me&quot;
&gt;She gives you a small smile before burying her face into your chest
&gt;&quot;Prof what is word....Bride? Jasmine kept saying Jani was your bride&quot; Jani asks sleepily
&gt;That question catches you off guard
&gt;How do you answer it?
&gt;&quot;Uh... A Bride is like...A Mate... For life&quot; you answer with a bit of uncertainty
&gt;How would Jani take that?
&gt;Her eyes snap open to look at you, her fur poofed and eyes wide
&gt;&quot;Jani is your mate?&quot;
&gt;Uh oh
&gt;Did she not like that?
&gt;&quot;Uh.... If you want to be?&quot;
&gt;Her Lips curl into a huge toothy smile
&gt;&quot;Of course Jani wants to be your Mate! She will Bare Many many cubs for you Prof!&quot;
&gt;Oh god yes
&gt;Another fuzzy kiss and the feeling of tiny paws exploring your body
&gt;Tonight was going to be a busy night...
&gt;And you&#039;re totally ok with that

Chapter 5: Something Just Like This

&gt;Dim lights fill your room as you lay in Bed with Jani
&gt;Her tiny paws feel and explore your body as you kiss her and 
&gt;Her Deep hazel eyes pierce yours as you slowly and meticulously feel her curvaceous body
&gt;You&#039;ve been staring at the body of hers for days, amazed by her perky tits and shapely ass
&gt;Even that first night by the fire as she rubbed against you while watching the rest of the tribe
&gt;Or the teasing shower play, or the gentle lap dance on the plane....
&gt;&quot;Jani?&quot; you ask as you run a hand down her long fluffy tail
&gt;&quot;Yes Prof?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Have you been trying to seduce me all along?&quot;
&gt;She gives you a guilty smile
&gt;&quot;Jani wanted to tease you! She liked your smell when we met&quot;
&gt;You give a small chuckle and pull her close
&gt;&quot;Well now I get to tease you&quot; you say with a smile
&gt;You fingers run down her body, parting her soft fur 
&gt;Ever since that shower with her, her fur felt heavenly soft
&gt;Investing in some of that high quality Anthro shampoo sounds like a good idea right about now
&gt;Softly you grip one of Jani&#039;s breasts and squeeze it, eliciting a tender moan from the feline
&gt;&quot;Prof... It feels good&quot; she moans before pulling you into a kiss
&gt;You feel her raspy tongue push into your mouth exploring and tasting you while you do the same to her
&gt;All the while you trail one hand down her body, savoring the feeling of soft fur and searching for her tender wetness
&gt;At long last, you feel her fur begin to thin slightly and you hand finds its target
&gt;Suddenly however, Jani Slams her legs closed
&gt;&quot;Uhh Jani is Unsure Prof, She doesn&#039;t know what to do...&quot;
&gt;Right... how would she know anything about breeding or sex, she&#039;s lived along for so long
&gt;You gently kiss her
&gt;&quot;Its ok Jani, just let me take the lead&quot; you say softly as you gently push her legs apart
&gt;She doesn&#039;t resist at all as you renew your exploration of her body, rubbing her pussy gently
&gt;With a single finger you begin, feeling and pushing past her lips, making sure you&#039;re going slow enough to not hurt or alarm her
&gt;Her hazel eyes are locked onto yours as she gasps from your touch
&gt;&quot;Prof, Jani feels weird...but good weird&quot; she moans as you gently rub your finger across her clit
&gt;She pulls you into another kiss as you feel her getting wetter and wetter
&gt;Holding your lower lips softly in her teeth, she begins that magnificent purr as you slowly press you finger into her wetness
&gt;Slow caressing, pushing it slowly into the small felines body
&gt;Letting go of your lip, she bites her own, looking into your eyes and breathing deep
&gt;&quot;Do you like it Jani?&quot; you ask as you reach your final knuckle
&gt;She nods slowly and deliberately, still biting her lip
&gt;&quot;Ready for a bit more?&quot;
&gt;Another nod, much quicker this time
&gt;You smile and slowly push one more finger into her pussy, which quivers a bit as it slides in with a little bit of resistance
&gt;Jesus she&#039;s so tight, but you aren’t surprised 
&gt;Start slow, work your way up to full speed
&gt;Slowly you begin sliding your fingers in and out of her wet pussy, curling each one in search for her spot
&gt;She shivers and quakes in your arms as you finger her, slowly speeding up
&gt;You bow a head down, and grab a hold of one of her nipples in your mouth as she lets out loud moans of pleasure
&gt;In and out, forward and back into Jani your fingers plunge
&gt;The tip of your finger brushes a small area inside her that causes a loud moan, and a gasped &quot;Prof!&quot;
&gt;There it is, Her G-spot
&gt;How an area so small could send shiver up her spine you didn&#039;t know
&gt;But you don’t care either
&gt;Quickly you adjust your finger so that each time you push into her you graze it
&gt;Jani&#039;s purring never stops and her hazel eyes never leave yours as you finger her hard
&gt;&quot;Profff, Profff! Jani F-feels, - F-FeelS SOmTHNNNNNGG&quot; She moans loud as she grabs onto you
&gt;You wince and Jani&#039;s shard claws dig into your back while her body arches and spasms
&gt;the pain doesn&#039;t stop you though, instead it spurs you on
&gt;Plunging your fingers deeper than before and pressing your thumb on her small clit
&gt;&quot;P-Pr-Prof! W-Whats HappenNNNNGGGG?&quot; she gasps as her Body shudders and spasms
&gt;Her walls tighten as you slow down and wait for her tremors to subside
&gt;She&#039;s left panting and quivering, look up at you with a half formed smile
&gt;&quot;Prof *ha* what *ha* was that?&quot; she pants out, shivering as her aftershocks subsides
&gt;You slowly pull your fingers out of her and lick them before answering
&gt;&quot;That was an orgasm Jani&quot; you say looking into her eyes that shine like diamonds &quot;Did you like it?&quot;
&gt;She bites her lower lip once more and nods
&gt;&quot;Ready for the real deal?&quot;
&gt;Her eyes widen slightly
&gt;&quot;You mean we will actually mate Prof?&quot; she whispers 
&gt;Her reaction has you slightly taken aback
&gt;&quot;Yes Jani... Why wouldn’t we?&quot;
&gt;She fidgets with her tail as a few left over tremors hit her
&gt;&quot;The....The other villagers said Jani would never mate... She was too small and not a pure blood&quot;
&gt;Her ears fold back and she looks down sadly
&gt;You place finger to her chin and make her look up at you
&gt;&quot;Jani, am I one of the villagers?&quot; you ask with a small smile
&gt;She returns the smile and you feel a small paw wrap around your member
&gt;&quot;No Prof... You’re so much more&quot;
&gt;But as she feels it the smile turns to one of shock
&gt;&quot;Prof....why is it so...&quot; you tense yourself for the hit to your ego
&gt;You aren&#039;t small! Really! You’d been with enough Human women to know how to please a lady and knew you were bigger than most
&gt;&quot;So big?&quot; Jani finishes
&gt;SCORE
&gt;&quot;And why are there no Uhmm...Barbs?&quot; she asks, looking down under the blankets at you cock
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not an Anthro&quot; you say with a smile
&gt;She quietly nods as she continues rubbing you delicately with her paws
&gt;You, shift in the bed so yours sitting up against your headboard, and gently guide Jani so she’s straddling you, your cock pressed to her dripping wetness
&gt;&quot;Take it slow Jani, I don&#039;t want to hurt you&quot;
&gt;She gives a quiet nod and rubs her paws on your chest, trailing down to your cock 
&gt;&quot;Jani is ready...” she whispers to herself before lifting herself slightly, then lowering herself slowly
&gt;You assist her by positioning your shaft against her pussy as she slowly lowers herself
&gt;As she lowers herself inch by inch, centimeter by centimeter all you feel is her
&gt;The overwhelming heat, the tightness beyond compare
&gt;You had been with other women before, human women specifically
&gt;This was beyond compare
&gt;Jani&#039;s wetness, as it slide over you was more than anything you had ever felt before
&gt;You place your hands on her hips and slowly guide her
&gt;&quot;It doesn&#039;t hurt Jani?&quot; you ask calmly, more concerned about her than your pleasure
&gt;Of course she felt amazing but at the moment you were more concerned with her
&gt;&quot;Profffffff, it feels soooo good&quot; She moans as her paws fall onto your chest
&gt;You grip her hips, encouraged by her words
&gt;&quot;Ready for more?&quot; you ask, ready to help her move slowly
&gt;Jani nods slowly, through her gasps and her claws periodically digging into your chest
&gt;God those claws are sharp
&gt;Your hands on her curvy body, your finger digging through her soft fur, her constant vibrating purr
&gt;So many new sensations that made human women never compare
&gt;&quot;Prof I-it f-feels g-good&quot;&quot; Jani moans, falling against you
&gt;You wrap your arms around her, and thrust into her
&gt;Heat, wetness, and tightness
&gt;So many sensation
&gt;On top of the new ones
&gt;Fur, claws, whispers and purring
&gt;So many feelings that draw you closer to Jani
&gt;As you hold her tight and thrust into her, her purrs grow louder
&gt;All the while you whisper to her
&gt;&quot;Ooooh Feels good, do you like it Jani?&quot;
&gt;And she purrs out her answer &quot;Feeeeeels good Prof, keep going&quot;
&gt;You kiss her, feeling her sharp fangs as you continue pushing deep into her body
&gt;Slowly, gently, you place your hands on her hips and aid her movements
&gt;Not up and down yet, it&#039;s far too early to start right off with that
&gt;Grinding motions, small circles in her, letting you feel out her insides
&gt;Its hot inside her, sweltering almost, and her pussy is the tightest you’ve ever felt
&gt;Human girls just CAN&#039;T Compete with Jani
&gt;How had you missed out on this!? You had spent so long traveling and seeing Anthros now you feel dumb for not &quot;sampling&quot; each one
&gt;But that doesn’t matter and Jani&#039;s tiny body rides you and digs her claws into your back as she wraps her arms around you
&gt;Purring moans and kisses, this was everything you never knew you wanted
&gt;You slowly lift her a bit and then drop her back down, getting a sharp gasp and a flick of her tail against your legs
&gt;&quot;OHHH!&quot; is all she can moans as you begin guiding her hips up and down against your member
&gt;She nuzzles into your chest, letting you take the lead as you begin pumping her up and down faster on you
&gt;Small wet slapping sounds are heard each time you bring her down onto you
&gt;Jani shivers and shudders as she moans louder, telling you that your bringing her to her limit
&gt;You hear sharp tight gasps from Jani in your ear as she clings to you, lost in the pleasure
&gt;&quot;P-prof! I-it&#039;s... Jani&#039;s is C-cummMINNGGG&quot;
&gt;You wince as she drags her claws over your back, leaving scratches all over
&gt;But that doesn’t stop you at all
&gt;Her orgasm somehow made her even tighter, bringing you that much closer to ecstasy
&gt;&quot;J-Jani Are you ready to M-mother my cubs!?&quot; You gasp out trying to hold on a little longer
&gt;This snaps her back to you
&gt;&quot;YES. Give Jani lots of cubs!&quot; She moans
&gt;You thrust up into her clenching wetness and fill her with your seed, savoring the tightness as you push deep into her
&gt;&quot;YESSSS&quot; She moans as you embrace her
&gt;Both of you slump down together, laying on your sides on the bed
&gt;&quot;That was amazing Prof, Jani can&#039;t wait to do it more&quot; she whispers with a small smile
&gt;You nod
&gt;&quot;Wanna keep going?&quot; you ask already knowing the answer
&gt;Jani bites her lip again and nods
&gt;&quot;Jani wants to make sure you give her a Cub&quot;
&gt;You smile at that and hug her
&gt;Your Cock is happy, you back is not
&gt;But that was a problem for a different day


Epilogue

&gt;It’s been 6 months since you brought Jani back home with you
&gt;And in that time you were officially married
&gt;Jasmine came to the wedding, and brought the Chickenman (you learned that later that it wasn’t gooseman like you thought&quot;)
&gt;While you never did get her to wear any clothes she settled in nicely
&gt;You were happy you brought her back home but you learned something terrible
&gt;Because she was a hybrid, she had a very very low chance of carrying your child
&gt;But you were still going to keep trying, why wouldn’t you?
&gt;Jani deserved to be a mother, and you wanted to be a father with her 
&gt;Right now, she was sitting next to you on a plane to China
&gt;You had heard of a temple deep in the mountains and were going to find it
&gt;Even though you were now a millionaire you continued your work, finding artifacts 
&gt;&quot;Prof! Profff! Look look look!&quot; Jani cries as she points out the window of your private jet
&gt;She bounces happily in her chair, still only wearing her usual oversized t-shirt
&gt;The mainland of china is in View out the window
&gt;You promised to show her the world and you intended to keep that promise
&gt;She slides into your lap and nuzzles against you, wearing a big smile
&gt;&quot;Jani loves you Prof! We get to explore the world together and see everything!&quot; she says as her tail wraps around you
&gt;You smile and give her a small kiss
&gt;&quot;We are going to see the world together&quot; you say, pulling your Smol Kitty into a big hug
&gt;Her purring starts and you feel happiness fill you ash the plane starts its descent
&gt;The tribe might have been mean to her 
&gt;But you were going to make sure the rest of the world showed her the love she deserved
&gt;And you were going to give her ALL the love you could
