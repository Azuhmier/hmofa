&gt;You weren&#039;t sure why the mood took you, but you had to get out of this stupid town
&gt;You had to get out of this stupid country
&gt;A few months later you&#039;re getting off at Heathrow, having hopped the pond
&gt;You&#039;ve been accepted into a British university to do some shit that took your fancy when you were applying
&gt;More importantly, you&#039;re 4000 miles away from your hometown
&gt;Time for 3-4 years of hard drinking with a different set of weirdos
&gt;Check in at uni, you get a key to a small room in a shitty dorm
&gt;No roommates, but some people in your corridor
&gt;You&#039;re too tired to socialise so you just go to sleep and figure you&#039;ll do something tomorrow
&gt;The morning
&gt;Get talking to your housemates
&gt;Apparently these Brits have something called a &quot;society&quot;
&gt;Which is like an after-school club
&gt;They&#039;re all really excited to go to &quot;freshman&#039;s fair&quot; to see what &quot;societies&quot; there are
&gt;Whatever, you&#039;ll tag along just out of boredom
&gt;Bigass tent in the parking lot
&gt;Fuckton of people, you lose your housemates quickly
&gt;The societies are out on desks, talking to passers-by and taking down emails for mailing lists
&gt;There&#039;s a bunch of sports societies, some cringy anime society, political shit, nothing that interests you
&gt;Quite a few anthros, though
&gt;There weren&#039;t that many back in Bumfuck, Kansas
&gt;Diversity in action
&gt;Suddenly…
&quot;Hey dude!&quot;
&gt;Right into your ear.
&quot;Ahh! Who the…?&quot;
&gt;Turning round, you see an anthro
&gt;A goat girl
&gt;She&#039;s probably about your age, rake thin, little stubby horns, soft white fur all over, and a &quot;goatee&quot; of downier stuff
&gt;She&#039;s wearing a loose cloth dress and is bare footed
&quot;Hey. Too many people here, right?&quot;
&gt;No shit
&quot;Uhh, yeah.&quot;
&gt;She smiles knowingly
&quot;I&#039;m Sugandha. You looking for a society a bit more relaxed than, ah…&quot;
&gt;She points her head and you can see the anime society
&gt;They&#039;re doing some cringy shit
&gt;You laugh nervously
&quot;I guess so, heh. My name&#039;s Anon, by the way.&quot;
&gt;She gestures to a table not so far away
&quot;I&#039;m the treasurer of the Psychonaut society. Would that be something that would interest you?&quot;
&gt;Her accent is pretty, soft and struggling a little with the Rs
&gt;Wait, psychonauts?
&gt;That sounds weird
&gt;But, kinda interesting
&quot;Uh, yeah, sure.&quot;
&gt;She beams at you
&quot;Great! Do you know your university email address? Write it down here please… We actually have a meeting tonight, do you have a map of the campus?&quot;
&gt;You head back to your dorm with a map of the campus, the name of a lecture hall, and the building it&#039;s in circled in pen
&gt;Pop into the campus shop on the way back
&gt;The drinking age is only 18 here, score!
&gt;You go home with a few packs of instant noodles and a six pack of beer
&gt;Just do whatever until the evening, get your stuff unpacked and have a little to drink before leaving
&gt;You seem to be one of the last to arrive
&gt;Sugandha is there, sitting on the ground at the front of the lecture hall
&gt;There are a few other freaks there; mostly anthros, but a couple of humans too
&gt;Dreads and sandals at six o&#039;clock
&gt;One of Sugandha&#039;s ears twitches at the sound of you opening the door, and she turns round
&gt;She recognizes you and flashes you a grin
&quot;Anon! Glad you could make it!&quot;
&gt;How many randoms did she try to press into this little club and how did she remember you
&quot;Oh, hey. You remembered me?&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s smiling wistfully
&quot;Of course. I noticed something in you when you came by the table. You have an interesting aura.&quot;
&gt;Aura what-now?
&quot;We were just about to have a beginner&#039;s meditation session. Have you ever chanted mantras before?&quot;
&gt;Meditation? Mantras? Where is this going?
&quot;Uhh, not really…&quot;
&gt;Best not to bring up that you were raised a Christian
&quot;That&#039;s fine! We&#039;re all beginners at some point.&quot;
&gt;She lays a hand on your shoulder
&quot;I can tell you&#039;re not too sure about this, and that&#039;s okay. We&#039;re going to have a relaxed pace today. You know there&#039;s scientific evidence that meditation is good for you?&quot;
&gt;That&#039;s plausible, you read an article about it once
&quot;How about you just take a cushion and sit with the others? It will be quite laid-back, I promise.&quot;
&gt;Well, why not. You can always just leave when the freaks start seeing Vishnu or whatever.
&gt;Sit on a cushion next to some laid-back looking vegetable of a person
&gt;Some kinda chill music starts playing, guys at the front close their eyes
&gt;You humour them and close your own eyes, and get into the groove of the music
&gt;Hmm, this isn&#039;t so bad
&gt;They&#039;re softly chanting something, but you can&#039;t quite make it out
&gt;Decide to just relax and enjoy sitting listening to the chill music
&gt;Before you know it, you&#039;re being told to open your eyes
&gt;You head to the front, feeling energized
&gt;Sugandha is getting to her feet, and smiles as she sees you coming
&quot;Hey Anon! You made it through the whole session?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, I guess I did.&quot;
&quot;Not bad! Did you see anything?&quot;
&quot;Not really. I just enjoyed the music and stuff. It was relaxing.&quot;
&gt;She smiles
&quot;Hey, I&#039;m glad you enjoyed it. I&#039;m going to go and get something to eat now, do you want to come with me?&quot;
&gt;You&#039;ve got nothing better to do
&quot;Sure, why not?&quot;
&gt;Wow she has a nice smile
&quot;That&#039;s great! Let&#039;s head out. I&#039;m sure the others will catch up in a bit.&quot;
&gt;Turns out the others don&#039;t turn up
&gt;You and Sugandha end up being alone eating tacos together and shooting the shit
&gt;She&#039;s as weird as you thought she was, but fun to talk to
&gt;She laughs at your jokes and gets you to come out of your shell
&gt;She&#039;s pretty funny herself
&gt;You end up discussing all sorts of things, from her religion to what brought you out here
&gt;She ends up giving you her number and you head home feeling pretty good about the whole affair
&gt;Sleep as soon as your head hits the pillow

2.
&gt;Your phone rings, waking you up
&gt;It&#039;s a text
&gt;It&#039;s from Sugandha
&quot;Namaste Anon! You know where the Einstein building is? My room is in there, wanna come check it out? I made curry!&quot;
&gt;Might be cool
&gt;You won&#039;t get any food except instant noodles if you stay home
&quot;Sure. I&#039;ll be right over.&quot;
&gt;It&#039;s easy to find on the map and not too hard to find outside
&gt;Sugandha is standing outside waiting for you
&gt;She&#039;s wearing a colourful dress, and a string of prayer beads around her neck
&quot;Hey,&quot; you say by way of greeting
&gt;She notices you and smiles widely
&gt;God she has a nice smile
&quot;Hi there! Glad you could make it.&quot;
&gt;She takes your hand and leads you inside
&gt;This dorm is a lot nicer than yours
&gt;She opens her door
&gt;Her room is a lot bigger than yours
&gt;It looks… well, as you expected it to
&gt;Big poster of some blue-skinned four-armed fellow on the wall
&gt;A bong, a big food pot, a rice cooker, and a teapot are on her desk
&gt;The teapot is steaming slightly, with two cute mosaic-patterned mugs
&gt;Her clothes are in a bit of disarray all over the ground
&quot;Sorry about the mess, I&#039;ve been meaning to clear up…&quot;
&quot;Hey, it&#039;s not like my place is much better.&quot;
&gt;She giggles
&quot;Let&#039;s not worry too much about that, then. I&#039;ve made enough curry for the both of us, but it&#039;s vegetarian I&#039;m afraid…&quot;
&gt;Hey, you&#039;re an open-minded fellow, you&#039;ll give it a try
&quot;Sounds good! I&#039;ve not eaten anything yet today.&quot;
&gt;She raises an eyebrow as she works at spooning some
&quot;Not even breakfast? Are you fasting for something?&quot;
&gt;Your turn to chuckle softly
&quot;Naw, I only just got up.&quot;
&gt;She smiles softly at you as she gives you a bowl
&gt;Tasty looking yellowish rice with a healthy dollop of curry on top
&gt;It looks really good
&gt;Smells great too
&gt;You realise how hungry you are
&gt;But, you&#039;re a gentleman, so you wait for her to serve hers up too
&gt;You both sit on the ground together, cross legged, and dig in
&gt;She&#039;s not really that dainty when she eats
&gt;Much like you she just shovels it in by the forkful
&gt;You both finish before too long
&gt;That was really good
&quot;Thanks so much Sugandha, that was great!&quot;
&quot;Hehe, thank you Anon!&quot;
&gt;She pours out two mugs of tea and gives one to you
&quot;So, I know you don&#039;t know me very well but I have a bit of a favour to ask you. Not too big of one, but a favour all the same…&quot;
&gt;You sip your tea and nod
&gt;Mmm, spiced chai
&quot;I just bought some new stuff from my dealer to try out, and I was hoping you could be my trip sitter? None of my friends are around right now, and all the psychonauts are terrible flakes.&quot;
&gt;Oh man
&gt;Fucking hippies
&quot;What would that involve?&quot; you ask cautiously.
&quot;Oh, nothing much. You just have to sit in with me and make sure I don&#039;t hurt myself while I&#039;m tripping. We can watch a movie or order some food if you like. The dealer told me the trip should only last a few hours.&quot;
&gt;You mull it over
&gt;Spending time with this cutie is fun
&gt;But you&#039;re not really a drug guy
&gt;Meh, you don&#039;t have to take any yourself, just look after her
&gt;Maybe she&#039;ll do something funny or cute under the influence
&gt;With that you&#039;ve made up your mind
&quot;Yeah, sure, I can do that.&quot;
&gt;She smiles and claps her hands gleefully, that was pretty cute
&quot;Thank you, Anon! Let&#039;s get started right away…&quot;
&gt;She opens one of her desk draws and pulls out a little ziplock bag
&gt;Inside there are three or four pink pills, about the size of dimes
&gt;She opens the bag and fishes one out
&quot;Wish me luck!&quot;
&gt;And she pops it
&gt;She&#039;s looking normal
&quot;No effect?&quot;
&gt;She giggles
&quot;They usually take a while to kick in, silly! Let&#039;s put a film on while we&#039;re waiting…&quot;
&gt;She peruses another drawer for a second and pulls out a DVD case
&gt;DVDs in CURRENTYEAR
&gt;She pops the DVD into her computer and sets the movie running, it&#039;s a Hong Kong action movie
&gt;You both sit on the bed together and get watching
&gt;Not long after the second act break, she starts making a weird noise
&gt;Halfway between bleating and… moaning?!
&gt;She leans on your shoulder and moans softly
&quot;Uhn… fucking dealer… Those weren&#039;t psychedelics…&quot;
&gt;That&#039;s the first time you&#039;ve heard her swear
&gt;Moreover, she&#039;s getting a little grabby
&gt;She&#039;s now gripping your arm, squeezing herself close
&gt;You turn away from the movie to look at her
&gt;She has big wet patches in her dress
&gt;Right over her nipples
&quot;Uhhh, Sugandha, are you okay?&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s giving you bedroom eyes
&gt;Without warning, she pushes you down by your shoulders, pinning you on the bed
&gt;She licks her lips
&quot;Mmm, I need a little pressure release. You&#039;ll do nicely.&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s straddling you, and weighs enough that struggling to get off won&#039;t do any good
&gt;She pushes the straps of her dress aside and pulls the front of her dress down, revealing decent sized tits for such a skinny girl
&gt;Her nipples are pointing out, erect, and a steady stream of milk is coming out
&gt;She guides your hands up to her chest and places them on her tits
&quot;Give them a good squeeze, and I might let you drink some.&quot;
&gt;That&#039;s about as fucked up as it is really hot
&gt;You don&#039;t need telling twice, as you squeeze her breasts gently
&gt;The fur on her breasts is so soft and downy
&gt;The squishy feeling of her boobs combined with the fluffiness of her fur feels heavenly
&gt;There&#039;s milk spraying everywhere, and she&#039;s bleating and moaning softly
&gt;You can feel a stirring in your pants at the lewd sight, sound, and feeling, and let out a moan of your own
&gt;Sugandha smiles widely
&quot;Mmmm, good boy.&quot;
&gt;Seeing you&#039;re not going to go anywhere, she shuffles back to sit in your lap, grinding up against you, and lets you sit up
&gt;You rest up against her, snuggling into her fur, wrapping your arms around her, guiding her rhythmic humping
&gt;She squeezes you up against her, and nibbles your neck
&quot;Sugandha, Sugandha!&quot; You can&#039;t help but say her name. She giggles again.
&quot;You&#039;re so cute, I knew it from the moment I saw you!&quot;
&gt;She gently untangles herself from your arms, shuffles round, and cradles your head in one arm
&quot;Now, your reward~!&quot;
&gt;Her nipples are right in your face, and you open your mouth and suckle on one of them
&gt;Her milk is sweet and smooth tasting
&gt;You can&#039;t help but let out a few soft moans
&gt;She&#039;s beaming at you giggling softly
&quot;Good boy, good boy!&quot;
&gt;You feel a fluffy paw caressing your tummy and pushing under your belt
&gt;Her hand is on your cock, giving it a light squeeze before pulling it out of your pants
&quot;How lovely, hehe&quot;
&gt;She starts stroking you off
&gt;She seems a bit inexperienced, but it feels pretty good
&gt;The sensation of being held in her arms, having a face full of breasts, and a mouthful of milk is way too pleasant
&gt;Before long you&#039;re squirming up against her, sucking and biting her nipple, muffled moans let out every few strokes
&gt;She too is moaning, pausing it only to say &quot;good boy&quot; a few times
&gt;It&#039;s really too much to handle, and you finish before long, squirting all over your chest (When did your top come off!?) and her arm
&gt;You both collapse on the bed, snuggling up to each other, and the next thing you know, you&#039;re asleep, feeling safe, comfortable, and warm in her downy belly fur</textarea>
