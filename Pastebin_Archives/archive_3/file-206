            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">[Tags: Human(M) x Anthro(F, Rat), playful femdom, light restraint play, edge play, oral (Fellatio, Cunnilingus), vaginal, cream pie]</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The amber glow of street lights muddied the red brick color of Pryston’s lone bus terminal, while lending a small amount of illumination to the dirt lot and road in front of it. The sun would still be hidden for at least another two hours, and past the lights of the terminal, the night ate away any visibility in the distance beyond vague shapes. A haunting, if scenic, moment. The only disruption to this was the shuffling of a single person who couldn’t decide if he wanted to sit on the lonely bench in front of the building or lean against the wall. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A young man with a brush of peach fuzz on his face alternated between looking at his watch, counting his money, and staring anxiously down the dark road. Human, something that could be identified by how he shivered and shook in the chill air of the early morning. He had gone out of his way to get a ticket for a ride at this time. The only people that would be up at this hour would be gas station clerks changing shifts, and none of them would be visiting the edge of town. That and he figured he could sleep on the bus, making the ride at least seem shorter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He had been alternating between counting his money, looking at his watch, and anxiously staring down the road, nervously awaiting the bus that would take him away from Pryston. It wasn’t much, but it was what he had saved up since he made up his mind to leave. Maybe enough to get him a couple weeks in a motel somewhere, or at least buy a sleeping bag and hot food when he got to wherever he was headed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">His name was Jacob Hevil and he hated this town. Well, hate might be too strong of a word to throw around; more accurately, he dreaded the idea of getting stuck here for the rest of his life. He was born here, and if he didn’t take this leap, he would die here. The only thing he had to look forward to was working at Hevil’s Hardware and Lawn with his dad before the old man finally kicked the bucket and he inherited the place. If living here meant every day being more of the same, then he wouldn’t be able to take it. He was more likely to go mad before he would make it to old age.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The crack and stutter of a small engine from down the road had pulled him from his worries, and as the sound got closer, he squinted and looked for the source. He knew what it was before the single headlight stopped obscuring his vision. In this small Texas town, there was only a handful of motorcycles around. Only one made this particular kind of racket, and he would know that sound anywhere. After all, it was his bike.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Bought right off of the front yard of one of the local tinkers, it served as his go to method of getting to point A to point B. Well, the bike didn’t belong solely to him. He co-owned it with the other person who had went halfsies on the bike with him and put up the other twenty five dollars the distracted grease head was asking for. The only other person with a set of keys to the aging Japanese noise maker, who’s house he had left the bike leaned up against before he walked to the bus terminal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alita Keller. Eighteen years old, youngest child of seven, and on the endangered species list as one of Pryston’s four metal heads. Not that her actual species was in any danger; rats had a way of keeping their numbers high, after all. Among her other qualities was that of being Jacob’s best friend since childhood. Not a single square foot of this quiet town had escaped their reign of terror since they first met in the third grade.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The open faced helmet she was wearing did nothing to hide that touch of wry amusement that crossed her muzzle whenever she had guessed right on something. “Thought that was you I spotted buyin’ a ticket couple days ago.” The splotches of brown on her fur looked almost golden in the artificial light, but the white coat underneath almost glowed. “You leavin’ the bike at my place in the middle of the of night just confirms things, doesn’t it?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Some would call it a stereotype, but Alita certainly didn’t act her size. A foot shorter than Jacob, she could keep up with him in just about anything, or at least try to. Thankfully, she didn’t have the bad attitude that most would associate with a short person being angry at a tall world. She took it as a challenge instead, laughing at anything both even remotely amusing or irritating. She was always in good mood for the most part, which was a decent fit for the sometimes easily troubled human that tended to be caught up in her craziness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He didn’t have anything to say in his defense. It was supposed to be a getaway in the dead of night, and he would do his explaining to the people who mattered over the phone later. Instead he offered a weak shrug as she killed the motor of the bike and stepped off of it. “Yeah, I can’t take it anymore, waiting for the ‘right moment’ to leave. So…I’m just leavin’, and that’ll be that.” Now he felt like an asshole. Alita would no doubt forgive him the easiest out of everyone. Or, on the other hand, hate him the most.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She just smiled as she dug through the back pocket of her jeans, fishing for something as she walked up. “Oh please, J. You weren’t the kind for big ol’ goodbyes anyways.” Whatever it was, she kept it clenched in her hands as she approached him. “Just wish you could’a told me ahead of time. I saw the bike leanin’ up against a post through my window when I got up to take a leak. Had me haulin’ ass across town just to see you off.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">They both stood there awkwardly, as teenagers tended to do when they have something to say but can’t find the will to say it. Jacob turned away, using the unspoken excuse of looking out for the coming bus. Alita just played with the dirt using her foot while wringing the end of her tail with her free hand, anxious to find something to continue the conversation.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It wasn’t like they didn’t have plenty to talk about. Since their playground days they had been inseparable. Every stupid decision one of them had made, the other was right next to them to witness it. More than once they were the other’s stupid mistake. If Jacob’s mom knew his first kiss was an anthro, she would never leave the church again. If his dad found out that not only he had sex before marriage, but it had been in the bed of the family work truck with an anthro, he would have been disowned at gun point.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It wasn’t as if there was some law that separated anthros and humans. Not anymore, at least. There was just this unspoken line that wasn’t crossed in small town, USA. Him and Alita could raise seven kinds of hell across the county, and people would only get mad at the property damage and noise they were making. Yet when she had stolen a kiss from his cheek on his seventeenth birthday, they had been politely asked to leave the burger joint they had been hanging out in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">They were, for as long as they actually cared about the opposite sex and all the fun sexual maturity provided, each other’s rebound fling and lazy afternoon distraction. He had been there for every ex-boyfriend, and she was there to remind him he could find someone better. The only real surprise was that when they had actually tried to be a thing together, it fell apart within the month. Nothing had changed, yet neither of them could shake the weird pretense making it official put on their relationship. As if they were expected to act differently, even if they had long been closer than some married couples they knew.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So, in mutual agreement, they had spent the last year of high school and months following graduation ‘best friends with some great benefits,’ as she had put it. It felt like a working compromise, but now that he was about to leave Pryston for what seemed to look like for good, it just complicated things. They weren’t officially a couple, so there shouldn’t be anything in the way beyond a simple ‘good luck’ and wish-you-luck, yet…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alita broke first, stomping and grumbling in exasperation before closing the distance and resting against Jacob’s chest. Whatever was balled up in her hands was shoved into his, and she curled his fingers around it. “We both fucking suck at goodbyes, so….look, you go out there and put Pryston on the map for the rest of us, okay? Or do whatever you think is out there for you. Because…” She paused, looking to the side for a moment to find the words she wanted before looking back at him and furrowing her brow, “Because if you come back, I’ll give you a reason to never leave again. You got that?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Jacob uncurled his fist, revealing a bundle of dollar bills with black and blue rubber bands tightly wound around the rolled up wad of cash. He blinked in surprise, “Alita, this is- I can’t take this!” The rubber bands had one simple significance; this was their stupid decisions money. The same savings that had afforded them their shared motorcycle and any other investment heavier than a couple burgers and a some of fries to share. The cash pile they both put into since they had part time jobs. It didn’t belong to him, at least not completely. Yet the heft of the amount in his hands told him that every dollar was there, both his and hers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">When he pushed the money back at her, she brushed past his outstretched arm and wrapped herself around his shoulders. “If you don’t shut up, I can’t give you one for the road.” With that, she pulled herself up to his face, and her lips found his. And they stayed there, Jacob reaching down to support her and pull her up to him as her tail wrapped around their legs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The sound of air brakes wheezing from down the road pulled them apart, and her bright eyes stared into his. “You make go on and make it big, J. You hear me?” His answer was a weak grin and a reluctance to let her go as she pulled away from him. By now the bus was turning the curve and its headlights began lighting up the terminal, exposing the pair as Alita stepped backwards to make some distance from the human.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“So,” he called out as she strapped her helmet back on and threw her leg over the bike, “How are you going to make me stay if I ever come back?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She froze for a moment, and then the bike started up with a twist of her hand. “I dunno yet! Give me a couple years, alright?” She shouted over the rumble of the engine. They shared a laugh, and waved good bye to each other before she kicked off. The last thing he saw of her was her tail dancing in the air behind her as she drove off into the night.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">When Jacob finally stepped off the bus in California, he immediately set off to earn back every dollar of Alita had given him. It took three years for him break into the music industry. Then it was six months for the record label he had signed onto to recognize that while he was decent with a guitar, the young man’s talents only truly shone when making things sound better than they had any right to be. Another six before he was trusted to work as an audio engineer and assistant producer for one of the label’s big stars, which turned out to be the rocket to success he was after all along.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The released single was a chart topper, and the artist let people know that Jacob was a key part of it. Not by telling his boss on the way out, or even mentioning him to fellow artists. No, that gator name dropped him in an interview on national television. He could still hear the singer’s almost certainly intoxicated drawl in his head as he said the line that made his career. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“No, for real though, the real secret ingredient was this Jacob Hevil kid. Ol’ Randy would step out of the booth and let him take over for a bit. At first I was worried, like, ‘who the hell is this guy?’ But I swear, you could bang pots together in front of the microphone and he could make it sound like opera. That kid worked magic at the mixing table, for sure. I’m pretty sure Randy was there just to make sure that guy didn’t make us sound like a completely different group of people.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It was a change so fast Jacob hardly had time to process it. He went from a no name audio engineer to B-list music celebrity within a couple days. Eventually the constant calls for interviews died down as he stopped being on top of the music scene’s news reel, but the prestige hardly corroded. Artists would come into the studio, and ask for him by name rather than any of the old timers who were working there long before him. Apparently he had come off as some sort of magic bullet for success.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The following two years were a haze of work and royalty checks with a frankly scary amount of zeroes on them as he made a name for himself. It was honestly a bit much for a kid who had took a midnight bus out of Pryston, Texas. Thankfully, he had a method he could rely upon to keep him steady and straight shooting. Ever since he first got his hand on the methods to, he was calling home at least once a week.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He wasn’t calling his family. At least not more than two or three times, anyways. It took his mother two years to finally forgive him for leaving so suddenly. On the other hand, his father still never got over the fact that they had to learn where he was going by Alita telling them the next day. Sure, the rat was basically a daughter they never had, but his old man felt betrayed and let down by his son running across the country to escape their family business.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Instead he was in Alita’s ear every Saturday night. Sometimes it was just small talk. What was happening back home, like which one of her knucklehead siblings was being arrested this month, or the kind of trouble she had been up to without her usual partner in crime. In exchange, he told her tales from the golden state. Musicians he had run into, how people acted differently here, the difference in prices between the two states for just about everything, and the drought he was experiencing in the search of a decent barbecue that wasn’t made by some brainless city kid reading from a recipe book.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A common topic in their conversations was Jacob paying her back for her part of the savings he had left with. Alita refused at first, telling him to do his best way out there with everything he had. She only became more stubborn once he actually became successful. Despite his insistence, she would never take his money. So they settled on a middle ground if only so he would stop bringing it up at least twice every time he called.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He couldn’t just send her cash, but she would allow him to help pay for things she had her eye on. At first, he was buying her parts to maintain the motorcycle, now reaching almost twenty years old. Then he bought her a more modern phone than the track phone she had been using since freshman year in high school. It took her a couple months for her to let it slide that he was paying for the bill entirely. The fact that they could do video chats helped ease her anger. The higher quality pictures being swapped between the both of them also was a factor, proving that there was still a some life to their fire despite the distance. Alita found it more than slightly amusing to send the human risque pictures of her cream and caramel colored body whenever she knew he was in a meeting.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Any further gifts became impossible as Alita’s family continued to grow with nieces and nephews, and she was running out of room for herself in the Keller home. The last straw came when one of her oldest nephew stole the key to their beloved motorcycle and proceeded to paint the road with part of his hide. He survived but the bike did not, much to her anger and disappointment. With no ride and a rising urge to maim her kin, she finally broke down and accepted his idea to have an envelope full of cash delivered to her personal P.O. box. Enough for a decent car, and a couple weeks at a motel while she decided on which apartment or trailer she would be enjoying some new found solitude in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The frustrated rat was only four days into her house searching when she received an uncharacteristic phone call from Jacob. Time zones always made long distance relationships funky, so she had become accustomed to how he would generally be calling late in the evening for her as he left the studio and was heading home. Instead, her phone was ringing at noon, and it was a Wednesday. Definitely not his usual weekend check in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He leaned against his car as he waited for her to pick up the phone. Not his own car. No, that had been given away long before he made this call. The keys to his studio apartment had been given back to the land lord, and he did his best to give away the things he could settle to part with to friends and coworkers. The rest of his belongings were in a shipping container, riding on a train car all the way back to south east Texas, where it would be delivered to a storage yard and kept there until he had a place to put everything.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">By now, he had enough clout and fame to operate from home, wherever he decided home would be. Where it wouldn’t be was California. As much as he appreciated the place, he only saw himself ever returning for business. At the moment however, he had withdrawn from the music industry. The only business he was interested in discussing was with the local real estate agency to find him a house big enough that a in-home recording studio could fit in. Well, that, and be durable enough to endure having a certain rodent with an indomitable attitude living within its four walls. Before any of that though, he had to at least let her know he was back. Then he could tell her that she wouldn’t have to bother paying rent again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Right now he was using a rental car as his resting spot, parked and now starting to bake in the humid heat. Eventually her ring tone stopped and what sounded like the rustling of clothing replaced it. There was a drawn out yawn before she finally said something. “Hrmmyaaah~ what do you want, J? Got some good news for little ol’ moi?” Definitely sleeping in instead of diligently continuing her quest to find some place to live. That meant a slight change of plans, and he left the car where it was to start climbing up a flight of stairs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Depends,” he replied with a shrug that no one witnessed, “Are you decent?” Not many people actually used the motels here in Pryston. The average customer was usually visiting family members from out of town, and that was only if they were the kind of people too stuffy to crash on an air bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">There was a hum as she thought for a second, and he heard her roll over in bed before answering, “By whose standards? Church decent? Because you know I’m never that kind of decent.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He stopped walking before he got too close. Didn’t want to spoil the surprise after all. “Mm, maybe not so strict. Wal-mart decent?” Jacob leaned up against a wall, eyeballing the room she said she was staying in at the moment. She had gotten irritated with him when he had made her repeat which motel and what number her room was several times, but he had been searching for something to write with at the air port when he had called. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The sound of scratching nails and ruffled hair filled the call for a few seconds, “Give me a second to put on some panties and swimming trunks and I’ll be good. Why, what’s up? Oh my god, is this your attempt at phone sex?” He heard her giggle, a snort of amusement even escaping before she contained herself. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Without warning Jacob hung up, and he started moving again. As he got closer to his destination, he heard a muffled ‘it was just a joke, fucker’ from the other side of the door. Smirking to himself, he started knocking on the door to the motel room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I’M UP, I’M UP. Give me a second.” He could hear a shuffle of movement from inside the room, most likely clothes being tugged out of a poorly packed suit case.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The man hardly waited before speaking up. “I thought you were almost Wal-mart decent?” With just that, the motel room went silent. After a few moments he heard the locks on the door shift and it cracked open to reveal a brown and white rat peering through the crack.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“C’mere.” Alita growled as the door was opened just enough for her to grab him by the collar and throw him into the motel room. By the time he had spun around she was locking the door again before turning to face him. She hadn’t been lying about her lack of decency; the only thing she had on was a years old Sabaton t-shirt. It was definitely meant for a once smaller rat, as it was tugging to keep her chest in and if she lifted her arms at all her belly button would be exposed. The rest of her was bare as the day she was born.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He didn’t get time to explain himself before she lunged at him, tackling him right at chest level and using her momentum to knock him onto the bed. The pads of her fingers and palms caressed and held his face as she forced her lips against his. Jacob was still trying to process things, but he could see in his peripheral that her whip tail was threatening to knock over the bedside lamp and phone with how wildly it was thrashing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">For someone who was only a fraction of his weight, she was doing a fine job keeping him pinned, legs slipping underneath his to wrap herself around his body. Thin and deft, her tongue wouldn’t have been able to do much by itself if he hadn’t opened his lips to let it in. Once he did, it was apparent that she would only give up the privilege of accessing his tongue under threat of violence. She threw herself into the kiss, huffing out of her nose as she hungrily made up for years of lost time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">When she finally relented, they both gasped for air. She dragged her paws down from his face to push herself up off his chest. Nails grabbed into his shirt as she quickly began grinding against his crotch, staining it with the fluids of her arousal as she found the bulge of his excited cock and attacked it almost mindlessly. “Mmnf, bastard. Couldn’t warn a lady?” She groaned.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Jacob grinned as she closed her eyes and rocked against him, humping at the tent in his pants. “I thought you would enjoy this more if I surprised you.” She grinned right back as she savored the heat between her legs before slowing down and nuzzling at his nose.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yeah, but I wanted to do something the day you came back. Now we gotta wait for your ‘Welcome Back’ gift to be ready. Except that means we don’t get to knock boots until we can’t walk for another half hour.” She panted before thinking. A finger scratched at her chin before she grew a grin that put a spot of panic in Jacob’s heart. “Actually…get out of those pants anyways, J. I need to see if I remembered to put a few things in in my bag before I left my mom’s.” Alita mumbled before she hopped off of him and off the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She pointed two fingers at her eyes and then pointed them back at Jacob before almost skipping over to the corner of the motel room. He caught himself staring as she bent over while tossing things out of her suitcase to each side, her swollen lips almost drooling. The rat was definitely easy to get wound up, but she must have something really special planned if she had enough willpower to pull herself off of him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Almost as if she could feel his gaze, she turned back around to look at him on the bed. “I don’t hear a zipper droppin’, J.” She tsked, and didn’t look away until he started shuffling to undress. Her ears and tail all twitched in approval when she heard the sound of his zipper going down, and she turned back to her search.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He hurriedly kicked off his pants, falling back onto the mattress with a sigh of relief as his cock sprung free. Even if he hadn’t told her he was coming back to Pryston, it was something he had been planning; it just was rushed ahead of schedule by her sudden homelessness. Regardless, part of that planning was ingesting any form of pineapple or pineapple juice he could tolerate. Another part was purposefully neglecting himself for the last few weeks, betting on his weakened endurance lasting long enough for the both of them to have a good time before celebrating their union with the first of many messy finales.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Because of these preparations, his dick was primed and ready to go from the moment she had wrapped herself around him for their first kiss in years. Her short but aggressive foreplay had only made it more difficult for him to get his pants off. Part of him didn’t even want to touch himself, afraid he would set himself off. Instead he finished stripping, throwing aside his t-shirt before scooting off the bed to turn the air conditioner a few notches higher.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The moment his ass left the bed he immediately heard a sharp “HEY!” from behind him. Turning around, Alita had her arms crossed and the look on her face was the kind that told him she wasn’t in the mood for any unapproved shenanigans. Fearfully, he pointed at the AC unit silently, causing her to follow his finger before shrugging and nodding, giving him permission while she unfolded her arms and started messing with something metallic sounding in her hands.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Once the air conditioner was blowing cool air in preparation for the afternoon’s activities, Jacob obediently got back into bed. She followed him in, pushing him down with one hand while her other was hidden behind her back. “You’re serious about this, aren’t you?” He muttered in between the rain of affectionate kisses meant to keep him busy as she got into position for whatever she had in mind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Hun, you aren’t even ready for what I’m going to do to you.” She cooed as she reached up with her forward hand, gripping onto his wrist before dragging his arm up to the bars of the headrest. “But that can wait. In a bit, you’ll be too cross eyed to think straight.” He didn’t like the grin on her face, but he had long ago learned to recognize when it was worth the effort to ask what she was up to and when it was better to just brace for impact.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">They shared one more long kiss as she brought his other hand up, and Jacob grinned when it broke. “I’m still reeling from that little rodeo I got just a bit ago. I ain’t sure I’m ready for this.” He hardly had time to brace for what she was about to do. The hand she was keeping behind her back flew up and he felt the clink of handcuffs clamping down on his wrists. Looking up, she had somehow looped the chain around the back of the headrest’s bars before shutting the hoops around his wrist. He gave a reflexive tug before looking back at her. “The hell?!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She looked far, far too pleased than he was comfortable with now that he was cuffed to the bed. Her grin was wide and wicked as she leaned in low to lick at his nose. “Oh, be glad I couldn’t be bothered to buy a ball gag, J. Anyways~” Alita hummed as she started lowering down his body, her back arching while she bit her lip when her leaking snatch met up with his length. Whatever else she had to say was put to the side as she began to grind against him, rocking against the throbbing shaft as she fought back groans.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">There was ‘ready to go,’ and then there was whatever tortuous state Jacob was in as she teased his cock with its long-lost friend. Something she must have been aware of the way she giggled when he immediately began rocking back against her. They shared a few hushed groans before Alita came back to her sense and brought herself face to face with her best friend and lover.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Anyways,” She exhaled, slowing herself and pulling away from the object of her fascination, “I knew you couldn’t stay away forever, so I did a little preparin’; just a little somethin’ special I picked up ” The rat was drawing circles on his chest, finger tracing around his nipples, “It takes awhile for it to kick in. So between now and the real good part,” her hand flowed down his body and gingerly wrapped around his dick, causing him to buck softly before she let go and continued south. His ballsack was cupped into her palm, softly being rolled while she continued, “I’mma get the boys down here nice and ready for the show. They need to do their best today. It might just be the most important thing they ever do, after all.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alita almost slithered off his chest, grinning as she finally sat back up and scooted off the foot of the bed. Once again she started digging through the suitcase, only this time he was too restrained to enjoy the view. It seemed she knew exactly for where to look for what she wanted this time, popping up a few seconds later with a triumphant grin on her face and an orange pill bottle in her hand. “Be riiight back~” She snickered as she stepped into the bathroom. After a couple seconds of what sounded like her struggling, she squeaked happily as a pop came from the small room. The faucet turned on, and he swore he heard her mutter, “Shit, these are bigger than I thought…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Several moments later, the water turned off, and the rat strutted out of the bathroom, pulling off her shirt and tossing it to the side. Now completely naked, she was grinning wide while crawling back over to the bound man, on all fours as she made a beeline for his crotch. “Wait, what were those pills?” He didn’t mean to sound panicked, but it was a bit hard not to struggle when he wasn’t accustomed to being handcuffed and at her mercy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She pulled her gaze away from his dick long enough to turn to him and put a finger to her lips, “Something special~ Don’t worry about it. Just try not to blow up in my face until it’s time for the rodeo to start.” He didn’t like how she giggled after that, but it looked like she was done talking as she draped her arms across his legs and stomach. It looked pretty lazy, but she was more interested in getting to his cock than getting into position.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Humming to herself, she leaned forward, small tongue hanging out before it finally made contact with the side of his shaft. Immediately he tensed and twitched, and he heard her snort in laughter before she began dragging her tongue upwards. When his knee curled up as she lifted off the head of his cock, he saw a grin cross the corner of her face. Not that she said anything, too busy lowering herself back to the base of his cock.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Once there, she began kissing around it, covering it in a ring of affection while a hand wrapped itself around the upper half of his length. She kept the other hand on his legs, keeping them down as she made another lap around his dick. Sprinkling in a few licks at same time, she slowly began to scoot sideways, bringing herself into a proper sixty nine position as she laid on top of his chest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Or, it would be a proper sixty nine position if she wasn’t so short and he could pull himself up. Instead, her soaked slit sat a foot or so in front of his face, the thin, almost nonexistent fur between her thighs becoming slicker every time her legs brushed together. It seemed she was aware of this, readjusting her hands so that one was holding her up while the other slipped between her furred thighs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Just as she brought her lips up against the head of his cock, her fingers slipped between her folds, splaying them out for him to see her need. He wasn’t sure if this was a show or foreplay at this point, really. The thought was made irrelevant as she kissed the tip of his dick, tongue falling out to roll in a slow circle around the head. Her fingers traced around her clit, as if she was trying to keep herself at the same level of pleasure he was experiencing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Eventually she pulled free with a quiet pop, wasting no time to nuzzle at the bottom of his dick only to drag her tongue all the way back to the top. Once she did that, she shifted just slightly to the side to coat a new angle with a layer of spittle. While she busied herself with painting every inch of his dick with her tongue, her free hand continued to massage at his sac, constantly giving it attention while she worked.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">All Jacob had to offer in this was the clinking of handcuff chains against the headrest as he reflexively curled and twitched underneath her care. She didn’t seem to be in a talking mood, so he didn’t say much besides mumbled swears and sharply exhaling whenever she struck gold with her tongue.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Once she was satisfied with how his cock was shining from her tongue polishing, she looked back over her shoulder before shaking her ass at his face, “Still alive back there?” She snickered. Her hand replaced her mouth, squeezing at his girth once or twice between slowly stroking him from top to bottom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He chuckled, shrugging as best he could, “I mean, this isn’t what I expected to be waiting for me when I came home. How much longer are you going to do this?” There was a hint of concern in his voice and on his face, nervously smirking back at her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Before she answered, she looked over to the clock on cable box across from the bed. “The bottle said forty five minutes. And then we can do the good bits. So….maybe another hour and a half in cuffs. That okay with you babe?” He opened his mouth to voice his opinion before she nodded, “Glad to hear it.” There was a touch of panic on his face as she faced forwards again, snickering to herself. They were done when she was done, and not a moment before.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Not that he had much time to worry about that, with the way she effectively attacked his crotch. Her muzzle pushed past his dick to get to his sac, announcing its presence when she exhaled hot air onto them moments before wrapping her lips around one of his orbs as best she could. Her suckling was momentarily distracted by the sight of his toes curling, but her hand was now picking up speed as she began to properly stroke at his cock.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The hissing and groans from behind her were completely ignored as she squeezed and stroked. Eventually she pulled herself from his sac, a pleased hum coming from her throat as planted kisses along his shaft up to the top, causing it to twitch as she released it from her grip. She tried not to feel too proud about how he sucked in air and braced himself once she was perched at his cock head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That breath he was holding immediately came free the moment she began dropping her head back down and letting his cock into her muzzle. Both as a handhold and to keep up the gauntlet of pleasure, she once again started palming at his now polished sac. Air pushed out of her nose as she nuzzled against his crotch, tongue lashing around the sides of his dick before sticking to it and dragging along the length as she bobbed upwards. Jacob muttered something, but it was basically gibberish to the point that even he wasn’t sure what he said, let alone Alita. Paying it no mind, she began dipping her head back and forth in a slow, controlled manner. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As good as it felt to have her showering all this attention to his cock and balls, he was getting a sinking suspicion that this wasn’t about his pleasure. At least, that wasn’t her main goal. Anything that got too much of a reaction out of him was never repeated, her tongue purposely tracing along the edge of the veins on his dick rather than over them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He was glad there was a wiggling piece of rat ass in between him and the television stand. It was starting to feel like this blowjob was lasting an eternity, and not an eternity he would like to be in. Seeing the digital clock refusing to tick over to each next minute would make her measured approach to tending to his cock even more torturous. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It never truly dawned on him before on how attentive she could be. While she was suckling, she was keeping a keen eye out for a few signs. At first she was paying attention to when she began tasting the pre-cum leaking out of his cock, a warm and surprisingly sweet addition to the spit already covering his length. Then she was feeling how he was tensing up under her and within her grasp, keeping measure of every twitch and tug of his body.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It was when he started chanting his usual litany of f-bombs that she revealed just how devious she intended to be. Right as his legs began to tense up and he stopped muttering ‘fuck’ under his breath and began hissing instead, she pulled up and off his dick with an audible pop and a sigh. She almost pushed herself off his crotch, a look of expectation and worry on her face as she eyed his cock to see if she had gone too far. Much to her amusement, even as Jacob bucked upwards, it seemed she had stopped at just the right moment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Underneath her and behind her tail she could hear the man panting, before he groaned, “Oh God, please tell me this isn’t what we’re doing.” His head fell back as his cock ached for just the tiniest amount of attention. Anything to push him over the edge. Alita only pumped her fist in triumph.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yup. Told you I was gonna get your boys all worked up.” She laughed, grinning as she spun around, “But now it’s break time so all that hard work doesn’t go to waste.” Jacob raised an eyebrow in confusion, looking up at his handcuffs and tugging at them. “Oh no, I mean a break for me. Now it’s your turn, cowboy.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He pursed his lips for a moment before sighing and letting his head fall back onto the mattress, “Guess I kind of deserve this.” Taking that as permission, she scooted up his body. One hand pressed to his forehead to keep him down while she straddled his face before unceremoniously dropping her ass down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alita loved a lot about this man. She could probably, and bashfully, make a list about all the things she adored about Jacob. When it came to sex, however, his face was competing with his dick for the top spot. More than once she had heard her friends complain about the awkwardness of getting head from their anthro boyfriends. Meanwhile, Jacob’s flat human face seemed to fit perfectly between her legs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">With no muzzle to worry about angling or harming, she could simply straddle the man’s head and let him go to work. Which was exactly what she was doing as she leaned forward to hold onto the head rest of the bed. He didn’t need instruction, offering no complaints once her cunt was in range.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">While she had long missed how it felt for him to be digging his fingers into her cheeks while he ate her out, she was glad just to have his tongue splitting her pussy open. The years apart hadn’t dulled his skill, starting from the bottom while gliding upwards, causing her to huff as he crossed her entrance and bite her lip as he flicked away at her clit in the end.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She lowered a hand to split her folds and give him better access. He immediately took advantage of this as he returned the favor from earlier and began drawing circles with his tongue. “Gnf-fuuhuck, I lose my bike, and my Romeo shows up to be its replacement. Love you J~” She teased while arching her back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Jacob was too busy lapping away to speak up, and she wasn’t giving him enough room to talk anyways. Furry thighs kept his face locked in place, squirming and squeezing whenever his tongue brushed against anywhere sensitive. Unlike how she was treating him for however long that blow job lasted, he was doing everything he could to make the rat on his face melt into a puddle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It wasn’t something that had gone unnoticed, either. She kept her cunt right against his lips, rolling her body against his eager tongue in anyway she could manage. In between her increasingly ragged groans, she managed to moan out some encouragement-cum-demands. “Get that tongue in there, you naked bastard,” she squeaked, parking her hips in what felt like the best spot for him dig at her opening, “I don’t know if you can but you better damn try!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Try he did, doing his damnedest to fit his tongue into her. Alita, for her part in this effort, abandoned holding her lips apart to instead toy with her clit. One hand was firmly gripping the bars of the headrest to keep her straight while she rode his face hard enough to push him down into the mattress. At that point, the sound of his slurping tongue was lost and drowned out by her moans and squeaking. A quiet lover she was not as she informed the neighboring rooms of just how good of a time she was having.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Eventually she grunted and clenched her teeth before gasping, her body going tense and then shuddering a bolt of pleasure rocked up her spine. As loud as she was moment ago, she was reduced to whining breathlessly as she began to shake. The rat even fell forward a bit, pulling her hand from her clit to catch the bed. All the while, Jacob labored away despite the increased heaviness of the feminine juices against his lips and chin. Every lash of his tongue kept her from catching her breath, eyes clenched tight as he pushed her orgasm along.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Once the waves of pleasure dulled from body trembling electricity to a pleasant buzz, Alita finally found it in her to stop clenching her teeth and pant for air. She let Jacob know she recovered by wiggling her hips and lifting herself up an inch or so, but she was in no hurry to remove herself from her favorite chair. Instead she just enjoyed the tip of his tongue caressing her damp sex while lazily looking over her shoulder to check the clock.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Still a bit of time left before the bottle said the pills would kick in. Her eyes fell to the still hard cock, standing tall and neglected; if she edged him again, they would have to wait again, unless she was happy with him blowing his load early the first time she got on his dick in years. No, that was definitely not an option. And even though he was still was using his tongue like the hard working man he was, no doubt he would eventually get tired of being her chair before it was time for the main course.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">After another minute of savoring his tongue, Alita finally grabbed the head rest with both hands before pulling herself up and off Jacob’s face. Both sighed in unison; her out of exertion, and him out of relief. It wouldn’t be long before she was on top of him again, scooting backwards to lay on his chest. The rat grinned as she looked at his face, “Need a napkin, J? You got somethin’ riiight,” she giggled as she leaned in and licked some of her own juices off of the edge of his lips, “There.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Rolling his eyes, Jacob lifted his head up so her arms could slip underneath as she busied herself with cleaning up the sides of his mouth. “You’re not doin’ it right if you’re not making a mess.” He defended himself as she finished with the last trail of slick fluid that was escaping down his cheek.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Still holding that pie eating contest win over my head, are we?” She snorted before pulling his head up for a deep kiss, not satisfied with the slick ‘crumbs’ of his meal and deciding to see if she could still taste herself on his tongue. It only took a moment to confirm that she could, and Jacob grunted as she tugged him in close and began hungrily wrestling with his tongue.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">At the same time, her long tail was coming to rest and slinking along his lower body. Not exactly the definition of prehensile as some other species of anthros, but plenty of practice had left her with some dexterity with the further end of its length. It was neat for a party trick or two, such as plucking bottles off a table, but there was a reason she had bothered to learn to do handle things with her tail. Even if she might as well be an honorary Hevil to his parents, they were very much insistent on her keeping her hands where she could see them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Which meant that Jacob was no stranger to getting a tail job while under the covers, sometimes even mere feet away from other people. She always had such a proud look on her face as she made him ruin another blanket during a movie night, all the while everyone else had their eyes on the screen. Eventually his dad just assumed rats liked to lick the end of their tails clean if they sat still for too long. Alita never corrected him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A laugh pulled from his throat when he felt her tail wrap around his cock, and she broke the kiss long enough to nuzzle his nose. “Missed this?” She cooed softly once her tail got enough grip to slip along his length, tightening and loosening its hold every so often.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He could only smile, laughing again as she started concentrating on working her tail. “I didn’t realize I did until I felt that thing creepin’ up like old times. Now I’m wonderin’ how I went so long without this.” The grin on his face was genuine, and she rewarded his honesty by tightening around his shaft and giving it a squeeze. It was a good enough answer for her, nuzzling into the side of his face before resting her head on the bed next to his. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her tail continued to lazily drag along his cock as she bit her lip, focusing her effort on not taking things too far. “So…” She mumbled, obviously distracted, “Aren’t you going to ask what the pills are for?” Alita teased, lifting herself up for a second or two to look over her shoulder to check the time, before turning around back to him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Jacob had seen this kind of look on her face before. It was one that said she had a secret that she had no interest in keeping. He knew better than to not play along, so he shrugged as best as he could. “It’s important enough that you’re willing to wait. What’s so special about these pills, Alita?” Part of him regretted asking her, since she immediately began wiggling on top of his chest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Remember back before you got on the bus? I said something like, ‘if you come back, I’ll make you stay forever.’ Or something like that. I was bein’ real dramatic.” She lifted and waved her hand, as if brushing away her past self’s embarrassment. “Well, I found somethin’ that will keep you here for good.” Seeing his face and the mix of curiosity and confusion on it, she began lowering herself down his body, tail unwinding and freeing his dick from its grip.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">For a moment his heart rate raced as she began to lift her hips. Indeed, the last few inches of his cock brushed up against an all-too-familiar slickness, and he even saw Alita bite her lip and tremble as she kept rolling backwards. His length bent back before she lifted herself higher and it sprang forward and upright again. Instead she seated herself on his thighs, his dick contrasting against her stomach. Almost reflexively she traced a finger along the top of it, running from base to tip with a smile on her face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“So…it’s kind of a recent thing, but the moment I saw a generic brand at the drugstore, I went and did some research. Which kind is the best, what works well with rats, that kind of thing.” As she continued to tease and hint, it only made him more confused. Alita of all people never did any kind of research, much more keen on simply winging it, whatever ‘it’ pertained to at any one moment. “So I saved up some money, and special ordered some. Got a litter’s worth of’em too.” For some reason, the smile on her face was starting to fill him with a sense of dread. Wherever this was going, it didn’t look like he was getting a word in edgewise.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She pinned her index finger to the head of his cock, lightly pushing it against her stomach. “High end crossbreeding pills aren’t cheap, especially the fast acting kind. They do somethin’ funky to a girl’s eggs so anyone can put’em to use. The kids come out as whatever the mom is, but they can have their dad’s eyes and stuff.” It was then that her smile grew even sharper, and for the first time since his father almost discovered them knocking boots in the hallway closet, Jacob’s blood run cold. “I’m gonna make you a daddy, J. And my momma always said every other generation of Keller girls has twins for their first. You gonna leave me alone in Pryston again when I’ve got a pair of little ones running around?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">While he was trying to find the words that would make her realize that just maybe he would like some time to think about this, Alita simply looked back at the clock on the cable box. “Alita, come on, you don’t want to, I dunno, do this at least some way more romantic than with me handcuffed to a motel bed?” It’s not like he was seeing any one else, but there was a time and a place for this kind of decision, and this cheap motel in Pryston in the middle of a lazy Wednesday afternoon was definitely neither in his mind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">His pleading effectively ignored as she turned forward again, putting a hand on his stomach for balance as she brought her hips up. The fingers of her other hand lightly wrapped around his girth, dragging it back against the fur of her stomach before it was once again brushing against her pussy. There was no ceremony to what she did; once he was properly lined up with the mushroom head of his prick pushing at her entrance, she dug her nails into his stomach before lowering her hips.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">They both shared a hissed ‘oh god’ the moment she began to spread around his cock. The prep work on both of them made for an easy first few inches, her cunt welcoming him in before it was forced to adjust for the remainder of his dick. Both of them had their eyes closed, yet Jacob’s teeth were clenched while Alita was almost slack jawed from the bliss. She only closed her mouth to hold back the pleasured groan of his shaft finding its way deeper.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">There were warnings all about this pill inducing some sort of breeding frenzy once hips starting rocking, but even before she had bought herself a set she thought it was nonsense. Just inexperienced women who never had a good time before, she thought. Now she was looking right into the face of her hubris; Jacob’s cock might as well have been glowing hot inside of her, and every throb his pulse sent through it sent a jolt through her that was making her toes splay outwards.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She released her guiding grasp on the base of his length, pulling both hands up to his chest before dropping her hips and impaling herself on the last few inches of dick with borderline savage intent. The gasp of pleasure and relief that escaped her lips played foil to the grunt that came from Jacob. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He looked up at her, half tugging at the cuffs that quite firmly held in him place. Despite being unaware of any of the finer details of the pill she had taken, he could see hunger in the half-lidded eyes that were looking back at him. She was going to fuck him until all he had left to offer to any woman for the next few days was a puff of seminal mist. Once again he found himself pulling at his restraints, less worried about becoming a father and more for his health.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As if detecting his panic, she brought a finger to his lips, “Don’t worry beau, I’ll do all the hard work. You just try to think of some good baby names, alright?” She chuckled, before dropping her hands to the blanket on either side of his chest. Despite the increasingly demanding needs between her legs, she had enough consideration to at least not dig her nails into her man. That skin was to be licked and touched, not scratched and scarred.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Alita had planned to take this long and slow once she finally got her hands on Jacob. A sensual build up where they would take their time before they shared the first of many mutual orgasms before they were exhausted and bathing in the afterglow of their long awaited reunion. Then the pills started talking and all she wanted was for him to paint her insides white, with as many coats as he could muster up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Furrowing her brow in concentration, she lifted her hips up while savoring the sensation of her emptiness. Even from his perspective, he could tell she was fighting the urge to just slam herself down onto him once the first few inches left her. Instead, she raised herself higher and higher until his cock threatened to leave her cunt. When she sank herself down, the soft clap of two bodies colliding was overshadowed by a shared moan and the creak of the bed frame.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Once again her mouth was left hanging open as his dick caused her mind to blow a fuse. Pulling herself together, she pulled herself up again, only letting around half of his length leave her before falling down on it again. It took only a few bounces for her to find a rhythm, one that was decidedly rushed and aggressive as she rode him into the mattress. “Nngfffucking you jerk. Can’t believe you- haffuck- made me wait six years for this.” She mumbled in between expletive carrying squeaks. “Mm-god so fucking good. I forgot how it - homygawd yes - hits all the right - nng - spots!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Every swear and moan was accompanied by her picking up the pace. Instead of enjoying his company and making him squirm as she used to back in their teenage years, all she wanted was to get him off. They could make up and do the sappy romance bit later, she was sure of it. Right now, though, she was burning up in a drug-induced heat and needed to be knocked up yesterday. Each throb of his cock excited her, tingling her with body shaking pleasure at the anticipation of the man underneath her finally losing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It certainly didn’t hurt that she still had the muscle memory to get his dick exactly where she wanted it. Lithe hips rolled and swayed with small adjustments, getting the head of his cock to drag against this side of her tunnel on the way up before prodding against a sensitive bundle of nerves on the other side when she brought her hips down again. If it wasn’t for how much effort it took for that kind of control, she would have her tongue lolling out rather then sporting the white knuckle grip that she was tearing into the blanket with.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Jacob on the other hand was trying his best to grin and bear Alita’s crazed rhythm. By now she was slamming her body down hard enough that he could feel himself being pushed down into the mattress, only for it to push him back up when she pulled herself up. He had expected plenty of dirty talk, I-missed-you’s, and other things separated lovers did when they reunited. Instead, she was riding him like a rodent possessed, practically assaulting him with how hard she was dropping back onto him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">When he had started abstaining from masturbating a couple weeks ago, this wasn’t what he had in mind. He didn’t think she would go straight in for the kill, her pussy squeezing at his cock and demanding to be filled with anything potent enough to knock her up. Even if his stamina wasn’t already sapped to begin with, Alita would just have easily burned through it regardless at the rate she was going.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It wasn’t just with her body that she was using to coax him towards his climax; when she wasn’t raving about how good it felt to be fucking him after so long, she was loosing words of encouragement down to her handcuffed beau. “C’mon J, just - ha shit - just gimme it. I’m practical-leee nnoh God - begging for kids. All you gotta-aahn - do is fire away. Lemme have it already~” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">While she fought with her own moans to speak at all, her tail was making sure he couldn’t get away or fight this. It had started wrapping around one of his legs just out of distantly remembered habit, bur once she had started getting up to speed it traced over to the other leg as well, tying itself around his knees. If it was anyone else, he would be terrified. Since it was Alita, he settled for simply being worried before submitting to her demands.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">When his moans started slurring from unintelligible sounds to a chanting chorus of ‘oh fucks,’ Alita knew she had him dead to rights. The already frenzied bounces of her hips became even shorter, hardly an inch of rushed motion as she did everything she could to push him past his limit and right off the cliff beyond it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Even if her face was too scrunched up from effort and focus to show it, she definitely felt a touch of pride with her timing; just as he threw his head back and went tense underneath her, she buried her hips against his one last time, causing the bed to once more creak in distress. She had done a good job working herself up for her second orgasm, but it still felt a ways off, especially since she had only just recently had her first. Still, she had gotten hers already, so it wasn’t too much of a worry.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Except the moment the first shot of cum fired out of Jacob’s dick landed against the inner walls of her pussy, she was hit by a blitz of dopamine and a jolt of mind numbing pleasure. Almost immediately afterwards she choked out a squeak before going silent while her second climax rocked her. If it wasn’t for the fact that she was already gripping onto the sheets for balance, she would have collapsed right onto his chest. Instead, she tense up, shaking as she tried her best to stay upright. Jacob, meanwhile, took charge of the situation, practically throwing his hips upwards to bury himself into her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It was a lurid feedback loop, each of them dragging out the orgasm of the other. Every throbbing pulse that delivered another rope of seed was met with a milking squeeze from her cunt that begged for another, a request that was eagerly obliged. Jacob couldn’t remember the last time he had came this hard. At first he was shooting his load up into her body, but even as it lost force he continued to pump out a heavy amount that pooled and filled her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Eventually he had nothing left, even as he weakly bucked his hips upwards in an attempt to coax the last of his jizz out. There had been some overflow; he could feel a pool of moisture growing underneath him, and from the stickiness he could tell it wasn’t just sweat. Still, he was exhausted despite having only really put in work during the finale. It left him panting from the exertion of being ridden like a uncooperative stud until he gave up the goods, and he was ready for a proper break that didn’t involve a rat sitting on his face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Compared to the exhausted human underneath her, Alita was practically on cloud nine. A lazy smile had grown on her face as she sat up before leaning back some, prompting a groan from the man as his tender cock was forced to shift with her as she got comfortable. One hand was pressed flat behind her, giving her support as she lazily ran a finger through the fur on her stomach, as if stirring the warmth within her. “It’s…never felt that good before.” She hummed, to which Jacob grunted in acknowledgment. “You think these things work with birth control? That was a rush, but I don’t want to end up pregnant every time I feel like cumming that hard again.” The rat sighed, and once more he only grunted in response.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The pair stayed like that for the next few minutes, Jacob too drained to even tug at the handcuffs now. It wasn’t the pleasant, feel good afterglow that either of them had thought they would get after their reunion fuck, but it was satisfying nonetheless. It was only when she pressed her hand to his stomach did he stir, looking up as she began pulling herself off of his dick.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It wasn’t easy, her legs having temporarily been turned to jello and unable to move from the intensity of her climax. It was mostly her arms doing the work, pushing herself off of his chest until her lower half remembered how to function. Still, it was no easy feat, the rat grumbling as inch after inch of cum coated shaft came free of her pussy. “Nnff, I’m always glad it’s so big until I have to pull it out.” Jacob offered no retort before laying his head back down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Once it was free, his slick length leaned over, still half erect as if it wasn’t sure there would be a second round. Alita let it be for the moment, clambering higher onto Jacob’s stomach before spinning around and straddling his chest. She reached back to grab her tail, lifting it up and out of the way while spreading her legs. “Hey J, whatcha think? Done in one? Or should I take you for another ride to make sure it sticks?” Between her legs was a now stuffed rat cunt, slick with a multitude of fluids but the primary color that was dribbling out of her was an off-white that spoke of a job well done.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The human lazily brought his head up to survey his handiwork. By all means and every estimate he could make, the only thing they could be doing better was actually making sure this had been during the right time of her cycle. Because he had definitely jammed her full of enough spunk to get at least three kids out of the rodent. Still, he wasn’t some quitter. In fact, he was her best friend. The only one crazy enough to try and keep up with her since the third grade. A smile crossed his face before he spoke:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I think we should give it another shot, just to be sure. But this time, you wear the cuffs.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">- Post Script Thoughts: https://pastebin.com/TKmAVfyd -</div></li></ol>        </div>

The amber glow of street lights muddied the red brick color of Pryston’s lone bus terminal, while lending a small amount of illumination to the dirt lot and road in front of it. The sun would still be hidden for at least another two hours, and past the lights of the terminal, the night ate away any visibility in the distance beyond vague shapes. A haunting, if scenic, moment. The only disruption to this was the shuffling of a single person who couldn’t decide if he wanted to sit on the lonely bench in front of the building or lean against the wall. 
A young man with a brush of peach fuzz on his face alternated between looking at his watch, counting his money, and staring anxiously down the dark road. Human, something that could be identified by how he shivered and shook in the chill air of the early morning. He had gone out of his way to get a ticket for a ride at this time. The only people that would be up at this hour would be gas station clerks changing shifts, and none of them would be visiting the edge of town. That and he figured he could sleep on the bus, making the ride at least seem shorter.
He had been alternating between counting his money, looking at his watch, and anxiously staring down the road, nervously awaiting the bus that would take him away from Pryston. It wasn’t much, but it was what he had saved up since he made up his mind to leave. Maybe enough to get him a couple weeks in a motel somewhere, or at least buy a sleeping bag and hot food when he got to wherever he was headed.
His name was Jacob Hevil and he hated this town. Well, hate might be too strong of a word to throw around; more accurately, he dreaded the idea of getting stuck here for the rest of his life. He was born here, and if he didn’t take this leap, he would die here. The only thing he had to look forward to was working at Hevil’s Hardware and Lawn with his dad before the old man finally kicked the bucket and he inherited the place. If living here meant every day being more of the same, then he wouldn’t be able to take it. He was more likely to go mad before he would make it to old age.
The crack and stutter of a small engine from down the road had pulled him from his worries, and as the sound got closer, he squinted and looked for the source. He knew what it was before the single headlight stopped obscuring his vision. In this small Texas town, there was only a handful of motorcycles around. Only one made this particular kind of racket, and he would know that sound anywhere. After all, it was his bike.
Bought right off of the front yard of one of the local tinkers, it served as his go to method of getting to point A to point B. Well, the bike didn’t belong solely to him. He co-owned it with the other person who had went halfsies on the bike with him and put up the other twenty five dollars the distracted grease head was asking for. The only other person with a set of keys to the aging Japanese noise maker, who’s house he had left the bike leaned up against before he walked to the bus terminal.
Alita Keller. Eighteen years old, youngest child of seven, and on the endangered species list as one of Pryston’s four metal heads. Not that her actual species was in any danger; rats had a way of keeping their numbers high, after all. Among her other qualities was that of being Jacob’s best friend since childhood. Not a single square foot of this quiet town had escaped their reign of terror since they first met in the third grade.
The open faced helmet she was wearing did nothing to hide that touch of wry amusement that crossed her muzzle whenever she had guessed right on something. “Thought that was you I spotted buyin’ a ticket couple days ago.” The splotches of brown on her fur looked almost golden in the artificial light, but the white coat underneath almost glowed. “You leavin’ the bike at my place in the middle of the of night just confirms things, doesn’t it?”
Some would call it a stereotype, but Alita certainly didn’t act her size. A foot shorter than Jacob, she could keep up with him in just about anything, or at least try to. Thankfully, she didn’t have the bad attitude that most would associate with a short person being angry at a tall world. She took it as a challenge instead, laughing at anything both even remotely amusing or irritating. She was always in good mood for the most part, which was a decent fit for the sometimes easily troubled human that tended to be caught up in her craziness.
He didn’t have anything to say in his defense. It was supposed to be a getaway in the dead of night, and he would do his explaining to the people who mattered over the phone later. Instead he offered a weak shrug as she killed the motor of the bike and stepped off of it. “Yeah, I can’t take it anymore, waiting for the ‘right moment’ to leave. So…I’m just leavin’, and that’ll be that.” Now he felt like an asshole. Alita would no doubt forgive him the easiest out of everyone. Or, on the other hand, hate him the most.
She just smiled as she dug through the back pocket of her jeans, fishing for something as she walked up. “Oh please, J. You weren’t the kind for big ol’ goodbyes anyways.” Whatever it was, she kept it clenched in her hands as she approached him. “Just wish you could’a told me ahead of time. I saw the bike leanin’ up against a post through my window when I got up to take a leak. Had me haulin’ ass across town just to see you off.”
They both stood there awkwardly, as teenagers tended to do when they have something to say but can’t find the will to say it. Jacob turned away, using the unspoken excuse of looking out for the coming bus. Alita just played with the dirt using her foot while wringing the end of her tail with her free hand, anxious to find something to continue the conversation.
It wasn’t like they didn’t have plenty to talk about. Since their playground days they had been inseparable. Every stupid decision one of them had made, the other was right next to them to witness it. More than once they were the other’s stupid mistake. If Jacob’s mom knew his first kiss was an anthro, she would never leave the church again. If his dad found out that not only he had sex before marriage, but it had been in the bed of the family work truck with an anthro, he would have been disowned at gun point.
It wasn’t as if there was some law that separated anthros and humans. Not anymore, at least. There was just this unspoken line that wasn’t crossed in small town, USA. Him and Alita could raise seven kinds of hell across the county, and people would only get mad at the property damage and noise they were making. Yet when she had stolen a kiss from his cheek on his seventeenth birthday, they had been politely asked to leave the burger joint they had been hanging out in.
They were, for as long as they actually cared about the opposite sex and all the fun sexual maturity provided, each other’s rebound fling and lazy afternoon distraction. He had been there for every ex-boyfriend, and she was there to remind him he could find someone better. The only real surprise was that when they had actually tried to be a thing together, it fell apart within the month. Nothing had changed, yet neither of them could shake the weird pretense making it official put on their relationship. As if they were expected to act differently, even if they had long been closer than some married couples they knew.
So, in mutual agreement, they had spent the last year of high school and months following graduation ‘best friends with some great benefits,’ as she had put it. It felt like a working compromise, but now that he was about to leave Pryston for what seemed to look like for good, it just complicated things. They weren’t officially a couple, so there shouldn’t be anything in the way beyond a simple ‘good luck’ and wish-you-luck, yet…
Alita broke first, stomping and grumbling in exasperation before closing the distance and resting against Jacob’s chest. Whatever was balled up in her hands was shoved into his, and she curled his fingers around it. “We both fucking suck at goodbyes, so….look, you go out there and put Pryston on the map for the rest of us, okay? Or do whatever you think is out there for you. Because…” She paused, looking to the side for a moment to find the words she wanted before looking back at him and furrowing her brow, “Because if you come back, I’ll give you a reason to never leave again. You got that?”
Jacob uncurled his fist, revealing a bundle of dollar bills with black and blue rubber bands tightly wound around the rolled up wad of cash. He blinked in surprise, “Alita, this is- I can’t take this!” The rubber bands had one simple significance; this was their stupid decisions money. The same savings that had afforded them their shared motorcycle and any other investment heavier than a couple burgers and a some of fries to share. The cash pile they both put into since they had part time jobs. It didn’t belong to him, at least not completely. Yet the heft of the amount in his hands told him that every dollar was there, both his and hers.
When he pushed the money back at her, she brushed past his outstretched arm and wrapped herself around his shoulders. “If you don’t shut up, I can’t give you one for the road.” With that, she pulled herself up to his face, and her lips found his. And they stayed there, Jacob reaching down to support her and pull her up to him as her tail wrapped around their legs.
The sound of air brakes wheezing from down the road pulled them apart, and her bright eyes stared into his. “You make go on and make it big, J. You hear me?” His answer was a weak grin and a reluctance to let her go as she pulled away from him. By now the bus was turning the curve and its headlights began lighting up the terminal, exposing the pair as Alita stepped backwards to make some distance from the human.
“So,” he called out as she strapped her helmet back on and threw her leg over the bike, “How are you going to make me stay if I ever come back?”
She froze for a moment, and then the bike started up with a twist of her hand. “I dunno yet! Give me a couple years, alright?” She shouted over the rumble of the engine. They shared a laugh, and waved good bye to each other before she kicked off. The last thing he saw of her was her tail dancing in the air behind her as she drove off into the night.



When Jacob finally stepped off the bus in California, he immediately set off to earn back every dollar of Alita had given him. It took three years for him break into the music industry. Then it was six months for the record label he had signed onto to recognize that while he was decent with a guitar, the young man’s talents only truly shone when making things sound better than they had any right to be. Another six before he was trusted to work as an audio engineer and assistant producer for one of the label’s big stars, which turned out to be the rocket to success he was after all along.
The released single was a chart topper, and the artist let people know that Jacob was a key part of it. Not by telling his boss on the way out, or even mentioning him to fellow artists. No, that gator name dropped him in an interview on national television. He could still hear the singer’s almost certainly intoxicated drawl in his head as he said the line that made his career. 

“No, for real though, the real secret ingredient was this Jacob Hevil kid. Ol’ Randy would step out of the booth and let him take over for a bit. At first I was worried, like, ‘who the hell is this guy?’ But I swear, you could bang pots together in front of the microphone and he could make it sound like opera. That kid worked magic at the mixing table, for sure. I’m pretty sure Randy was there just to make sure that guy didn’t make us sound like a completely different group of people.”

It was a change so fast Jacob hardly had time to process it. He went from a no name audio engineer to B-list music celebrity within a couple days. Eventually the constant calls for interviews died down as he stopped being on top of the music scene’s news reel, but the prestige hardly corroded. Artists would come into the studio, and ask for him by name rather than any of the old timers who were working there long before him. Apparently he had come off as some sort of magic bullet for success.
The following two years were a haze of work and royalty checks with a frankly scary amount of zeroes on them as he made a name for himself. It was honestly a bit much for a kid who had took a midnight bus out of Pryston, Texas. Thankfully, he had a method he could rely upon to keep him steady and straight shooting. Ever since he first got his hand on the methods to, he was calling home at least once a week.
He wasn’t calling his family. At least not more than two or three times, anyways. It took his mother two years to finally forgive him for leaving so suddenly. On the other hand, his father still never got over the fact that they had to learn where he was going by Alita telling them the next day. Sure, the rat was basically a daughter they never had, but his old man felt betrayed and let down by his son running across the country to escape their family business.
Instead he was in Alita’s ear every Saturday night. Sometimes it was just small talk. What was happening back home, like which one of her knucklehead siblings was being arrested this month, or the kind of trouble she had been up to without her usual partner in crime. In exchange, he told her tales from the golden state. Musicians he had run into, how people acted differently here, the difference in prices between the two states for just about everything, and the drought he was experiencing in the search of a decent barbecue that wasn’t made by some brainless city kid reading from a recipe book.
A common topic in their conversations was Jacob paying her back for her part of the savings he had left with. Alita refused at first, telling him to do his best way out there with everything he had. She only became more stubborn once he actually became successful. Despite his insistence, she would never take his money. So they settled on a middle ground if only so he would stop bringing it up at least twice every time he called.
He couldn’t just send her cash, but she would allow him to help pay for things she had her eye on. At first, he was buying her parts to maintain the motorcycle, now reaching almost twenty years old. Then he bought her a more modern phone than the track phone she had been using since freshman year in high school. It took her a couple months for her to let it slide that he was paying for the bill entirely. The fact that they could do video chats helped ease her anger. The higher quality pictures being swapped between the both of them also was a factor, proving that there was still a some life to their fire despite the distance. Alita found it more than slightly amusing to send the human risque pictures of her cream and caramel colored body whenever she knew he was in a meeting.
Any further gifts became impossible as Alita’s family continued to grow with nieces and nephews, and she was running out of room for herself in the Keller home. The last straw came when one of her oldest nephew stole the key to their beloved motorcycle and proceeded to paint the road with part of his hide. He survived but the bike did not, much to her anger and disappointment. With no ride and a rising urge to maim her kin, she finally broke down and accepted his idea to have an envelope full of cash delivered to her personal P.O. box. Enough for a decent car, and a couple weeks at a motel while she decided on which apartment or trailer she would be enjoying some new found solitude in.


The frustrated rat was only four days into her house searching when she received an uncharacteristic phone call from Jacob. Time zones always made long distance relationships funky, so she had become accustomed to how he would generally be calling late in the evening for her as he left the studio and was heading home. Instead, her phone was ringing at noon, and it was a Wednesday. Definitely not his usual weekend check in.
He leaned against his car as he waited for her to pick up the phone. Not his own car. No, that had been given away long before he made this call. The keys to his studio apartment had been given back to the land lord, and he did his best to give away the things he could settle to part with to friends and coworkers. The rest of his belongings were in a shipping container, riding on a train car all the way back to south east Texas, where it would be delivered to a storage yard and kept there until he had a place to put everything.
By now, he had enough clout and fame to operate from home, wherever he decided home would be. Where it wouldn’t be was California. As much as he appreciated the place, he only saw himself ever returning for business. At the moment however, he had withdrawn from the music industry. The only business he was interested in discussing was with the local real estate agency to find him a house big enough that a in-home recording studio could fit in. Well, that, and be durable enough to endure having a certain rodent with an indomitable attitude living within its four walls. Before any of that though, he had to at least let her know he was back. Then he could tell her that she wouldn’t have to bother paying rent again.
Right now he was using a rental car as his resting spot, parked and now starting to bake in the humid heat. Eventually her ring tone stopped and what sounded like the rustling of clothing replaced it. There was a drawn out yawn before she finally said something. “Hrmmyaaah~ what do you want, J? Got some good news for little ol’ moi?” Definitely sleeping in instead of diligently continuing her quest to find some place to live. That meant a slight change of plans, and he left the car where it was to start climbing up a flight of stairs.
“Depends,” he replied with a shrug that no one witnessed, “Are you decent?” Not many people actually used the motels here in Pryston. The average customer was usually visiting family members from out of town, and that was only if they were the kind of people too stuffy to crash on an air bed.
There was a hum as she thought for a second, and he heard her roll over in bed before answering, “By whose standards? Church decent? Because you know I’m never that kind of decent.”
He stopped walking before he got too close. Didn’t want to spoil the surprise after all. “Mm, maybe not so strict. Wal-mart decent?” Jacob leaned up against a wall, eyeballing the room she said she was staying in at the moment. She had gotten irritated with him when he had made her repeat which motel and what number her room was several times, but he had been searching for something to write with at the air port when he had called. 
The sound of scratching nails and ruffled hair filled the call for a few seconds, “Give me a second to put on some panties and swimming trunks and I’ll be good. Why, what’s up? Oh my god, is this your attempt at phone sex?” He heard her giggle, a snort of amusement even escaping before she contained herself. 
Without warning Jacob hung up, and he started moving again. As he got closer to his destination, he heard a muffled ‘it was just a joke, fucker’ from the other side of the door. Smirking to himself, he started knocking on the door to the motel room.
“I’M UP, I’M UP. Give me a second.” He could hear a shuffle of movement from inside the room, most likely clothes being tugged out of a poorly packed suit case.
The man hardly waited before speaking up. “I thought you were almost Wal-mart decent?” With just that, the motel room went silent. After a few moments he heard the locks on the door shift and it cracked open to reveal a brown and white rat peering through the crack.
“C’mere.” Alita growled as the door was opened just enough for her to grab him by the collar and throw him into the motel room. By the time he had spun around she was locking the door again before turning to face him. She hadn’t been lying about her lack of decency; the only thing she had on was a years old Sabaton t-shirt. It was definitely meant for a once smaller rat, as it was tugging to keep her chest in and if she lifted her arms at all her belly button would be exposed. The rest of her was bare as the day she was born.
He didn’t get time to explain himself before she lunged at him, tackling him right at chest level and using her momentum to knock him onto the bed. The pads of her fingers and palms caressed and held his face as she forced her lips against his. Jacob was still trying to process things, but he could see in his peripheral that her whip tail was threatening to knock over the bedside lamp and phone with how wildly it was thrashing.
For someone who was only a fraction of his weight, she was doing a fine job keeping him pinned, legs slipping underneath his to wrap herself around his body. Thin and deft, her tongue wouldn’t have been able to do much by itself if he hadn’t opened his lips to let it in. Once he did, it was apparent that she would only give up the privilege of accessing his tongue under threat of violence. She threw herself into the kiss, huffing out of her nose as she hungrily made up for years of lost time.
When she finally relented, they both gasped for air. She dragged her paws down from his face to push herself up off his chest. Nails grabbed into his shirt as she quickly began grinding against his crotch, staining it with the fluids of her arousal as she found the bulge of his excited cock and attacked it almost mindlessly. “Mmnf, bastard. Couldn’t warn a lady?” She groaned.
Jacob grinned as she closed her eyes and rocked against him, humping at the tent in his pants. “I thought you would enjoy this more if I surprised you.” She grinned right back as she savored the heat between her legs before slowing down and nuzzling at his nose.
“Yeah, but I wanted to do something the day you came back. Now we gotta wait for your ‘Welcome Back’ gift to be ready. Except that means we don’t get to knock boots until we can’t walk for another half hour.” She panted before thinking. A finger scratched at her chin before she grew a grin that put a spot of panic in Jacob’s heart. “Actually…get out of those pants anyways, J. I need to see if I remembered to put a few things in in my bag before I left my mom’s.” Alita mumbled before she hopped off of him and off the bed.
She pointed two fingers at her eyes and then pointed them back at Jacob before almost skipping over to the corner of the motel room. He caught himself staring as she bent over while tossing things out of her suitcase to each side, her swollen lips almost drooling. The rat was definitely easy to get wound up, but she must have something really special planned if she had enough willpower to pull herself off of him.
Almost as if she could feel his gaze, she turned back around to look at him on the bed. “I don’t hear a zipper droppin’, J.” She tsked, and didn’t look away until he started shuffling to undress. Her ears and tail all twitched in approval when she heard the sound of his zipper going down, and she turned back to her search.
He hurriedly kicked off his pants, falling back onto the mattress with a sigh of relief as his cock sprung free. Even if he hadn’t told her he was coming back to Pryston, it was something he had been planning; it just was rushed ahead of schedule by her sudden homelessness. Regardless, part of that planning was ingesting any form of pineapple or pineapple juice he could tolerate. Another part was purposefully neglecting himself for the last few weeks, betting on his weakened endurance lasting long enough for the both of them to have a good time before celebrating their union with the first of many messy finales.
Because of these preparations, his dick was primed and ready to go from the moment she had wrapped herself around him for their first kiss in years. Her short but aggressive foreplay had only made it more difficult for him to get his pants off. Part of him didn’t even want to touch himself, afraid he would set himself off. Instead he finished stripping, throwing aside his t-shirt before scooting off the bed to turn the air conditioner a few notches higher.
The moment his ass left the bed he immediately heard a sharp “HEY!” from behind him. Turning around, Alita had her arms crossed and the look on her face was the kind that told him she wasn’t in the mood for any unapproved shenanigans. Fearfully, he pointed at the AC unit silently, causing her to follow his finger before shrugging and nodding, giving him permission while she unfolded her arms and started messing with something metallic sounding in her hands.
Once the air conditioner was blowing cool air in preparation for the afternoon’s activities, Jacob obediently got back into bed. She followed him in, pushing him down with one hand while her other was hidden behind her back. “You’re serious about this, aren’t you?” He muttered in between the rain of affectionate kisses meant to keep him busy as she got into position for whatever she had in mind.
“Hun, you aren’t even ready for what I’m going to do to you.” She cooed as she reached up with her forward hand, gripping onto his wrist before dragging his arm up to the bars of the headrest. “But that can wait. In a bit, you’ll be too cross eyed to think straight.” He didn’t like the grin on her face, but he had long ago learned to recognize when it was worth the effort to ask what she was up to and when it was better to just brace for impact.
They shared one more long kiss as she brought his other hand up, and Jacob grinned when it broke. “I’m still reeling from that little rodeo I got just a bit ago. I ain’t sure I’m ready for this.” He hardly had time to brace for what she was about to do. The hand she was keeping behind her back flew up and he felt the clink of handcuffs clamping down on his wrists. Looking up, she had somehow looped the chain around the back of the headrest’s bars before shutting the hoops around his wrist. He gave a reflexive tug before looking back at her. “The hell?!”
She looked far, far too pleased than he was comfortable with now that he was cuffed to the bed. Her grin was wide and wicked as she leaned in low to lick at his nose. “Oh, be glad I couldn’t be bothered to buy a ball gag, J. Anyways~” Alita hummed as she started lowering down his body, her back arching while she bit her lip when her leaking snatch met up with his length. Whatever else she had to say was put to the side as she began to grind against him, rocking against the throbbing shaft as she fought back groans.
There was ‘ready to go,’ and then there was whatever tortuous state Jacob was in as she teased his cock with its long-lost friend. Something she must have been aware of the way she giggled when he immediately began rocking back against her. They shared a few hushed groans before Alita came back to her sense and brought herself face to face with her best friend and lover.
“Anyways,” She exhaled, slowing herself and pulling away from the object of her fascination, “I knew you couldn’t stay away forever, so I did a little preparin’; just a little somethin’ special I picked up ” The rat was drawing circles on his chest, finger tracing around his nipples, “It takes awhile for it to kick in. So between now and the real good part,” her hand flowed down his body and gingerly wrapped around his dick, causing him to buck softly before she let go and continued south. His ballsack was cupped into her palm, softly being rolled while she continued, “I’mma get the boys down here nice and ready for the show. They need to do their best today. It might just be the most important thing they ever do, after all.”
Alita almost slithered off his chest, grinning as she finally sat back up and scooted off the foot of the bed. Once again she started digging through the suitcase, only this time he was too restrained to enjoy the view. It seemed she knew exactly for where to look for what she wanted this time, popping up a few seconds later with a triumphant grin on her face and an orange pill bottle in her hand. “Be riiight back~” She snickered as she stepped into the bathroom. After a couple seconds of what sounded like her struggling, she squeaked happily as a pop came from the small room. The faucet turned on, and he swore he heard her mutter, “Shit, these are bigger than I thought…”
Several moments later, the water turned off, and the rat strutted out of the bathroom, pulling off her shirt and tossing it to the side. Now completely naked, she was grinning wide while crawling back over to the bound man, on all fours as she made a beeline for his crotch. “Wait, what were those pills?” He didn’t mean to sound panicked, but it was a bit hard not to struggle when he wasn’t accustomed to being handcuffed and at her mercy.
She pulled her gaze away from his dick long enough to turn to him and put a finger to her lips, “Something special~ Don’t worry about it. Just try not to blow up in my face until it’s time for the rodeo to start.” He didn’t like how she giggled after that, but it looked like she was done talking as she draped her arms across his legs and stomach. It looked pretty lazy, but she was more interested in getting to his cock than getting into position.
Humming to herself, she leaned forward, small tongue hanging out before it finally made contact with the side of his shaft. Immediately he tensed and twitched, and he heard her snort in laughter before she began dragging her tongue upwards. When his knee curled up as she lifted off the head of his cock, he saw a grin cross the corner of her face. Not that she said anything, too busy lowering herself back to the base of his cock.
Once there, she began kissing around it, covering it in a ring of affection while a hand wrapped itself around the upper half of his length. She kept the other hand on his legs, keeping them down as she made another lap around his dick. Sprinkling in a few licks at same time, she slowly began to scoot sideways, bringing herself into a proper sixty nine position as she laid on top of his chest.
Or, it would be a proper sixty nine position if she wasn’t so short and he could pull himself up. Instead, her soaked slit sat a foot or so in front of his face, the thin, almost nonexistent fur between her thighs becoming slicker every time her legs brushed together. It seemed she was aware of this, readjusting her hands so that one was holding her up while the other slipped between her furred thighs.
Just as she brought her lips up against the head of his cock, her fingers slipped between her folds, splaying them out for him to see her need. He wasn’t sure if this was a show or foreplay at this point, really. The thought was made irrelevant as she kissed the tip of his dick, tongue falling out to roll in a slow circle around the head. Her fingers traced around her clit, as if she was trying to keep herself at the same level of pleasure he was experiencing.
Eventually she pulled free with a quiet pop, wasting no time to nuzzle at the bottom of his dick only to drag her tongue all the way back to the top. Once she did that, she shifted just slightly to the side to coat a new angle with a layer of spittle. While she busied herself with painting every inch of his dick with her tongue, her free hand continued to massage at his sac, constantly giving it attention while she worked.
All Jacob had to offer in this was the clinking of handcuff chains against the headrest as he reflexively curled and twitched underneath her care. She didn’t seem to be in a talking mood, so he didn’t say much besides mumbled swears and sharply exhaling whenever she struck gold with her tongue.
Once she was satisfied with how his cock was shining from her tongue polishing, she looked back over her shoulder before shaking her ass at his face, “Still alive back there?” She snickered. Her hand replaced her mouth, squeezing at his girth once or twice between slowly stroking him from top to bottom.
He chuckled, shrugging as best he could, “I mean, this isn’t what I expected to be waiting for me when I came home. How much longer are you going to do this?” There was a hint of concern in his voice and on his face, nervously smirking back at her.
Before she answered, she looked over to the clock on cable box across from the bed. “The bottle said forty five minutes. And then we can do the good bits. So….maybe another hour and a half in cuffs. That okay with you babe?” He opened his mouth to voice his opinion before she nodded, “Glad to hear it.” There was a touch of panic on his face as she faced forwards again, snickering to herself. They were done when she was done, and not a moment before.
Not that he had much time to worry about that, with the way she effectively attacked his crotch. Her muzzle pushed past his dick to get to his sac, announcing its presence when she exhaled hot air onto them moments before wrapping her lips around one of his orbs as best she could. Her suckling was momentarily distracted by the sight of his toes curling, but her hand was now picking up speed as she began to properly stroke at his cock.
The hissing and groans from behind her were completely ignored as she squeezed and stroked. Eventually she pulled herself from his sac, a pleased hum coming from her throat as planted kisses along his shaft up to the top, causing it to twitch as she released it from her grip. She tried not to feel too proud about how he sucked in air and braced himself once she was perched at his cock head.
That breath he was holding immediately came free the moment she began dropping her head back down and letting his cock into her muzzle. Both as a handhold and to keep up the gauntlet of pleasure, she once again started palming at his now polished sac. Air pushed out of her nose as she nuzzled against his crotch, tongue lashing around the sides of his dick before sticking to it and dragging along the length as she bobbed upwards. Jacob muttered something, but it was basically gibberish to the point that even he wasn’t sure what he said, let alone Alita. Paying it no mind, she began dipping her head back and forth in a slow, controlled manner. 
As good as it felt to have her showering all this attention to his cock and balls, he was getting a sinking suspicion that this wasn’t about his pleasure. At least, that wasn’t her main goal. Anything that got too much of a reaction out of him was never repeated, her tongue purposely tracing along the edge of the veins on his dick rather than over them.
He was glad there was a wiggling piece of rat ass in between him and the television stand. It was starting to feel like this blowjob was lasting an eternity, and not an eternity he would like to be in. Seeing the digital clock refusing to tick over to each next minute would make her measured approach to tending to his cock even more torturous. 
It never truly dawned on him before on how attentive she could be. While she was suckling, she was keeping a keen eye out for a few signs. At first she was paying attention to when she began tasting the pre-cum leaking out of his cock, a warm and surprisingly sweet addition to the spit already covering his length. Then she was feeling how he was tensing up under her and within her grasp, keeping measure of every twitch and tug of his body.
It was when he started chanting his usual litany of f-bombs that she revealed just how devious she intended to be. Right as his legs began to tense up and he stopped muttering ‘fuck’ under his breath and began hissing instead, she pulled up and off his dick with an audible pop and a sigh. She almost pushed herself off his crotch, a look of expectation and worry on her face as she eyed his cock to see if she had gone too far. Much to her amusement, even as Jacob bucked upwards, it seemed she had stopped at just the right moment.
Underneath her and behind her tail she could hear the man panting, before he groaned, “Oh God, please tell me this isn’t what we’re doing.” His head fell back as his cock ached for just the tiniest amount of attention. Anything to push him over the edge. Alita only pumped her fist in triumph.
“Yup. Told you I was gonna get your boys all worked up.” She laughed, grinning as she spun around, “But now it’s break time so all that hard work doesn’t go to waste.” Jacob raised an eyebrow in confusion, looking up at his handcuffs and tugging at them. “Oh no, I mean a break for me. Now it’s your turn, cowboy.” 
He pursed his lips for a moment before sighing and letting his head fall back onto the mattress, “Guess I kind of deserve this.” Taking that as permission, she scooted up his body. One hand pressed to his forehead to keep him down while she straddled his face before unceremoniously dropping her ass down.
Alita loved a lot about this man. She could probably, and bashfully, make a list about all the things she adored about Jacob. When it came to sex, however, his face was competing with his dick for the top spot. More than once she had heard her friends complain about the awkwardness of getting head from their anthro boyfriends. Meanwhile, Jacob’s flat human face seemed to fit perfectly between her legs.
With no muzzle to worry about angling or harming, she could simply straddle the man’s head and let him go to work. Which was exactly what she was doing as she leaned forward to hold onto the head rest of the bed. He didn’t need instruction, offering no complaints once her cunt was in range.
While she had long missed how it felt for him to be digging his fingers into her cheeks while he ate her out, she was glad just to have his tongue splitting her pussy open. The years apart hadn’t dulled his skill, starting from the bottom while gliding upwards, causing her to huff as he crossed her entrance and bite her lip as he flicked away at her clit in the end.
She lowered a hand to split her folds and give him better access. He immediately took advantage of this as he returned the favor from earlier and began drawing circles with his tongue. “Gnf-fuuhuck, I lose my bike, and my Romeo shows up to be its replacement. Love you J~” She teased while arching her back.
Jacob was too busy lapping away to speak up, and she wasn’t giving him enough room to talk anyways. Furry thighs kept his face locked in place, squirming and squeezing whenever his tongue brushed against anywhere sensitive. Unlike how she was treating him for however long that blow job lasted, he was doing everything he could to make the rat on his face melt into a puddle.
It wasn’t something that had gone unnoticed, either. She kept her cunt right against his lips, rolling her body against his eager tongue in anyway she could manage. In between her increasingly ragged groans, she managed to moan out some encouragement-cum-demands. “Get that tongue in there, you naked bastard,” she squeaked, parking her hips in what felt like the best spot for him dig at her opening, “I don’t know if you can but you better damn try!”
Try he did, doing his damnedest to fit his tongue into her. Alita, for her part in this effort, abandoned holding her lips apart to instead toy with her clit. One hand was firmly gripping the bars of the headrest to keep her straight while she rode his face hard enough to push him down into the mattress. At that point, the sound of his slurping tongue was lost and drowned out by her moans and squeaking. A quiet lover she was not as she informed the neighboring rooms of just how good of a time she was having.
Eventually she grunted and clenched her teeth before gasping, her body going tense and then shuddering a bolt of pleasure rocked up her spine. As loud as she was moment ago, she was reduced to whining breathlessly as she began to shake. The rat even fell forward a bit, pulling her hand from her clit to catch the bed. All the while, Jacob labored away despite the increased heaviness of the feminine juices against his lips and chin. Every lash of his tongue kept her from catching her breath, eyes clenched tight as he pushed her orgasm along.
Once the waves of pleasure dulled from body trembling electricity to a pleasant buzz, Alita finally found it in her to stop clenching her teeth and pant for air. She let Jacob know she recovered by wiggling her hips and lifting herself up an inch or so, but she was in no hurry to remove herself from her favorite chair. Instead she just enjoyed the tip of his tongue caressing her damp sex while lazily looking over her shoulder to check the clock.
Still a bit of time left before the bottle said the pills would kick in. Her eyes fell to the still hard cock, standing tall and neglected; if she edged him again, they would have to wait again, unless she was happy with him blowing his load early the first time she got on his dick in years. No, that was definitely not an option. And even though he was still was using his tongue like the hard working man he was, no doubt he would eventually get tired of being her chair before it was time for the main course.
After another minute of savoring his tongue, Alita finally grabbed the head rest with both hands before pulling herself up and off Jacob’s face. Both sighed in unison; her out of exertion, and him out of relief. It wouldn’t be long before she was on top of him again, scooting backwards to lay on his chest. The rat grinned as she looked at his face, “Need a napkin, J? You got somethin’ riiight,” she giggled as she leaned in and licked some of her own juices off of the edge of his lips, “There.” 
Rolling his eyes, Jacob lifted his head up so her arms could slip underneath as she busied herself with cleaning up the sides of his mouth. “You’re not doin’ it right if you’re not making a mess.” He defended himself as she finished with the last trail of slick fluid that was escaping down his cheek.
“Still holding that pie eating contest win over my head, are we?” She snorted before pulling his head up for a deep kiss, not satisfied with the slick ‘crumbs’ of his meal and deciding to see if she could still taste herself on his tongue. It only took a moment to confirm that she could, and Jacob grunted as she tugged him in close and began hungrily wrestling with his tongue.
At the same time, her long tail was coming to rest and slinking along his lower body. Not exactly the definition of prehensile as some other species of anthros, but plenty of practice had left her with some dexterity with the further end of its length. It was neat for a party trick or two, such as plucking bottles off a table, but there was a reason she had bothered to learn to do handle things with her tail. Even if she might as well be an honorary Hevil to his parents, they were very much insistent on her keeping her hands where she could see them.
Which meant that Jacob was no stranger to getting a tail job while under the covers, sometimes even mere feet away from other people. She always had such a proud look on her face as she made him ruin another blanket during a movie night, all the while everyone else had their eyes on the screen. Eventually his dad just assumed rats liked to lick the end of their tails clean if they sat still for too long. Alita never corrected him.
A laugh pulled from his throat when he felt her tail wrap around his cock, and she broke the kiss long enough to nuzzle his nose. “Missed this?” She cooed softly once her tail got enough grip to slip along his length, tightening and loosening its hold every so often.
He could only smile, laughing again as she started concentrating on working her tail. “I didn’t realize I did until I felt that thing creepin’ up like old times. Now I’m wonderin’ how I went so long without this.” The grin on his face was genuine, and she rewarded his honesty by tightening around his shaft and giving it a squeeze. It was a good enough answer for her, nuzzling into the side of his face before resting her head on the bed next to his. 
Her tail continued to lazily drag along his cock as she bit her lip, focusing her effort on not taking things too far. “So…” She mumbled, obviously distracted, “Aren’t you going to ask what the pills are for?” Alita teased, lifting herself up for a second or two to look over her shoulder to check the time, before turning around back to him.
Jacob had seen this kind of look on her face before. It was one that said she had a secret that she had no interest in keeping. He knew better than to not play along, so he shrugged as best as he could. “It’s important enough that you’re willing to wait. What’s so special about these pills, Alita?” Part of him regretted asking her, since she immediately began wiggling on top of his chest.
“Remember back before you got on the bus? I said something like, ‘if you come back, I’ll make you stay forever.’ Or something like that. I was bein’ real dramatic.” She lifted and waved her hand, as if brushing away her past self’s embarrassment. “Well, I found somethin’ that will keep you here for good.” Seeing his face and the mix of curiosity and confusion on it, she began lowering herself down his body, tail unwinding and freeing his dick from its grip.
For a moment his heart rate raced as she began to lift her hips. Indeed, the last few inches of his cock brushed up against an all-too-familiar slickness, and he even saw Alita bite her lip and tremble as she kept rolling backwards. His length bent back before she lifted herself higher and it sprang forward and upright again. Instead she seated herself on his thighs, his dick contrasting against her stomach. Almost reflexively she traced a finger along the top of it, running from base to tip with a smile on her face.
“So…it’s kind of a recent thing, but the moment I saw a generic brand at the drugstore, I went and did some research. Which kind is the best, what works well with rats, that kind of thing.” As she continued to tease and hint, it only made him more confused. Alita of all people never did any kind of research, much more keen on simply winging it, whatever ‘it’ pertained to at any one moment. “So I saved up some money, and special ordered some. Got a litter’s worth of’em too.” For some reason, the smile on her face was starting to fill him with a sense of dread. Wherever this was going, it didn’t look like he was getting a word in edgewise.
She pinned her index finger to the head of his cock, lightly pushing it against her stomach. “High end crossbreeding pills aren’t cheap, especially the fast acting kind. They do somethin’ funky to a girl’s eggs so anyone can put’em to use. The kids come out as whatever the mom is, but they can have their dad’s eyes and stuff.” It was then that her smile grew even sharper, and for the first time since his father almost discovered them knocking boots in the hallway closet, Jacob’s blood run cold. “I’m gonna make you a daddy, J. And my momma always said every other generation of Keller girls has twins for their first. You gonna leave me alone in Pryston again when I’ve got a pair of little ones running around?”
While he was trying to find the words that would make her realize that just maybe he would like some time to think about this, Alita simply looked back at the clock on the cable box. “Alita, come on, you don’t want to, I dunno, do this at least some way more romantic than with me handcuffed to a motel bed?” It’s not like he was seeing any one else, but there was a time and a place for this kind of decision, and this cheap motel in Pryston in the middle of a lazy Wednesday afternoon was definitely neither in his mind.
His pleading effectively ignored as she turned forward again, putting a hand on his stomach for balance as she brought her hips up. The fingers of her other hand lightly wrapped around his girth, dragging it back against the fur of her stomach before it was once again brushing against her pussy. There was no ceremony to what she did; once he was properly lined up with the mushroom head of his prick pushing at her entrance, she dug her nails into his stomach before lowering her hips.
They both shared a hissed ‘oh god’ the moment she began to spread around his cock. The prep work on both of them made for an easy first few inches, her cunt welcoming him in before it was forced to adjust for the remainder of his dick. Both of them had their eyes closed, yet Jacob’s teeth were clenched while Alita was almost slack jawed from the bliss. She only closed her mouth to hold back the pleasured groan of his shaft finding its way deeper.
There were warnings all about this pill inducing some sort of breeding frenzy once hips starting rocking, but even before she had bought herself a set she thought it was nonsense. Just inexperienced women who never had a good time before, she thought. Now she was looking right into the face of her hubris; Jacob’s cock might as well have been glowing hot inside of her, and every throb his pulse sent through it sent a jolt through her that was making her toes splay outwards.
She released her guiding grasp on the base of his length, pulling both hands up to his chest before dropping her hips and impaling herself on the last few inches of dick with borderline savage intent. The gasp of pleasure and relief that escaped her lips played foil to the grunt that came from Jacob. 
He looked up at her, half tugging at the cuffs that quite firmly held in him place. Despite being unaware of any of the finer details of the pill she had taken, he could see hunger in the half-lidded eyes that were looking back at him. She was going to fuck him until all he had left to offer to any woman for the next few days was a puff of seminal mist. Once again he found himself pulling at his restraints, less worried about becoming a father and more for his health.
As if detecting his panic, she brought a finger to his lips, “Don’t worry beau, I’ll do all the hard work. You just try to think of some good baby names, alright?” She chuckled, before dropping her hands to the blanket on either side of his chest. Despite the increasingly demanding needs between her legs, she had enough consideration to at least not dig her nails into her man. That skin was to be licked and touched, not scratched and scarred.
Alita had planned to take this long and slow once she finally got her hands on Jacob. A sensual build up where they would take their time before they shared the first of many mutual orgasms before they were exhausted and bathing in the afterglow of their long awaited reunion. Then the pills started talking and all she wanted was for him to paint her insides white, with as many coats as he could muster up.
Furrowing her brow in concentration, she lifted her hips up while savoring the sensation of her emptiness. Even from his perspective, he could tell she was fighting the urge to just slam herself down onto him once the first few inches left her. Instead, she raised herself higher and higher until his cock threatened to leave her cunt. When she sank herself down, the soft clap of two bodies colliding was overshadowed by a shared moan and the creak of the bed frame.
Once again her mouth was left hanging open as his dick caused her mind to blow a fuse. Pulling herself together, she pulled herself up again, only letting around half of his length leave her before falling down on it again. It took only a few bounces for her to find a rhythm, one that was decidedly rushed and aggressive as she rode him into the mattress. “Nngfffucking you jerk. Can’t believe you- haffuck- made me wait six years for this.” She mumbled in between expletive carrying squeaks. “Mm-god so fucking good. I forgot how it - homygawd yes - hits all the right - nng - spots!”
Every swear and moan was accompanied by her picking up the pace. Instead of enjoying his company and making him squirm as she used to back in their teenage years, all she wanted was to get him off. They could make up and do the sappy romance bit later, she was sure of it. Right now, though, she was burning up in a drug-induced heat and needed to be knocked up yesterday. Each throb of his cock excited her, tingling her with body shaking pleasure at the anticipation of the man underneath her finally losing.
It certainly didn’t hurt that she still had the muscle memory to get his dick exactly where she wanted it. Lithe hips rolled and swayed with small adjustments, getting the head of his cock to drag against this side of her tunnel on the way up before prodding against a sensitive bundle of nerves on the other side when she brought her hips down again. If it wasn’t for how much effort it took for that kind of control, she would have her tongue lolling out rather then sporting the white knuckle grip that she was tearing into the blanket with.
Jacob on the other hand was trying his best to grin and bear Alita’s crazed rhythm. By now she was slamming her body down hard enough that he could feel himself being pushed down into the mattress, only for it to push him back up when she pulled herself up. He had expected plenty of dirty talk, I-missed-you’s, and other things separated lovers did when they reunited. Instead, she was riding him like a rodent possessed, practically assaulting him with how hard she was dropping back onto him.
When he had started abstaining from masturbating a couple weeks ago, this wasn’t what he had in mind. He didn’t think she would go straight in for the kill, her pussy squeezing at his cock and demanding to be filled with anything potent enough to knock her up. Even if his stamina wasn’t already sapped to begin with, Alita would just have easily burned through it regardless at the rate she was going.
It wasn’t just with her body that she was using to coax him towards his climax; when she wasn’t raving about how good it felt to be fucking him after so long, she was loosing words of encouragement down to her handcuffed beau. “C’mon J, just - ha shit - just gimme it. I’m practical-leee nnoh God - begging for kids. All you gotta-aahn - do is fire away. Lemme have it already~” 
While she fought with her own moans to speak at all, her tail was making sure he couldn’t get away or fight this. It had started wrapping around one of his legs just out of distantly remembered habit, bur once she had started getting up to speed it traced over to the other leg as well, tying itself around his knees. If it was anyone else, he would be terrified. Since it was Alita, he settled for simply being worried before submitting to her demands.
When his moans started slurring from unintelligible sounds to a chanting chorus of ‘oh fucks,’ Alita knew she had him dead to rights. The already frenzied bounces of her hips became even shorter, hardly an inch of rushed motion as she did everything she could to push him past his limit and right off the cliff beyond it.
Even if her face was too scrunched up from effort and focus to show it, she definitely felt a touch of pride with her timing; just as he threw his head back and went tense underneath her, she buried her hips against his one last time, causing the bed to once more creak in distress. She had done a good job working herself up for her second orgasm, but it still felt a ways off, especially since she had only just recently had her first. Still, she had gotten hers already, so it wasn’t too much of a worry.
Except the moment the first shot of cum fired out of Jacob’s dick landed against the inner walls of her pussy, she was hit by a blitz of dopamine and a jolt of mind numbing pleasure. Almost immediately afterwards she choked out a squeak before going silent while her second climax rocked her. If it wasn’t for the fact that she was already gripping onto the sheets for balance, she would have collapsed right onto his chest. Instead, she tense up, shaking as she tried her best to stay upright. Jacob, meanwhile, took charge of the situation, practically throwing his hips upwards to bury himself into her.
It was a lurid feedback loop, each of them dragging out the orgasm of the other. Every throbbing pulse that delivered another rope of seed was met with a milking squeeze from her cunt that begged for another, a request that was eagerly obliged. Jacob couldn’t remember the last time he had came this hard. At first he was shooting his load up into her body, but even as it lost force he continued to pump out a heavy amount that pooled and filled her.
Eventually he had nothing left, even as he weakly bucked his hips upwards in an attempt to coax the last of his jizz out. There had been some overflow; he could feel a pool of moisture growing underneath him, and from the stickiness he could tell it wasn’t just sweat. Still, he was exhausted despite having only really put in work during the finale. It left him panting from the exertion of being ridden like a uncooperative stud until he gave up the goods, and he was ready for a proper break that didn’t involve a rat sitting on his face.
Compared to the exhausted human underneath her, Alita was practically on cloud nine. A lazy smile had grown on her face as she sat up before leaning back some, prompting a groan from the man as his tender cock was forced to shift with her as she got comfortable. One hand was pressed flat behind her, giving her support as she lazily ran a finger through the fur on her stomach, as if stirring the warmth within her. “It’s…never felt that good before.” She hummed, to which Jacob grunted in acknowledgment. “You think these things work with birth control? That was a rush, but I don’t want to end up pregnant every time I feel like cumming that hard again.” The rat sighed, and once more he only grunted in response.
The pair stayed like that for the next few minutes, Jacob too drained to even tug at the handcuffs now. It wasn’t the pleasant, feel good afterglow that either of them had thought they would get after their reunion fuck, but it was satisfying nonetheless. It was only when she pressed her hand to his stomach did he stir, looking up as she began pulling herself off of his dick.
It wasn’t easy, her legs having temporarily been turned to jello and unable to move from the intensity of her climax. It was mostly her arms doing the work, pushing herself off of his chest until her lower half remembered how to function. Still, it was no easy feat, the rat grumbling as inch after inch of cum coated shaft came free of her pussy. “Nnff, I’m always glad it’s so big until I have to pull it out.” Jacob offered no retort before laying his head back down.
Once it was free, his slick length leaned over, still half erect as if it wasn’t sure there would be a second round. Alita let it be for the moment, clambering higher onto Jacob’s stomach before spinning around and straddling his chest. She reached back to grab her tail, lifting it up and out of the way while spreading her legs. “Hey J, whatcha think? Done in one? Or should I take you for another ride to make sure it sticks?” Between her legs was a now stuffed rat cunt, slick with a multitude of fluids but the primary color that was dribbling out of her was an off-white that spoke of a job well done.
The human lazily brought his head up to survey his handiwork. By all means and every estimate he could make, the only thing they could be doing better was actually making sure this had been during the right time of her cycle. Because he had definitely jammed her full of enough spunk to get at least three kids out of the rodent. Still, he wasn’t some quitter. In fact, he was her best friend. The only one crazy enough to try and keep up with her since the third grade. A smile crossed his face before he spoke:

“I think we should give it another shot, just to be sure. But this time, you wear the cuffs.”
