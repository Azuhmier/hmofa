            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Summary:[NSFW] Set in the Warhammer Fantasy universe, an Imperial footknight is captured by a mysterious Skaven clan. (Uses a first-person perspective from the knights POV) </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">________________________________________________________________________________</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The throbbing in your head wakes you with its incessant beating, the non-reverberated sound of your groan revealing your lack of armor. You instinctively reach to rub your head only to notice the binding on your arms, the sudden realization of capture clears your head as you look around the room. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It’s dark, wet, dank...Your in a cave, or a burrow of some ki-wait, burrow, the rats, the Skaven! </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The memories rush back as you recall the slaughter of the battle, an apparent raid by beastmen. But no, these weren’t beastmen, they were something else, you’d only realized far too late. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You stand at the gates of the township, the screaming and clamoring of the peasants making the already chaotic skirmish even more hectic. You’d quite literally carved a path through the hordes of rats along with your brothers in arms, but the slew of bodies seemed almost minor when compared to the sheer number of Skaven. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Gather the townsfolk! Keep a forward guard! Don’t let any of these rats into the central square!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The guard captain shouted orders from atop the wall, and as the gate opens into the outer edges of the city, you silently issue a prayer to Sigmar, though a small part of you curses your title of footknight as you march into the front lines of this hell. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The gate gives way, and the small army of defenders pushes forward, killing innumerable amounts of Skaven as they rush to escape the overrun city. Some peasants simply run away screaming, abandoning the crowd in favor of themselves. Through the hordes, you glimpse a small group of what appears to be cloaked women running into an alley, a pack of clan rats being led by a rat ogre following behind them. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Gritting your teeth, you break off from the skirmish and rush the alley, not content to let these rats kill a group of innocents.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It doesn’t take long for you to reach the small contingent of rats, they’ve already backed the women into a corner and you can tell the ogre isn’t winding up for a hug. You quickly draw the blunderbuss from your belt and fire into its back, the resounding CRACK punctuated by the spew of blood &amp; bone is more than enough to send the ogre screeching in pain, turning to you, now very much enraged. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You waste no time and rush headlong into the Skaven war party, cutting down multiple ratmen in single swings of your sword. As you carve your way towards the rat ogre, it charges through the group, killing many of its own before making a great leap for you! With only seconds to spare you grab hold of a now dead Skaven’s spear and thrust it upwards into the ogres gapping maw! Its own momentum causing even the rather scrappy spear to pierce its skull, leaving the beast dead where it drops. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The rest of the rats flee as you run forward to the group of civilians. You approach the cloaked woman leading the party, placing your hand on her shoulder and turning back towards the plaza. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Get back to the main group! You’ll be safer there! C&#039;mon!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A shiver runs up your spine as the woman places her hand on your arm, it’s spindly and clawed, even through thick gloves you can feel it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Oh, we’s are very fines now sweets hero.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You turn back to the woman in shock, the leader pulling down her hood to reveal the face of a white furred Skaven. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Now that we’s found you.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Before you can act, a powerful shock courses through your body. Tendrils of electric green energy racing over your armor before knocking you into unconsciousness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Back to reality you shake your somewhat groggy head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yes, that was it...That’s how you got here, that damned rat tricked you. Or at least partially tricked you? Why were the other Skaven trying to kill her and what you assume were other disguised Skaven? Maybe they mistook them for humans? If that were the case why were they running around disguised in a practical war zone? Why did they take you alive? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Many questions coursed through your mind but they were all cut short by the sound of a creaking door in the darkness of your “cell.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A pair of glowing verminous eyes peers from the darkness, and you brace for what may come. “Ah very goodsies, man thing is awakes, was worried mistress had zapped you to much, yes yes?” You try to give a growl in the direction of the rat, but the squeaking noises you receive in return tells you this rat is only laughing at your plight. “Still very strong, yes yes? Heehee, mistress will be happy!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The Skaven approaches ever closer, with your eyes slowly acclimating to the darkness you can now see it’s not the one that put you in this predicament, though it...she, is another female for certain. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">With seemingly little hesitation she reaches to grab your face, turning your head side to side as if to examine you further. As you&#039;re about to tell her off, she pushes her sniffer right into the side of your neck, the mix of a cold wet nose and ticklish whiskers making you jump in surprise. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*Sniff Sniff* &quot;Heehee, man thing smells goooood, yes yes, much better then dummy males, mmmmnnn.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Many feelings course through your body, though confusion and curiosity certainly trump most of them. With the female Skav now quite literally straddling you, you can see her clearly. Her fur is coal black, and her body is lithe, small perky breasts and an exposed navel rubbing against your chest acting as more than enough proof of her femininity. She&#039;s wearing a small amount of leather armor and you can see what appears to be a knife tucked away on her belt. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A brief thought of trying to grab it is cut short as the rat woman rakes her small claws down your shoulders as she begins to fondle your pectorals. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Ooooh yes yes! Mistress was right, man thing is very strong!&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You turn your head down in an attempt to glare at her, only to be met with a shaggy mane of hair in your face. It&#039;s at this moment you notice something else, the scent. A smell is coming off the female, not bad per say but it&#039;s getting to your head, like a pungent sweat or musk. Worse yet, you can feel her fondling continuing to go lower, the rats having apparently stripped you down to nothing but your leggings. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Mmmmnnn yeeess, think we&#039;s very much going to likes you&#039;s&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You begin to grit your teeth as she fingers the edge of your leathers, not exactly mentally prepared to get molested by a rat woman. Though your prayers are seemingly answered as the door to the room once again swings open, now with a blaring torchlight. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;CHIFFSKA! Mistress wanted man things much times ago!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">___________________________________________________________________________</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Your would-be rapist falls off you with a surprised squeak. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;W-was just seeings if man thing was awake?! Yes Yes!&quot;  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The much larger Skaven enters the room fully, issuing a hiss at the smaller rat woman. Another female, this one with white fur, though she&#039;s wearing some form of scrap iron armor, her body far more built then the one who shocked you. She&#039;s obviously a warrior of some sort, at least by Skaven standards.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As she pushes past the female apparently named Chiffska, she locks eyes with you before bopping her in the back of the head. Sending the smaller Skav scampering into the hall with an &quot;Eeep!&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You! man thing, you come with to see Mistress, comes willingly, or I MAKES you come!&quot;  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">To accentuate her point she taps what you assumed was a spear on the ground, though now you realize its actually one of those horrid trapper hooks. Not wanting to deal with a neck full of rusty iron spikes, you let out a grunt and nod at the Skav.   </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She wastes no time in unhooking your bindings from the wall, though she still leaves your arms cuffed together as she drags you deeper into the burrow. You once again briefly toy with the idea of escape, but the thought is quelled by your more rational side. You&#039;re Sigmar knows how deep in Skaven territory, in pitch darkness, surrounded by a nigh uncountable force. With begrudging acceptance, you follow your captors lead to wherever she is taking you.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As you walk you hear Skaven scampering throughout the shanty caves. Some whispering in hushed squeaky tones as you pass by. You note that most of what hear sounds female. The thought, as well as what Chiffska had mentioned about males is beginning to paint a picture in your mind, something your not quite sure how to feel about. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Your captor suddenly stops, causing you to bump into her back, despite her being rather rough looking for a Skaven she&#039;s still quite a bit smaller than you, only coming up to your chest. Though what really makes your mind screech to a halt is the realization that at some point your body has betrayed you, your manhood apparently taught in its confines after your little...escapade with Chiff. Lo &amp; behold it&#039;s the thing that happens to bump into your captor as well.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The rat-woman turns to you with what your guessing is either surprise or disdain, but she doesn&#039;t bring any attention to your...problem, letting you keep some modicum of pride.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;We waits here, Mistress calls us in when she ready.&quot;  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You must be in front of her room then. And despite the apparent secretiveness of whatever meeting she is currently having, Skaven voices seem not to lend themselves well to whispering.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;We must be moving on soons Mistress! Males wills be scampering down tunnels very soon! Yes Yes!&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;We&#039;s knows! Do not cower so quicklies! Must ensure best prize was worth risk!&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;BAH! Man thing not worth our time! We risk to much, you wa-*THWACK!* </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Quiets! Man thing could be keys to clan becoming strong! To not having to hide in STUPID coward holes, now go! Set up many watches! If males do come we&#039;s be ready!&quot;  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The door to the room flies open, another female running into the hall. The room is alight with a dull green haze, and despite the conversation you&#039;d just heard the situation seems all the more foreboding once again.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Come Krizek! Bring man things in!&quot;  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You&#039;re quickly pulled into the room, the haze giving way to a seemingly more structurally sound hovel of a hole. The walls carved away for warpstone candles of some sort, the ground covered in a mix of fur and carpets. A small altar at the very back where a most recognizable face stands.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Ah very goods, man thing is feeling wells I trusts?&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Krizek unceremoniously dumps you kneeling on a pile of somewhat thicker furs before the Skaven Mistress. Leaving you alone with her as quickly as she came. Yes...without a doubt, this is the one who put you here. White fur, green tinged eyes, long white unkempt hair, and those spindly little claws. Though you also note what appears to be two small horns growing from the side of her head.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Must thank you&#039;s for saving me&#039;s man thing, was SOOO~ heroic in coming to help pretty ladies, Yes yes?&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She pulls a mock swoon as she flutters her eyes, a snaggle toothed grin growing across her face. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Before you can retort, she kneels in front of you, getting eye level...well, about as eye level as these rats can get to you.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Have been looking for VERY longs time for man like you&#039;s. For not WEAK male! Was very worrieds would have to take weaksies human, but no, big strong man things come to me!&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She grabs your face much like Chiffska did, though she seems to be doing so more out of glee then experimentation. Not wanting to be constantly on the back end of the prodding, you decide to cut her eccentrics short. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;What is it you want with me?&quot;  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A part of you feels like you already know the answer for as bothersome as the idea is, but for all you know about Skaven she could very well just want to sacrifice you. Though the eager face she gives as you question her seems to lean more towards your former idea.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Male Skavs no good, hads to work very hard to get where clans is now! Many females free, but NO! Never truly free! Needs to become strongs! Stronger than worthless coward male clans!&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She stands up and walks back towards the altar, seemingly caught up in her own theatrics once again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Have been workings very hard, yes yes, very hards to find right male. To help grow clan, to help becomes strong! But needs to be sures, must test, must make sure is rights!&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She turns back towards you, slowly pulling her grey robe open, revealing her full form underneath.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You allow yourself a small gulp as you witness her full body. For such an apparently aged Skav, she&#039;s certainly not lacking in the female department. Her white fur matting into a chest tuft, hiding two breasts underneath, each giving way to a smaller breast as they descend down her navel. Her tummy looks shaven, and just above her womanhood you recognize a symbol seemingly floating above her womb, a mark of Slaanesh.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yes, your former idea of what was planned for you is all too clear now, and for every part of your brain that’s screaming to run, fight, or resist in some way, your body continues to betray you. Though you can&#039;t wholly put the blame upon yourself. The moment the she&#039;d opened her robes, that scent Chiffska was letting off returns, only this time in what feels like a wave of force that zips across your skin, right down to your manhood. Even with your mind fighting to kick any limb into motion, your stuck kneeling, almost gobsmacked as the Skaven Mistress approaches you.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">When she reaches you once again, she pushes you back onto the furs, your cuffed hands falling above your head as she straddles your waist.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I am&#039;s Seltra, and you&#039;s are MINE!&quot;  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She rakes her claws along your chest and abdominals, seemingly delighting in the way your muscles jump in reaction. Her breath growing more ragged as the bulge in your leathers begins to push harder against her nether regions. The scent is overwhelming now, it feels like its replacing the air in your lungs, and between your manhood, and her groping, your not entirely in your right mind anymore.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yesss, very nice, feelings good as Seltra yes yes?&quot;  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She crawls lower and lower, eventually pulling your pants down with her, your manhood finally free of its confines, gives her a bop on the nose, a small &quot;Eep!&quot; Escaping her mouth at the surprise. Though the boop is quickly forgotten as she immediately begins to fondle and prod your lower regions.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Haaaahh so bigs, virile, heavy...strong.&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You swear there&#039;s steam coming off your manhood now, or maybe its her breath as she pants over it. Her spindly fingers gripping the shaft, massaging your balls, and pretty much fondling any area that seems to catch her interest. You feel like your losing your mind, but that notion shatters when her long tongue slithers from her mouth, lapping from the bottom to the top of your genitals in one fluid motion. Had to grit your teeth to avoid whatever sound you were about to make on that one.   </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Scent is so thick, taste very good, must see if true for all you&#039;s.&quot;  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You&#039;d have questioned what she was implying were it not for her long tongue snaking around your cock. Her hands gripping your now wrapped shaft as she begins to pump you into her mouth, her tongue acting as both a lubricant and blissful orifice of its own.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">For all your experience, you would like to have thought you were an above average man in terms of sexual prowess. Granted, most of those sexual encounters involved tavern wenches and peasant girls, but the sighs and moans you got from them at least proved some ideal of your own studliness. But this...this you just weren&#039;t ready for, the eager pumping of this rat matron as she tried to get a taste of your spunk, probably intent on having you fill her with it afterwards proved a little too much for even your stamina. Though she certainly didn’t seem to mind as you arched back and fired off into her mouth, her happy little squeaks accentuated by her massaging your balls, as if to get even more out of you.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;MMMPHH! MWYESS!&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Seltra arched her head back, gulping down your load as if she were without water. Licking the remnants from her fingers as she laughed in that familiar Skav laugh you were starting to get all too comfortable with.   </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Perfects! Yes! Virile, alives, delicious!&quot;  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She looks back down at you, an almost crazed look in her eyes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Is just as Seltra knews. You&#039;s will make clan strong, will breeds me&#039;s full of wonderful ratlings.&quot;  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She cups the symbol above her womb, and despite what Seltra had just done to you, your manhood hadn&#039;t seemingly waned at all, if anything, her claim only made it grow harder, much to your chagrin.   </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yeeeesss will become greats mate, Can sees it now.&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her nethers drag across your manhood, flattening it to your body as she grinds against you. She leans down, your chests now pressed together as she affectionately licks your face with her long tongue, occasionally plunging it into your mouth to wrestle with your own.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">To be honest your not quite certain if it was you or her who took the final step, you can only remember the resounding shock of you piercing her, the tightness, the wetness, what felt like a thrum of energy resonating from her womb. You grit your teeth in an attempt to gain control over yourself, whilst Seltra lets free a high-pitched gasp of her own, eyes rolling back in her head. Juding by the rather lewd noises coming from your connection, the old gal is cumming, and from her reaction, you wonder if this is the first time she&#039;s done something like this.   </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I SquEEEeE, Ca-HA!&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Whatever she&#039;s trying to say, she can&#039;t word in her current state, not that it matters much to you, at this point your too far gone to wait for her input. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You reach your chains over her, hugging her taught against your body as you plunge even deeper, receiving another mangled set of pleasured squeaks, and squelching orgasms in return for the effort. The sounds, smells, and feelings all smashing into one another like a furious fever dream.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">For a moment you think she&#039;s going to fall unconscious until she grabs your scalp, arches her back and begins grinding back into your cock, the thrumming energy from her womb now permeating the entirety of her vagina. It&#039;s now your turn to bury your face into the nape of her neck, trying with all your might to fight against the overwhelming pleasure.    </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;INSIDES! CUM INSIDES! NEEDS IT! WANTS IT!&quot;  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The entirety of your lower regions is a sopping mess of sexual fluids now, her orgasms seemingly riding off the backs of one another, soaking you in her scent as she rides you in a maddened state of sexual discourse. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">With one last bout of strength you grab hold of her behind and slam it down onto your manhood to calm her feverish humping if just for a second. This seems to break whatever composure she had left as she lets out an almost ear piercing *SKREEE!* of pleasure. The final contractions of her extended orgasm shocking you into finally releasing inside her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">For a brief moment you actually think you might explode, before everything that had been building up blasts into her deepest regions. It&#039;s hot, for you and her, like everything is melting together. Without a doubt you fill her to brim, the mark of Slaanesh above her womb flaring up as you continue to pump the rat matron full. For a long while the torrent doesn&#039;t stop, the flood of virile semen staining her insides until it overflows out onto the furs you lay upon. You know for certain she&#039;s unconscious now, the occasional squeak peeping from her as another spurt fills her insides.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">With the last few twitches of your manhood you fall back into the makeshift bedding, Seltra laying against you panting, struggling to regain consciousness as her insides still grip and suckle at you.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Your own gasps for air leave a cloud of steam in the already hazy room, your mind &amp; body eventually following her as you to fall into unconsciousness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">___________________________________________________________________________</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You rouse in a far better state than your last awakening, the soft furs on your back and the softer fur of Seltra rubbing against your front, a somewhat more welcome pleasantry then the musty hole of a room you were in some time ago.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">For a moment you&#039;re almost relaxed, but the realization of what you’ve done begins to sink in. Your equal parts disgusted and satisfied with yourself, the presence of your manhood still buried deep in the matron’s nethers a sign of your...activities. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">If Sigmar is watching, your guessing he isn’t too pleased with you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You reach up to rub your face, and as you pinch the bridge of your nose another realization dawns, your manacles have been removed. You assume it’s some sort of trick until you notice the unlocked shackles to your side, did Seltra unchain you? Why? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You look down at the Skaven in question, still very much unconscious if not simply asleep on your chest. She certainly seems rather self-satisfied, a smirk painted across her muzzle. The small voice that has been pestering you about escape is now forefront in your mind, if there ever was a chance, then now is certainly the time. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">With extreme care you slowly maneuver your “lover” onto the fur beddings beneath you, withdrawing your manhood from her with an audible *plop* your shared essence spilling from her as she squirms slightly in her sleeping state, seemingly displeased with the lack of warmth holding her if not inside her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You lean back and take one last look at the female. You want to be enraged, but some deeper part of you is refusing to view the Skav with ire. You shake your head and pull up your pants, you’ve no time for self-introspection. You step away from the sleeping rat and walk towards the door of the room. Pushing your ear to the frame you listen for any sign of movement on the other side, if there’s anything waiting out there it’s not making any noise. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Girding your loins, you push through the doorway as silently as you can. Just as you’d remembered, it’s far too dark to see, but you at least have some inkling of the burrows layout from when you were moved by Krizek. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">With careful steps you begin to make your way through the winding tunnels. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Much like before, you can hear the whispered chatter of female Skaven, it helps in avoiding them as they chitter away, though you still fear for whatever silent ones may be skulking these halls. Eventually you run out of familiar territory, the sound of female Skaven beginning to fade into the distance. With renewed vigor you push further, there must be an exit somewhere!? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">This hope is suddenly crippled as you bump into a furry form in the darkness. Your instincts take over as you grab the Rat, locking its neck in an attempt to muffle whatever alarm it may try to sound. Though it appears to only squirm and curse at you...wait, this doesn’t sound like a female Skav at all, just sounds like one of the males from up top!? You briefly consider questioning him before deciding it’s probably not worth it, snapping the rat&#039;s brittle neck bones with a quick wrench of your arm. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You stare at the now dead Skaven in your grasp, you remember that other female talking about the males possibly pushing into these tunnels. On one hand that means your reaching some form of exit, on the other...your worried, and surprisingly not for yourself. You wonder what will happen if these rats sneak up on the females deeper in, if they manage to get to Seltra... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You’d like to blame your &quot;knightly&quot; training for your “heroic nature” but you get the feeling it’s just an excuse your using to downplay your current decision. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Reaching down you grab the spear the Skaven was carrying, and deciding to make the best of a bad situation, you reaffirm your grip on the dead Skav’s neck, an impromptu shield if nothing else. Armaments in hand, you push deeper into the tunnels, intent on snuffing out what males you come across. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It doesn’t take long for you to make good on this would-be quest. The sound of chittering and scuffling approaching from your front. With nothing to lose you raise your “shield” and march forward. The chittering becomes panicked, though you pay it no heed as you thrust with your spear into whatever rat was unlucky enough to head it&#039;s group. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As the screeching increases so does your flurry, the occasional swing from an attacker taking a chunk from your meat shield. Despite the darkness the noise is telling for where and what you need to hit, that and the gore spewing onto your body from the onslaught of ratmen trying to push you back. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Eventually your shoddy spear breaks, prompting you to lean down and swipe a blade from one of the now many dead tunnel fighters. It’s certainly no Imperial sword...but it will do. You throw the corpse shield into the fray, knocking back the Skaven horde as you begin to pull off your best Grimgor impression, planting your feet on either side of the tunnel and bracing for the coming impact. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">With all your might you slice into the first line with a satisfying *LOP!* the screeching of injured ratmen filling your ears. Despite the tunnel being their preferred fighting grounds, it still gives you the benefit of only having to kill a few at any one moment. Which certainly serves you well as they continue to pile atop one another in an attempt to get at you, only to be met with death as you carve through them. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The maddening chorus of screeching and gore begins to die down as the bodies stack up. Pushing ever deeper into the cavern, you cut down the occasional straggler until finally reaching what seems to be an intersection of sorts. Dirt walls giving way to cobblework stone and rotten wood. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The sounds of fighting are now silent, though you could still hear the occasional chitter from the side tunnels. More important however was the light. Small holes in the ceiling revealed what you assumed was the surface, streaks of light reaching down into the central chamber. You were close now, to freedom...of some sort. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As you walk forward into the chamber, you notice a dull green light coming from the opposite tunnel. You quickly duck behind a busted support column, barely disappearing from view as a rather well armored storm vermin enters the room. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Man things that way! Kill many slave rats! Yes yes!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A clan rat runs past you into the tunnel, followed closely behind by the storm vermin. You briefly consider letting him pass, but whatever will has been pushing you to fight so far spurs you into action once again, as you pounce atop the Skaven! He lets out a screech of surprise as you attempt to stab your blade into his throat, but with all his thrashing you only manage to jam the jagged sword into his shoulder. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">With a rather impressive heave he tosses you off, sending you sliding into the dirt. Looking up at the Skav, he certainly doesn’t seem to happy. The clan rat from before having returned, looking ready to flee again should the situation call for it.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“MAN FLESH! We KILLS you!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">He wrenches the blade from his shoulder and tosses it to the ground, drawing a rather intimidating halberd from his back in the process. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Not one to rest on your laurels you jolt from the ground, darting past the storm vermin as he swings just above your head. Realizing you won’t be having much luck trying to punch him to death, you make a grab for the clan rat, the smaller Skav blurting out a rather pathetic *Eee!* as you toss him at the halberd wielding soldier. Both fall to the ground as you rush for the halberd!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You heft it just in time as the vermin pushes the clan rat from atop him. Only to be met with the business end of the pike as you pierce his skull through his mouth. You stand atop the now dead Skaven, the adrenaline still pumping through your veins, so much so that you don’t even notice the other rat run off screaming. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As you come down from your battle high, you look around the room once more, your eyes returning to the light pouring from the ceiling. You could run, get back to the city! But was the city ok? What about those strange female Skaven? The one you’d...become acquainted with. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As you stewed over your decision, the sound of many overlapping footsteps, or perhaps pawsteps could be heard from the tunnel leading to the female burrow. You prepare for battle again until you hear a familiar voice screech from the darkness. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Man things!? You’s ok?! Man thing!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A rather out of breath looking Krizek emerges from the darkness, the look on her face a mix of confusion and surprise as she locks eyes on you.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“M-man thing?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You come to the realization that you probably don’t look the best, what with being covered in gore, sweat, dirt, and holding the halberd of a recently slain storm vermin. Though the look of fear and perhaps...impressed adoration you get from the brawny female is something to appreciate. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The rest of the group reveals itself soon after, more female warriors, most likely in the same vain as Krizek, though it’s not them your interested in. Pushing through them is Seltra, a look of relief overcoming her as she walks past Krizek to stand before you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Ohh thanksies chaotic ones you’s is well my prize! Was very much worrieds...Though am thinking I shouldnt have beens.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She looks down at the dead vermin then back to you with a smile. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yes, as strong as we knews you weres, males standed no chance yes?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You shift uncomfortably in your spot, unsure how to feel about the matron addressing you with praise like your good friends. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You try to run, but you fight malesies yes? Could have escaped, but you no wants them to hurt precious ratlings hmm?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She puts her hand over yours, your grip on the halberd loosening slightly. It does occur to you that she could certainly be pregnant after what you’d done together... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Is knows you are the one, you’s HAS to be! Will helps us, will becomes greatest clan father.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She takes your free hand in hers, placing it on her belly. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Dark ones promised it, knews it, fortolds it. A powerful man thing to free us from our weak chains. I knows it’s you, MUST be you’s!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You drop the halberd, uncertain as to why, but not resisting as she takes your now empty hand in hers. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Will shows you, for you’s will become greater than any other man things! Will grow with us, will be mines, will be...ours.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Whatever voices within your mind that had been screaming for you to fight, run, resist, are all silent now. And as Seltra pulls you into the shadow of the tunnels, the light fading away behind you, your uncertain how to describe the feelings welling up inside your chest. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Regardless of it all, you accept whatever fate may come, be it the will of Sigmar, Chaos, or the obsessive machinations of Seltra herself. The rest of the female menagerie falls in beside you, Seltra turning around and leading you by the hand. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The time to turn back is gone, nowhere left to go but forward.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">___________________________________________________________________________</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The darkness of the tunnels seems all the more consuming now. Though Seltra’s hand in yours gives some comfort, at least in knowing your not gonna to be doin anymore fighting for some time. The sounds of ratty footsteps picks up all around you, but judging by the state of non-panic you assume it’s only more females. They must be gathering up, leaving? But to where? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Come sisters, callsies others quicklies! We must be goings! Takes all treasures, we returns home!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The sudden order from Seltra sends the group scuttling, chippers and squeaks from further voices indicating that the message is getting around. Your heading...home? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You walk along in march step with the clan now, the tunnels winds and turns eventually becoming too much to remember as you simply choose to follow the lead of Seltra. However, as time wears on you notice light beginning to break through small cracks in the walls. Are you going towards the surface? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The answer comes fast, a burst of light making you recoil along with many of the other rats. Krizek having apparently kicked open a hatch leading topside. You stand agape before the exit, Skaven walking past you as they climb up to the surface, you look to Seltra as she grins and simply tugs you along. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You almost want to kiss the ground, for as muddy and pathetic as the soil is, it’s still what your used to. The Skaven on the other hand certainly seem out of their element, looking around in suspicion of their surroundings. Eventually more of the group emerges from the underground, and only then do you realize how big the contingent was, a small armies worth of females huddling together as they clamor for a “safe” spot in the gathering. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Is small hordes, but home holds many mores!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You recognize the rat who spoke as Chiffska, the lithe Skaven female who “introduced” you to the clan. In the light she’s certainly far less intimidating, though she still holds herself in a haughty cocked hip stance, that mocking tone of voice overcoming everything she says. As you look Chiffska over, your eyes are drawn to what’s behind her. The city in the distance, plumes of smoke rising from within it. Chiffska looks over her shoulder with a frown before turning back to you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Have no worries man thing, malesies lost, would not have comes scabbering down tunnels if theys won hmm?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You admit, it does make you feel somewhat better knowing the city is safe, or at the very least not completely overrun. As the rest of the females finally arrive you all begin moving en masse, from the direction your heading it seems like you&#039;ll be hitting the forest soon enough. You really don’t like the idea of running into wood elves right now, but if you’ve come this far you might as well keep going... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The journey is long but surprisingly quiet, the “small” group of skavs is quite skilled at slinking around, even with their numbers and the relatively open area you swear you can see a few of them disappearing only to reappear a few moments later. They&#039;re certainly a stealthy bunch you’ll give em that. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The forest isn&#039;t as dense as you’d expected, but your fears aren’t exactly eschewed. Regardless, the party continues moving in, warrior rats scanning the tree line every which way for danger. As you march ever deeper you spot a small river flowing amongst the growth. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Sisters! We stops for small bits! Rest quicklies!”  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The clan scatters, some taking scouting posts up in the trees whilst others simply plop down next to the stream. Looking down at yourself, still covered in blood, dirt, and other...fluids. You decide it’d be best to clean yourself off whilst you have the chance. The water is cold, but fresh. Without hesitation you dunk into the shallow stream. The female skavs all stare at you like your mad, but you choose to ignore them as you begin scrubbing yourself clean. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Man things is strange...” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Krizek almost comes off like a scolding mother from the riverbank. And for all your mixed emotions you can’t hold yourself back from splashing some water in her direction. The scared *REEE!* you get in return is all to satisfying. The other females falling over in laughter at the sight. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You also can’t help but chuckle till you hear another *Sploosh* Turning to the noise it appears Chiffska has decided to join you, a strange sentiment considering how the other females treat the water. Though from how shakily she walks towards you she certainly cant be used to this. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“M-man things is help Chiffska get c-c-cleans to?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You snort another laugh before reaching out to grab the shivering rat, her small squeak of surprise is damned near cute, and for all her haughtiness, she can’t pretend to be bigger or better than you in this situation. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You cup a handful of water over her head. At first she seems afraid, but she quickly becomes all too happy with the process as you begin to scrub her down as you best you can. She isn’t exactly dirty by Skaven standards but you figure she didn’t really come in here with you to get clean. The “audience” on the shoreline having gone silent as they watch you massage the gutter runners’ fur. She’s sighing and you swear purring as you begin to reach her lower half. But wherever your little bath was going is cut short as Seltra speaks up from the bank. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“No more funs for nowsies Chiffska. We must be movings again!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You withdraw your hands from a rather disappointed looking Chiffska, the Skav letting out a small huff as she crawls out of the water. Though before you’re able to leave yourself something made of cloth smacks you square in the face. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Gets dressed Man things!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The gruff order from Krizek is punctuated by her plopping your boots on the grass. Hey, your gear! Has she had it the whole time?! Well, it’s not your whole set, but it’s certainly better then walking around in nothing but your leathers that’s for certain. You leave the river and clothe yourself in what little gear is returned to you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Come, we be goings now. Prize, follow closelies!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Seltra is still wearing her signature grin as you come to walk beside her, the group once again skulking through the trees in little time. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“How far is this home of yours?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Seltra is taken aback by your voice, and to be fair you haven’t been very talkative, but she quickly returns to her normal self as she answers. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Is small ways, but hidden wells, yes yes! Great old elfsies magics hides it. Was shown by dark ones wheres it be. Homes for all lost and new females, and soons be your homesies to!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The last statement seems to excite her, and to be honest your quite interested in seeing this apparent old elf-ruin turned Skaven den as well. The trek is quiet but filled with caution. You wish you had some form of weapon but your guessing Krizek still doesn’t trust you enough to give you the rest of your equipment back. Regardless you do eventually reach this apparent “elven burrow.” The entrance certainly isn’t what you expected. It’s as if walking through a thick haze, one moment it’s all empty woods, the next your standing before ancient ruins. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“We’s here!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Seltra tugs you inside, the light once again fading away behind you as you follow her ever deeper into the ruins. Though this time the tunnels are actually made of carved stone, rather than rotten wood or packed dirt, so it’s certainly far more bearable if nothing else. Eventually you reach what appears to be a large gate or doorway, set deep within the stonework of the ancient tunnels.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Beholds my most precious!Taproot!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The gates swing open! Revealing a rather daunting sight on the other side. What appears to be an entire city, almost comparable in size to the township you were defending not long ago, though the architecture and colors of the place are beyond what you’d ever known. Houses hanging from the ceiling, walkways upon walkways all criss-crossing one another, creating a spiderweb of roads amongst the chaos. Complexes of carts carrying warpstone, ores, and other strange relics fly by at random intervals. All of it melded into the elven stonework, a veritable perversion of beauty and madness. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Is amazings, yes yes?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You have to admit it’s quite impressive, and you note once again that it seems to be populated almost entirely by females from what you can see, but there must be some males around if they have this many Skaven right? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Come, we goes rest, have much to speaks about hmm?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The traveling warband of females parts ways, each heading off into the city at their leisure, save for Krizek who throws a rather heavy bag into your arms before lumbering off. You grunt a thanks in her direction before looking in the bag, as you’d expected it’s your gear, or at least most of it you hope. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Without further distractions you tag along with Seltra, the eager seer babbling on about how much you’ll love her home and how everything is great and going perfect. It’s an almost somber moment all things considered, the whole situation feels damned close to normal...but only close. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">After going up a rather uncomfortably shoddy elevator you reach her den and your new apparent “home.” It’s not bad all things considered, mostly because it’s built primarily into a large Elvish structure, but hey, semantics. The inside is certainly Seltra however. Furs of strange creatures, altars and religious icons of every sort, tomes, texts, and papers filled with Sigmar knows what, and of course a bed that looks like it’s been scrapped together by someone that’s ritualistically sacrificed a dozen other comfy beds in order to create the biggest comfiest bed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Seltra herself almost skips over to a large central fur rug where she plops down, patting beside her as a sign for you to come sit. Placing your bag and greaves near the entrance you join her. Coming to rest beside the female clan leader you smell that same musky haze in the air, her room having the same green lit candles and smoke it did back in the cave when you first...”met.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Is hopes you likes it, wantsies you’s to be very comfortable, will be havings many duties here, but togethers we’s will surely succeed!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Once again she alludes to some great scheme or perhaps destiny she has planned for you, but your still in the dark on what this is all is, what you actually mean to this crazy in love greyseer of a Skaven woman. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I suppose nows the time to ask. What is this...plan, you have for me? Why go through all the trouble? Why not some other male? Why all the females? Why all of...this.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You gesture to the lower city from a window, Seltra taking a serious expression as she mulls over your questions. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Is...very many things, but we’s should starts from beginnings.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She reaches over to one of the altars and pulls what looks like a necklace with an icon of Chaos undivided hanging from it. She hands the chain to you and for a moment you fear it’s going to burn your hand, but it simply feels like cold metal in your palm. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Was borns in deep dark pits of male blight, to screamings hordes of brothers and sisters, from rotten corpsies of broken mother.

A giftsies from Dark Mother, for Horned One feels no loves for ANY female!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She spits to the side to emphasize her words. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Old male rats take this one, teach me’s words, teach me to fears Horned Rat, teach me...but hates me, fears me, not knows whats to do with me’s.

Froms runtlings to clan!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She waves her hand over the window, the backdrop of the city in the distance. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Much works, much times, many difficulties, but we’s gets stronger...but can only gets so strong, malesies cannots be swayed, slaves are to weaks and worthless for breedings!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She turns back to you, looking directly into your eyes. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Dark Mother helpsies again, marks me’s as chosen mother, but says I must findsies perfect mate, strong mate, chosen father!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She reaches forward and grasps your hand. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Anothers voice, this one...Growling, burnings, ANGRY! Tells me where I must goes, what I must sees and finds. A man things, strongs and unbreakings, midsts of chaos and wars!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You gulp down a lump in your throat. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“And finds you’s...Killings males like runts, protecting females with strength.

The half-lidded sultry expression on the seer’s face awakening that same instinct inside you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Do you’s wants this my prize?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She pulls open her robe, her body almost...Fuller then before, more supple and round. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Do you wants Sel-MMmph!?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You blame the sultry Skav in your mind for doing this to you, a few days ago you’d have reviled at the thought of laying with a rat, but now your body was raging to have yet another taste of what you’d been given before, and judging by her reaction it was certainly mutual. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“YEZ! MMmmph, Oos Mwah! Bodies as wishies mate!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It wasn’t easy kissing a gal with such a pointy snout, but between her tongue and eagerness you were both making it work. The heat dancing across your skin giving way to sweat as Seltra pulls your shirt from your chest, once again leaving you in a rather familiar position, only this time you were free to do as you willed rather than just lying back and receiving. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You lift the matron from the rug and toss her upon the bed, her eager sighs and moans mixing with the occasional giggle as she attempts to strike some form of sexy pose for you. Your manhood feels like it could rip free of its confines all its own, and you briefly consider that this rat may have actually gotten you addicted to her body somehow. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Your own libido silences these thoughts, if she wanted to get you hooked on her then you’d simply have to pay her in kind. Standing at the edge of the bed you slam both your hands on the bedding either side of Seltra’s head, her giggles cutting off to high pitched moans as you lean down to bite one of her ears, grinding your engorged bulge into her soaked crotch. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“P-please mates, please takes Seltra agains! Hah! Marks me’s as most precious.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">All too eager to oblige her you rip what little coverings she still had away, her legs coming up to pin you to her as she grabs for your pants, wrenching the front of them down to reveal your cock. It almost feels heavier now, both in the shaft and balls, you once again silently blame Seltra for this corruption of your body, who seems to be having the time of her life at the moment. The greyseer is pumping your cock with one hand and rubbing herself with the other, occasionally taking some of the juices from her own nethers to moisten your already heated manhood. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Your faces are close, sharing steaming breath for a short moment before pushing your lips together in what feels like an almost romantic kiss. You reach down and grab your mates’ thighs, pulling her closer to the bed’s edge as you pull your shaft free from her grasp, the sticky fluids of her nethers squelching as you begin pumping your now turgid cock over the lips of her womanhood. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“NEEDS! Mwah! Needs insides! Mmn! Pwease!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You can’t deny her, let alone your own body any longer, pulling back one last time you thrust forward into her heat. The slick walls of her vagina almost sucking you in, her internal muscles eagerly gripping and massaging your cock as she howls in pleasure, the shaking of her hips, and twitching of her insides signaling her immediate orgasm. The sounds alone are getting to you, between her *Squueees!* and the wet slapping sounds of your connection, you have to grit your teeth just to avoid losing yourself to the pleasure immediately. After all, you’d promised yourself to make this rat woman just as addicted to you as you were now to her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">With your steel grip still pinning her thighs, you lift her legs into a mating press position, the poor gal only managing to sputter out a sound of confusion before you wrench back once again to hammer her insides. *EEEEeEe!* Seltra arches her back, her head turning up as she screams to the heavens in pleasure! With your new position, you can feel the kiss of her womb, that same tingling sensation pulsing through you, only amplified by your mates orgasms and pelvic shaking. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I G-Nyaha! Feeeel GAH! NYOooo!” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her incoherent babbling mixes with your own grunts and growls. Every thrust of your manhood causing a shivering shock to run up from her crotch to her head, answered in turn by another bout of gibberish and squelching orgasms. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It’s an empowering feeling to see the Skav so utterly reduced to a drooling mess of orgasms and tears as you continue to relentlessly fuck her silly. But for all your amusement the pleasure is still getting to you fast as well, each of your thrusts causing the Slanneshi symbol to flare up, pulsing your cock with energy, as if pushing you forward to fill Seltra to the brim once again. You release her thighs and hug firm to the small of her back, pulling the squirming rat into a tight grip as you bury yourself as deep as you can into her. The resounding *Screee!* echoing across the room as your girth pierces her womb, finally releasing its load as your mate in turn frantically grinds against you, orgasming the whole way. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The cum fills her quickly, hot and virile within her. But even as she overflows you can’t stop. Pulling back once again you continue fucking her into the bed as your ejaculate burns her insides. She passes out and regains consciousness at steady intervals, awakening from her own orgasms only to pass out once again as you relentlessly pump her full, your own orgasms beginning to overlap themselves as the pleasure of filling her overwhelms you as well. She claws into your back, gasping and squeaking in desperation for air, her body eventually falling limp, energy sapped from your endless assault, content to let you mark her completely. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">With your remaining vigor you pull free of her heat. Your still pulsing as you leave her insides, the remaining ejaculate covering her belly and face as the last pangs of pleasure course through your body. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Your left panting over her ravaged form. The sound of her breathing hitches every few moments, her body still racking with orgasms even after you’d left her. It’s quite the sight, your combined fluids pouring from her insides, steaming in a pool between her thighs. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">For a brief moment her eyes open again, she can barely focus on you but reaches forward to cup your cheek regardless. Your white knuckle gripping the bedding, your own body shivering from the aftershocks, but even as it’s about to give out you can still feel that same instinct within you, urging you to continue having your way with her. But her hand on your face seems to calm that nerve. You both stare at one another, and for the first time since you’ve met her, Seltra gives you what appears to be a genuine smile. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You reach down and pull her close, flopping down on the bed as you hold her atop you. She muffles a giggle in your chest, and as you hug your lover close, you realize that your smiling as well. It’s a quiet revelation, the thought that your genuinely happy in this moment. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Seltra’s breathing grows calm, so you reach down to pet her head as she nuzzles into the crook of your neck, sighing in content as sleep begins to take her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The room is quiet now, save for your shared breathing, and the sounds of the city. You mull over what Seltra had told you beforehand, the apparent machinations of the dark gods of chaos, what they had told her, what she had hoped for. It’s something that would make most men roil in fear, but in this moment you are calm, a sign that you’ve lost yourself completely, or that you had a stouter will then most. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Despite it all you did know one thing, you weren’t the man you were back in the Empire, or at least, you’d grown into something else entirely. But as sleep overtakes you, you hold your little guide into madness close. If this were destiny or manipulation so be it, for all your humanity you couldn’t deny one thing...you’d grown to care for this Skaven.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">________________________________________________________________________________</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The morning, or at least what felt like morning, came with a churning growl in your stomach. You answered your body with a groan, though hunger aside, this was a far better awakening then you were used to. Back in the Empire you&#039;d only had your small cot and a splitting headache to wake up to, the soft matron in your arms on the other hand was something you were certainly coming to enjoy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You ponder leaving her to rest, but considering your last foray of attempted &quot;escape&quot; you decide it&#039;d be best to wake her up. If not for her help, then at least to not worry her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Seltra grumbles a light *Hissss* as you gently shake her. You can only chuckle in response.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Come on, as much as i&#039;d love to stay like this, I&#039;m fairly certain you haven&#039;t eaten as well.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She grunts and sighs before finally pushing herself up a tad. Flowing white locks tangled all across her body and yours.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Is trues...But still wants to stay likes this for whiles longer, yes yes?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You sigh, and brush your fingers through the grey-seer&#039;s mane of hair. Just a few days ago this rat was your captor, now you were practically a love-sick puppy, though you got the feeling she was in the same boat as you, If not a bit more eager &amp; willing to embrace said situation. Regardless, if you were going to truly follow this path then you needed to get used to it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Can&#039;t help the clan from bed now, hmm?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The hiss you get from her almost sounds like a scoff as she rolls off of you. A blunt *Thump!* coming from the floor beside you as she simply plops on the ground.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Ecch! Worldsies can wait...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That actually gets a laugh from you, and Seltra seems excited that your happy for once. Walking with renewed pep, she throws on her robe before tossing your garments at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Comes, I showsies home to mate, explain many plans, yes yes?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You push your body from the bed, throwing on your clothes and pausing as you pick up the chain necklace, the symbol of chaos undivided upon it. Seltra had given it to you yesterday, and you were still somewhat off-put by it...But, this WAS a present of sorts from your &quot;Lady&quot; and you weren&#039;t about to scorn it. You place the chain around your neck, it clinks quietly, now sharing a spot with your symbol of Sigmar. They were both light in form, but your spirit still felt oddly heavy...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Regardless, Seltra seems overjoyed at you wearing it, and thats enough to wash away the negative emotions. She grabs your hand and your off into the city proper.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You feel like your head&#039;s going to spin, or your eyes, or...something!? This place is a corpus of madness! Seltra however is doing damned dandy! She eagerly points at every building, machine, worker, and wayward explosion, explaining their purpose and reason in a way that you can only half digest. Despite the chaos of it all it&#039;s a rather &quot;fun&quot; experience, the Skaven females crowd around you like a novelty, and you briefly wonder if this is what the Emperor Franz feels like. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As you push through the crowd, Seltra occasionally stopping to explain something to you, or to speak to some random higher ranking Skav. You eventually come across what looks like a large training area of sorts. Rats of all kind look to be in the midst of fighting, though its far from being &quot;regimented&quot; at least compared to the training back in the Empire. The would-be soldiers mostly scrabble and beat on one another in random brawls, only a select few look to be halfway decent when it comes down to it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Chiffska! Krizek!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Seltra calls out to two familiar faces, both marching up to the matron on queue. Well Chiffska actually saunters, but you&#039;re fairly certain Seltra couldn&#039;t care less. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Comes! We eats and speaks.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The &quot;dining hall&quot; if you could even call it that, was a sight in of itself. You&#039;d heard tales of the legendary hunger of Skaven, but frankly, this was a whole nother level. Mysterious hooked meats all searing over open fires, massive cauldrons filled to the brim with bubbling broths, and what you were fairly certain was the corpse of a dragon getting gnawed on by a horde of young ratlings! All things considered...It was only slightly worse then the average Imperial dining hall. Plus with Seltra and her compatriots at your side, you apparently got the &quot;choicest&quot; seating in the room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Whatever the small group that accompanied you was going to speak about was soon forgotten as food was plopped onto the table by the kitchen slaves. For a moment you stared in awe as they tore into it like wild beasts, before your own stomach demanded you sustain it as well. You expected the worst, but truth be told it wasn&#039;t all that bad, undercooked if nothing else, though you made certain to check if any of the meat seemed a bit to &quot;humanoid.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Only after the group was sated did Seltra finally speak up, bopping Krizek on the head with her staff to pull her attention away from a rather succulent bone she was gnawing on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Now! I speaksies to you&#039;s and man things about many plans, so pays attention!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Both of Seltra&#039;s apparent lackies seem to only half pay attention, probably having heard all this before at some point. You on the other hand are taken aback by what Seltra tells you. How you&#039;re to travel to the north-lands and convene with the chaos gods in order to become the Everchosen, how she plans to raise herself to a Vermin-Queen by touching the &quot;Black Pillar&quot; or something of the sort, how with your powers combined you can stop the End-Times....WHAT!?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;WHAT!?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The girls all look at you in surprise.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Is something wrongs with plans chosens one?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Chiffska looks to be holding back a snicker as she says that. You simply ignore her and look to Seltra.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You...Want to stop the End-Times? But isn&#039;t that what the Skaven want to cause? Isn&#039;t that what CHAOS wants to cause!? A-and you want me to....to become!?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Seltra looks almost afraid as you stare her down. The hall is silent and only now do you realize your standing in a rather hostile stance. You shake your head and seat yourself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;m...I&#039;m sorry I-&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;No, is alrights most precious, should have knowns it would be&#039;s most strange soundings. But please, listen, and wills hope to makes it all clear. Yes yes?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You sigh and nod, the room once again returning to it&#039;s chaotic hussle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Dark ones...Are not wholesies themselves...They&#039;s do not thinks or feels like us, they...Feeds.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She waves her hand across the room, gesturing to the Skaven as they continue to feast.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Dark ones want, want chaos, for chaos is what they feeds upon, just as all things feeds upons it.

We stopsies the end, breaks the old prophecy with newsies one! Change worlds for better, yes yes?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Your still parsing it all together in your mind. A short while ago you were thinking that sleeping with this Skaven woman was the craziest thing in your life, now you were sitting here talking about how you were apparently going to change the fortold end of the world by usurping the destiny yourselves. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;It&#039;s just...A lot to take in I suppose.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Seltra places her hand over yours.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;We takes one step of plan at a times.

        <textarea class="textarea">Summary:[NSFW] Set in the Warhammer Fantasy universe, an Imperial footknight is captured by a mysterious Skaven clan. (Uses a first-person perspective from the knights POV) 
________________________________________________________________________________
The throbbing in your head wakes you with its incessant beating, the non-reverberated sound of your groan revealing your lack of armor. You instinctively reach to rub your head only to notice the binding on your arms, the sudden realization of capture clears your head as you look around the room. 

It’s dark, wet, dank...Your in a cave, or a burrow of some ki-wait, burrow, the rats, the Skaven! 

The memories rush back as you recall the slaughter of the battle, an apparent raid by beastmen. But no, these weren’t beastmen, they were something else, you’d only realized far too late. 

You stand at the gates of the township, the screaming and clamoring of the peasants making the already chaotic skirmish even more hectic. You’d quite literally carved a path through the hordes of rats along with your brothers in arms, but the slew of bodies seemed almost minor when compared to the sheer number of Skaven. 

“Gather the townsfolk! Keep a forward guard! Don’t let any of these rats into the central square!” 

The guard captain shouted orders from atop the wall, and as the gate opens into the outer edges of the city, you silently issue a prayer to Sigmar, though a small part of you curses your title of footknight as you march into the front lines of this hell. 

The gate gives way, and the small army of defenders pushes forward, killing innumerable amounts of Skaven as they rush to escape the overrun city. Some peasants simply run away screaming, abandoning the crowd in favor of themselves. Through the hordes, you glimpse a small group of what appears to be cloaked women running into an alley, a pack of clan rats being led by a rat ogre following behind them. 

Gritting your teeth, you break off from the skirmish and rush the alley, not content to let these rats kill a group of innocents.

It doesn’t take long for you to reach the small contingent of rats, they’ve already backed the women into a corner and you can tell the ogre isn’t winding up for a hug. You quickly draw the blunderbuss from your belt and fire into its back, the resounding CRACK punctuated by the spew of blood &amp; bone is more than enough to send the ogre screeching in pain, turning to you, now very much enraged. 

You waste no time and rush headlong into the Skaven war party, cutting down multiple ratmen in single swings of your sword. As you carve your way towards the rat ogre, it charges through the group, killing many of its own before making a great leap for you! With only seconds to spare you grab hold of a now dead Skaven’s spear and thrust it upwards into the ogres gapping maw! Its own momentum causing even the rather scrappy spear to pierce its skull, leaving the beast dead where it drops. 

The rest of the rats flee as you run forward to the group of civilians. You approach the cloaked woman leading the party, placing your hand on her shoulder and turning back towards the plaza. 

“Get back to the main group! You’ll be safer there! C&#039;mon!” 

A shiver runs up your spine as the woman places her hand on your arm, it’s spindly and clawed, even through thick gloves you can feel it.

“Oh, we’s are very fines now sweets hero.” 

You turn back to the woman in shock, the leader pulling down her hood to reveal the face of a white furred Skaven. 

“Now that we’s found you.” 

Before you can act, a powerful shock courses through your body. Tendrils of electric green energy racing over your armor before knocking you into unconsciousness.

Back to reality you shake your somewhat groggy head. 

Yes, that was it...That’s how you got here, that damned rat tricked you. Or at least partially tricked you? Why were the other Skaven trying to kill her and what you assume were other disguised Skaven? Maybe they mistook them for humans? If that were the case why were they running around disguised in a practical war zone? Why did they take you alive? 

Many questions coursed through your mind but they were all cut short by the sound of a creaking door in the darkness of your “cell.” 

A pair of glowing verminous eyes peers from the darkness, and you brace for what may come. “Ah very goodsies, man thing is awakes, was worried mistress had zapped you to much, yes yes?” You try to give a growl in the direction of the rat, but the squeaking noises you receive in return tells you this rat is only laughing at your plight. “Still very strong, yes yes? Heehee, mistress will be happy!” 

The Skaven approaches ever closer, with your eyes slowly acclimating to the darkness you can now see it’s not the one that put you in this predicament, though it...she, is another female for certain. 

With seemingly little hesitation she reaches to grab your face, turning your head side to side as if to examine you further. As you&#039;re about to tell her off, she pushes her sniffer right into the side of your neck, the mix of a cold wet nose and ticklish whiskers making you jump in surprise. 

*Sniff Sniff* &quot;Heehee, man thing smells goooood, yes yes, much better then dummy males, mmmmnnn.&quot;
Many feelings course through your body, though confusion and curiosity certainly trump most of them. With the female Skav now quite literally straddling you, you can see her clearly. Her fur is coal black, and her body is lithe, small perky breasts and an exposed navel rubbing against your chest acting as more than enough proof of her femininity. She&#039;s wearing a small amount of leather armor and you can see what appears to be a knife tucked away on her belt. 

A brief thought of trying to grab it is cut short as the rat woman rakes her small claws down your shoulders as she begins to fondle your pectorals. 

&quot;Ooooh yes yes! Mistress was right, man thing is very strong!&quot; 

You turn your head down in an attempt to glare at her, only to be met with a shaggy mane of hair in your face. It&#039;s at this moment you notice something else, the scent. A smell is coming off the female, not bad per say but it&#039;s getting to your head, like a pungent sweat or musk. Worse yet, you can feel her fondling continuing to go lower, the rats having apparently stripped you down to nothing but your leggings. 

&quot;Mmmmnnn yeeess, think we&#039;s very much going to likes you&#039;s&quot; 

You begin to grit your teeth as she fingers the edge of your leathers, not exactly mentally prepared to get molested by a rat woman. Though your prayers are seemingly answered as the door to the room once again swings open, now with a blaring torchlight. 

&quot;CHIFFSKA! Mistress wanted man things much times ago!&quot;
___________________________________________________________________________
Your would-be rapist falls off you with a surprised squeak. 

&quot;W-was just seeings if man thing was awake?! Yes Yes!&quot;  

The much larger Skaven enters the room fully, issuing a hiss at the smaller rat woman. Another female, this one with white fur, though she&#039;s wearing some form of scrap iron armor, her body far more built then the one who shocked you. She&#039;s obviously a warrior of some sort, at least by Skaven standards.  

As she pushes past the female apparently named Chiffska, she locks eyes with you before bopping her in the back of the head. Sending the smaller Skav scampering into the hall with an &quot;Eeep!&quot; 

&quot;You! man thing, you come with to see Mistress, comes willingly, or I MAKES you come!&quot;  

To accentuate her point she taps what you assumed was a spear on the ground, though now you realize its actually one of those horrid trapper hooks. Not wanting to deal with a neck full of rusty iron spikes, you let out a grunt and nod at the Skav.   

She wastes no time in unhooking your bindings from the wall, though she still leaves your arms cuffed together as she drags you deeper into the burrow. You once again briefly toy with the idea of escape, but the thought is quelled by your more rational side. You&#039;re Sigmar knows how deep in Skaven territory, in pitch darkness, surrounded by a nigh uncountable force. With begrudging acceptance, you follow your captors lead to wherever she is taking you.  

As you walk you hear Skaven scampering throughout the shanty caves. Some whispering in hushed squeaky tones as you pass by. You note that most of what hear sounds female. The thought, as well as what Chiffska had mentioned about males is beginning to paint a picture in your mind, something your not quite sure how to feel about. 

Your captor suddenly stops, causing you to bump into her back, despite her being rather rough looking for a Skaven she&#039;s still quite a bit smaller than you, only coming up to your chest. Though what really makes your mind screech to a halt is the realization that at some point your body has betrayed you, your manhood apparently taught in its confines after your little...escapade with Chiff. Lo &amp; behold it&#039;s the thing that happens to bump into your captor as well.

The rat-woman turns to you with what your guessing is either surprise or disdain, but she doesn&#039;t bring any attention to your...problem, letting you keep some modicum of pride.  

&quot;We waits here, Mistress calls us in when she ready.&quot;  

You must be in front of her room then. And despite the apparent secretiveness of whatever meeting she is currently having, Skaven voices seem not to lend themselves well to whispering.  

&quot;We must be moving on soons Mistress! Males wills be scampering down tunnels very soon! Yes Yes!&quot; 

&quot;We&#039;s knows! Do not cower so quicklies! Must ensure best prize was worth risk!&quot; 

&quot;BAH! Man thing not worth our time! We risk to much, you wa-*THWACK!* 

&quot;Quiets! Man thing could be keys to clan becoming strong! To not having to hide in STUPID coward holes, now go! Set up many watches! If males do come we&#039;s be ready!&quot;  

The door to the room flies open, another female running into the hall. The room is alight with a dull green haze, and despite the conversation you&#039;d just heard the situation seems all the more foreboding once again.  

&quot;Come Krizek! Bring man things in!&quot;  

You&#039;re quickly pulled into the room, the haze giving way to a seemingly more structurally sound hovel of a hole. The walls carved away for warpstone candles of some sort, the ground covered in a mix of fur and carpets. A small altar at the very back where a most recognizable face stands.  

&quot;Ah very goods, man thing is feeling wells I trusts?&quot; 

Krizek unceremoniously dumps you kneeling on a pile of somewhat thicker furs before the Skaven Mistress. Leaving you alone with her as quickly as she came. Yes...without a doubt, this is the one who put you here. White fur, green tinged eyes, long white unkempt hair, and those spindly little claws. Though you also note what appears to be two small horns growing from the side of her head.  

&quot;Must thank you&#039;s for saving me&#039;s man thing, was SOOO~ heroic in coming to help pretty ladies, Yes yes?&quot; 

She pulls a mock swoon as she flutters her eyes, a snaggle toothed grin growing across her face. 

Before you can retort, she kneels in front of you, getting eye level...well, about as eye level as these rats can get to you.  

&quot;Have been looking for VERY longs time for man like you&#039;s. For not WEAK male! Was very worrieds would have to take weaksies human, but no, big strong man things come to me!&quot; 

She grabs your face much like Chiffska did, though she seems to be doing so more out of glee then experimentation. Not wanting to be constantly on the back end of the prodding, you decide to cut her eccentrics short. 

&quot;What is it you want with me?&quot;  

A part of you feels like you already know the answer for as bothersome as the idea is, but for all you know about Skaven she could very well just want to sacrifice you. Though the eager face she gives as you question her seems to lean more towards your former idea.  

&quot;Male Skavs no good, hads to work very hard to get where clans is now! Many females free, but NO! Never truly free! Needs to become strongs! Stronger than worthless coward male clans!&quot; 

She stands up and walks back towards the altar, seemingly caught up in her own theatrics once again. 

&quot;Have been workings very hard, yes yes, very hards to find right male. To help grow clan, to help becomes strong! But needs to be sures, must test, must make sure is rights!&quot; 

She turns back towards you, slowly pulling her grey robe open, revealing her full form underneath.  

You allow yourself a small gulp as you witness her full body. For such an apparently aged Skav, she&#039;s certainly not lacking in the female department. Her white fur matting into a chest tuft, hiding two breasts underneath, each giving way to a smaller breast as they descend down her navel. Her tummy looks shaven, and just above her womanhood you recognize a symbol seemingly floating above her womb, a mark of Slaanesh.  

Yes, your former idea of what was planned for you is all too clear now, and for every part of your brain that’s screaming to run, fight, or resist in some way, your body continues to betray you. Though you can&#039;t wholly put the blame upon yourself. The moment the she&#039;d opened her robes, that scent Chiffska was letting off returns, only this time in what feels like a wave of force that zips across your skin, right down to your manhood. Even with your mind fighting to kick any limb into motion, your stuck kneeling, almost gobsmacked as the Skaven Mistress approaches you.  

When she reaches you once again, she pushes you back onto the furs, your cuffed hands falling above your head as she straddles your waist.  

&quot;I am&#039;s Seltra, and you&#039;s are MINE!&quot;  

She rakes her claws along your chest and abdominals, seemingly delighting in the way your muscles jump in reaction. Her breath growing more ragged as the bulge in your leathers begins to push harder against her nether regions. The scent is overwhelming now, it feels like its replacing the air in your lungs, and between your manhood, and her groping, your not entirely in your right mind anymore.  

&quot;Yesss, very nice, feelings good as Seltra yes yes?&quot;  

She crawls lower and lower, eventually pulling your pants down with her, your manhood finally free of its confines, gives her a bop on the nose, a small &quot;Eep!&quot; Escaping her mouth at the surprise. Though the boop is quickly forgotten as she immediately begins to fondle and prod your lower regions.  

&quot;Haaaahh so bigs, virile, heavy...strong.&quot; 

You swear there&#039;s steam coming off your manhood now, or maybe its her breath as she pants over it. Her spindly fingers gripping the shaft, massaging your balls, and pretty much fondling any area that seems to catch her interest. You feel like your losing your mind, but that notion shatters when her long tongue slithers from her mouth, lapping from the bottom to the top of your genitals in one fluid motion. Had to grit your teeth to avoid whatever sound you were about to make on that one.   

&quot;Scent is so thick, taste very good, must see if true for all you&#039;s.&quot;  

You&#039;d have questioned what she was implying were it not for her long tongue snaking around your cock. Her hands gripping your now wrapped shaft as she begins to pump you into her mouth, her tongue acting as both a lubricant and blissful orifice of its own.  

For all your experience, you would like to have thought you were an above average man in terms of sexual prowess. Granted, most of those sexual encounters involved tavern wenches and peasant girls, but the sighs and moans you got from them at least proved some ideal of your own studliness. But this...this you just weren&#039;t ready for, the eager pumping of this rat matron as she tried to get a taste of your spunk, probably intent on having you fill her with it afterwards proved a little too much for even your stamina. Though she certainly didn’t seem to mind as you arched back and fired off into her mouth, her happy little squeaks accentuated by her massaging your balls, as if to get even more out of you.  

&quot;MMMPHH! MWYESS!&quot; 

Seltra arched her head back, gulping down your load as if she were without water. Licking the remnants from her fingers as she laughed in that familiar Skav laugh you were starting to get all too comfortable with.   

&quot;Perfects! Yes! Virile, alives, delicious!&quot;  

She looks back down at you, an almost crazed look in her eyes. 

&quot;Is just as Seltra knews. You&#039;s will make clan strong, will breeds me&#039;s full of wonderful ratlings.&quot;  

She cups the symbol above her womb, and despite what Seltra had just done to you, your manhood hadn&#039;t seemingly waned at all, if anything, her claim only made it grow harder, much to your chagrin.   

&quot;Yeeeesss will become greats mate, Can sees it now.&quot; 

Her nethers drag across your manhood, flattening it to your body as she grinds against you. She leans down, your chests now pressed together as she affectionately licks your face with her long tongue, occasionally plunging it into your mouth to wrestle with your own.  

To be honest your not quite certain if it was you or her who took the final step, you can only remember the resounding shock of you piercing her, the tightness, the wetness, what felt like a thrum of energy resonating from her womb. You grit your teeth in an attempt to gain control over yourself, whilst Seltra lets free a high-pitched gasp of her own, eyes rolling back in her head. Juding by the rather lewd noises coming from your connection, the old gal is cumming, and from her reaction, you wonder if this is the first time she&#039;s done something like this.   

&quot;I SquEEEeE, Ca-HA!&quot; 

Whatever she&#039;s trying to say, she can&#039;t word in her current state, not that it matters much to you, at this point your too far gone to wait for her input. 

You reach your chains over her, hugging her taught against your body as you plunge even deeper, receiving another mangled set of pleasured squeaks, and squelching orgasms in return for the effort. The sounds, smells, and feelings all smashing into one another like a furious fever dream.  

For a moment you think she&#039;s going to fall unconscious until she grabs your scalp, arches her back and begins grinding back into your cock, the thrumming energy from her womb now permeating the entirety of her vagina. It&#039;s now your turn to bury your face into the nape of her neck, trying with all your might to fight against the overwhelming pleasure.    

&quot;INSIDES! CUM INSIDES! NEEDS IT! WANTS IT!&quot;  

The entirety of your lower regions is a sopping mess of sexual fluids now, her orgasms seemingly riding off the backs of one another, soaking you in her scent as she rides you in a maddened state of sexual discourse. 

With one last bout of strength you grab hold of her behind and slam it down onto your manhood to calm her feverish humping if just for a second. This seems to break whatever composure she had left as she lets out an almost ear piercing *SKREEE!* of pleasure. The final contractions of her extended orgasm shocking you into finally releasing inside her. 

For a brief moment you actually think you might explode, before everything that had been building up blasts into her deepest regions. It&#039;s hot, for you and her, like everything is melting together. Without a doubt you fill her to brim, the mark of Slaanesh above her womb flaring up as you continue to pump the rat matron full. For a long while the torrent doesn&#039;t stop, the flood of virile semen staining her insides until it overflows out onto the furs you lay upon. You know for certain she&#039;s unconscious now, the occasional squeak peeping from her as another spurt fills her insides.  

With the last few twitches of your manhood you fall back into the makeshift bedding, Seltra laying against you panting, struggling to regain consciousness as her insides still grip and suckle at you.  

Your own gasps for air leave a cloud of steam in the already hazy room, your mind &amp; body eventually following her as you to fall into unconsciousness.
___________________________________________________________________________
You rouse in a far better state than your last awakening, the soft furs on your back and the softer fur of Seltra rubbing against your front, a somewhat more welcome pleasantry then the musty hole of a room you were in some time ago.  

For a moment you&#039;re almost relaxed, but the realization of what you’ve done begins to sink in. Your equal parts disgusted and satisfied with yourself, the presence of your manhood still buried deep in the matron’s nethers a sign of your...activities. 

If Sigmar is watching, your guessing he isn’t too pleased with you. 

You reach up to rub your face, and as you pinch the bridge of your nose another realization dawns, your manacles have been removed. You assume it’s some sort of trick until you notice the unlocked shackles to your side, did Seltra unchain you? Why? 

You look down at the Skaven in question, still very much unconscious if not simply asleep on your chest. She certainly seems rather self-satisfied, a smirk painted across her muzzle. The small voice that has been pestering you about escape is now forefront in your mind, if there ever was a chance, then now is certainly the time. 

With extreme care you slowly maneuver your “lover” onto the fur beddings beneath you, withdrawing your manhood from her with an audible *plop* your shared essence spilling from her as she squirms slightly in her sleeping state, seemingly displeased with the lack of warmth holding her if not inside her. 

You lean back and take one last look at the female. You want to be enraged, but some deeper part of you is refusing to view the Skav with ire. You shake your head and pull up your pants, you’ve no time for self-introspection. You step away from the sleeping rat and walk towards the door of the room. Pushing your ear to the frame you listen for any sign of movement on the other side, if there’s anything waiting out there it’s not making any noise. 

Girding your loins, you push through the doorway as silently as you can. Just as you’d remembered, it’s far too dark to see, but you at least have some inkling of the burrows layout from when you were moved by Krizek. 

With careful steps you begin to make your way through the winding tunnels. 

Much like before, you can hear the whispered chatter of female Skaven, it helps in avoiding them as they chitter away, though you still fear for whatever silent ones may be skulking these halls. Eventually you run out of familiar territory, the sound of female Skaven beginning to fade into the distance. With renewed vigor you push further, there must be an exit somewhere!? 

This hope is suddenly crippled as you bump into a furry form in the darkness. Your instincts take over as you grab the Rat, locking its neck in an attempt to muffle whatever alarm it may try to sound. Though it appears to only squirm and curse at you...wait, this doesn’t sound like a female Skav at all, just sounds like one of the males from up top!? You briefly consider questioning him before deciding it’s probably not worth it, snapping the rat&#039;s brittle neck bones with a quick wrench of your arm. 

You stare at the now dead Skaven in your grasp, you remember that other female talking about the males possibly pushing into these tunnels. On one hand that means your reaching some form of exit, on the other...your worried, and surprisingly not for yourself. You wonder what will happen if these rats sneak up on the females deeper in, if they manage to get to Seltra... 

You’d like to blame your &quot;knightly&quot; training for your “heroic nature” but you get the feeling it’s just an excuse your using to downplay your current decision. 

Reaching down you grab the spear the Skaven was carrying, and deciding to make the best of a bad situation, you reaffirm your grip on the dead Skav’s neck, an impromptu shield if nothing else. Armaments in hand, you push deeper into the tunnels, intent on snuffing out what males you come across. 

It doesn’t take long for you to make good on this would-be quest. The sound of chittering and scuffling approaching from your front. With nothing to lose you raise your “shield” and march forward. The chittering becomes panicked, though you pay it no heed as you thrust with your spear into whatever rat was unlucky enough to head it&#039;s group. 

As the screeching increases so does your flurry, the occasional swing from an attacker taking a chunk from your meat shield. Despite the darkness the noise is telling for where and what you need to hit, that and the gore spewing onto your body from the onslaught of ratmen trying to push you back. 

Eventually your shoddy spear breaks, prompting you to lean down and swipe a blade from one of the now many dead tunnel fighters. It’s certainly no Imperial sword...but it will do. You throw the corpse shield into the fray, knocking back the Skaven horde as you begin to pull off your best Grimgor impression, planting your feet on either side of the tunnel and bracing for the coming impact. 

With all your might you slice into the first line with a satisfying *LOP!* the screeching of injured ratmen filling your ears. Despite the tunnel being their preferred fighting grounds, it still gives you the benefit of only having to kill a few at any one moment. Which certainly serves you well as they continue to pile atop one another in an attempt to get at you, only to be met with death as you carve through them. 

The maddening chorus of screeching and gore begins to die down as the bodies stack up. Pushing ever deeper into the cavern, you cut down the occasional straggler until finally reaching what seems to be an intersection of sorts. Dirt walls giving way to cobblework stone and rotten wood. 

The sounds of fighting are now silent, though you could still hear the occasional chitter from the side tunnels. More important however was the light. Small holes in the ceiling revealed what you assumed was the surface, streaks of light reaching down into the central chamber. You were close now, to freedom...of some sort. 

As you walk forward into the chamber, you notice a dull green light coming from the opposite tunnel. You quickly duck behind a busted support column, barely disappearing from view as a rather well armored storm vermin enters the room. 

“Man things that way! Kill many slave rats! Yes yes!” 

A clan rat runs past you into the tunnel, followed closely behind by the storm vermin. You briefly consider letting him pass, but whatever will has been pushing you to fight so far spurs you into action once again, as you pounce atop the Skaven! He lets out a screech of surprise as you attempt to stab your blade into his throat, but with all his thrashing you only manage to jam the jagged sword into his shoulder. 

With a rather impressive heave he tosses you off, sending you sliding into the dirt. Looking up at the Skav, he certainly doesn’t seem to happy. The clan rat from before having returned, looking ready to flee again should the situation call for it.  

“MAN FLESH! We KILLS you!” 

He wrenches the blade from his shoulder and tosses it to the ground, drawing a rather intimidating halberd from his back in the process. 

Not one to rest on your laurels you jolt from the ground, darting past the storm vermin as he swings just above your head. Realizing you won’t be having much luck trying to punch him to death, you make a grab for the clan rat, the smaller Skav blurting out a rather pathetic *Eee!* as you toss him at the halberd wielding soldier. Both fall to the ground as you rush for the halberd!

You heft it just in time as the vermin pushes the clan rat from atop him. Only to be met with the business end of the pike as you pierce his skull through his mouth. You stand atop the now dead Skaven, the adrenaline still pumping through your veins, so much so that you don’t even notice the other rat run off screaming. 

As you come down from your battle high, you look around the room once more, your eyes returning to the light pouring from the ceiling. You could run, get back to the city! But was the city ok? What about those strange female Skaven? The one you’d...become acquainted with. 

As you stewed over your decision, the sound of many overlapping footsteps, or perhaps pawsteps could be heard from the tunnel leading to the female burrow. You prepare for battle again until you hear a familiar voice screech from the darkness. 

“Man things!? You’s ok?! Man thing!” 

A rather out of breath looking Krizek emerges from the darkness, the look on her face a mix of confusion and surprise as she locks eyes on you.  

“M-man thing?” 

You come to the realization that you probably don’t look the best, what with being covered in gore, sweat, dirt, and holding the halberd of a recently slain storm vermin. Though the look of fear and perhaps...impressed adoration you get from the brawny female is something to appreciate. 

The rest of the group reveals itself soon after, more female warriors, most likely in the same vain as Krizek, though it’s not them your interested in. Pushing through them is Seltra, a look of relief overcoming her as she walks past Krizek to stand before you. 

“Ohh thanksies chaotic ones you’s is well my prize! Was very much worrieds...Though am thinking I shouldnt have beens.” 

She looks down at the dead vermin then back to you with a smile. 

“Yes, as strong as we knews you weres, males standed no chance yes?” 

You shift uncomfortably in your spot, unsure how to feel about the matron addressing you with praise like your good friends. 

“You try to run, but you fight malesies yes? Could have escaped, but you no wants them to hurt precious ratlings hmm?” 

She puts her hand over yours, your grip on the halberd loosening slightly. It does occur to you that she could certainly be pregnant after what you’d done together... 

“Is knows you are the one, you’s HAS to be! Will helps us, will becomes greatest clan father.” 

She takes your free hand in hers, placing it on her belly. 

“Dark ones promised it, knews it, fortolds it. A powerful man thing to free us from our weak chains. I knows it’s you, MUST be you’s!” 

You drop the halberd, uncertain as to why, but not resisting as she takes your now empty hand in hers. 

“Will shows you, for you’s will become greater than any other man things! Will grow with us, will be mines, will be...ours.” 

Whatever voices within your mind that had been screaming for you to fight, run, resist, are all silent now. And as Seltra pulls you into the shadow of the tunnels, the light fading away behind you, your uncertain how to describe the feelings welling up inside your chest. 

Regardless of it all, you accept whatever fate may come, be it the will of Sigmar, Chaos, or the obsessive machinations of Seltra herself. The rest of the female menagerie falls in beside you, Seltra turning around and leading you by the hand. 

The time to turn back is gone, nowhere left to go but forward.
___________________________________________________________________________

The darkness of the tunnels seems all the more consuming now. Though Seltra’s hand in yours gives some comfort, at least in knowing your not gonna to be doin anymore fighting for some time. The sounds of ratty footsteps picks up all around you, but judging by the state of non-panic you assume it’s only more females. They must be gathering up, leaving? But to where? 
  
“Come sisters, callsies others quicklies! We must be goings! Takes all treasures, we returns home!” 
  
The sudden order from Seltra sends the group scuttling, chippers and squeaks from further voices indicating that the message is getting around. Your heading...home? 
  
You walk along in march step with the clan now, the tunnels winds and turns eventually becoming too much to remember as you simply choose to follow the lead of Seltra. However, as time wears on you notice light beginning to break through small cracks in the walls. Are you going towards the surface? 
  
The answer comes fast, a burst of light making you recoil along with many of the other rats. Krizek having apparently kicked open a hatch leading topside. You stand agape before the exit, Skaven walking past you as they climb up to the surface, you look to Seltra as she grins and simply tugs you along. 
  
You almost want to kiss the ground, for as muddy and pathetic as the soil is, it’s still what your used to. The Skaven on the other hand certainly seem out of their element, looking around in suspicion of their surroundings. Eventually more of the group emerges from the underground, and only then do you realize how big the contingent was, a small armies worth of females huddling together as they clamor for a “safe” spot in the gathering. 
  
“Is small hordes, but home holds many mores!” 
  
You recognize the rat who spoke as Chiffska, the lithe Skaven female who “introduced” you to the clan. In the light she’s certainly far less intimidating, though she still holds herself in a haughty cocked hip stance, that mocking tone of voice overcoming everything she says. As you look Chiffska over, your eyes are drawn to what’s behind her. The city in the distance, plumes of smoke rising from within it. Chiffska looks over her shoulder with a frown before turning back to you. 
  
“Have no worries man thing, malesies lost, would not have comes scabbering down tunnels if theys won hmm?” 
  
You admit, it does make you feel somewhat better knowing the city is safe, or at the very least not completely overrun. As the rest of the females finally arrive you all begin moving en masse, from the direction your heading it seems like you&#039;ll be hitting the forest soon enough. You really don’t like the idea of running into wood elves right now, but if you’ve come this far you might as well keep going... 
  
The journey is long but surprisingly quiet, the “small” group of skavs is quite skilled at slinking around, even with their numbers and the relatively open area you swear you can see a few of them disappearing only to reappear a few moments later. They&#039;re certainly a stealthy bunch you’ll give em that. 
  
The forest isn&#039;t as dense as you’d expected, but your fears aren’t exactly eschewed. Regardless, the party continues moving in, warrior rats scanning the tree line every which way for danger. As you march ever deeper you spot a small river flowing amongst the growth. 
  
“Sisters! We stops for small bits! Rest quicklies!”  
 
The clan scatters, some taking scouting posts up in the trees whilst others simply plop down next to the stream. Looking down at yourself, still covered in blood, dirt, and other...fluids. You decide it’d be best to clean yourself off whilst you have the chance. The water is cold, but fresh. Without hesitation you dunk into the shallow stream. The female skavs all stare at you like your mad, but you choose to ignore them as you begin scrubbing yourself clean. 
  
“Man things is strange...” 
  
Krizek almost comes off like a scolding mother from the riverbank. And for all your mixed emotions you can’t hold yourself back from splashing some water in her direction. The scared *REEE!* you get in return is all to satisfying. The other females falling over in laughter at the sight. 
  
You also can’t help but chuckle till you hear another *Sploosh* Turning to the noise it appears Chiffska has decided to join you, a strange sentiment considering how the other females treat the water. Though from how shakily she walks towards you she certainly cant be used to this. 
  
“M-man things is help Chiffska get c-c-cleans to?” 
  
You snort another laugh before reaching out to grab the shivering rat, her small squeak of surprise is damned near cute, and for all her haughtiness, she can’t pretend to be bigger or better than you in this situation. 
  
You cup a handful of water over her head. At first she seems afraid, but she quickly becomes all too happy with the process as you begin to scrub her down as you best you can. She isn’t exactly dirty by Skaven standards but you figure she didn’t really come in here with you to get clean. The “audience” on the shoreline having gone silent as they watch you massage the gutter runners’ fur. She’s sighing and you swear purring as you begin to reach her lower half. But wherever your little bath was going is cut short as Seltra speaks up from the bank. 
  
“No more funs for nowsies Chiffska. We must be movings again!” 
  
You withdraw your hands from a rather disappointed looking Chiffska, the Skav letting out a small huff as she crawls out of the water. Though before you’re able to leave yourself something made of cloth smacks you square in the face. 
  
“Gets dressed Man things!” 
  
The gruff order from Krizek is punctuated by her plopping your boots on the grass. Hey, your gear! Has she had it the whole time?! Well, it’s not your whole set, but it’s certainly better then walking around in nothing but your leathers that’s for certain. You leave the river and clothe yourself in what little gear is returned to you. 
  
“Come, we be goings now. Prize, follow closelies!” 
  
Seltra is still wearing her signature grin as you come to walk beside her, the group once again skulking through the trees in little time. 
  
“How far is this home of yours?” 
  
Seltra is taken aback by your voice, and to be fair you haven’t been very talkative, but she quickly returns to her normal self as she answers. 
  
“Is small ways, but hidden wells, yes yes! Great old elfsies magics hides it. Was shown by dark ones wheres it be. Homes for all lost and new females, and soons be your homesies to!” 
  
The last statement seems to excite her, and to be honest your quite interested in seeing this apparent old elf-ruin turned Skaven den as well. The trek is quiet but filled with caution. You wish you had some form of weapon but your guessing Krizek still doesn’t trust you enough to give you the rest of your equipment back. Regardless you do eventually reach this apparent “elven burrow.” The entrance certainly isn’t what you expected. It’s as if walking through a thick haze, one moment it’s all empty woods, the next your standing before ancient ruins. 
  
“We’s here!” 
  
Seltra tugs you inside, the light once again fading away behind you as you follow her ever deeper into the ruins. Though this time the tunnels are actually made of carved stone, rather than rotten wood or packed dirt, so it’s certainly far more bearable if nothing else. Eventually you reach what appears to be a large gate or doorway, set deep within the stonework of the ancient tunnels.” 
  
“Beholds my most precious!Taproot!” 
  
The gates swing open! Revealing a rather daunting sight on the other side. What appears to be an entire city, almost comparable in size to the township you were defending not long ago, though the architecture and colors of the place are beyond what you’d ever known. Houses hanging from the ceiling, walkways upon walkways all criss-crossing one another, creating a spiderweb of roads amongst the chaos. Complexes of carts carrying warpstone, ores, and other strange relics fly by at random intervals. All of it melded into the elven stonework, a veritable perversion of beauty and madness. 
  
“Is amazings, yes yes?” 
  
You have to admit it’s quite impressive, and you note once again that it seems to be populated almost entirely by females from what you can see, but there must be some males around if they have this many Skaven right? 
  
“Come, we goes rest, have much to speaks about hmm?” 
  
The traveling warband of females parts ways, each heading off into the city at their leisure, save for Krizek who throws a rather heavy bag into your arms before lumbering off. You grunt a thanks in her direction before looking in the bag, as you’d expected it’s your gear, or at least most of it you hope. 
  
Without further distractions you tag along with Seltra, the eager seer babbling on about how much you’ll love her home and how everything is great and going perfect. It’s an almost somber moment all things considered, the whole situation feels damned close to normal...but only close. 
  
After going up a rather uncomfortably shoddy elevator you reach her den and your new apparent “home.” It’s not bad all things considered, mostly because it’s built primarily into a large Elvish structure, but hey, semantics. The inside is certainly Seltra however. Furs of strange creatures, altars and religious icons of every sort, tomes, texts, and papers filled with Sigmar knows what, and of course a bed that looks like it’s been scrapped together by someone that’s ritualistically sacrificed a dozen other comfy beds in order to create the biggest comfiest bed. 
  
Seltra herself almost skips over to a large central fur rug where she plops down, patting beside her as a sign for you to come sit. Placing your bag and greaves near the entrance you join her. Coming to rest beside the female clan leader you smell that same musky haze in the air, her room having the same green lit candles and smoke it did back in the cave when you first...”met.” 
  
“Is hopes you likes it, wantsies you’s to be very comfortable, will be havings many duties here, but togethers we’s will surely succeed!” 
  
Once again she alludes to some great scheme or perhaps destiny she has planned for you, but your still in the dark on what this is all is, what you actually mean to this crazy in love greyseer of a Skaven woman. 
  
“I suppose nows the time to ask. What is this...plan, you have for me? Why go through all the trouble? Why not some other male? Why all the females? Why all of...this.” 
  
You gesture to the lower city from a window, Seltra taking a serious expression as she mulls over your questions. 
  
“Is...very many things, but we’s should starts from beginnings.” 
  
She reaches over to one of the altars and pulls what looks like a necklace with an icon of Chaos undivided hanging from it. She hands the chain to you and for a moment you fear it’s going to burn your hand, but it simply feels like cold metal in your palm. 
  
“Was borns in deep dark pits of male blight, to screamings hordes of brothers and sisters, from rotten corpsies of broken mother. But hads been born differents, furs of white and horns upon me’s head, a giftsies from Horned Rat? NO! A giftsies from Dark Mother, for Horned One feels no loves for ANY female!” 
  
She spits to the side to emphasize her words. 
  
“Old male rats take this one, teach me’s words, teach me to fears Horned Rat, teach me...but hates me, fears me, not knows whats to do with me’s. Was of no matter, for Dark Mother she whispered, told me’s of truths, showing of whats they dids to mothers, sisters, kins!” 
  
Flares of sparking green energy pulse from Seltra as she gets angrier. 
  
“Dark Mother bless me’s with power, and with powers I escape, I finds NEW home, and thens newsies voice comes! Silent voice, coldsies voice, tells me secrets, tells me plans, tells me hows to bring...change.” 
  
She clacks her claws together, a more scheming look coming over her. 
  
“Free more sisters, grow homes bigger, we goes from hiding to fightings! Froms runtlings to clan!” 
  
She waves her hand over the window, the backdrop of the city in the distance. 
  
“Much works, much times, many difficulties, but we’s gets stronger...but can only gets so strong, malesies cannots be swayed, slaves are to weaks and worthless for breedings!” 
  
She turns back to you, looking directly into your eyes. 
  
“Dark Mother helpsies again, marks me’s as chosen mother, but says I must findsies perfect mate, strong mate, chosen father!” 
  
She reaches forward and grasps your hand. 
  
“Anothers voice, this one...Growling, burnings, ANGRY! Tells me where I must goes, what I must sees and finds. A man things, strongs and unbreakings, midsts of chaos and wars!” 
  
You gulp down a lump in your throat. 
  
“And finds you’s...Killings males like runts, protecting females with strength. In caves, you’s lays with Seltra and sires brood, burning and proud! Fight aways malesies once again, stands besides females, Warrior! Mates! Chosen Father!” 
  
Seltra is flush against you now, pushing your hand against the mark upon on her womb. 
  
“Was all trues, dark ones guide Seltra so far, give everythings...gives me you’s.” 
  
She strokes her claws through your hair. 
  
“But do not just wants giftsies, wants mates, wants love, wants you’s to wants Seltra, to wants females, to brings forths new age willingly...to fathers many rattlings happily.” 
  
There’s that scent again, rushing to your head like a bolt of lightning. The half-lidded sultry expression on the seer’s face awakening that same instinct inside you. 
  
“Do you’s wants this my prize?” 
  
She pulls open her robe, her body almost...Fuller then before, more supple and round. 
  
“Do you wants Sel-MMmph!?” 
  
You blame the sultry Skav in your mind for doing this to you, a few days ago you’d have reviled at the thought of laying with a rat, but now your body was raging to have yet another taste of what you’d been given before, and judging by her reaction it was certainly mutual. 
  
“YEZ! MMmmph, Oos Mwah! Bodies as wishies mate!” 
  
It wasn’t easy kissing a gal with such a pointy snout, but between her tongue and eagerness you were both making it work. The heat dancing across your skin giving way to sweat as Seltra pulls your shirt from your chest, once again leaving you in a rather familiar position, only this time you were free to do as you willed rather than just lying back and receiving. 
  
You lift the matron from the rug and toss her upon the bed, her eager sighs and moans mixing with the occasional giggle as she attempts to strike some form of sexy pose for you. Your manhood feels like it could rip free of its confines all its own, and you briefly consider that this rat may have actually gotten you addicted to her body somehow. 
  
Your own libido silences these thoughts, if she wanted to get you hooked on her then you’d simply have to pay her in kind. Standing at the edge of the bed you slam both your hands on the bedding either side of Seltra’s head, her giggles cutting off to high pitched moans as you lean down to bite one of her ears, grinding your engorged bulge into her soaked crotch. 
  
“P-please mates, please takes Seltra agains! Hah! Marks me’s as most precious.” 
  
All too eager to oblige her you rip what little coverings she still had away, her legs coming up to pin you to her as she grabs for your pants, wrenching the front of them down to reveal your cock. It almost feels heavier now, both in the shaft and balls, you once again silently blame Seltra for this corruption of your body, who seems to be having the time of her life at the moment. The greyseer is pumping your cock with one hand and rubbing herself with the other, occasionally taking some of the juices from her own nethers to moisten your already heated manhood. 
  
Your faces are close, sharing steaming breath for a short moment before pushing your lips together in what feels like an almost romantic kiss. You reach down and grab your mates’ thighs, pulling her closer to the bed’s edge as you pull your shaft free from her grasp, the sticky fluids of her nethers squelching as you begin pumping your now turgid cock over the lips of her womanhood. 
  
“NEEDS! Mwah! Needs insides! Mmn! Pwease!” 
  
You can’t deny her, let alone your own body any longer, pulling back one last time you thrust forward into her heat. The slick walls of her vagina almost sucking you in, her internal muscles eagerly gripping and massaging your cock as she howls in pleasure, the shaking of her hips, and twitching of her insides signaling her immediate orgasm. The sounds alone are getting to you, between her *Squueees!* and the wet slapping sounds of your connection, you have to grit your teeth just to avoid losing yourself to the pleasure immediately. After all, you’d promised yourself to make this rat woman just as addicted to you as you were now to her. 
  
With your steel grip still pinning her thighs, you lift her legs into a mating press position, the poor gal only managing to sputter out a sound of confusion before you wrench back once again to hammer her insides. *EEEEeEe!* Seltra arches her back, her head turning up as she screams to the heavens in pleasure! With your new position, you can feel the kiss of her womb, that same tingling sensation pulsing through you, only amplified by your mates orgasms and pelvic shaking. 
  
“I G-Nyaha! Feeeel GAH! NYOooo!” 
  
Her incoherent babbling mixes with your own grunts and growls. Every thrust of your manhood causing a shivering shock to run up from her crotch to her head, answered in turn by another bout of gibberish and squelching orgasms. 
  
It’s an empowering feeling to see the Skav so utterly reduced to a drooling mess of orgasms and tears as you continue to relentlessly fuck her silly. But for all your amusement the pleasure is still getting to you fast as well, each of your thrusts causing the Slanneshi symbol to flare up, pulsing your cock with energy, as if pushing you forward to fill Seltra to the brim once again. You release her thighs and hug firm to the small of her back, pulling the squirming rat into a tight grip as you bury yourself as deep as you can into her. The resounding *Screee!* echoing across the room as your girth pierces her womb, finally releasing its load as your mate in turn frantically grinds against you, orgasming the whole way. 
  
The cum fills her quickly, hot and virile within her. But even as she overflows you can’t stop. Pulling back once again you continue fucking her into the bed as your ejaculate burns her insides. She passes out and regains consciousness at steady intervals, awakening from her own orgasms only to pass out once again as you relentlessly pump her full, your own orgasms beginning to overlap themselves as the pleasure of filling her overwhelms you as well. She claws into your back, gasping and squeaking in desperation for air, her body eventually falling limp, energy sapped from your endless assault, content to let you mark her completely. 
  
With your remaining vigor you pull free of her heat. Your still pulsing as you leave her insides, the remaining ejaculate covering her belly and face as the last pangs of pleasure course through your body. 
  
Your left panting over her ravaged form. The sound of her breathing hitches every few moments, her body still racking with orgasms even after you’d left her. It’s quite the sight, your combined fluids pouring from her insides, steaming in a pool between her thighs. 
  
For a brief moment her eyes open again, she can barely focus on you but reaches forward to cup your cheek regardless. Your white knuckle gripping the bedding, your own body shivering from the aftershocks, but even as it’s about to give out you can still feel that same instinct within you, urging you to continue having your way with her. But her hand on your face seems to calm that nerve. You both stare at one another, and for the first time since you’ve met her, Seltra gives you what appears to be a genuine smile. 
  
You reach down and pull her close, flopping down on the bed as you hold her atop you. She muffles a giggle in your chest, and as you hug your lover close, you realize that your smiling as well. It’s a quiet revelation, the thought that your genuinely happy in this moment. 
  
Seltra’s breathing grows calm, so you reach down to pet her head as she nuzzles into the crook of your neck, sighing in content as sleep begins to take her. 
  
The room is quiet now, save for your shared breathing, and the sounds of the city. You mull over what Seltra had told you beforehand, the apparent machinations of the dark gods of chaos, what they had told her, what she had hoped for. It’s something that would make most men roil in fear, but in this moment you are calm, a sign that you’ve lost yourself completely, or that you had a stouter will then most. 

Despite it all you did know one thing, you weren’t the man you were back in the Empire, or at least, you’d grown into something else entirely. But as sleep overtakes you, you hold your little guide into madness close. If this were destiny or manipulation so be it, for all your humanity you couldn’t deny one thing...you’d grown to care for this Skaven.
________________________________________________________________________________
The morning, or at least what felt like morning, came with a churning growl in your stomach. You answered your body with a groan, though hunger aside, this was a far better awakening then you were used to. Back in the Empire you&#039;d only had your small cot and a splitting headache to wake up to, the soft matron in your arms on the other hand was something you were certainly coming to enjoy.

You ponder leaving her to rest, but considering your last foray of attempted &quot;escape&quot; you decide it&#039;d be best to wake her up. If not for her help, then at least to not worry her. 

Seltra grumbles a light *Hissss* as you gently shake her. You can only chuckle in response.

&quot;Come on, as much as i&#039;d love to stay like this, I&#039;m fairly certain you haven&#039;t eaten as well.&quot;

She grunts and sighs before finally pushing herself up a tad. Flowing white locks tangled all across her body and yours.

&quot;Is trues...But still wants to stay likes this for whiles longer, yes yes?&quot;

You sigh, and brush your fingers through the grey-seer&#039;s mane of hair. Just a few days ago this rat was your captor, now you were practically a love-sick puppy, though you got the feeling she was in the same boat as you, If not a bit more eager &amp; willing to embrace said situation. Regardless, if you were going to truly follow this path then you needed to get used to it.

&quot;Can&#039;t help the clan from bed now, hmm?&quot;

The hiss you get from her almost sounds like a scoff as she rolls off of you. A blunt *Thump!* coming from the floor beside you as she simply plops on the ground.

&quot;Ecch! Worldsies can wait...&quot;

That actually gets a laugh from you, and Seltra seems excited that your happy for once. Walking with renewed pep, she throws on her robe before tossing your garments at you.

&quot;Comes, I showsies home to mate, explain many plans, yes yes?&quot;

You push your body from the bed, throwing on your clothes and pausing as you pick up the chain necklace, the symbol of chaos undivided upon it. Seltra had given it to you yesterday, and you were still somewhat off-put by it...But, this WAS a present of sorts from your &quot;Lady&quot; and you weren&#039;t about to scorn it. You place the chain around your neck, it clinks quietly, now sharing a spot with your symbol of Sigmar. They were both light in form, but your spirit still felt oddly heavy...

Regardless, Seltra seems overjoyed at you wearing it, and thats enough to wash away the negative emotions. She grabs your hand and your off into the city proper.

You feel like your head&#039;s going to spin, or your eyes, or...something!? This place is a corpus of madness! Seltra however is doing damned dandy! She eagerly points at every building, machine, worker, and wayward explosion, explaining their purpose and reason in a way that you can only half digest. Despite the chaos of it all it&#039;s a rather &quot;fun&quot; experience, the Skaven females crowd around you like a novelty, and you briefly wonder if this is what the Emperor Franz feels like. 

As you push through the crowd, Seltra occasionally stopping to explain something to you, or to speak to some random higher ranking Skav. You eventually come across what looks like a large training area of sorts. Rats of all kind look to be in the midst of fighting, though its far from being &quot;regimented&quot; at least compared to the training back in the Empire. The would-be soldiers mostly scrabble and beat on one another in random brawls, only a select few look to be halfway decent when it comes down to it. 

&quot;Chiffska! Krizek!&quot;

Seltra calls out to two familiar faces, both marching up to the matron on queue. Well Chiffska actually saunters, but you&#039;re fairly certain Seltra couldn&#039;t care less. 

&quot;Comes! We eats and speaks.&quot;

The &quot;dining hall&quot; if you could even call it that, was a sight in of itself. You&#039;d heard tales of the legendary hunger of Skaven, but frankly, this was a whole nother level. Mysterious hooked meats all searing over open fires, massive cauldrons filled to the brim with bubbling broths, and what you were fairly certain was the corpse of a dragon getting gnawed on by a horde of young ratlings! All things considered...It was only slightly worse then the average Imperial dining hall. Plus with Seltra and her compatriots at your side, you apparently got the &quot;choicest&quot; seating in the room.

Whatever the small group that accompanied you was going to speak about was soon forgotten as food was plopped onto the table by the kitchen slaves. For a moment you stared in awe as they tore into it like wild beasts, before your own stomach demanded you sustain it as well. You expected the worst, but truth be told it wasn&#039;t all that bad, undercooked if nothing else, though you made certain to check if any of the meat seemed a bit to &quot;humanoid.&quot;

Only after the group was sated did Seltra finally speak up, bopping Krizek on the head with her staff to pull her attention away from a rather succulent bone she was gnawing on.

&quot;Now! I speaksies to you&#039;s and man things about many plans, so pays attention!&quot;

Both of Seltra&#039;s apparent lackies seem to only half pay attention, probably having heard all this before at some point. You on the other hand are taken aback by what Seltra tells you. How you&#039;re to travel to the north-lands and convene with the chaos gods in order to become the Everchosen, how she plans to raise herself to a Vermin-Queen by touching the &quot;Black Pillar&quot; or something of the sort, how with your powers combined you can stop the End-Times....WHAT!?

&quot;WHAT!?&quot;

The girls all look at you in surprise.

&quot;Is something wrongs with plans chosens one?&quot;

Chiffska looks to be holding back a snicker as she says that. You simply ignore her and look to Seltra.

&quot;You...Want to stop the End-Times? But isn&#039;t that what the Skaven want to cause? Isn&#039;t that what CHAOS wants to cause!? A-and you want me to....to become!?&quot;

Seltra looks almost afraid as you stare her down. The hall is silent and only now do you realize your standing in a rather hostile stance. You shake your head and seat yourself.

&quot;I&#039;m...I&#039;m sorry I-&quot;

&quot;No, is alrights most precious, should have knowns it would be&#039;s most strange soundings. But please, listen, and wills hope to makes it all clear. Yes yes?&quot;

You sigh and nod, the room once again returning to it&#039;s chaotic hussle.

&quot;Dark ones...Are not wholesies themselves...They&#039;s do not thinks or feels like us, they...Feeds.&quot;

She waves her hand across the room, gesturing to the Skaven as they continue to feast.

&quot;Dark ones want, want chaos, for chaos is what they feeds upon, just as all things feeds upons it. Magics, Time...Gods.&quot;

The necklace of Sigmar feels heavy once again.

&quot;Gods want end of all things yes yes? but also know if end comes, they no longer can feeds. We dies and so do theys, yes yes? So now...Now we&#039;s give them what they NEEDS, not what they WANTS! We gives them chaos, but nots world ending chaos! We stopsies the end, breaks the old prophecy with newsies one! Change worlds for better, yes yes?&quot;
 
Your still parsing it all together in your mind. A short while ago you were thinking that sleeping with this Skaven woman was the craziest thing in your life, now you were sitting here talking about how you were apparently going to change the fortold end of the world by usurping the destiny yourselves. 
 
&quot;It&#039;s just...A lot to take in I suppose.&quot;

Seltra places her hand over yours.

&quot;We takes one step of plan at a times. You will sees, may just takesies a while...&quot;

Seltra stands to leave, but before you can join her she gestures to Chiffska.

&quot;Must speaksies with many others, been aways for long time, much works to do. Chiffska wills be guiding you from heres, yes yes. But will sees you soon, and will explain more of plans.&quot;

You once again nod in response as shes brushes her hand over your cheek before taking her leave. Pushing down the feeling of estranged dread in your stomach, you look over to your new guide. Chiffska is beaming at you like a child with a key to the candy store. Oh what a day it&#039;s shaping up to be...
