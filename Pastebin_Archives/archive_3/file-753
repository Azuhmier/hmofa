</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;N-no...&quot; Her voice is barely more than a whisper. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;What happened?&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There&#039;s a pause as she steadies herself before explaining, taking a deep, shaky breath. &quot;I-I...Mayhem and I got into a fight, a-and...&quot;

</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She starts crying again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her quiet sobs are a little heartbreaking to hear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Do you want me to come over?&quot;

</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to sound supportive, god knows the girl looks like she needs it right about now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She hugs herself, not meeting your eyes. When she speaks, her voice wavers. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;S-she broke up with me...&quot; she whispers. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your eyebrows raised in surprise. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sure, the two went through rough patches a lot, but you never really thought you&#039;d see it reach that point. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Damn...did she explain why?&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;S-she...she said I was t-too needy...too c-clingy...&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few tears fall from her eyes onto the couch cushions. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a sigh, you scoot close to her and, resting a hand on her shoulder, gently pull her close to you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She hugs you tightly, and you do the same as she buries her face into your shoulder, the tears finally coming.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As sobs wrack the shark&#039;s body, you rub her back slowly. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hey...&quot; You speak softly to the shark. &quot;It&#039;s gonna be alright, Mischief...&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That...doesn&#039;t seem to help much.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her cries become a little harder, and her grip on you tightens even more, her tail even sliding around your waist. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You couldn&#039;t get her off even if you wanted too at this point. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I-I...how could she just drop me like that?

People stuck on a perpetually moving train during an ice age. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You relax back against the couch, and after a moment, Mischief scoots close to you, resting against your side, her tail in your lap. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Aside from the occasional comment, the two of you are mostly quiet. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once she&#039;s finished the candy and tossed the wrapper aside, you feel her arms hesitantly slide somewhat around you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It feels a little awkward due to the position, but you know what she wants. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You turn and slide your arms around the shark, allowing her to rest more comfortably in your embrace. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A faint blush on her cheeks, she nestles against you, and you begin to play with her hair once more. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Neither of you are paying attention to the movie at this point. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is just...so nice. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It feels right. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And...you&#039;d be lying if you said you didn&#039;t have some feelings for her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The shark turns her head back and nuzzles into the crook of your neck for a moment before your eyes meet. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The faint flush on her cheeks is still there, only a little more prominent now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can feel your cheeks flush too, and your heart begins to beat a little faster.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;A-Anon?&quot; She says your name with a shy whisper. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her cheeks flush brighter as you lean forward, closing the gap between you and give her a slow, soft kiss. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The kiss gets a little &quot;eep!&quot; out of the shark, but a second later she melts from the affection. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you break it, she&#039;s panting, even trembling a little in your lap now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can&#039;t help but smile at her incredibly shy reaction. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Sorry.

In your eyes, perfect. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your teasing caresses are enough to get a soft moan out of her, but when you slip one of her nipples into your mouth, they become a little louder. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her hands press your head against her breast, her breath shaky. &quot;O-oh, Anon...&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your erection is borderline painful at this point.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She clearly felt it, her hips beginning to lightly grind against the bulge in your crotch. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Diamonds.mov </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your right hand slowly trails down her belly now, slipping under the waistline of her panties and two of your fingers between her legs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The sensation of your fingers running over her soaked slit elicits a gasp from Mischief, </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She whines your name again, grinding her hips against your fingers. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you pull your fingers back, she whimpers until she sees you beginning to unbuckle your belt. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your pants come off, as do hers, and soon you&#039;re both completely naked. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You relocate to her bedroom, it&#039;d be easier that way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Soon enough, you&#039;re on top of her in bed, kissing her softly once more, your raging boner hard as a rock against her soft stomach.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s already warmed up, so it looks like foreplay wasn&#039;t much of an issue. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull the shark in for a deep kiss, then ask quietly. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Have you ever...done it like this before?&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her soft palm runs over your erection, and she shakes her head shyly. &quot;N-not really, no...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Then just relax for me baby, okay?

M/F Human X Anthro shark. Vanilla, cuddling, cute, Lesbian loves the D.

&gt;You are Anon. 
&gt;Currently, you&#039;re sitting alone on your couch, beer in hand, mindlessly watching the TV. 
&gt;You&#039;re tired, your leg muscles feel particularly heavy. 
&gt;Sometimes you wondered if working at Home Depot was a good idea. The labor kept you in shape, sure, but damn if you didn&#039;t get tired of it. 

&gt;You take another sip of your beer as you change the channel. 
&gt;Your phone goes off beside you, buzzing a few times on the couch, indicating you were getting a call. 
&gt;You pick it up and look at the screen, afraid it&#039;d be your boss calling to request you come in tomorrow for overtime. 
&gt;But no, it&#039;s just Mischief. 
&gt;You relax a little and answer. 

&quot;Hey Chief, whats good?&quot; 

&gt;You always called the shark that, knowing how the nickname got under her skin. 
&gt;But you&#039;re not met with the usual huff of annoyance that nickname gets you. 

&gt;&quot;A-Anon?&quot; 

&gt;The shark&#039;s voice is shaky. You can tell she&#039;s been crying. 
&gt;The smile leaves your face almost immediately, and you lean forward in your seat. 

&quot;Uh...everything okay, Mischief?&quot; 

&gt;&quot;N-no...&quot; Her voice is barely more than a whisper. 

&quot;What happened?&quot; 

&gt;There&#039;s a pause as she steadies herself before explaining, taking a deep, shaky breath. &quot;I-I...Mayhem and I got into a fight, a-and...&quot; 

&gt;She trails off, and you sigh through your nose. 
&gt;Great, this again. 
&gt;You should have figured. 
&gt;Anytime she called you with a problem, it almost always involved her girlfriend Mayhem. 
&gt;Honestly you were a little tired of it, but...well, not like you&#039;d ever tell Mischief that. 
&gt;Though sometimes you seriously considered giving Mayhem a piece of your mind. 

&quot;She didn&#039;t hurt you, did she?&quot; 

&gt;&quot;N-no!&quot; Mischief quickly denies, but her voice gets quiet again soon after. &quot;B-but...I think she...s-she...&quot; 

&gt;She starts crying again. 
&gt;Her quiet sobs are a little heartbreaking to hear.

&quot;Do you want me to come over?&quot; 

&gt;She sniffles. “P-please.”

&gt;You get up, holding the phone between your ear and your shoulder as you grab your jacket off the back of the couch and slip it on. 

&quot;I’ll be there in a few minutes, alright?” 

&gt;”Okay…” 

&gt;She hangs up, and you stuff your phone in your pocket. 
&gt;Grabbing your wallet and keys, you head out the door. 
&gt;Mischief’s apartment was about a fifteen minute walk away from your house, so there was no sense was driving. 
&gt;You stop for a few minutes at a 7-11 to get a few items. 
&gt;You knew this was gonna be a tearfest on her part, so it was better to have some things. 
&gt;Swedish Fish always helped cheer her up. 
&gt;And some Cherry coke would help you get through this with patience. 

&gt;About 20 minutes after the phone call, you enter her apartment complex and knock on her door. 
&gt;A few seconds pass before the door unlocks and opens. 
&gt;Mischief is a mess. 
&gt;Her eyes red, tears running down her cheeks. 
&gt;Her glasses are gone, and her hair is a mess. 
&gt;Well…at least you knew Mayhem didn’t physically hurt her. 

&gt;”H-hey…” she says quietly.
&gt;You try to give a supportive smile as you step inside, setting the drinks and candy down by a lamp while you sit with her on the couch, facing her. 

&quot;So what exactly happened, Mischief?&quot; 

&gt;You try to sound supportive, god knows the girl looks like she needs it right about now. 
&gt;She hugs herself, not meeting your eyes. When she speaks, her voice wavers. 

&gt;&quot;S-she broke up with me...&quot; she whispers. 

&gt;Your eyebrows raised in surprise. 
&gt;Sure, the two went through rough patches a lot, but you never really thought you&#039;d see it reach that point. 

&quot;Damn...did she explain why?&quot; 

&gt;&quot;S-she...she said I was t-too needy...too c-clingy...&quot; 

&gt;A few tears fall from her eyes onto the couch cushions. 
&gt;With a sigh, you scoot close to her and, resting a hand on her shoulder, gently pull her close to you. 
&gt;She hugs you tightly, and you do the same as she buries her face into your shoulder, the tears finally coming.
 
&gt;As sobs wrack the shark&#039;s body, you rub her back slowly. 

&quot;Hey...&quot; You speak softly to the shark. &quot;It&#039;s gonna be alright, Mischief...&quot; 

&gt;That...doesn&#039;t seem to help much.
&gt;Her cries become a little harder, and her grip on you tightens even more, her tail even sliding around your waist. 
&gt;You couldn&#039;t get her off even if you wanted too at this point. 

&gt;&quot;I-I...how could she just drop me like that? After e-everything we...?&quot; 

&gt;You can feel she&#039;s trembling now. 
&gt;Frowning, you reach up with one of your hands and slowly thread it through the shark&#039;s soft hair. 
&gt;A few seconds of this pass, and she seems to relax a little. 
&gt;Thankful you found something that works, you keep at it, focusing your little caresses around her ears, which seems to work best. 

&quot;I don&#039;t know, Mischief. I honestly can&#039;t tell you why...&quot; 

&gt;She sniffles, her head resting on your shoulder as you continue. 

&quot;But... I mean, it is what it is...if this is what she wants to do, you really can&#039;t stop her. You&#039;ve just gotta try and move past it...&quot; 

&gt;&quot;I-I don&#039;t know if I can, Anon...&quot; she whimpers. 

&gt;You start working your fingernails into the pets, running your fingers in slow, circular patterns through the hair on the back of her head. 

&quot;Why not?&quot; 

&gt;&quot;I...I would never have even talked to her if Fracas hadn&#039;t told Mayhem I liked her. Mayhem was t-the one who came to me. I-I...I don&#039;t think...I don&#039;t think I-I&#039;d have the confidence to try with anyone else...&quot; 

&gt;You sigh, and pull back from the hug slightly so you can look at her. 
&gt;With a brush of your thumb, you wipe the tears from her cheeks and smile. 

&quot;Well, I know you&#039;re a shy potato, Mischief...&quot; 

&gt;That manages to get a soft laugh out of the shark, a hint of a smile on her face. 

&quot;But...you shouldn&#039;t have to TRY, I don&#039;t think.&quot; 

&gt;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; She asks quietly.


&quot;Well...I mean, I think it&#039;s better to just let things flow naturally. If someone has to go out of their way to talk to whoever their interested in...well, do you really think that&#039;d work out in the long run?&quot; 

&gt;She&#039;s quiet for a moment, before coming close to you again, tucking her head under your chin. &quot;I guess not...&quot; 

&gt;She nuzzles your neck before laughing sweetly. &quot;But how would you know? Have you even had a girlfriend before?&quot; 

&gt;Well, if she&#039;s teasing you, then you&#039;ve done your job. 

&quot;Yeaaaah, my method is still awaiting results from testing.&quot; 

&gt;She giggles. &quot;Really? Never?&quot; 

&quot;Well...there was this one chick in highschool, but that didn&#039;t work out.&quot; 

&gt;&quot;What happened?&quot; 

&quot;Uh...she cheated.&quot; 

&gt;&quot;Oh...I-I&#039;m sorry, I didn&#039;t mean to bring up any bad memories...&quot; she says quietly. 

&quot;You&#039;re fine. That was years ago, I got over it a while ago.&quot; 

&gt;&quot;Still...&quot; There goes her tail again, sliding around your waist while she hugs you. &quot;I figured you&#039;d have been taken a while ago..&quot; 

&quot;What, me? I&#039;m like on level below fedora tipping neckbeard,&quot; you laugh. &quot;I&#039;ve already accepted my impending lonely life.&quot; 

&gt;&quot;Oh stop,&quot; she huffs, smacking the back of your head with her fin. &quot;Any girl would be lucky to have you.&quot; 

&quot;What makes you say that?&quot; 

&gt;Is...is she blushing? 
&gt;Maybe...though she was crying pretty hard. You can&#039;t really be sure. 

&gt;&quot;W-well...you&#039;re really sweet, Anon...&quot; She says softly. 

&quot;Speaking of sweets,&quot; you pull away from the hug to grab the candy out of the 7-11 bag, and hand it to her. &quot;Here.&quot; 

&gt;The shark&#039;s smile widens as she sees what kind of candy it is. &quot;Heh...you know me so well.&quot;


&gt;She opens the bag of candy and looks up at you. &quot;Do you have work tomorrow?&quot; 

&quot;Thankfully not.&quot; 

&gt;She smiles. &quot;So...do you wanna just...I don&#039;t know, hang out for a while?&quot; 

&quot;As if I could say no,&quot; you grin. &quot;You still have that hulu subscription or did that tank?&quot; 

&gt;She nods and pops one of the candies into her mouth. 
&gt;For a moment, you get a glance at those teeth. 
&gt;Rows of them, razor sharp. 
&gt;Odd how she was so shy, when she could easily be so vicious if she wanted.... 

&gt;&quot;Yeah, I still have it.&quot; 

&quot;Binge sci-fi then?&quot; 

&gt;Her smile widens and she nods happily. 
&gt;You grab her game system controller and fire it up, soon puling up Hulu. 
&gt;You decide to let her pick the movie. 
&gt;It&#039;s one you&#039;ve never seen, called Snowpiercer. 
&gt;Interesting concept, at least. People stuck on a perpetually moving train during an ice age. 
&gt;You relax back against the couch, and after a moment, Mischief scoots close to you, resting against your side, her tail in your lap. 
&gt;Aside from the occasional comment, the two of you are mostly quiet. 
&gt;Once she&#039;s finished the candy and tossed the wrapper aside, you feel her arms hesitantly slide somewhat around you. 
&gt;It feels a little awkward due to the position, but you know what she wants. 
&gt;You turn and slide your arms around the shark, allowing her to rest more comfortably in your embrace. 
&gt;A faint blush on her cheeks, she nestles against you, and you begin to play with her hair once more. 
&gt;Neither of you are paying attention to the movie at this point. 
&gt;This is just...so nice. 
&gt;It feels right. 
&gt;And...you&#039;d be lying if you said you didn&#039;t have some feelings for her. 

&gt;The shark turns her head back and nuzzles into the crook of your neck for a moment before your eyes meet. 
&gt;The faint flush on her cheeks is still there, only a little more prominent now. 
&gt;You can feel your cheeks flush too, and your heart begins to beat a little faster.


&gt;&quot;A-Anon?&quot; She says your name with a shy whisper. 
&gt;Her cheeks flush brighter as you lean forward, closing the gap between you and give her a slow, soft kiss. 
&gt;The kiss gets a little &quot;eep!&quot; out of the shark, but a second later she melts from the affection. 
&gt;When you break it, she&#039;s panting, even trembling a little in your lap now. 
&gt;You can&#039;t help but smile at her incredibly shy reaction. 

&quot;Sorry. I couldn&#039;t help myself,&quot; you grin. 

&gt;She blushes brighter, and then, with a bit of confidence you didn&#039;t expect from her, kisses you again. 
&gt;It doesn&#039;t take long for tongue to get involved, and holy shit, those teeth make it so much more exciting. 
&gt;When she breaks it, she giggles shyly.
&gt;&quot;Neither could I,&quot; she says quietly. 
&gt;Her arms slide up your back, her pointed nails beginning to run through the hair on the back of your head. 
&gt;As they pass over the nape of your neck and chills run through your body, she smiles a little and starts focusing on that spot. 

&gt;&quot;Anon...?&quot; she starts. &quot;Do...do you wanna spend the night?&quot; 

&gt;You know what that means, and it causes a rush of excitement to run through your chest. 
&gt;You nod, and pull her in for another kiss. 
&gt;Hormones rushing, your hands start to explore the shark&#039;s body. 
&gt;Her hoodie comes off, as does your jacket. 
&gt;Your fingers slip under her shirt, trailing up her back with your nails, making the shark quiver from the feeling. 
&gt;Her skin is rough when you go up, but when you go down, it&#039;s silky smooth. 
&gt;Your fingers begin caressing around the base of the fin on her back. 
&gt;That&#039;s definitely a sweet spot for her, it makes the shark whimper through the deep kiss you&#039;re sharing. 
&gt;You take advantage of that, your hands running along the sensitive appendage. 
&gt;Off comes your shirt too, and as she breaks the kiss, her head suddenly turns down and she began to lightly nibble on the skin of your neck. 
&gt;She kept it just light enough to not make you bleed. 
&gt;And damn, did it get you solid.


&gt;After a minute or two more of kisses, bites, and caresses, off comes her shirt. 
&gt;She&#039;s...hesitant, to remove her bra, her cheeks alight with blush. 
&gt;Why, you didn&#039;t understand. Her breasts were nothing short of perfect. 
&gt;Though on the smaller side, they were perky, and enough to grab a handful. In your eyes, perfect. 
&gt;Your teasing caresses are enough to get a soft moan out of her, but when you slip one of her nipples into your mouth, they become a little louder. 
&gt;Her hands press your head against her breast, her breath shaky. &quot;O-oh, Anon...&quot; 

&gt;Your erection is borderline painful at this point.
&gt;She clearly felt it, her hips beginning to lightly grind against the bulge in your crotch. 
&gt;Diamonds.mov 
&gt;Your right hand slowly trails down her belly now, slipping under the waistline of her panties and two of your fingers between her legs.
&gt;The sensation of your fingers running over her soaked slit elicits a gasp from Mischief, 
&gt;She whines your name again, grinding her hips against your fingers. 
&gt;As you pull your fingers back, she whimpers until she sees you beginning to unbuckle your belt. 

&gt;Your pants come off, as do hers, and soon you&#039;re both completely naked. 
&gt;You relocate to her bedroom, it&#039;d be easier that way.
&gt;Soon enough, you&#039;re on top of her in bed, kissing her softly once more, your raging boner hard as a rock against her soft stomach.
&gt;She&#039;s already warmed up, so it looks like foreplay wasn&#039;t much of an issue. 
&gt;You pull the shark in for a deep kiss, then ask quietly. 

&quot;Have you ever...done it like this before?&quot; 

&gt;Her soft palm runs over your erection, and she shakes her head shyly. &quot;N-not really, no...&quot;

&quot;Then just relax for me baby, okay? And if it&#039;s too uncomfortable and you want me to stop, tell me.&quot; 

&gt;&quot;O-okay...&quot;


&gt;Lining yourself up with her entrance, you slowly push yourself inside her. 
&gt;Almost immediately, the shark&#039;s body tenses, and you stop about a quarter of the way in, giving her a sweet kiss. 

&quot;I&#039;m not hurting you am I?&quot; 

&gt;&quot;N-no...keep going,&quot; she whispers, pulling your head down for another kiss. 
&gt;You return it, and keep going. 
&gt;You do have to take it slow, but eventually, she&#039;s adjusted to you, and you can start to speed it up. 
&gt;You don&#039;t jackhammer it, though. 
&gt;No, you work a nice, steady, even pace, going deep each time. 
&gt;It seems to be perfect for her, you&#039;re hitting sensitive spots inside her certainly wasn&#039;t used to being stimulated. 
&gt;As you thrust, you continue to kiss her until she&#039;s so wound up she&#039;s panting hard. 
&gt;At that point, she just holds your head against her chest while you thrust into her. 

&gt;&quot;A-Anon...&quot; she breathes while you start pressing balls deep with each thrust. &quot;I-I&#039;m getting close...&quot; 

&gt;You start to go a little faster while maintaining the depth of your thrusts. 
&gt;Your own climax is building, a hot pressure at the base of your cock. 
&gt;The speed is enough to help push her along, though. 
&gt;Her nails dig into your back as her body tenses up, her walls clamping down around you, spasaming as her climax hits. &quot;O-oh, A-Anon!&quot; 
&gt;The contractions and sudden increased tightness is enough to send you over the brink as well, your load spraying deep in her. 
&gt;Thank god for the genetic gap. 

&gt;The both of you panting hard, you wait for your mind to come off the orgasmic high before plopping down beside her. 
&gt;The shark curls up close to you, nuzzling your chest. 
&gt;&quot;Anon...that was...a-amazing...&quot; She whispers. 
&gt;You grin, and tilt her chin up, giving her a soft kiss. 

&quot;Glad to hear it...&quot; you say with a little grin. &quot;Hope I cheered you up.&quot; 

&gt;She giggles, nuzzling your chest before letting out a tiny yawn. &quot;I&#039;d say you did...&quot; 

&gt;Her hand finds yours as she cuddles up to you. 

&gt;&quot;Goodnight, Anon.&quot;
