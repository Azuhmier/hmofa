A job for which you were completely unqualified for.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All of your work for the magazine normally took place in a climate controlled building doing editing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Unfortunately, he&#039;d have none of it, so off you went with cash to cover bare minimum travel expense and lodging.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Supposedly, you would meet up with a tour guide down there who would take you places.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Given you had to meet the guy at a certain time, you programmed the GPS in your POS car.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;An eight hour drive later, you arrived in Louisiana, in some backwater town with a French name.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was hot, humid, well and truly away from any beach body women.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This was only the start of your troubles, as apparently, your tour guide was arrested for possession of controlled substances.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;On top of this, the hotels were booked for a bunch of competitive fishers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Those that weren&#039;t, were in a pretty sketchy part of town, so you had no choice but to sleep in your car.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was miserable, but at least any money you saved would be added to your pay.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Next morning, you drove down a dirt road to an unused fishing area, nature preserve and all that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Humidity Caused your clothing to stick to you, and the bugs swarmed you relentlessly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Plenty of swamp to take pictures of, and a moss covered dock stuck out into the water a ways</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Carefully, you marched out, eyeing the wall of green before you, raising the camera you were given.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was digital, waterproof, and had a good lens, and all you had to do was get a weeks worth of pictures.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a minute of scanning, you managed to spot a dragonfly, gotta start somewhere right.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few seconds later, you have a pretty decent set of pictures, perhaps this won&#039;t be so bad.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hey.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You jump a little, and spin around, looking for the woman who spoke to you, but nobody&#039;s there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Down here city boy.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking at the end of the dock, your heart all but leaps into your throat when you spot the gator woman.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s resting here elbows on the edge of the dock, staring up at you with unblinking reptilian eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Odds are, she isn&#039;t floating so much as standing in the water, grinning like the cat catching a canary.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Heavyset women weren&#039;t exactly your thing, but her massive boobs pressed against the end of the pier...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your face breaks out in a horrible blush as you avert your gaze, the gator woman huffing in amusement.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;See somthin&#039; ya like Slick?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;WHY IS SHE NAKED!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few months back, you&#039;d seen a video on the net involving a Florida Man and a Gator Woman.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Apparently, Florida Man tried snatching a purse from some mouse woman and sprinting to his getaway car.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some gator woman saw this and took great offence, and proceeded to charge the bastard.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She plowed through a small tree, a sign, and T-boned the car so hard the side caved in and it slide a few feet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This wasn&#039;t the end of it, with a grunt she flipped the car onto its side as though it were a toy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then she tore the roof off, hauled the guy out, and gave the lady back her purse.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It had been funny to watch, but now you were in a very bad spot, having ogled a naked gator woman.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She didn&#039;t seem to mind at all, but you weren&#039;t a perv, and definitely didn&#039;t want to be considered one.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To make matters worse, it seemed that her friends had shown up, and they were just as big.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Oh, who&#039;s your friend Gabby?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Well now, city boy want a show heh heh.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Slick alright for a city boy girls,&quot; Gabby said, &quot;Though what brings ya to the bayou?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If you turn around and start hauling ass, you could get to your car and get out of here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Um, my boss sent me to get some pictures of the local wildlife.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take a step back. At this, the three chuckle, and shift as though to climb onto the dock.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Leavin&#039; so soon Slick? Perhaps you&#039;d like to get a few pictures of some &#039;Wild&#039; women first?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I appreciate the offer, but I should probably give you your privacy and all.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You turn and make it about three steps before slamming to a wall of flesh, sinking into it slightly from momentum.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you can fall down however, a powerful arm pulls you back in, your face buried in soft, sun-warmed scales.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Now now ladies,&quot; the newcomer rumbles, &quot;Did Ma&#039; teach y&#039;all o be nice to gentlemen? Slick here seems decent for city folk.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a sinking sensation, you realize that your face is currently imprisoned between a massive set of boobs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Most men would kill to be in such a position...odds were you were about to die in it, Not the worst way to go.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The deep chuckling of voices indicate the rest of them are out of the water now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are pulled out of your plush prison and held at arms length by strong and large gator hands.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Gator woman before you stand s 7&#039;6&quot;, looks about 420 pounds, and has a scar over one eye.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There are four more of them, including the ones you&#039;ve already seen, the newest face wearing a baseball cap.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;So tell me Slick,&quot; Scarface rumbles with a giant grin, &quot;What brings ya to this humble slice o&#039; Louisiana?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you tell them why you&#039;re out here sweating like mad, and hoping they don&#039;t kill you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few minutes of explaining later, they all seem to be giving you sympathetic looks and nodding in understanding.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Well, Slick,&quot; Scarface says, &quot;Me and the girls have been having a bit of a dry spell here, and we could yous a polite young man like yourself to help us out.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;In return, we help you get some pictures and give ya place to stay, sound like a deal?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Normally, you&#039;d have booked it, but five women eager to jump(break) your bones and keeping your job was too good to pass up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Good,&quot; Scarface says, before snatching your camera, &quot;Yer the more digitally inclined of us &#039;lizbeth. Snap a few pics will ya?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait, now? but before you can protest further, Scarface grips your head in a massive hand and draws you in for a kiss.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Gator snouts weren&#039;t designed for kissing, but Scarface isn&#039;t deterred, her tongue pouring into your mouth, nearly gagging you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your knees all but buckle as you sag in her grip, her second hand groping your ass and feeling you up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her tongue overwhelms yours, and any attempt to kiss back is met with overwhelming force.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Finally, she lets you come up for air, a thick strand of drool connecting your mouths.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Name&#039;s Jessie,&quot; She says, &quot;you&#039;ll be screaming it shortly.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to give her yours, but you&#039;re smothered by a massive breast the size of a basketball.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jessie is going to work getting your pants off, and the other girls are rubbing themselves idly as they watch.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few seconds later, Jessie has you mostly naked, your pants bunched up around your boots as she brings you in for another kiss.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her scaly body feels wonderful against your own, even beneath buttery fat you can feel her muscles shifting like steel cables.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your pinned to the ground, Jessie resting her thick thighs on either side of your body, eyeing your junk.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;No half bad for a city boy Slick,&quot; She grins.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She grinds against you, her sheer mass pinning you to the ground, her lower lips slathering more moisture onto you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your body drags against the muddy ground, it and her body pleasantly cool in comparison to the swampy heat you&#039;d been facing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Finally, she lifts up, lines you up carefully, and hilts you in one go, her insides gripping you like a velvety fist.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She begins moving a a steady pace, her hips driving you into the ground, hands planted either side of your head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Those massive breast sway in hypnotic motions, leaving you open-mouthed as you gaze up at them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Go on Slick, play with &#039;em.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You do, your fingers sinking into them up to the knuckle, occasionally playing with her nipples. She&#039;d gasp occasionally when you did this.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her pace picked up, slamming down onto you, you&#039;d definitely be sore after all of this.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a minute of this, you were at your limit, panting from heat and exertion.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;m gonna...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Almost there Slick, hang on.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few second later, you climax, you vision blurring from the intensity of it. Jessie follows suite moments later, smashing down on you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She lay atop you, her passage milking you dry all while letting out a bone-shaking rumble, rattling your brains even further.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Panting, her full weight presses on you for a moment, driving the air from your lungs, before she rolled over with you in tow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After the both of you recovered, Jessie helped you get dressed before telling Brenda(ballcap) to get you to the house.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Brenda had to lay the front seat back most the way so she could lean over it from the back seat.

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;You had plans for college spring break, plans to go to the beach and find a woman around your age.
&gt;Your boss at Great Outdoors Magazine, had other plans for you in Louisiana, horrible plans
&gt;Namely, pictures of wildlife in the swamp. A job for which you were completely unqualified for.
&gt;All of your work for the magazine normally took place in a climate controlled building doing editing.
&gt;Unfortunately, he&#039;d have none of it, so off you went with cash to cover bare minimum travel expense and lodging.
&gt;Supposedly, you would meet up with a tour guide down there who would take you places.
&gt;Given you had to meet the guy at a certain time, you programmed the GPS in your POS car.
&gt;An eight hour drive later, you arrived in Louisiana, in some backwater town with a French name.
&gt;It was hot, humid, well and truly away from any beach body women.
&gt;This was only the start of your troubles, as apparently, your tour guide was arrested for possession of controlled substances.
&gt;On top of this, the hotels were booked for a bunch of competitive fishers.
&gt;Those that weren&#039;t, were in a pretty sketchy part of town, so you had no choice but to sleep in your car.
&gt;It was miserable, but at least any money you saved would be added to your pay.
&gt;Next morning, you drove down a dirt road to an unused fishing area, nature preserve and all that.
&gt;Humidity Caused your clothing to stick to you, and the bugs swarmed you relentlessly.
&gt;Plenty of swamp to take pictures of, and a moss covered dock stuck out into the water a ways
&gt;Carefully, you marched out, eyeing the wall of green before you, raising the camera you were given.
&gt;It was digital, waterproof, and had a good lens, and all you had to do was get a weeks worth of pictures.
&gt;After a minute of scanning, you managed to spot a dragonfly, gotta start somewhere right.
&gt;A few seconds later, you have a pretty decent set of pictures, perhaps this won&#039;t be so bad.
&quot;Hey.&quot;
&gt;You jump a little, and spin around, looking for the woman who spoke to you, but nobody&#039;s there.
&quot;Down here city boy.&quot;
&gt;Looking at the end of the dock, your heart all but leaps into your throat when you spot the gator woman.
&gt;She&#039;s resting here elbows on the edge of the dock, staring up at you with unblinking reptilian eyes.
&gt;Odds are, she isn&#039;t floating so much as standing in the water, grinning like the cat catching a canary.
&gt;Heavyset women weren&#039;t exactly your thing, but her massive boobs pressed against the end of the pier...
&gt;Your face breaks out in a horrible blush as you avert your gaze, the gator woman huffing in amusement.
&quot;See somthin&#039; ya like Slick?&quot;
&gt;WHY IS SHE NAKED!
&gt;A few months back, you&#039;d seen a video on the net involving a Florida Man and a Gator Woman.
&gt;Apparently, Florida Man tried snatching a purse from some mouse woman and sprinting to his getaway car.
&gt;Some gator woman saw this and took great offence, and proceeded to charge the bastard.
&gt;She plowed through a small tree, a sign, and T-boned the car so hard the side caved in and it slide a few feet.
&gt;This wasn&#039;t the end of it, with a grunt she flipped the car onto its side as though it were a toy.
&gt;Then she tore the roof off, hauled the guy out, and gave the lady back her purse.
&gt;It had been funny to watch, but now you were in a very bad spot, having ogled a naked gator woman.
&gt;She didn&#039;t seem to mind at all, but you weren&#039;t a perv, and definitely didn&#039;t want to be considered one.
&gt;To make matters worse, it seemed that her friends had shown up, and they were just as big.
&quot;Oh, who&#039;s your friend Gabby?&quot;
&quot;Well now, city boy want a show heh heh.&quot;
&quot;Slick alright for a city boy girls,&quot; Gabby said, &quot;Though what brings ya to the bayou?&quot;
&gt;If you turn around and start hauling ass, you could get to your car and get out of here.
&quot;Um, my boss sent me to get some pictures of the local wildlife.&quot;
&gt;You take a step back. At this, the three chuckle, and shift as though to climb onto the dock.
&quot;Leavin&#039; so soon Slick? Perhaps you&#039;d like to get a few pictures of some &#039;Wild&#039; women first?&quot;
&quot;I appreciate the offer, but I should probably give you your privacy and all.&quot;
&gt;You turn and make it about three steps before slamming to a wall of flesh, sinking into it slightly from momentum.
&gt;Before you can fall down however, a powerful arm pulls you back in, your face buried in soft, sun-warmed scales.
&quot;Now now ladies,&quot; the newcomer rumbles, &quot;Did Ma&#039; teach y&#039;all o be nice to gentlemen? Slick here seems decent for city folk.&quot;
&gt;With a sinking sensation, you realize that your face is currently imprisoned between a massive set of boobs.
&gt;Most men would kill to be in such a position...odds were you were about to die in it, Not the worst way to go.
&gt;The deep chuckling of voices indicate the rest of them are out of the water now.
&gt;You are pulled out of your plush prison and held at arms length by strong and large gator hands.
&gt;The Gator woman before you stand s 7&#039;6&quot;, looks about 420 pounds, and has a scar over one eye.
&gt;There are four more of them, including the ones you&#039;ve already seen, the newest face wearing a baseball cap.
&quot;So tell me Slick,&quot; Scarface rumbles with a giant grin, &quot;What brings ya to this humble slice o&#039; Louisiana?&quot;
&gt;So you tell them why you&#039;re out here sweating like mad, and hoping they don&#039;t kill you.
&gt;A few minutes of explaining later, they all seem to be giving you sympathetic looks and nodding in understanding.
&quot;Well, Slick,&quot; Scarface says, &quot;Me and the girls have been having a bit of a dry spell here, and we could yous a polite young man like yourself to help us out.&quot;
&quot;In return, we help you get some pictures and give ya place to stay, sound like a deal?&quot;
&gt;Normally, you&#039;d have booked it, but five women eager to jump(break) your bones and keeping your job was too good to pass up.
&quot;Good,&quot; Scarface says, before snatching your camera, &quot;Yer the more digitally inclined of us &#039;lizbeth. Snap a few pics will ya?&quot;
&gt;Wait, now? but before you can protest further, Scarface grips your head in a massive hand and draws you in for a kiss.
&gt;Gator snouts weren&#039;t designed for kissing, but Scarface isn&#039;t deterred, her tongue pouring into your mouth, nearly gagging you.
&gt;Your knees all but buckle as you sag in her grip, her second hand groping your ass and feeling you up.
&gt;Her tongue overwhelms yours, and any attempt to kiss back is met with overwhelming force.
&gt;Finally, she lets you come up for air, a thick strand of drool connecting your mouths.
&quot;Name&#039;s Jessie,&quot; She says, &quot;you&#039;ll be screaming it shortly.&quot;
&gt;You try to give her yours, but you&#039;re smothered by a massive breast the size of a basketball.
&gt;Jessie is going to work getting your pants off, and the other girls are rubbing themselves idly as they watch.
&gt;A few seconds later, Jessie has you mostly naked, your pants bunched up around your boots as she brings you in for another kiss.
&gt;Her scaly body feels wonderful against your own, even beneath buttery fat you can feel her muscles shifting like steel cables.
&gt;Your pinned to the ground, Jessie resting her thick thighs on either side of your body, eyeing your junk.
&quot;No half bad for a city boy Slick,&quot; She grins.
&gt;She grinds against you, her sheer mass pinning you to the ground, her lower lips slathering more moisture onto you.
&gt;Your body drags against the muddy ground, it and her body pleasantly cool in comparison to the swampy heat you&#039;d been facing.
&gt;Finally, she lifts up, lines you up carefully, and hilts you in one go, her insides gripping you like a velvety fist.
&gt;She begins moving a a steady pace, her hips driving you into the ground, hands planted either side of your head.
&gt;Those massive breast sway in hypnotic motions, leaving you open-mouthed as you gaze up at them.
&quot;Go on Slick, play with &#039;em.&quot;
&gt;You do, your fingers sinking into them up to the knuckle, occasionally playing with her nipples. She&#039;d gasp occasionally when you did this.
&gt;Her pace picked up, slamming down onto you, you&#039;d definitely be sore after all of this.
&gt;After a minute of this, you were at your limit, panting from heat and exertion.
&quot;I&#039;m gonna...&quot;
&quot;Almost there Slick, hang on.&quot;
&gt;A few second later, you climax, you vision blurring from the intensity of it. Jessie follows suite moments later, smashing down on you.
&gt;She lay atop you, her passage milking you dry all while letting out a bone-shaking rumble, rattling your brains even further.
&gt;Panting, her full weight presses on you for a moment, driving the air from your lungs, before she rolled over with you in tow.
&gt;After the both of you recovered, Jessie helped you get dressed before telling Brenda(ballcap) to get you to the house.
&gt;Brenda had to lay the front seat back most the way so she could lean over it from the back seat. She was nice, and apparently a mechanic.
&gt;An hour of navigating twisting back roads later, you arrived at their house, a waterside affair with a monstrous truck parked out front.
&gt;Jessie, Gabby, Elizabeth, and Mary were waiting for the two of you, apparently swimming through the swamp was far faster.
&gt;Gabby helped you settle in, before pulling you aside entirely for a bit of fun of her own. By the time you could stand it was lunch.
&gt;Mary was one hell of a cook, her food was far better than anything you;d had on they way out here, or nuked in the microwave.
&gt;A short siesta later, and Gabby took you into the swamp to take some pictures. You rode on her back, the tough scales a stark contrast to those on her belly.
&gt;She could get into places no boat could hope to, and she was a lot quieter, pointing out various creatures for you to shoot.
&gt;By the time you got back, Mary had some of her mother&#039;s secret Gumbo recipe ready, and insisted on putting meat on your bones.
&gt;After helping her with the dishes, Mary decided to reward you a little, and carried your spent body to bed with her like a teddy.
&gt;The next four days would go in a similar manner, and you found yourself enjoying it immensely.
&gt;Sure, there were a few mishaps along the way, like Elizabeth knocking you over with a playful tail-slap to the back of your legs and leaving a light bruise.
&gt;Then there was the time Mary about smothered you with one of her enormous tits, in her sleep, and her response to your struggles was to pull you closer.
&gt;You joined them for a game of football in a field, your smaller size and agility allowing you to slip past the other players a few times.
&gt;Jessie then tackled you and death-rolled across half the field however, scrambling your brains and nearly dislocating your shoulder in the process.
&gt;Brenda insisted on going over your car to make sure everything was working properly. You got to help fix the car and service her.
&gt;Gabby left a few claw marks on you back after a particularly intense bout of lovemaking, but thankfully nothing requiring stitches.
&gt;Wrestling was a constant pastime, and the girls found your resistance to be adorable.
&gt;Been cuddled was mandatory, as was being the smaller spoon, but that wasn&#039;t so bad.
&gt;You even went to see a mud-wrestling match between Jessie and some Burmese snake lady. It had been a close thing, but Jessie won.
&gt;The food was amazing, you got plenty of great pictures(some for keeping in the memory book), and the sex was awesome.
&gt;Still, you went to bed aching, sore, and looking forward to doing it all again in the morning.
&gt;All good things come to an end however, and on day five you began packing up and saying goodbye to the wonderful women you had met.
&gt;Elizabeth had helped you sort the pictures(work related from NSFW) the night before, and promised to keep in touch via email.
&gt;You let her upload a few copies of pictures of the six of you, and then the girls gave you a group hug that threatened to pop your spine.
&quot;Ya&#039; come back soon now ya hear.&quot;
&gt;You promised to visit when you got time off or headed out this way, and began the long drive home.
&gt;Upon arriving back at your apartment, you staggered inside, walked to your bed, and face-planted on it, revealed to be back.
&gt;It was a little disappointing when you weren&#039;t grabbed by scaly hands and pulled up against a larger woman.
&gt;Still, you had work in the morning, and, come to think of it, you never did get to take that vacation of yours.
&gt;You&#039;d put in for a week in the fall, and head back over to the girls then, once you made sure you could pull it off.
&gt;And you still had most of the travel expense money, the Boss wouldn&#039;t notice most of it missing, he wasn&#039;t the brightest bulb in the building.
&gt;Everything turned out wonderfully, much better than you&#039;d imagined. You couldn&#039;t wait to go back though, but you;d survive until then.</textarea>
