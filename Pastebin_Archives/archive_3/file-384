Anyone here?” I ask, scanning the room for any signs of life</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A noise somewhere between a groan and moan rises up from the couch, along with a female figure of busty size (mostly in the chest-area)</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Umm… Are you my roommate?” I question as I try to find the light-switch with my left-hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Feel something plastic with my pinky</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Push and click</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And God said: Let there be light</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Ah, my eyes! Who the…?” A female Lynx, I notice by the black tufts on her ears, almost shrieks and turns to me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Oh sorry, I was just…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait a minute, that face...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”That you Anon?” The Lynx dips her head to down a little while rubbing her eyes a little</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Nope, It’s Chad from high-school.” I retort</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Heh unlikely, he doesn’t smell as nice as you.” She laughs as she opens her eyes and flips herself over the couch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The first thing I take note of, as she steps closer to me with her long legs, is the fact that she’s literally wearing nothing but a bardot top and black panties</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;From her chin to the inner-thighs, ran white fur and the rest of her body is covered in a goldish-brown coat of fur</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That, combined with the clothes she wore (or lack thereof) made many things hard for me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Such as my attempts to hide the most biggest boner I think i’ll pop in my lifetime</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Uh...Can I go set my stuff and maybe take a shower? I’ve got some stuff to drop off.” I turn my gaze from her towards the wall on the right</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Yeah, that’s cool. Use the room near the window, since that’s empty.” She turns on her feet and points at the window-side room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I speed-walk towards it, open the door and enter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Close the door and drop my bags</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I sigh and turn my head to look at the current room i’m in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s really empty, leave a single bed, a shelf opposite of it and a desk to side of the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lay down on the bed and just relax</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jeans feel so tight I think they’re gonna rip</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Cast them and  my jacket aside, leaving me wearing only boxers and turtleneck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tent still pitched, but not as tight</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Close my eyes and think about her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Move my hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Ja-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hear the door open and I snap my eyes open, was the door that loud before?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Anon, I’m gonna ma-”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She opens the door fully open and sees me, laying on the bed with a massive hard-on tent and hand halfway downtown to faptown</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;My eyes instinctively turn to her body and I feel my erection throb with vigor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”-ke dinner…” She finishes her sentence while her eyes wander down and she seems to shiver a little</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”So uh, you can go take your shower while I cook…” She turns away to leave, clear awkwardness in her voice as she closes the door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;’Dick why?’</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I slowly get up and open the door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Can’t see her anywhere, probably went to cook</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Walk to the door that looks like it could be the bathroom</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Open door and walk in, noticing the dark-red carpet on the tiled-floor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I guessed right</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Close the door and start taking off my shirt </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;My mind wanders into thoughts of her walking in on me right now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;’Am I really that desperate?’ I think as I throw away my boxer and pull the shower curtains away absent-mindedly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The curtains move away and well, I find her standing behind them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Jamie!?” I step back in shock and she almost knocks me down with a sudden hug</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Anon, you’re pretty dirty, getting excited like that~” She snarky tone is clear, even though her face (and rest of her body) is pressed up against me, her arms feeling my back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Boner gets up and I feel her right paw swirl around it while she smugly turns to face me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You’re so hard~ Guessing you haven’t fapped in a while?” She whispers to my ear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Feel my erection throb in her paw, and I shiver as she starts to move her paw back and forth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Ah, Jamie…” I close my eyes and call her name as she continues her movement</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She speeds up slightly and I feel my legs shake a little</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Feel her kiss my lips and then her wet and warm tongue entering my mouth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I respond with my own, both of our tongues feeling the other</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Open my eyes and see her seawater blue eyes staring at mine</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I pull her closer with into an embrace and feel my member sliding between her thighs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”A-Anon, give it to me…” Her pleading voice whispers to me and she lays herself on her back on the carpet and I follow her body, hands tracing her sweaty, furred legs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shiver at my touch and my hands reach her hips</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I turn my eyes upwards to see her face, breathing heavily</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Breasts moving slightly with every breath in and out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;My hand move upwards again, feeling her fur, skin and ribs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I then reach her breasts, feeling their soft, round shape</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then I trace her nipples with my finger as I move my pelvis closer the hers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Inch myself closer to her, me sitting on my knees and her legs spread above mine</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”A….Anon…” Her breathing gets louder as I get closer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I feel the warmness just by being close to the entrance of hers </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’m gonna do it.” I whisper, sweating slightly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I push myself forward and raise my knees as well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Ah!....Ah~” Jamie shivers and almost screams as I enter her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She feels like slick and warm inside, and I start moving</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Oh God...Anon!” She unsheathes her claws and digs them deep into the carpet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Jamie..Jamie!” I repeat her name while continuing to thrust</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her breathing and shaking gets intensive as does my movements</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She then holds me close, pushing my face to her breasts</div></li><li

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Be Anon
&gt;Moving from my old house in the countryside to a city apartment after finding a new job close to said city
&gt;Apparently I’m gonna be living with a roommate
&gt;”Let’s do this.” I say as I open the apartment door with my newly-acquired key
&gt;Door-lock clicks and I open the door to a living room
&gt;No lights on, which a bit weird
&gt;TV is on and appears to be playing a old western movie
&gt;Walk past the door, take off shoes, close door and walk further into the TV-lit living room
&gt;”Hello? Anyone here?” I ask, scanning the room for any signs of life
&gt;A noise somewhere between a groan and moan rises up from the couch, along with a female figure of busty size (mostly in the chest-area)
&gt;”Umm… Are you my roommate?” I question as I try to find the light-switch with my left-hand
&gt;Feel something plastic with my pinky
&gt;Push and click
&gt;And God said: Let there be light
&gt;”Ah, my eyes! Who the…?” A female Lynx, I notice by the black tufts on her ears, almost shrieks and turns to me
&gt;”Oh sorry, I was just…”
&gt;...
&gt;Wait a minute, that face...
&gt;”That you Anon?” The Lynx dips her head to down a little while rubbing her eyes a little
&gt;”Nope, It’s Chad from high-school.” I retort
&gt;”Heh unlikely, he doesn’t smell as nice as you.” She laughs as she opens her eyes and flips herself over the couch
&gt;The first thing I take note of, as she steps closer to me with her long legs, is the fact that she’s literally wearing nothing but a bardot top and black panties
&gt;From her chin to the inner-thighs, ran white fur and the rest of her body is covered in a goldish-brown coat of fur
&gt;That, combined with the clothes she wore (or lack thereof) made many things hard for me
&gt;Such as my attempts to hide the most biggest boner I think i’ll pop in my lifetime
&gt;”Uh...Can I go set my stuff and maybe take a shower? I’ve got some stuff to drop off.” I turn my gaze from her towards the wall on the right
&gt;”Yeah, that’s cool. Use the room near the window, since that’s empty.” She turns on her feet and points at the window-side room
&gt;I speed-walk towards it, open the door and enter
&gt;Close the door and drop my bags
&gt;I sigh and turn my head to look at the current room i’m in
&gt;It’s really empty, leave a single bed, a shelf opposite of it and a desk to side of the bed.
&gt;Lay down on the bed and just relax
&gt;Jeans feel so tight I think they’re gonna rip
&gt;Cast them and  my jacket aside, leaving me wearing only boxers and turtleneck
&gt;Tent still pitched, but not as tight
&gt;Close my eyes and think about her
&gt;Move my hand
&gt;”Ja-
&gt;Hear the door open and I snap my eyes open, was the door that loud before?
&gt;”Anon, I’m gonna ma-”
&gt;She opens the door fully open and sees me, laying on the bed with a massive hard-on tent and hand halfway downtown to faptown
&gt;My eyes instinctively turn to her body and I feel my erection throb with vigor
&gt;”-ke dinner…” She finishes her sentence while her eyes wander down and she seems to shiver a little
&gt;”So uh, you can go take your shower while I cook…” She turns away to leave, clear awkwardness in her voice as she closes the door
&gt;’Dick why?’
&gt;I slowly get up and open the door
&gt;Can’t see her anywhere, probably went to cook
&gt;Walk to the door that looks like it could be the bathroom
&gt;Open door and walk in, noticing the dark-red carpet on the tiled-floor
&gt;I guessed right
&gt;Close the door and start taking off my shirt 
&gt;My mind wanders into thoughts of her walking in on me right now
&gt;’Am I really that desperate?’ I think as I throw away my boxer and pull the shower curtains away absent-mindedly
&gt;The curtains move away and well, I find her standing behind them
&gt;”Jamie!?” I step back in shock and she almost knocks me down with a sudden hug
&gt;”Anon, you’re pretty dirty, getting excited like that~” She snarky tone is clear, even though her face (and rest of her body) is pressed up against me, her arms feeling my back
&gt;Boner gets up and I feel her right paw swirl around it while she smugly turns to face me
&gt;”You’re so hard~ Guessing you haven’t fapped in a while?” She whispers to my ear
&gt;Feel my erection throb in her paw, and I shiver as she starts to move her paw back and forth
&gt;”Ah, Jamie…” I close my eyes and call her name as she continues her movement
&gt;She speeds up slightly and I feel my legs shake a little
&gt;Feel her kiss my lips and then her wet and warm tongue entering my mouth
&gt;I respond with my own, both of our tongues feeling the other
&gt;Open my eyes and see her seawater blue eyes staring at mine
&gt;I pull her closer with into an embrace and feel my member sliding between her thighs
&gt;”A-Anon, give it to me…” Her pleading voice whispers to me and she lays herself on her back on the carpet and I follow her body, hands tracing her sweaty, furred legs
&gt;She shiver at my touch and my hands reach her hips
&gt;I turn my eyes upwards to see her face, breathing heavily
&gt;Breasts moving slightly with every breath in and out
&gt;My hand move upwards again, feeling her fur, skin and ribs
&gt;I then reach her breasts, feeling their soft, round shape
&gt;Then I trace her nipples with my finger as I move my pelvis closer the hers
&gt;Inch myself closer to her, me sitting on my knees and her legs spread above mine
&gt;”A….Anon…” Her breathing gets louder as I get closer
&gt;I feel the warmness just by being close to the entrance of hers 
&gt;”I’m gonna do it.” I whisper, sweating slightly
&gt;I push myself forward and raise my knees as well
&gt;”Ah!....Ah~” Jamie shivers and almost screams as I enter her
&gt;She feels like slick and warm inside, and I start moving
&gt;”Oh God...Anon!” She unsheathes her claws and digs them deep into the carpet
&gt;”Jamie..Jamie!” I repeat her name while continuing to thrust
&gt;Her breathing and shaking gets intensive as does my movements
&gt;She then holds me close, pushing my face to her breasts
&gt;”Anon! I…Ah~” She digs her claws into my back, but I’m too far in to stop now
&gt;”Jamie, I’m about to..!”
&gt;”Anon, let it all in!” She desperately holds me even closer
&gt;She tightens and I cum immediately after
&gt;”Ahh!!~” She moans louder than before, arching her back
&gt;Both of our bodies shake in a wave of pleasure
&gt;We stay there for a couple seconds, just listening to each other breaths
&gt;”Anon, I love you…” She kisses me
&gt;”I love you too, Jamie…” I return the kiss and I get off top of her, flopping next to her
&gt;We layed there for a couple seconds before I get up, legs a bit wobbly still
&gt;”Your claws are really sharp.” I comment as I look in the mirror at my back
&gt;Small cuts, nothing major
&gt;”Oh, sorry…”
&gt;”Don’t worry about it. By the way, need me to carry you?”
&gt;”Nah.” She slowly raises herself and pulls her panties from a hidden drawer
&gt;”Oh so that’s where you hid your clothes.” I say as I put on my boxer
&gt;”Yep.” She pulls up panties and turns to me
&gt;I pat her: “We’re sleeping in your bed tonight, right?”
&gt;”Of course!”
&gt;We walk side-by-side to her room, which is almost identical to my room, except hers is has a bit more stuff in it
&gt;”You first.” She pulls me to her bed and I slide myself under the blue covers, with her snuggling to my side
&gt;”We should have done this those 4 years ago.” She point outs, embracing me
&gt;”I know, but better late than never right?” I pull up the cover on our mostly-naked bodies and return the gesture
&gt;I close my eyes and take in her and her room’s smell
&gt;”Oh, I probably should have mentioned that I’m in heat.”
&gt;”Yes, and?”
&gt;”...Wonder how many kids we’ll have?” She asks with a curious tone
&gt;”Well, we’ll find out someday, but tonight we’re gonna go to sleep.”
&gt;”Agreed. Goodnight.” She shifts herself a little
&gt;”Goodnight.”</textarea>
