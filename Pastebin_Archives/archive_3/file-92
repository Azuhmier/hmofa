Well, assuming that he can fix your car of course.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To top everything off, it was -10° outside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were currently standing in the lobby of a small hotel.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking into your wallet, you saw you had just enough cash on hand for a two-night stay in the hotel.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could head to an ATM to get cash to pay for the car repairs, but it was going to put an unwanted dent in your finances.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh, and walk up to the counter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Walking up, you see a bored looking Anthro Beaver sitting at the desk.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She instantly perks up when she sees you, a surprised look on her face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh wow, a Human. What can I do for yah, Sir?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her Minnesotan accent hits you like a brick, and you have to stifle a laugh.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you plan on renting a room for the night.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods with a smile, and tells you the cost.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It&#039;s $80 for the night, Sir. You hafta pay in advance.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod, and hand her the appropriate amount of cash.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh! One more thing, sir.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You see, this hotel is communal, dont&#039;cha know. You&#039;ll be sharing your room with three other guests. It&#039;s an Anthro thing. Safety in numbers, and all that.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry, they&#039;re regulars here, and we&#039;ve never received a complaint about them.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shit. The last thing you wanted to do was interact with more Anthros.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You weren&#039;t prejudiced, but you were always a bit nervous around members of other species.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She hands you a small keycard for your room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Here you go, Sir.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You thank her, and she gives you a nervous smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Umm... Can you do a quick favor for me, Sir?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pulls out her phone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We don&#039;t see a lot of Humans around here. You&#039;re actually the second one I&#039;ve ever seen in person.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Would you mind if I... Got a quick picture?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sheepishly smiles, a bit embarrassed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You simply shrug and tell her it would be fine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Great! Okay, let me get next to you...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She walks around the counter, and stands next to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She puts her arm around your shoulder, and holds the phone up to take a selfie of the two of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Smile.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You give a small smile, and she takes a picture.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Sweet! Thanks, Human. My friends&#039;ll all be so jealous I met me a real Human.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her goodbye, and you turn to head up to your room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stop in front of your room, and you can hear voices inside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It must be your temporary &quot;roommates&quot;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You knock, and the voices go quiet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The door swings open, and you&#039;re greeted by the sight of a large female Wolf. She looks to be around 6&#039;3&quot;, and has black fur.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks at you and gives you a curious look.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;A Human? What are you doing here?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hold up the keycard, and tell her you&#039;ll be staying with her for a couple days.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh. Well, come on in then.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You enter, and get a look at the other two guests.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They&#039;re both wolves too!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One has white fur, and stands at 6&#039;2&quot;. The other has dark gray fur, and stands at 6&#039;5&quot;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The white one looks visibly excited upon seeing you, jumping up and walking over to you, leaning down to sniff at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh boy. It was going to be an interesting night.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The gray wolf on the other hand, looks distressed upon seeing you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;There was a Human outside!? But It&#039;s so cold! He could get hurt!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now you have 3 wolves standing around you. One of them actively sniffing at you, one chastising you for being out in the extreme cold, and one just looking at you with an unreadable expression.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The black wolf pipes up, and tells the other two to calm down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Human. My name is Harriet. These are my friends. The white one is Beth, and the gray one is Lily. What&#039;s yours?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell them your name is Anon, and they all greet you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They move to the couch, and the white one practically drags you over, having a firm grip on your arm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking at the room, It seems quite spacious. In the main room there&#039;s a small room with a table and chairs, with a coffee machine, a hot plate, and a mini-fridge sitting on a counter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;On the other side of the room there&#039;s a couch and a large stuffed chair near a TV.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In the living room area, there&#039;s two doors. One of which leads to the Bathroom, and the other leads to a Bedroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you sit down on the couch, you&#039;re sandwiched in-between Beth the white wolf, and Lily the gray wolf.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Harriet sat down across from you in the chair.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tried to take off your coat, but Lily insisted you keep it on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It&#039;s too cold out, Anon! You&#039;ll freeze!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Beth swings her arm around your shoulders and pulls you close to her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry, Lily. I&#039;ll keep him warm.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lily scooches even closer to the two of you, and gives a small growl at Beth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;No, I will!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fuck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Harriet snarls at both of them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Girls, stop bothering him!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They both back off a bit, but they still remain close to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Harriet continues:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So, Anon. What brings a Human to this town?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell them you were driving across the country, wanting to see as much of it as you could. It had always been a dream of yours.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were only staying in town because your car had some issues you needed identified.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Beth perks up a bit upon hearing you mention your car needing a mechanic</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before any of them could respond, you ask them where they were from, as they didn&#039;t have the distinct Minnesotan accent like the Beaver in the lobby had.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lily responds first.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Me and Harriet are from Ohio. We come up here every year in the winter, because our families are from here. It&#039;s nice to visit them.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Beth lives up here. She stays with us when we come here though. It would be too crowded for the three of us at her house.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gestures to the two other wolves in the room with you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We aren&#039;t related, though. Just good friends.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell them where you&#039;re from, and they nod.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Beth turns to talk to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So Anon... If the mechanic can&#039;t fix your car, does that mean you&#039;ll get to stay here longer~?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her maybe. You didn&#039;t even know what was wrong with it. You weren&#039;t much of a car person.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;That&#039;s... Interesting.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The three of you talk at length about various topics such as hobbies, traveling, and eventually you get on the topic of the weather.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lily is talking to you about Humans and cold weather.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I just don&#039;t know how you can stand it out there with no fur! You HAVE to be freezing.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her it&#039;s not that bad without a coat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And besides, you grew up in the Midwest.

What if you got stranded and froze?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her it&#039;s not like you&#039;re a reptile or something.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re still a mammal who can generate body heat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Suddenly, Beth interrupts:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yeah, but you don&#039;t generate as much as us wolves.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come here, let me show you~&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She takes your hand and presses it into the floof under her neck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She wasn&#039;t kidding.

&gt;Be Anon.
&gt;You were 26, and stand at 5&#039;11&quot;.
&gt;You were traveling across the country, seeing the sights.
&gt;You had won a decent amount of money in a local lottery, and had been spending it on a large vacation, wanting to see all of America.
&gt;You had been driving through Minnesota during the middle of Winter.
&gt;Or at least you had been, until your old, beat up Sedan had broken down.
&gt;As a result, you had been stranded in a small Anthro logging town.
&gt;You had left it with a local Mechanic, but he wouldn&#039;t be in until Monday morning due to illness.
&gt;Fortunately, it was Sunday, so you only had to wait a until tomorrow until you could leave town. Well, assuming that he can fix your car of course.
&gt;To top everything off, it was -10° outside.

&gt;You were currently standing in the lobby of a small hotel.
&gt;Looking into your wallet, you saw you had just enough cash on hand for a two-night stay in the hotel.
&gt;You could head to an ATM to get cash to pay for the car repairs, but it was going to put an unwanted dent in your finances.
&gt;You sigh, and walk up to the counter.
&gt;Walking up, you see a bored looking Anthro Beaver sitting at the desk.
&gt;She instantly perks up when she sees you, a surprised look on her face.
&gt;&quot;Oh wow, a Human. What can I do for yah, Sir?&quot;
&gt;Her Minnesotan accent hits you like a brick, and you have to stifle a laugh.
&gt;You tell her you plan on renting a room for the night.
&gt;She nods with a smile, and tells you the cost.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s $80 for the night, Sir. You hafta pay in advance.&quot;
&gt;You nod, and hand her the appropriate amount of cash.
&gt;&quot;Oh! One more thing, sir.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You see, this hotel is communal, dont&#039;cha know. You&#039;ll be sharing your room with three other guests. It&#039;s an Anthro thing. Safety in numbers, and all that.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry, they&#039;re regulars here, and we&#039;ve never received a complaint about them.&quot;
&gt;Shit. The last thing you wanted to do was interact with more Anthros.
&gt;You weren&#039;t prejudiced, but you were always a bit nervous around members of other species.
&gt;She hands you a small keycard for your room.
&gt;&quot;Here you go, Sir.&quot;
&gt;You thank her, and she gives you a nervous smile.
&gt;&quot;Umm... Can you do a quick favor for me, Sir?&quot;
&gt;She pulls out her phone.
&gt;&quot;We don&#039;t see a lot of Humans around here. You&#039;re actually the second one I&#039;ve ever seen in person.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Would you mind if I... Got a quick picture?&quot;
&gt;She sheepishly smiles, a bit embarrassed.
&gt;You simply shrug and tell her it would be fine.
&gt;&quot;Great! Okay, let me get next to you...&quot;
&gt;She walks around the counter, and stands next to you.
&gt;She puts her arm around your shoulder, and holds the phone up to take a selfie of the two of you.
&gt;&quot;Smile.&quot;
&gt;You give a small smile, and she takes a picture.
&gt;&quot;Sweet! Thanks, Human. My friends&#039;ll all be so jealous I met me a real Human.&quot;
&gt;You tell her goodbye, and you turn to head up to your room.

&gt;You stop in front of your room, and you can hear voices inside.
&gt;It must be your temporary &quot;roommates&quot;.
&gt;You knock, and the voices go quiet.
&gt;The door swings open, and you&#039;re greeted by the sight of a large female Wolf. She looks to be around 6&#039;3&quot;, and has black fur.
&gt;She looks at you and gives you a curious look.
&gt;&quot;A Human? What are you doing here?&quot;
&gt;You hold up the keycard, and tell her you&#039;ll be staying with her for a couple days.
&gt;&quot;Oh. Well, come on in then.&quot;
&gt;You enter, and get a look at the other two guests.
&gt;They&#039;re both wolves too!
&gt;One has white fur, and stands at 6&#039;2&quot;. The other has dark gray fur, and stands at 6&#039;5&quot;.
&gt;The white one looks visibly excited upon seeing you, jumping up and walking over to you, leaning down to sniff at you.
&gt;Oh boy. It was going to be an interesting night.
&gt;The gray wolf on the other hand, looks distressed upon seeing you.
&gt;&quot;There was a Human outside!? But It&#039;s so cold! He could get hurt!&quot;
&gt;Now you have 3 wolves standing around you. One of them actively sniffing at you, one chastising you for being out in the extreme cold, and one just looking at you with an unreadable expression.
&gt;The black wolf pipes up, and tells the other two to calm down.
&gt;&quot;Human. My name is Harriet. These are my friends. The white one is Beth, and the gray one is Lily. What&#039;s yours?&quot;
&gt;You tell them your name is Anon, and they all greet you.
&gt;They move to the couch, and the white one practically drags you over, having a firm grip on your arm.

&gt;Looking at the room, It seems quite spacious. In the main room there&#039;s a small room with a table and chairs, with a coffee machine, a hot plate, and a mini-fridge sitting on a counter.
&gt;On the other side of the room there&#039;s a couch and a large stuffed chair near a TV.
&gt;In the living room area, there&#039;s two doors. One of which leads to the Bathroom, and the other leads to a Bedroom.
&gt;As you sit down on the couch, you&#039;re sandwiched in-between Beth the white wolf, and Lily the gray wolf.
&gt;Harriet sat down across from you in the chair.
&gt;You tried to take off your coat, but Lily insisted you keep it on.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s too cold out, Anon! You&#039;ll freeze!&quot;
&gt;Beth swings her arm around your shoulders and pulls you close to her.
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry, Lily. I&#039;ll keep him warm.&quot;
&gt;Lily scooches even closer to the two of you, and gives a small growl at Beth.
&gt;&quot;No, I will!&quot;
&gt;Fuck.
&gt;Harriet snarls at both of them.
&gt;&quot;Girls, stop bothering him!&quot;
&gt;They both back off a bit, but they still remain close to you.
&gt;Harriet continues:
&gt;&quot;So, Anon. What brings a Human to this town?&quot;
&gt;You tell them you were driving across the country, wanting to see as much of it as you could. It had always been a dream of yours.
&gt;You were only staying in town because your car had some issues you needed identified.
&gt;Beth perks up a bit upon hearing you mention your car needing a mechanic
&gt;Before any of them could respond, you ask them where they were from, as they didn&#039;t have the distinct Minnesotan accent like the Beaver in the lobby had.
&gt;Lily responds first.
&gt;&quot;Me and Harriet are from Ohio. We come up here every year in the winter, because our families are from here. It&#039;s nice to visit them.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Beth lives up here. She stays with us when we come here though. It would be too crowded for the three of us at her house.&quot;
&gt;She gestures to the two other wolves in the room with you.
&gt;&quot;We aren&#039;t related, though. Just good friends.&quot;
&gt;You tell them where you&#039;re from, and they nod.
&gt;Beth turns to talk to you.
&gt;&quot;So Anon... If the mechanic can&#039;t fix your car, does that mean you&#039;ll get to stay here longer~?
&gt;You tell her maybe. You didn&#039;t even know what was wrong with it. You weren&#039;t much of a car person.
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s... Interesting.&quot;

&gt;The three of you talk at length about various topics such as hobbies, traveling, and eventually you get on the topic of the weather.
&gt;Lily is talking to you about Humans and cold weather.
&gt;&quot;I just don&#039;t know how you can stand it out there with no fur! You HAVE to be freezing.&quot;
&gt;You tell her it&#039;s not that bad without a coat.
&gt;And besides, you grew up in the Midwest. You weren&#039;t some fag from Florida who prepared for an ice age when it hit 40° outside.
&gt;&quot;Yeah, but you said your car broke down... What if you got stranded and froze?&quot;
&gt;You tell her it&#039;s not like you&#039;re a reptile or something.
&gt;You&#039;re still a mammal who can generate body heat.
&gt;Suddenly, Beth interrupts:
&gt;&quot;Yeah, but you don&#039;t generate as much as us wolves.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Come here, let me show you~&quot;
&gt;She takes your hand and presses it into the floof under her neck.
&gt;She wasn&#039;t kidding. Her fur is really warm and soft...
&gt;Looking back at Lily, her eyes just about pop out of her canid skull when she sees you touching Beth near the chest.
&gt;Harriet is just smiling at the two of you, shaking her head.

&gt;Eventually, the clock strikes 9, and it&#039;s time to discuss sleeping arrangements.
&gt;There&#039;s 2 beds in the hotel room.
&gt;You say that you&#039;re willing to take the couch, but they&#039;re having none of it.
&gt;They decide that you can share a bed with Beth.
&gt;Lily seems a bit upset, but she concedes after a couple minutes of arguing.
&gt;You enter the bedroom, and look at the beds.
&gt;They&#039;re King sized, big enough for the two of you to sleep comfortably.
&gt;Well, at least she wouldn&#039;t be pressed up against you all night.
&gt;You turn around to ask who&#039;s going to get ready first, but what you see nearly causes you to choke to death.
&gt;They&#039;re all in various stages of getting undressed.
&gt;Beth is smiling at you, and winks.
&gt;Oh shit.
&gt;Harriet notices your confusion and explains:
&gt;&quot;Oh, Wolves usually sleep in the nude.&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s a culture thing. You wouldn&#039;t understand, Anon.&quot;
&gt;You shrug. It was only for one night, so who cares?
&gt;You head into the bathroom and change into your sleepwear.

&gt;When you enter the bedroom again, the wolves are all naked, tits hanging out and everything.
&gt;The wolves crawl into their beds, but you hesitate.
&gt;Shit, were you really going to sleep next to a naked wolf?
&gt;Beth looks up at you and cocks her head in confusion.
&gt;&quot;Anon, aren&#039;t you coming to bed? It&#039;s late...&quot;
&gt;Shit, you guess you are.
&gt;You nod, and walk over to the bed.
&gt;Beth smiles at you as you slip under the covers.
&gt;You try to keep a buffer zone in between you two, but it&#039;s quickly violated when Beth reaches over and pulls you over close to her.
&gt;You&#039;re thinking of a way out of this, when all of a sudden a large boom shatters the silence.
&gt;The lights cut out and you&#039;re left in complete darkness.
&gt;Beth clutches you tightly, and Harriet jumps out of bed, running into the living room.
&gt;After a couple minutes she returns, shaking her head.
&gt;&quot;Some dumbass ran into a utility pole and brought down some wires. Power&#039;s out on the whole block.&quot;
&gt;&quot;EMTs are there, but it looks like the power is going to be down for awhile.&quot;
&gt;The power&#039;s out?
&gt;Oh shit, that means the heat is out.
&gt;You voice your concern, and Lily pops out of bed immediately and climbs in bed with you without a word.
&gt;She whispers in your ear.
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry, Anon. I won&#039;t let you be cold...&quot;
&gt;Harriet shrugs, then gets back into bed alone.
&gt;&quot;Nothing to get worked up over, just some idiot...&quot;
&gt;Harriet drifts off to sleep, leaving you, Beth, and Lily awake and pressed up against each other.

&gt;Shit, this is a tight spot you&#039;re in.
&gt;In more ways than one.
&gt;Beth and Lily are on opposite edges of the bed, with you wedged in the middle.
&gt;You&#039;re facing Beth, and she has you in a death grip, one of her hands against your back, and her other hand pressing your face into her neck floof.
&gt;Lily is pressed up against your back, her wet nose pressing into your neck.
&gt;20 minutes pass, and you&#039;re pretty sure everyone is asleep.
&gt;It&#039;s starting to get cold.
&gt;If it was -10° when it was still light out, you can&#039;t even imagine how cold it must be now.
&gt;Against your better judgement, you slip your arms around Beth, and squeeze closer to her.
&gt;Your head pressed against her, you can hear an appreciative rumble, and she begins to slowly rub your back.
&gt;Nope, she was still wide awake.
&gt;Her tongue darts out of her mouth and starts to paint your forehead in saliva.
&gt;Suddenly, you can hear a grunt from across the room.
&gt;It&#039;s Harriet.
&gt;&quot;Fuck it... Hey girls, make some room for me. It&#039;s colder than a brass toilet seat over here.&quot;
&gt;There&#039;s no more room in the bed, and Lily whines when Harriet tries to push her way in.
&gt;Beth actually growls a bit, and clutches you tightly.
&gt;&quot;Oh, shut up Beth... Make some room!&quot;
&gt;Beth growls a bit more, and says:
&gt;&quot;There IS no room. Now back off of Anon, he&#039;s mine...&quot;
&gt;Wait, what?
&gt;Beth brings her snout down into your shaggy hair, and sniffs deeply.
&gt;Harriet realizes there&#039;s no room on the sides, so she resorts to drastic measure.
&gt;She goes to the bottom of the bed, and crawls in through there.
&gt;She rests on top of all three of you, and she rubs against you a bit, trying to get comfortable.

&gt;You had pity for those who had never felt what it was like to be surrounded by soft, warm, Anthro wolf fur from all three sides.
&gt;Beth had you in a tight grip, her nose pressing into your hair, and you were almost enveloped by her soft coat.
&gt;Lily was pressing against your back with her muzzle resting on the side of your head.
&gt;Harriet was sprawled out on top of all three of you, her weight pressing you down into the soft mattress.
&gt;Her weight would have been uncomfortable, but it was evenly distributed across all three of you laying on the mattress.
&gt;They were all asleep and snoring lightly.
&gt;You didn&#039;t think you would be able to hold off on sleep much longer.
&gt;You close your eyes for a couple seconds, but you can&#039;t seem to get them to open again.
&gt;And with that, sleep takes you.

&gt;The next morning after everyone had woken up, you&#039;re sitting in the living room.
&gt;The power and heat was still out, and you were wearing your coat again.
&gt;Lily and Harriet were sitting next to you, trying to keep the &quot;poor, furless human&quot; warm.
&gt;You didn&#039;t tell them the coat was keeping you warm enough.
&gt;Beth had left to go to her job, leaving you alone.
&gt;When it comes time for you to leave to see the mechanic, you&#039;re almost remorseful at having to leave the lovely she-wolfs.
&gt;You gotta keep going though, you would burn up all your savings staying at this hotel.
&gt;Speaking of which, after speaking to the hotel manager, you had managed to get your money back.
&gt;They were really sorry for letting you sleep in a room without heat in sub-zero weather, especially a human.
&gt;You walk to the Mechanic a block away, and when you walk in the door, to your surprise you see a familiar face. Er, muzzle.
&gt;It&#039;s Beth!

&gt;&quot;Hey, Anon.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Bet you didn&#039;t know I was the mechanic you were waiting for.&quot;
&gt;&quot;So I was looking at your car, and I have bad news.&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s easily fixable, but I just don&#039;t have the parts.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I can order them, but it would take a week to get them.&quot;
&gt;&quot;So it looks like you&#039;re stuck here...&quot;
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry, though. Lily and Harriet might be leaving soon, but you can stay with me...&quot;
&gt;You can&#039;t help but smile.
&gt;Hey, at least you would be staying warm all night.
