Each one taxing your dwindling cash supply, like the ghosts of future expenses were haunting your bank account.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Rent was due by the end of the week, but you were already running a risk of missing another car payment, and you have to go grocery shopping today before the coupons that have been covering your ass expire.

Not in a nightmarish monster kind of way, or even like how the crusty bulldog janitor from middle school scared you with his creepy ass stank eye.

Even when she laughed it felt like she was putting everyone around her on eggshells.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You even confided in your neighbors about this and they all feel the same.

She called them her ‘nephews’ before, but half the time they weren’t even any kind of feline. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What gets to you is the eye patch, and the scar underneath it. A heavy piece of leather with bolts covering her eye, with a slash shaped path of scar tissue tracing underneath it down to her cheek.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The only people with that kind of scar are movie villains, but there it was, resting right on her permanently smirking face. Always grinning like she knew something no one else did.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sometimes, in a lapse of survival instinct, you let yourself take a look at the rest of her. She had the body of a retired fighter, something you noticed whenever you saw her wearing something that showed off her body.

The stupid part of you was curious how it would feel to squeeze, but the more intelligent part of you reminded yourself how much you liked having hands.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’ve seen her claws, too; most felines these days get them at least shortened, but you had seen hers when she was dragging them against the cheek of the otter that used to live next door to you while she was informing him of “How….upset…” she would be if he missed another rent payment. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was no big cat, but you’re pretty certain she could probably pop her fingers into someone’s throat and pull out their wind box like some kind of slasher movie.

She’s got jokes, apparently.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shaking your head in response with one hand firmly on a guard rail, you start making your way down the stairs, “No, ah ha, I was uh, about to go grocery shopping, maybe pick up some dinner on the way home.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">---</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nodding as if pleased with the answer, she waited, singular blue eye on you as approached. Her arms were still crossed, but her tail flicked back and forth as she watched.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Passing knowledge of feline body language reminded you that meant she was interested in what she was seeing. In any other cat, it would make you curious. Seeing your landlord eyeball you as you got closer only made you hold your breath and hope she would find something else to look at.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take the time to look around the parking lot. There’s some people a few apartment buildings down, bustling around a car. The Borils, you guess.

Her convertible is right there with the top down, and there certainly isn’t anyone else in it. Did she come here alone?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually you run out of steps and land on the sidewalk next to the feline woman. The usual smirk isn’t on her face, and it looks like she’s considering something. She had the whole walk down to start a conversation, but she kept silent on your descent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Might as well bite the bullet and deal with this before your heart just gives up and you keel over out of stress. “What’s up, Mrs. Labbate?” What if she’s here to tell you stay out of the house while she kills your noisy ass neighbors? You would be down for that, at least.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I wanted to talk to you about your rent situation.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh. She’s here to kill you, instead.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wonder if your dad thought you were serious about the stupid catch phrase you joked about having put on your headstone.</div></li></ol>        </div>

&gt;Ariannis Labbate, your golden haired landlord and current audience to your brush with death. And judging from the toothy grin on her face, she finds it hilarious. Goddammit; only a cat could almost kill someone and think it was funny.
&gt;”In a hurry, are we?” You can hear the barely restrained laughter behind the question. She’s got jokes, apparently.
&gt;Shaking your head in response with one hand firmly on a guard rail, you start making your way down the stairs, “No, ah ha, I was uh, about to go grocery shopping, maybe pick up some dinner on the way home.”
---
&gt;Nodding as if pleased with the answer, she waited, singular blue eye on you as approached. Her arms were still crossed, but her tail flicked back and forth as she watched.
&gt;Passing knowledge of feline body language reminded you that meant she was interested in what she was seeing. In any other cat, it would make you curious. Seeing your landlord eyeball you as you got closer only made you hold your breath and hope she would find something else to look at.
&gt;You take the time to look around the parking lot. There’s some people a few apartment buildings down, bustling around a car. The Borils, you guess. It looks like the usual pack of mice children swarming while their parents try to corral them into the family van.
&gt;What gets you is the fact that there isn’t a single one of her ‘nephews’ in sight. Her convertible is right there with the top down, and there certainly isn’t anyone else in it. Did she come here alone?
&gt;Eventually you run out of steps and land on the sidewalk next to the feline woman. The usual smirk isn’t on her face, and it looks like she’s considering something. She had the whole walk down to start a conversation, but she kept silent on your descent.
&gt;Might as well bite the bullet and deal with this before your heart just gives up and you keel over out of stress. “What’s up, Mrs. Labbate?” What if she’s here to tell you stay out of the house while she kills your noisy ass neighbors? You would be down for that, at least.
&gt;”I wanted to talk to you about your rent situation.”
&gt;Oh. She’s here to kill you, instead.
&gt;You wonder if your dad thought you were serious about the stupid catch phrase you joked about having put on your headstone.</textarea>
