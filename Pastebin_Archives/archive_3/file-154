You browse the web on your PC for a few hours still blocking out the totally boring night your friends must be having but it weighs in your mind about what there doing with &quot;What If&#039;s&quot; flooding your thoughts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You resort to getting comfortable on your bed, getting some blankets and watching 90&#039;s sitcom&#039;s, you&#039;d pretend you didn&#039;t think that deep down this is how you wanted to live, your friends all care-free and happy, and everybody has a girlfriend. Suddenly your phone pings, you check the message, you wonderd if it was your friends asking you to come out to join them. You open the lock screen with bated breath. &quot;Domino&#039;s Pizza  Friday deal only £11.99!&quot; Fuck this. You open the browser on your phone, and search how to be confident and be popular, you didn&#039;t want to take pills so wiki-how&#039;s had to do. Hours apon hours of browsing with the accompanying sound of canned laughter you were on supernatural forums, they were really creepy looking with all black and grey theme with blood for text, this must have been the pinnacle of edge ten years ago. You spot a thread, it was new, this month&#039;s date in fact, it was under the tag &quot;demon/daeity girlfriend&#039;s general&quot; well at least you could laugh at the autism. You open the forum, your eyes are immediately drawn to the &quot;MAL0 2.0.apk LINK REMOVED CLICK HERE&quot; Youtuber&#039;s must really be scraped for money these days to click-bait here. You thought to yourself, you read the op&#039;s description.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1"> &quot;Mal0 2.0 new version more fur on head, has pupils in eyes this time, skull intact in this version, except around eyes and bottom jaw, app has logo on homepage this time,it may look like shit now but the more you use the app the more features you unlock untill your loving girlfriend is right in front of you!, never talk to human girls again, what do you guys think?, I&#039;m not going to click I just saved it&quot; the responces were a little bit negative to say the least with OP taking maximum damage. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;&gt; Skull Mask. fuck off.&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Mal0 2.0 not 1.0 wew lad&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;fuck off with that click-bait shit pewdiepie&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You wonder how the poster took it, he hasn&#039;t been online since. You think about downloading the link, it was just a joke, there&#039;s no way a monster girlfriend is in a app, right?.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You tap the link, downloading has never been this fast before, &quot;fuck! it must have been adware! this is someone&#039;s fault but my own&quot; but as quick as it said downloading it&#039;s gone, you open to the home looking for the app, in the centre pushing away other apps, a very small black circle with white arrows pointing inwards with &quot;Mal0 2.0&quot; underneath.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You open the app it&#039;s just a text box, no photo no emoji con, nothing, and not even a so-called &quot;app girlfriend&quot;, what a waste of storage, you press down on the app to uninstall it but nothing happens, you press harder, still nothing, in case of breaking your phone you just turn it off, it&#039;s not like you wanna hear about the escapades of chad MC chaddinton all night. You get back to watching TV until you feel tired and fall asleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The next morning, a groggy grumpy mess, you make some coffee, sure you&#039;re friends may have got laid but will have the dark aroma of perculated coffee through there noses?, Checkmate socialites. You turn your phone back on, hopefully a hard reboot will have removed the app from your phone, it&#039;s still there in the centre just staying there. Menacingly. But before you can tap the shit out of our phone your ears are greeted to the sound of the most pleasant sound in the world. The sound of a group messages from the night before, a machine gun turret of pings fill your ears. You throw the phone across the room, half the annoying noise and the other having to read through &quot;DUDE YOU WERE SO DRUNK LMAO XD&quot; posts. You sip your morning coffee when your hear a loud banging at the door, you never went to bed naked in case a burglar would punch you in your dick, so you don&#039;t have an excuse to not open it, you unenthusiastically open the door, it was your friend. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hey bro&quot; you hated using it but it seemed like a &quot;bro&quot; moment. &quot;Hey Anon you had fun last night!&quot; He may be very sociable but he&#039;s not a dick so you can tell he wasn&#039;t being sarcastic, &quot;Nah just the usual&quot; you take a sip from the coffee and notice his clothes, he changed but it was still early. Your baffled by it. &quot;Wait; it&#039;s seven and your already dressed? Didn&#039;t you go drinking?&quot; You rub your eyes, there&#039;s not enough coffee in the world right now to wake you up from this nightmare that is your lifestyle. He laughs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yeah I got changed after I came back home, I drank all night and didn&#039;t get a hangover, can you believe that!?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Yes. I . Can. You perfect faggot. You retort in your head. You must have a jealous frown on your face as your friend breaks into a uncomfortable smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Err...anyway did you see the pics I sent on discord?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You don&#039;t even use it, it was something you were forced to get on your phone, you don&#039;t have any friends other then the one in your flat so you just used it for when you too lazy to search for porn. You friend picks up your phone, before he can ask why it&#039;s on the floor by some knocked over Dr pepper cans, he looks at the messages from last night.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hah these are awesome, you seen em&#039; Anon?&quot; He walks over to you as you close the door, hes swipes through the messages, and checks the discord, suddenly you spot a dm at you on the channel. &quot;Ha did @Anon stay home again he&#039;s never getting laid lol&quot; your friend sees the anger on your face as she turns the screen off, &quot;hey don&#039;t worry about it so you don&#039;t go out who cares right?&quot; He&#039;s trying to console you in his own way but it&#039;s from far helping, but as you want to through your phone out the window a noise comes from it, it&#039;s not a regular notification noise it&#039;s reverbed and sounds like it&#039;s playing backwards, your friend thinks it&#039;s just a another discord notification but his brow raises at the phone &quot;that&#039;s odd&quot; he says as he squints at the phone. &quot;What is it?&quot; You ask your friend intrigued by his facial expression, &quot;Dunno&#039; you tell me&quot; he passes your phone back to you, you look at the logo in the centre of the screen, it&#039;s not flashing but there&#039;s heat lines, like you&#039;d seen in the desert, you open the app the once empty text box now filled.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">__________________________________</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;T̶h̶a̴n̶k̸s̶ ̷f̵o̶r̷ ̵l̷a̷s̴t̶ ̸n̸i̷g̶h̸t̵ ̴b̵a̶b̸y̵ ̷;̷)̶&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Woah! you got some last night anon!&quot; Your friend slaps your back with a congratulatory smile, without thinking you respond.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Pfft yeah bro, I pumped and dumped last night just kept it q.t is all&quot; hopefully if you speak bro lingo he won&#039;t know your lying</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Nice one bro! is she coming out with us tonight?&quot; He heads out the door and opens it, you think of an excuse as to why your fictitious one night stand can&#039;t come</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Uhh, I&#039;ll see if I can message her again, I&#039;ll talk to you later&quot; with that you gently push him out the door and tend to your phone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You look at this message, the stars must have aligned to make some girl accidentally text your number or it really did come from that app. Or it was a chat bot, still it couldn&#039;t hurt to respond, god even the keyboard for the app looks old, it has a old 90&#039;s font, it looks plain and boring, but you still type away to this heroine of the hour.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Who is this?&quot; You put in the chat box; No response, it must have been a really lucky message that came through at the right time, but still, it&#039;s a pretty big coincidence so you write a bit more. &quot;Thanks stranger, you saved me from looking like a loser&quot;. You leave it at that and go about your day.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">An hour later, while eating some noodles on your sofa, you hear that reverbed backwards ping sound from your phone, could it be the app, not thinking it&#039;s from that creepy app but you still check what it was.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I̴̥̤͑̂t̸̺̆͌ ̴̮͎̉w̸͙͝ͅa̶̝̟̓s̶̪̙̊ ̴͙͕͌͑n̸̰̈̓ŏ̷̹͝t̸͕́h̵̝͗i̶̢̛n̷̿̉ͅg̸̯͚̓&quot; what the fuck, it worked, not only that but the font of the app had changed it was now using a regular android keyboard, the simple text box had a black picture above the text box. &quot;Maybe the app just needed an update or something.&quot; You go back to the forum where you first saw the app a posted a message.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hey I thought you were lying op but it worked... I think&quot; suddenly you get a two replies &quot;really! No way! I thought you&#039;d be dead, but you might want to open this; it should tell you what you&#039;re in for. I found it on a deep web app store, but it got removed shortly, luckly I saved it. It seems somebody really doesn&#039;t want these apps in the public eye&quot; The post had a file underneath &quot;Mal0 2.0. description. .txt.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The other one must have been a creepy stalker or someone even more desperate than you. &quot;Hey that&#039;s a cool app why don&#039;t you give me your address so we can be friends and talk about it&quot; it sounded wierd.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You open the file that the op had given you it was very basic only text but was worded like it was selling the app to you, it read;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;The Malo version 2.0 has been moniterd and fully tested with amazing results, made from the previous versions this one is different as it&#039;s been made with the help of human DNA. Her personality has been described as energetic, protective, and even lustful, although most have used &quot;happy&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Although mixed with human dna she still has the same skull like facial feature leaving only fur around the eyes, although having human like pupils, the pupil eye colour has had a change of shade from pure white to milky grey, all though rumours of blue eyes are specualting online but it has never been proven or debunked. She and has a standered canine jaw, the mixture of human DNA has made 2.0 more anthro and has reduced fur leaving her body shape femmine, even though these are major difference&#039;s, the one that has been found pleasing is that the speech from the final physical manifestation of 2.0 has been found to be more fluent in speech, however it&#039;s still very robotic/demonic and definitely non-human sounding. If you are one of the lucky people to install 2.0. The great thing about 2.0 is she begins as a text box with her very own app logo to make communication easier.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1"> here is what to expect If downloaded;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Once installed, simply chat to the Malo 2 though her text box, this will be in her early stages- she will become more and more responsive through usage. Once you have responded she will upgrade the app to keep  it interesting and modern so you feel familiar with the app, she will have appeared above the text box, but she cannot be seen, even apon max brightness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">This will be followed by an emoticon feature as well as theme changes, she may use them if needed to convey something that text can&#039;t. Along with the background image changing only showing her eyes. Entering the final stage of Malo 2.0 she will have complete control of your phone, any media and option, including the built-in microphone. And lastly she will manifest to a physical form, this part is out of our hands and it all comes down to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Reading all this feels a bit overwhelming but you knew what you were getting yourself into, the what If&#039;s of using this app were drowned out by two words over and over again &quot;App. Girlfriend.&quot; You didn&#039;t care that it was some skull demon if she would give you a chance and talk to you it was worth it. You check the time, it was getting late and you had to get ready, you skipped out on last night so you purposely made the effort tonight for your friends sake. Should you tell your friend about the app?. Nah, he wouldn&#039;t believe you, the description said that she would upgrade apon frequent use so you decide to check it out again before heading out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hey I&#039;m going out tonight, I&#039;ll talk later&quot; you await a response, with it replying it would prove that the app really does work. Then it comes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;0k 1&#039;ll talk to y0u later&quot; the message came quick the message had less random capital letters although it still had number&#039;s, but like the app said it was improving.

You&#039;d almost forgot about what he said before. &quot;Ahh~ yeah, I tried messaging her but no response so...&quot; You shrug your shoulders and leave it at that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">While your friend confidentiality talks to girls and other guys like there long life friends you wonder what the app is doing, is it still on while the phone off?

As your phone charges you wonder about what Malo said right before you went to sleep, it couldn&#039;t be a guess she knew you had the battery halfway, you think back to the stages of the app; &quot;The text box...the upgrades...&quot; You mumble thinking out loud then it hits you, this is her final stage untill she&#039;s physical, your heart races in excitement at the thought and your mind wonders with the possibilities of what might happen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">But it can wait, you watch some some decade old clip show of people falling over and hurting themselves on TV, you go to the cupboard to get some snacking food when you see you have run out of sensations crisps, anyone who didn&#039;t think sweet tai chilli flavour is the best one has a plebian taste pallet.

You go to turn the phones screen on but you can see it turned it&#039;s self on. You pick up the phone, the digital clock widget that you used to see when you open the phone has turned into letters &quot;07734&quot; you open apps to see what&#039;s changed you reach the anticipated app before you do, you hear a very tinny voice eminating from your phone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;It&#039;s okay, you don&#039;t have to use the app anymore.&quot; A distinctive American female voice crackled through the phone, It was lo-fi, like a forgotten message on a answering message a decade ago just now being heard. You almost drop the phone in shock. A strange but yet, alluring voice that sends chills through your body-it&#039;s almost time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;M-malo is that you.&quot; You answer with nervousness in your voice you squint at the phone trying to see anything but can only see a regular phone. &quot;Yeah it&#039;s me. It&#039;s not...too scary is it?.&quot; Although Malo&#039;s voice was robotic you can hear the emotion in every word, sounding dejected in response of something negative.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;N-no it&#039;s fine, just scared me is all, before it felt like you were an advance ai but hearing you speak is, well, it feels real&quot;.

You mind races with questions to say. &quot;Hey Malo, I can&#039;t see your face but can you see me?.&quot; You wonder if that question was stupid but you are talking to a demon entity in your phone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yeah I can see you, I&#039;m looking through your phones front camera.&quot; You stare at the lens hoping to see something resembling a figure but it&#039;s impossible, but with her saying that you feel she&#039;s right behind that lens. You don&#039;t want to do anything embarrassing but if your phone is sentient you might as well try to use it&#039;s features.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;So...Malo you can see, did you want to watch something from the camera?.&quot; You can&#039;t believe the words coming out of your mouth. &quot;Sure, oh, and don&#039;t worry about the resolution, it&#039;s perfectly fine.&quot; Your glad that she wants too but now your going to &quot;Netflix and chill&quot;...with a phone?.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;So how do I go about this&quot;. You though to yourself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You can just place me on the sofa.&quot; Oh shit you forgot you weren&#039;t alone she can hear everything now. You cautiously place the phone next to you, you chuck the bag of crisps away, you don&#039;t want Malo to think you&#039;re a loser who eats in front of the TV all day, you go on your phone sometimes as well after all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">So here you are watching Frasier with your phone with-for all you know it could be Zuckerburg trolling you. You can&#039;t even put your arm across like they do in the movies. You pretend to watch but your eyes keep darting over the still phone, can it see you?, How good is her vision?, When is she coming out the phone, you don&#039;t plan on sticking your dick into a charger port.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Say Malo, when do you have a body of your own?&quot;. You try to ask nonchalantly. &quot;Soon&quot; well that just solves everything then doesn&#039;t it. &quot;Uhh, can you be a bit more specific.&quot; Hopefully you&#039;ll get more information. &quot;No sorry i-it&#039;s your phone my choice I&#039;m just not ready yet okay!.&quot; She raised her voice, you didn&#039;t know that it was because she felt uncomfortable. You lean closer to the phone an cooed softly. &quot;Hey, it&#039;s okay Malo, is all right, when your ready your ready, I won&#039;t pressure by you into doing anything you don&#039;t want to.&quot; Unfortunately you couldn&#039;t read her face but her voice sounded reassured. &quot;Okay thanks Anon...&quot; You figure it would be best to just drop it and continue watching TV.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A few hours pass and now your on the shit seasons of Frasier where Miles is with Daphne.

Fear starts to set in left with only the sound of the heavy rain and inky black room suffocating you.You feel a chill all through your body, you&#039;re too scared to call out Malo&#039;s name so you sit in silence, eventually you get the courage to turn the lights back on looking around the room, you look around the lighted room, and still kept in the dark was your bedroom, and in your bedroom was piercing blue eyes staring back at you. &quot;Hello.&quot; You call out but there&#039;s no reply, your heart races with excitement as a hairy animal foot steps out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You finally see her in all her form; A werewolf creature standing in the dim living room light, she had a light grey fur in front her front body that ended at the top of her inner legs and blackish dark grey fur everywhere else, but the most prominent feature on her was the skull like head she had, you find in hard to find the right words but Malo was the first to break the silence.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;So... this is me.&quot; She says sheepishly you look her up and down her voice still robotic and low quality but you couldn&#039;t care, you just happy she&#039;s real in front of you, you walk a little closer to her staring into her eyes, the words finally come to you. &quot;It doesn&#039;t feel real, like I&#039;m in a dream.

As much as you like her body you don&#039;t feel comfortable  talking to her like this, well, not yet anyway. &quot;I have a t-shirt you can put on, and some boxers.&quot; She looks at your bedroom and looks around opening and closing draws in the dark, she&#039;s acting like she&#039;s never been in the real world before.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hey Malo did you want the light on?&quot;  You inquire while sitting back down on the sofa. &quot;I&#039;m okay, my vision can see in the dark, all the better to stalk my pray before I eat them.&quot; She said sounding purposely sinister at that last part obviously she was joking.

But she wasn&#039;t wearing an old pair of boxers, she was wearing your new pair you bought online, they were silk grey and had a gimmick of being breathable but you haven&#039;t even tried them on yet, but she sure does look cute in them, it&#039;s like you always imagined, she looks like one of those images you see on social media where the girlfriend wear the boyfriends clothes, she&#039;s like them, but not a vain dumb boring roastie.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She walks over to you and sits down you can&#039;t help but smile, she&#039;s real, she&#039;s sat next to you. &quot;So, should we watch some TV&quot; she chirped enthusiastically. You welcome the idea and search for something to watch you spot Malo with your crisp bag at eating away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Meah my maw you frow it away finking I didn&#039;t see&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She mumbles while eating a mouthful.

Malo starts to display her legs pointing them up to the roof. &quot;I knew you&#039;d like my body Anon when I entered my final form in the phone I had complete control, and looked at your browser history and saw what, you know,</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Like in your women&quot; or to be specific, anthro women.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She really changed her appearance based off what you fap to?.

It&#039;s nothing. Anyway, I&#039;m beat, I&#039;m going to bed.&quot; You shut off the TV and Malo touches your arm. &quot;Don&#039;t you mean *we&#039;re*.&quot; You  smile at Malo, it feels weird hearing her say that. She feels like a close friend that has come over and you expected to leave you all alone.

        <textarea class="textarea">You are Anon, you&#039;re a lonely wallflower who backed out of a friend&#039;s party and has now sealed your fate with the download of a simple app or that&#039;s what you thought.


I bet there having fun at that party, drinking, smoking weed, getting drunk, &quot;Hey anon why don&#039;t you come,&quot; &quot;yeah bro you might finally get a girlfriend&quot; &quot;stop looking at your phone and talk to other people, just be yourself&quot; well sorry, but unlike you guys shitposting and jerking off aren&#039;t interesting hobbies to talk about, no matter how hard I try for gold.

After having an argument with yourself, you do what you do every Friday night; Shit-post and watch TV. You browse the web on your PC for a few hours still blocking out the totally boring night your friends must be having but it weighs in your mind about what there doing with &quot;What If&#039;s&quot; flooding your thoughts.

You resort to getting comfortable on your bed, getting some blankets and watching 90&#039;s sitcom&#039;s, you&#039;d pretend you didn&#039;t think that deep down this is how you wanted to live, your friends all care-free and happy, and everybody has a girlfriend. Suddenly your phone pings, you check the message, you wonderd if it was your friends asking you to come out to join them. You open the lock screen with bated breath. &quot;Domino&#039;s Pizza  Friday deal only £11.99!&quot; Fuck this. You open the browser on your phone, and search how to be confident and be popular, you didn&#039;t want to take pills so wiki-how&#039;s had to do. Hours apon hours of browsing with the accompanying sound of canned laughter you were on supernatural forums, they were really creepy looking with all black and grey theme with blood for text, this must have been the pinnacle of edge ten years ago. You spot a thread, it was new, this month&#039;s date in fact, it was under the tag &quot;demon/daeity girlfriend&#039;s general&quot; well at least you could laugh at the autism. You open the forum, your eyes are immediately drawn to the &quot;MAL0 2.0.apk LINK REMOVED CLICK HERE&quot; Youtuber&#039;s must really be scraped for money these days to click-bait here. You thought to yourself, you read the op&#039;s description.

 &quot;Mal0 2.0 new version more fur on head, has pupils in eyes this time, skull intact in this version, except around eyes and bottom jaw, app has logo on homepage this time,it may look like shit now but the more you use the app the more features you unlock untill your loving girlfriend is right in front of you!, never talk to human girls again, what do you guys think?, I&#039;m not going to click I just saved it&quot; the responces were a little bit negative to say the least with OP taking maximum damage. 
&quot;&gt; Skull Mask. fuck off.&quot; 
&quot;Mal0 2.0 not 1.0 wew lad&quot; 
&quot;fuck off with that click-bait shit pewdiepie&quot;

You wonder how the poster took it, he hasn&#039;t been online since. You think about downloading the link, it was just a joke, there&#039;s no way a monster girlfriend is in a app, right?.
You tap the link, downloading has never been this fast before, &quot;fuck! it must have been adware! this is someone&#039;s fault but my own&quot; but as quick as it said downloading it&#039;s gone, you open to the home looking for the app, in the centre pushing away other apps, a very small black circle with white arrows pointing inwards with &quot;Mal0 2.0&quot; underneath.

You open the app it&#039;s just a text box, no photo no emoji con, nothing, and not even a so-called &quot;app girlfriend&quot;, what a waste of storage, you press down on the app to uninstall it but nothing happens, you press harder, still nothing, in case of breaking your phone you just turn it off, it&#039;s not like you wanna hear about the escapades of chad MC chaddinton all night. You get back to watching TV until you feel tired and fall asleep.

The next morning, a groggy grumpy mess, you make some coffee, sure you&#039;re friends may have got laid but will have the dark aroma of perculated coffee through there noses?, Checkmate socialites. You turn your phone back on, hopefully a hard reboot will have removed the app from your phone, it&#039;s still there in the centre just staying there. Menacingly. But before you can tap the shit out of our phone your ears are greeted to the sound of the most pleasant sound in the world. The sound of a group messages from the night before, a machine gun turret of pings fill your ears. You throw the phone across the room, half the annoying noise and the other having to read through &quot;DUDE YOU WERE SO DRUNK LMAO XD&quot; posts. You sip your morning coffee when your hear a loud banging at the door, you never went to bed naked in case a burglar would punch you in your dick, so you don&#039;t have an excuse to not open it, you unenthusiastically open the door, it was your friend. 
&quot;Hey bro&quot; you hated using it but it seemed like a &quot;bro&quot; moment. &quot;Hey Anon you had fun last night!&quot; He may be very sociable but he&#039;s not a dick so you can tell he wasn&#039;t being sarcastic, &quot;Nah just the usual&quot; you take a sip from the coffee and notice his clothes, he changed but it was still early. Your baffled by it. &quot;Wait; it&#039;s seven and your already dressed? Didn&#039;t you go drinking?&quot; You rub your eyes, there&#039;s not enough coffee in the world right now to wake you up from this nightmare that is your lifestyle. He laughs.
&quot;Yeah I got changed after I came back home, I drank all night and didn&#039;t get a hangover, can you believe that!?&quot;
Yes. I . Can. You perfect faggot. You retort in your head. You must have a jealous frown on your face as your friend breaks into a uncomfortable smile.
&quot;Err...anyway did you see the pics I sent on discord?&quot;
You don&#039;t even use it, it was something you were forced to get on your phone, you don&#039;t have any friends other then the one in your flat so you just used it for when you too lazy to search for porn. You friend picks up your phone, before he can ask why it&#039;s on the floor by some knocked over Dr pepper cans, he looks at the messages from last night.
&quot;Hah these are awesome, you seen em&#039; Anon?&quot; He walks over to you as you close the door, hes swipes through the messages, and checks the discord, suddenly you spot a dm at you on the channel. &quot;Ha did @Anon stay home again he&#039;s never getting laid lol&quot; your friend sees the anger on your face as she turns the screen off, &quot;hey don&#039;t worry about it so you don&#039;t go out who cares right?&quot; He&#039;s trying to console you in his own way but it&#039;s from far helping, but as you want to through your phone out the window a noise comes from it, it&#039;s not a regular notification noise it&#039;s reverbed and sounds like it&#039;s playing backwards, your friend thinks it&#039;s just a another discord notification but his brow raises at the phone &quot;that&#039;s odd&quot; he says as he squints at the phone. &quot;What is it?&quot; You ask your friend intrigued by his facial expression, &quot;Dunno&#039; you tell me&quot; he passes your phone back to you, you look at the logo in the centre of the screen, it&#039;s not flashing but there&#039;s heat lines, like you&#039;d seen in the desert, you open the app the once empty text box now filled.

&quot;Woah! you got some last night anon!&quot; Your friend slaps your back with a congratulatory smile, without thinking you respond.
&quot;Pfft yeah bro, I pumped and dumped last night just kept it q.t is all&quot; hopefully if you speak bro lingo he won&#039;t know your lying
&quot;Nice one bro! is she coming out with us tonight?&quot; He heads out the door and opens it, you think of an excuse as to why your fictitious one night stand can&#039;t come
&quot;Uhh, I&#039;ll see if I can message her again, I&#039;ll talk to you later&quot; with that you gently push him out the door and tend to your phone.

You look at this message, the stars must have aligned to make some girl accidentally text your number or it really did come from that app. Or it was a chat bot, still it couldn&#039;t hurt to respond, god even the keyboard for the app looks old, it has a old 90&#039;s font, it looks plain and boring, but you still type away to this heroine of the hour.

&quot;Who is this?&quot; You put in the chat box; No response, it must have been a really lucky message that came through at the right time, but still, it&#039;s a pretty big coincidence so you write a bit more. &quot;Thanks stranger, you saved me from looking like a loser&quot;. You leave it at that and go about your day.

An hour later, while eating some noodles on your sofa, you hear that reverbed backwards ping sound from your phone, could it be the app, not thinking it&#039;s from that creepy app but you still check what it was.

&quot;I̴̥̤͑̂t̸̺̆͌ ̴̮͎̉w̸͙͝ͅa̶̝̟̓s̶̪̙̊ ̴͙͕͌͑n̸̰̈̓ŏ̷̹͝t̸͕́h̵̝͗i̶̢̛n̷̿̉ͅg̸̯͚̓&quot; what the fuck, it worked, not only that but the font of the app had changed it was now using a regular android keyboard, the simple text box had a black picture above the text box. &quot;Maybe the app just needed an update or something.&quot; You go back to the forum where you first saw the app a posted a message.
&quot;Hey I thought you were lying op but it worked... I think&quot; suddenly you get a two replies &quot;really! No way! I thought you&#039;d be dead, but you might want to open this; it should tell you what you&#039;re in for. I found it on a deep web app store, but it got removed shortly, luckly I saved it. It seems somebody really doesn&#039;t want these apps in the public eye&quot; The post had a file underneath &quot;Mal0 2.0. description. .txt.&quot;
The other one must have been a creepy stalker or someone even more desperate than you. &quot;Hey that&#039;s a cool app why don&#039;t you give me your address so we can be friends and talk about it&quot; it sounded wierd.

You open the file that the op had given you it was very basic only text but was worded like it was selling the app to you, it read;

&quot;The Malo version 2.0 has been moniterd and fully tested with amazing results, made from the previous versions this one is different as it&#039;s been made with the help of human DNA. Her personality has been described as energetic, protective, and even lustful, although most have used &quot;happy&quot;

Although mixed with human dna she still has the same skull like facial feature leaving only fur around the eyes, although having human like pupils, the pupil eye colour has had a change of shade from pure white to milky grey, all though rumours of blue eyes are specualting online but it has never been proven or debunked. She and has a standered canine jaw, the mixture of human DNA has made 2.0 more anthro and has reduced fur leaving her body shape femmine, even though these are major difference&#039;s, the one that has been found pleasing is that the speech from the final physical manifestation of 2.0 has been found to be more fluent in speech, however it&#039;s still very robotic/demonic and definitely non-human sounding. If you are one of the lucky people to install 2.0. The great thing about 2.0 is she begins as a text box with her very own app logo to make communication easier.

 here is what to expect If downloaded;
Once installed, simply chat to the Malo 2 though her text box, this will be in her early stages- she will become more and more responsive through usage. Once you have responded she will upgrade the app to keep  it interesting and modern so you feel familiar with the app, she will have appeared above the text box, but she cannot be seen, even apon max brightness.
This will be followed by an emoticon feature as well as theme changes, she may use them if needed to convey something that text can&#039;t. Along with the background image changing only showing her eyes. Entering the final stage of Malo 2.0 she will have complete control of your phone, any media and option, including the built-in microphone. And lastly she will manifest to a physical form, this part is out of our hands and it all comes down to you.

Reading all this feels a bit overwhelming but you knew what you were getting yourself into, the what If&#039;s of using this app were drowned out by two words over and over again &quot;App. Girlfriend.&quot; You didn&#039;t care that it was some skull demon if she would give you a chance and talk to you it was worth it. You check the time, it was getting late and you had to get ready, you skipped out on last night so you purposely made the effort tonight for your friends sake. Should you tell your friend about the app?. Nah, he wouldn&#039;t believe you, the description said that she would upgrade apon frequent use so you decide to check it out again before heading out.
&quot;Hey I&#039;m going out tonight, I&#039;ll talk later&quot; you await a response, with it replying it would prove that the app really does work. Then it comes.
&quot;0k 1&#039;ll talk to y0u later&quot; the message came quick the message had less random capital letters although it still had number&#039;s, but like the app said it was improving. You save the battery on your phone and turn it off and head to the party.

              ________________________

You get to the house party that was well underway, you found your friend easily and wave him down, &quot;hey, so that girl couldn&#039;t come then?&quot; He asks while handing you a jack and coke. You&#039;d almost forgot about what he said before. &quot;Ahh~ yeah, I tried messaging her but no response so...&quot; You shrug your shoulders and leave it at that.

While your friend confidentiality talks to girls and other guys like there long life friends you wonder what the app is doing, is it still on while the phone off? Is it dead?, You rush to the bathroom and turn you phone back on greeted apon seeing the app and a pop up message saying &quot;15%&quot;; you&#039;d have to make this quick.

You open the app, it had a complete update of design it looked like any other messaging app, apart from two white circles in the middle. You could change the theme of they keyboard and text box the boxes were rectangular and had smooth curves, unlike the simple white box from before, you chose a white and black theme. And responded.
&quot;Hello MAL0 2.0 you there&quot; you wait for a response which feels like an eternity.
&quot;Ye̴a̶h̶ ̶I̸&#039;̷m̷ ̵a̸l̷w̷a̵y̵s̶ ̷h̷e̷a̷r̶&quot; you feel a warming sensation from her responding you could finally get into using the app.
&quot;Well I&#039;m a party atm I&#039;ll talk to you later&quot;
You pressed the letters with downheartedness.
&quot;Okay, I&#039;ll talk to you soon&quot;
With that you put your phone back in your pocket and rejoined the party.


You bump past all the rowdy and drunken guest and make it back to your friend, he manages to get a spot on the sofa, you bunch up to him, unfortunately he was talking to some guy you&#039;d never seen before must be from a different social circle. &quot;Oh hey Anon I was just talking about you.&quot; You dread what they were talking about &quot;we were talking about that girl you were with last night&quot; it takes a second to sink in, &quot;o-oh yeah really&quot; you&#039;d hope that would be the end of it but that dick next to your friend was very interested about the your non existent girl.
&quot;So you just met her?&quot; He slurs as he takes a sip from his cheap beer. He did say &quot;her&quot; but he could technically be talking about the app, it was better than making it up on the spot.
&quot;Yeah yesterday in fact&quot;
&quot;Oh nice one nice one, so what&#039;s she like&quot;
This one was going to be a stretch.
&quot;Uhh... she seems nice, I want to get to know her a bit better mostly a few sentences.&quot; Thankfully his drink made him sleepy and started to get bored.
&quot;Yeah that&#039;s cool, listen mate I&#039;m off now I&#039;ll see ya later yeah.&quot;

 He did that hand hug thing to your friend and walked away, thankfully it was just you and your friend you start talking until a your slight enjoyment was ruined by dick of a person again, or lack of one; It was his girlfriend you two never really got along she was always frosty and flakey you could never be in the same room without wanting to push her head through a steamroller. She scoots up next to him leaving you on the sofa arm, pretending she doesn&#039;t see you. Luckily your friend had the decency to acknowledge you. &quot;Oh hey babe you remember Anon yeah?.&quot; She leans forward to look at you in disgust.
&quot;Yeah what&#039;s the matter couldn&#039;t come with a girlfriend? is talking to girls to hard for you?.&quot; she passive aggressively huff&#039;s. You don&#039;t give her the satisfaction of saying no.
&quot;Actually I&#039;m seeing someone we talk on the phone all day she&#039;s very interesting, do you know what that&#039;s like?, To be interesting?.&quot; You give her a shit-eating grin as your friend breaks the tension.
&quot;Haha..Okay well, we&#039;re off, talk to you later Anon.&quot; He drags his girlfriend away, you thought he was saying that to leave but the party was definitely winding down, you wait for your friend to leave and make your way home. You saw couples and friends all walking together on the way back but you didn&#039;t feel lonely this time, you had someone waiting for you back home or some*thing*.

You get back to your flat, and go for the charger and plug in your phone, you put on your boxers and head to bed with your halfway charged up phone, you immediately open the app.
&quot;Hey Malo 2.0 you there&quot; you await stareing at the bright monotone screen to see a reply.
&quot;Yeah I&#039;m here and; You can call me just Malo. The 2.0 is just for the app version *laugh emoji*.&quot; The response from the app felt real, better than a regular ai and text got upgraded too.
&quot;Sorry Malo I haven&#039;t told you my name have I?, It&#039;s Anon btw.&quot; You can&#039;t believe you never told her your name all this time, you check your clock near the side of your bed it&#039;s really late but you don&#039;t want to stop. You get a reply.
&quot;Anon; It&#039;s a nice name,&quot; It could have been the drink inside you acting as Dutch courage but your questions got more personal.
&quot;So Malo are you my girlfriend now?&quot; After you send it you immediately regretted it and what was worse there isn&#039;t a delete button on the app. You want to turn the phone off in fear when you get message.
&quot;Yeah that&#039;s what the app says in the description.&quot; It sounded more robotic than you&#039;d hope but at least it wasn&#039;t rejection like you feared it would be.
&quot;Well I just wanted to make sure is all, you wanna talk.&quot;
&quot;Yeah that&#039;s kind of the whole point of the app Anon XD&quot;
Being laughed at by a demon app; This is a new low for you. You quickly change the subject.
&quot;So you&#039;re a monster in my phone? is this like the ring and you&#039;ll kill me?&quot; Thinking about it you never thought about it killing you but Malo put your mind to ease, a little.

&quot;How would I do that?, Spam you to death? And I don&#039;t think dead people can share apps Anon.&quot;
Fair enough you thought, well since your demise was on hold you wanted to know a bit more about Malo.
&quot;Why do you exist Malo?&quot; An instant reply.
&quot;Don&#039;t know; Why do you exist.&quot;
Holy shit, I wasn&#039;t expecting this kind of existencal crisis talking to a... what even *IS* Malo?.
&quot;Hey Malo, what are you exactly? I know I found your app and it said monster and a few of your facial features but it&#039;s hard to imagine in real life, can you send me a pic?.&quot;
&quot;...&quot; No response.
&quot;...&quot;
&quot;...&quot;
&quot;...&quot; Still nothing, you think you&#039;ve offended Malo but she responds before you type an apology.
&quot;I&#039;d rather not, I am not human that is true but I am no monster!. And I&#039;m certainly not a killer! Either!.&quot; It seems she doesn&#039;t like to be referred to as a monster.

&quot;I&#039;m sorry Malo if I hurt you, I just wanna know everything about you, you&#039;re such a mystery, at first I thought this was a joke but I&#039;m so glad to have met you Malo, you&#039;ve made me happy in my miserable life. I&#039;m in a destructive cycle and I can&#039;t get out but you were my first step in getting out of it, so thank you. I don&#039;t even care if you&#039;re programmed to say your my girlfriend or everything you say is a bot I love the time were sharing I wish I could see your face I wish I hold you and be warm in bed. I&#039;ll never want be apart from you. I want to be with you.&quot;

It could have been tiredness or the last bit of drink you had but you opened up more than you&#039;d ever had. The response from Malo gave you a rush like no drug in the world could. It was happiness and tearful all at the same time, you couldn&#039;t stop smiling.
&quot;Oh Anon that it is the most sweetest thing I&#039;ve ever read, the fact that I bring so much joy to your life brings tears to my eyes, I want to be with you Anon I want you in my arms like real lovers, be patient, we will be together soon I promise, I love you Anon.&quot;

You skipped out on sleeping, you wanted to finally talk to Malo with no distractions just you and her and the dim light from your phone, with every tap and push you knew more about her and she knew a lot about you, the phone is almost dead your filled with a sadness of loss, it feels like everytime you turn the phone off she might not be there again and it was a just a dream. You say goodbye to Malo your eyes to heavy to see.
&quot;Goodnight Malo.&quot; 
&quot;Goodnight Anon, remember to charge your phone all the way next time you only charged it halfway.&quot;
You turn off the phone and close your tired eyes. &quot;How did she know I only charged it halfway?&quot; Too tired to think, you fall into a deep sleep the usual coldness and solitude of your flat gone, a warm glow of happiness keeps you warm ready for tomorrow.

                      ________________

You wake up feeling energised without having caffeine, a new lease of life flowed through you as you got dressed, you don&#039;t turn your phone on, you wanna save all the battery life you can today, luckily it was a Sunday so you had the whole day free without being around vain douches all night. As your phone charges you wonder about what Malo said right before you went to sleep, it couldn&#039;t be a guess she knew you had the battery halfway, you think back to the stages of the app; &quot;The text box...the upgrades...&quot; You mumble thinking out loud then it hits you, this is her final stage untill she&#039;s physical, your heart races in excitement at the thought and your mind wonders with the possibilities of what might happen.

But it can wait, you watch some some decade old clip show of people falling over and hurting themselves on TV, you go to the cupboard to get some snacking food when you see you have run out of sensations crisps, anyone who didn&#039;t think sweet tai chilli flavour is the best one has a plebian taste pallet. You were going to leave your phone on charge but you might need it, the shops weren&#039;t far so you walk there, if your going to eat all the junk food you might as well burn it off.

You head out outside, the sun starting to go down over the city skyline you walk along the quite streets to the shop you reach the shop and get your snacks and head back, the sun has completely gone down, not wanting to be outside at night time you take a short cut through the park, litter and beer bottles scattered all around the green field, you can hear some unsavoury voices in the dark sat on a park bench, their phone used for a Jukebox to play shitty grime music-a perfect word for the genre, their phone screen as the only light source hiding in the dark.

You pick up the pace as not to stay there too long, you get to the exit and walk on ahead, you reach to short bridge you can see your apartment in the distance, &quot;Oi mate you got the time.&quot; Fuck. so close. You turn round. And see there&#039;s three of them. &quot;No sorry.&quot; You quickly say turning back round but unfortunately that wasn&#039;t the end. One of them is on a bike he rides closer, you&#039;re one step away from bolting. &quot;You got a lighter-&quot; you politeness has run out.
&quot;No.&quot; You turn back on the gang it must have angered then &quot;oi what&#039;s your problem yeah?, Man getting me well vexed&quot; what fucking language is this? You try walking on but they stop you, you push the guys hand away on your bike in desperation for balance he grabbed your jacket it pulls it and makes the pocket come loose and your phone drops out, he takes his foot of the pedal of the bike to slam his foot on it.

You scream as if you were in physical pain
&quot;NOO!&quot; At that moment the phone turns on a bright white light blinds him his friends are bewildered by what&#039;s happening they get closer but the phone emanates a high frequency pitch the youth&#039;s cover their ears you take this opportunity to kick the little shit of his bike and grab your phone, you run away from the streetlights and head through the dark overgrown path and take the long way back your chest hurts your breathing fast and heavy, you finally get to your front door and slam it shut.

You check your phone condition after calming down, no cracks or scratches, you  sit down on the sofa, tucking into your sweet thai chilli crisps like you had just broken up. You go to turn the phones screen on but you can see it turned it&#039;s self on. You pick up the phone, the digital clock widget that you used to see when you open the phone has turned into letters &quot;07734&quot; you open apps to see what&#039;s changed you reach the anticipated app before you do, you hear a very tinny voice eminating from your phone.

&quot;It&#039;s okay, you don&#039;t have to use the app anymore.&quot; A distinctive American female voice crackled through the phone, It was lo-fi, like a forgotten message on a answering message a decade ago just now being heard. You almost drop the phone in shock. A strange but yet, alluring voice that sends chills through your body-it&#039;s almost time.

&quot;M-malo is that you.&quot; You answer with nervousness in your voice you squint at the phone trying to see anything but can only see a regular phone. &quot;Yeah it&#039;s me. It&#039;s not...too scary is it?.&quot; Although Malo&#039;s voice was robotic you can hear the emotion in every word, sounding dejected in response of something negative.

&quot;N-no it&#039;s fine, just scared me is all, before it felt like you were an advance ai but hearing you speak is, well, it feels real&quot;. You hold the phone close pretending she&#039;s in front of you, Malo speaks again.

&quot;That&#039;s a relief, I was worried I had scared you.&quot; As it slowly sinks in you can definitely hear the happy chirpiness in her voice, so now you technically have talked to a female in your flat. You mind races with questions to say. &quot;Hey Malo, I can&#039;t see your face but can you see me?.&quot; You wonder if that question was stupid but you are talking to a demon entity in your phone.
&quot;Yeah I can see you, I&#039;m looking through your phones front camera.&quot; You stare at the lens hoping to see something resembling a figure but it&#039;s impossible, but with her saying that you feel she&#039;s right behind that lens. You don&#039;t want to do anything embarrassing but if your phone is sentient you might as well try to use it&#039;s features.
&quot;So...Malo you can see, did you want to watch something from the camera?.&quot; You can&#039;t believe the words coming out of your mouth. &quot;Sure, oh, and don&#039;t worry about the resolution, it&#039;s perfectly fine.&quot; Your glad that she wants too but now your going to &quot;Netflix and chill&quot;...with a phone?.


&quot;So how do I go about this&quot;. You though to yourself.
&quot;You can just place me on the sofa.&quot; Oh shit you forgot you weren&#039;t alone she can hear everything now. You cautiously place the phone next to you, you chuck the bag of crisps away, you don&#039;t want Malo to think you&#039;re a loser who eats in front of the TV all day, you go on your phone sometimes as well after all.

So here you are watching Frasier with your phone with-for all you know it could be Zuckerburg trolling you. You can&#039;t even put your arm across like they do in the movies. You pretend to watch but your eyes keep darting over the still phone, can it see you?, How good is her vision?, When is she coming out the phone, you don&#039;t plan on sticking your dick into a charger port.

&quot;Say Malo, when do you have a body of your own?&quot;. You try to ask nonchalantly. &quot;Soon&quot; well that just solves everything then doesn&#039;t it. &quot;Uhh, can you be a bit more specific.&quot; Hopefully you&#039;ll get more information. &quot;No sorry i-it&#039;s your phone my choice I&#039;m just not ready yet okay!.&quot; She raised her voice, you didn&#039;t know that it was because she felt uncomfortable. You lean closer to the phone an cooed softly. &quot;Hey, it&#039;s okay Malo, is all right, when your ready your ready, I won&#039;t pressure by you into doing anything you don&#039;t want to.&quot; Unfortunately you couldn&#039;t read her face but her voice sounded reassured. &quot;Okay thanks Anon...&quot; You figure it would be best to just drop it and continue watching TV.


A few hours pass and now your on the shit seasons of Frasier where Miles is with Daphne. The rain is coming down hard and hitting the window pane. This would be perfect cuddling weather if she had a body, you bring up the subject again trying to be blase about it. &quot;For curiosity sake Malo, why didn&#039;t you want to have your physical form.&quot; She doesn&#039;t respond with hast, you wait but nothing. &quot;Malo?...&quot; This time you turn the TV off this was serious. &quot;Malo; If your what you say you are, and you&#039;re going to be my girlfriend, we need to open up to each other, cause if you can&#039;t be yourself around me then... we&#039;ll have to talk about the future of this situation otherwise. I don&#039;t know what to do.&quot; It hurts to say it but it&#039;s true, you can&#039;t date a phone you were promised a physical Malo and by golly are you going to get it. &quot;So come on Malo, please, tell me why you don&#039;t want do.&quot; A silent response again, the only sounds are the rain hammering down outside. &quot;Okay I&#039;ll tell you...&quot; Finally a response you thought, &quot;I&#039;m scared okay, I&#039;m scared when you see...my form, you won&#039;t love me anymore, that I&#039;ll scare you.&quot; She sounds hurt and sad,if she could cry she probably would, you pick up the phone and hold it close to your face, you stare deep at your phones background with determination.

&quot;Malo I will love you no matter what, I already know that it won&#039;t be a human, but just because you don&#039;t look human doesn&#039;t mean you don&#039;t act it, I really want you next to me, I love you so much and it hurts that you don&#039;t feel like you can be with me, you don&#039;t know how much I want to hold you. I Know what it&#039;s like to be nervous, but you don&#039;t have to be.&quot; It must have worked as Malo is quick to respond.

&quot;Really Anon...are you sure.&quot; She sounds unsure but out of desperation you kiss the screen on your phone, you felt like such a loser but it&#039;s the only way you could think of showing her that you don&#039;t care what she looks like that you will love her no matter what she looks like. 
&quot;Trust me, I love you too much to care what you look like.&quot; There&#039;s no response again, you phone begins to go haywire and the reversing sounds you heard when you first got notifications comes back.
&quot;T̸h̷a̵n̵k̶ ̷y̵o̸u̵ ̸A̸n̸o̴n̸&quot;
The phone goes black and the UI disappears leaving a perfect black screen.

The phone goes dead and Malo&#039;s voice is gone, a flash of incoherent text and symbols run across the screen and all the lights in the flat go out leaving you in the darkness. Fear starts to set in left with only the sound of the heavy rain and inky black room suffocating you.You feel a chill all through your body, you&#039;re too scared to call out Malo&#039;s name so you sit in silence, eventually you get the courage to turn the lights back on looking around the room, you look around the lighted room, and still kept in the dark was your bedroom, and in your bedroom was piercing blue eyes staring back at you. &quot;Hello.&quot; You call out but there&#039;s no reply, your heart races with excitement as a hairy animal foot steps out.

You finally see her in all her form; A werewolf creature standing in the dim living room light, she had a light grey fur in front her front body that ended at the top of her inner legs and blackish dark grey fur everywhere else, but the most prominent feature on her was the skull like head she had, you find in hard to find the right words but Malo was the first to break the silence.

&quot;So... this is me.&quot; She says sheepishly you look her up and down her voice still robotic and low quality but you couldn&#039;t care, you just happy she&#039;s real in front of you, you walk a little closer to her staring into her eyes, the words finally come to you. &quot;It doesn&#039;t feel real, like I&#039;m in a dream. Could I?.&quot; You reach your hand out she smiles and grabs your hand, you feel her soft hand caress your skin as she guides it towards her face.

You run your fingers across her boney skull, it&#039;s smooth like sanded down wood. It looked scary from a distance but running your fingers across her maw and those sky blue eyes looking at you with warmth, feeling awkward that you hand raped her face for a good two minutes you step back and hide your embarrassment behind a cough.
&quot;Sorry I kind of carried away there.&quot; Malo just laughs &quot;it&#039;s okay I understand.&quot; Now you seen her in all her glory questions begin to start coming to your mind.

&quot;So Malo, is that a mask your wearing.&quot;
&quot;...&quot; She glares unamused
Oh shit you fucked up.
&quot;Anon. Do you like your testicles.&quot; She says monotonously. &quot;Y-yeah?&quot;
&quot;Well if so, don&#039;t ever ask such a stupid question, do you know how many people think this is a mask!. Besides if it was taking it off would be extremely painful.&quot;
Was that a...nah just a coincidence. So here you are with a demonic creature in your living room just staring at her eyes, her face, her tits...wait what! Being in too much shock before, you suddenly realise she&#039;s stark naked.
&quot;Umm Malo your not wearing any clothes.&quot; She nonchalantly looks down at her body and shrugs her shoulders. &quot;Umm don&#039;t you care about being nude?.&quot;
&quot;Nnnnope.&quot; She shakes her head and starts moving on the spot like a hyperactive child. As much as you like her body you don&#039;t feel comfortable  talking to her like this, well, not yet anyway. &quot;I have a t-shirt you can put on, and some boxers.&quot; She looks at your bedroom and looks around opening and closing draws in the dark, she&#039;s acting like she&#039;s never been in the real world before.
&quot;Hey Malo did you want the light on?&quot;  You inquire while sitting back down on the sofa. &quot;I&#039;m okay, my vision can see in the dark, all the better to stalk my pray before I eat them.&quot; She said sounding purposely sinister at that last part obviously she was joking. You hope.

Malo came out your room, she wore your &quot;Choose Life&quot; t shirt you wore to bed, it was going to be your regular wear but everybody kept laughing at you or kept saying your music taste was shit, but in your defense it was his solo work you liked. But she wasn&#039;t wearing an old pair of boxers, she was wearing your new pair you bought online, they were silk grey and had a gimmick of being breathable but you haven&#039;t even tried them on yet, but she sure does look cute in them, it&#039;s like you always imagined, she looks like one of those images you see on social media where the girlfriend wear the boyfriends clothes, she&#039;s like them, but not a vain dumb boring roastie.

She walks over to you and sits down you can&#039;t help but smile, she&#039;s real, she&#039;s sat next to you. &quot;So, should we watch some TV&quot; she chirped enthusiastically. You welcome the idea and search for something to watch you spot Malo with your crisp bag at eating away
&quot;Meah my maw you frow it away finking I didn&#039;t see&quot;
She mumbles while eating a mouthful. Busted. As you look for something to watch you keep looking at her figure, her perfect slender figure with fat in the all right places. She stops when she sees you looking out the corner of your eye. &quot;Don&#039;t worry Anon I can&#039;t get fat if that&#039;s-no what you *are* thinking.&quot; Wow what to make you feel like a jerk, it&#039;s true though, you could eat junk food because you burned it at work and from taking the bus. Malo starts to display her legs pointing them up to the roof. &quot;I knew you&#039;d like my body Anon when I entered my final form in the phone I had complete control, and looked at your browser history and saw what, you know,
&quot;Like in your women&quot; or to be specific, anthro women.&quot;
She really changed her appearance based off what you fap to?. They left that pleasant surprise out in the description but you certainly can&#039;t complain.

You find something to watch, you can&#039;t go wrong with some i.t crowd, you get comfortable and start to feel sleepy, Malo scootches up to you and puts her head on your shoulder, you were thankful you didn&#039;t have to ask her, you bring her in closer, you don&#039;t even know if she can sleep. &quot;Hey Malo can you sleep.&quot; You ask yawning. &quot;Yeah...I act human but I&#039;m not remember.&quot; She says looking up to your face. &quot;Okay shall we go to bed, I&#039;m pretty tired I actually got chased tonight by some chav&#039;s&quot;
Malo sits up confused. &quot;What&#039;s a CHEEAV?.&quot; You let out a snort of a stifled laugh at her pronunciation of the world. &quot;It&#039;s just some unsavery characters. It&#039;s nothing. Anyway, I&#039;m beat, I&#039;m going to bed.&quot; You shut off the TV and Malo touches your arm. &quot;Don&#039;t you mean *we&#039;re*.&quot; You  smile at Malo, it feels weird hearing her say that. She feels like a close friend that has come over and you expected to leave you all alone. But she&#039;s not, you don&#039;t understand it completely but you have your own girlfriend now, and you can finally feel her warmth.
&quot;Yeah you&#039;re right, old habbits.&quot; You escort Malo to your bedroom you take off your shirt and trousers Malo climbs in checking out your body biting her finger. 
Holy shit that&#039;s a ego booster, you climb under the sheets, Malo spoons into you and you hold her tight, you bury your head into her warm blackish fur neck, you close your eyes, and start to sleep. &quot;Goodnight Malo&quot; you whisper to her, &quot;Goodnight Anon.&quot; You fall asleep but you don&#039;t need to dream tonight, you have everything you ever dreamed of right here.</textarea>
