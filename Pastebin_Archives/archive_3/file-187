        <textarea class="textarea">Chapter 1: Slow and steady
&gt;You are Anon
&gt;Hiking through the woods and to the top of mountains has always been a passion of you
&gt;You love the feel of fresh air in your hair and the sounds of nature in your ears
&gt;Trading the noise of cars for the relaxing chirping of birds is your version of a spa treatment
&gt;You can feel the weight of your backpack, stuffed with rations, water, a survival kit and your tent
&gt;With a big step you arrive on top of the first small hill and look upwards to the mountains just waiting for you
&gt;Of course you don&#039;t take this hike alone
&gt;There always is a big group of like-minded people around you
&gt;Together no mountain is to big and no forest to dark
&gt;Normally you would be in the front of the group, pulling them with you, until you arrive at a campground to pitch your tents for the night
&gt;Normally...but not this time
&gt;This time you drew the short straw and have to accompany Grace
&gt;She is a really nice girl, always friendly and with her knowledge about plants a indispensable help
&gt;You stop and turn around to wait for her again
&gt;Grace is currently nearly 200 meters behind you, staring into the valley below
&gt;&quot;Grace, come on. The others are nearly on the campground and we still have to travel nearly 5 Kilometers&quot;
&gt;Her head is slowly starting to turn towards you while she slowly raises a hand with the big claws to wave in your direction
&gt;It takes her nearly a minute to do so and start walking again
&gt;&quot;Yeah.....sorry.......Anon&quot;
&gt;Grace is a sloth
&gt;Literally
&gt;You are not angry at her, she can&#039;t change who she is
&gt;You are, however, starting to get frustrated with her
&gt;Why did this girl, that takes nearly twice as long as all other species, choose to take a hike into the mountains ?

2 hours later

&gt;You managed it to travel nearly half the way to the camp when you suddenly get a message on your phone
&gt;There is a thunderstorm alert from the mountain rescue service
&gt;Dammit
&gt;&quot;Hey Grace, we have to camp right here, there is a storm coming&quot;
&gt;You quickly send a text to the rest of your group and look for a suitable place for the tent
&gt;There is a small cavity in the mountainside, only 3 meters in depth
&gt;Not perfect, but there is no way you can place your tent in a way that trees could fall on top of it
&gt;It will also protect you from falling rocks
&gt;With practiced hand you place the tent inside of the cavity and prepare everything for the storm
&gt;At this height in the mountains there is always the danger of a cold snap and sudden snowfall
&gt;Combined with strong winds and lightning it can get dangerous really fast
&gt;You stand in front of your tent and store the canned food inside as the first snowflakes come down
&gt;Danger aside, you really love these situations
&gt;Sitting in your tent, wrapped in a warm blanket while it&#039;s snowing outside
&gt;Ahhh....wonderful
&gt;The temperature takes a sudden plunge as the snowfall picks up
&gt;You take a look to the free space in the cavity and nearly get a heart attack as you spot Grace still walking towards you, snow starting to pile on top of her
&gt;You quickly run towards her, grab her arm and drag her into your tent
&gt;As you drag the zipper up and close the flap to your tent there is already nothing but snow outside
&gt;Looks like the two of you will spend a night together in your one-man-tent

End of Chapter 1

Slow and Steady: Chapter 2
&gt;The storm outside the tent has picked up in intensity and is now howling like crazy
&gt;The thin walls are waving back and forth, the coldness is creeping through the zipper
&gt;Besides the fact, that this is one of the worst situations you ever found yourself in you are not upset
&gt;Grace is just finishing her sentence she started three minutes ago about her university and why she choose plant biology as her major
&gt;”And...my...mother...used...to...grow...these...berries...in...our...garden. I...liked...them. They...never...ran...away.”
&gt;You never spend much time with Grace, something you regret now.
&gt;She is very self-aware about her speed and likes to make fun of her slowness
&gt;By now you are even used to her speech pattern
&gt;You check your backpack again and pull out a big pack of instant food, something soja based and self heating
&gt;You pull the little flap on the package and fell how it starts to heat up
&gt;After a few seconds you offer the strips to Grace who slowly bows over
&gt;Soon her long claws, which you now notice are polished, reach into the bag
&gt;Grace is using them almost like chopstick to pull out some strips and slowly starts chewing on them
&gt;”So, your mother was a florist in the city. Sounds nice”
&gt;”It...was. She...sometimes...even...grew...them...on...her...back”
&gt;You look up from the bag and swallow, the soja tastes like strawberries
&gt;Who thought that was a good idea ?
&gt;”Yeah...our...fur...is...so...dense...that...plants...can...grow...in...it”
&gt;”You too ?”
&gt;She is slowly shaking her head
&gt;”No...too...much...work...and...it&#039;s....dirty”
&gt;Yeah, thats what you thought
&gt;You take s look at your phone and once again check the weather forecast
&gt;Snow, snow and snow
&gt;”Well Grace, looks like we will be stuck here for some time. How about we turn in for the night ?”
&gt;While she is slowly nodding you prepare the electric thermometer and set the hypothermia alert
&gt;Having two sleeping backs in your tent is a little cramped but it&#039;s not as bad as you expected
&gt;With the taste of soja and strawberry and the thought of flowers you drift of to sleep
…...
&gt;A loud beeping is tearing you from your dreams and you immediately notice how cold it is in the tent
&gt;The thermometer is showing – 10°C inside of the tent, a cold wave must have hit you
&gt;You have to prepare for this, without a heat source this will not end well
&gt;Your hand finds Grace and you try to shake her awake
&gt;No effect, she is not responding
&gt;You take a look at her and notice how her body is rigid, her breaths are even slower than normal
&gt;With horror you remember your biology class again, sloths can not shiver, they do not have enough muscle mass for that
&gt;If you don’t act fast Grace could freeze
&gt;You immediately start the small electric heater and set it to maximal temperature before you lift Grace from her bedroll
&gt;She is stiff as a piece of wood
&gt;You stuff her into your own sleeping back and grab every self heating pack you can find
&gt;Your survival instincts take over and before you can stop yourself you stripped down
&gt;Soon Grace clothes are gone too and the both of you are stuffed inside the bedroll, covered in warm instant food
&gt;This is not how you imagined this trip

End of Chapter 2

Chapter 3: Too fast
&gt;You once again run your fingers through Grace fur and try to ignore the warmth spreading through your body
&gt;It started as a simple way to make sure that she is still breathing but now, nearly two hours later, you can&#039;t get enough of the softness
&gt;The instant food and your own body were enough to prevent Grace from freezing
&gt;While your thoughts wander your hand does to
&gt;Your fingers close around Grace ass and you give her fluffy cheek a good squeeze
&gt;Seems like your dry spell has effected you more than you thought
&gt;You don&#039;t want to be this needy but you simply can&#039;t stop
&gt;Fur is running through your fingers as you continue your assault
&gt;Your finger slips closer to her nether region and you can feel how the thick fur makes way for sensitive skin
&gt;Dammit, this is wrong
&gt;You swallow hard and position your fingers again
&gt;The fingertips part her folds and you slowly slip into her
&gt;Wonderful Anon, only 6 months without a female touch and you start raping the first girl you find
&gt;Your fingers slowly circle inside of her, your thumb is searching for her clit
&gt;She is not wet, which means you have to slow down, her insides are wonderful warm
&gt;You find the small marble of concentrated pleasure and give it a small pinch
&gt;While you explore the sleeping sloth you can feel her breast rubbing against your chest, her nipples start to harden
&gt;As you notice this change you withdraw your fingers from her, dragging her outer labia a small distance with you
&gt;The lack of lubrication makes them stick to you
&gt;Grace slowly starts to open her eyes and you place your hands next to your sides
&gt;Her eyes focus on you and the shy smile on your face
&gt;”Hey Grace.....sorry about this but you were kind of hypothermic and I had to warm you up”
&gt;Grace eyes “dart” through the tent, from the thermometer to the warm food all around you
&gt;”Yeahhh....tha..anks.....for....that”
&gt;Her speech is both slower and a little more shaky than normal
&gt;”Well since you are now awake how about we both try to sleep again ? Hehe..”
&gt;You desperately try to cover up your own tension and hope that the sudden change is distracting her enough so that she does not notice your erection
&gt;Anon little is rising directly between Grace legs and does not show any indices for a quick shrinkage
&gt;You quickly close your eyes and mimic sleeping sounds
&gt;Any other living being would not be fooled by this but thanks to the slow nerve system of sloths it works on Grace
&gt;While you concentrate on your breathing to make it sound like you are sleeping Grace is shifting atop of you
&gt;Her claws slide over your belly, down to your hips and scratch your skin
&gt;Soon she has reached your....ohh

Grace POV

&gt;You were torn from your slumber by a strange feeling in your nethers
&gt;You are lying naked on Anon, covered by warm packages of food
&gt;”HeyGracesorryaboutthisbutyouwerekindofhypothermicandIhadtowarmyouup”
&gt;And he is asleep again
&gt;You have no idea how all other species can act this fast
&gt;You let your eyes wander around the tent and over to the thermometer
&gt;This hike really was a mistake
&gt;Not only did you once again slow everyone down and now you nearly froze
&gt;Sometimes you wonder if you should simply stop
&gt;At least you can get a good look at Anon now
&gt;The thought of being stripped by him is really arousing, even though it would be a little to fast for you
&gt;You enjoy the slow and steady peeling away of clothing, while his eyes would wander over your body and...
&gt;What is wrong with you ?
&gt;The burning in your pussy is growing stronger, you have to act
&gt;You slide your hand down your body, your claws slide between your and Anons body
&gt;The heat is unbelievable strong now, your breathing is accelerating
&gt;Before your fingers can reach your burning nethers a sudden jolt of pleasure is running through your body
&gt;Your clit feels like something is pressing down on it, sending pleasure down your spine, directly into your brain
&gt;You try to stop it but can&#039;t help yourself
&gt;Squirming and squeaking you orgasm on top of Anon

Anon POV

&gt;Your hold your breath as Grace claws nudge your erection
&gt;This is the end, she found out and is now going to geld you
&gt;Suddenly Grace is starting to squirm on top of you, slowly rolling on top of you
&gt;You open your eyes and stare directly into hers
&gt;Her eyes have rolled back into her skull, her mouth is hanging open
&gt;Warm breaths are hitting your face and something warm starts to flow down your leg
&gt;Grace is holding this position for nearly 3 minutes before she starts to respond to you again
&gt;For a few moments both of you simply stare at each other
&gt;Grace is breaking the silence by screaming a high pitched screech directly in your face

20 minutes later

&gt;”Ohh...god....Anon....slow....down...pleaahahaaaseee”
&gt;You did not touch her for nearly 5 minute now
&gt;Before that however you got a good feel of her body
&gt;Squeezing her ample breasts and rubbing her clit, faster and harder than any sloth ever could
&gt;This is now her fifth climax
&gt;”Anon....stop....thats....the....wrong....holeeeaaaa”
&gt;Wow, she has just reached the start of your anal fingering
&gt;That was ten minutes ago
&gt;The next time you will by some energy drinks for her
