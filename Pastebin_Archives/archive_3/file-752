        <textarea class="textarea">This was written by some anon and I&#039;m just reposting it here.

&gt;be anon, suburban middle class guy with an average job
&gt;not poor but not exactly rich either
&gt;have qt vixen best friend you’ve known since childhood
&gt;still good friends after all this time
&gt;feelsgoodman
&gt;haven’t talked to her in while
&gt;you suddenly get invited to her house
&gt;you were starting to get worried
&gt;walk up to her average suburban middle class house and knock on the door
&gt;she opens the door
&gt;she looks like she hasn’t left the house in days
&gt;her winter coat looks ruffled under her basic shirt and short shorts combo
&gt;her hazel eyes squint in the sunlight, trying their best to get used to it
&gt;”hey, how’s it goin’? haven’t hung out in a while, huh?”
&gt;she sounds like she’s trying to mask physical pain 
&gt;greet her and ask her how she’s been
&gt;”uh, i’ve been alright, kinda”
&gt;you walk into her house and holy shit it’s hot in here
&gt;with it being in the middle of winter, you’d imagine she’d have her house fairly heated
&gt;but you didn’t think it’d be this hot
&gt;”heh, sorry for the temperature. been keeping my windows open and I haven’t had the motivation to leave my room”
&gt;uh-huh
&gt;the door opens to her living room, which has an old couch and a shitty tv which is never used
&gt;”let’s head to my room, i have the games in there”
&gt;the door to her bedroom is right next to the front door
&gt;it’s even hotter in here
&gt;and sweaty
&gt;you see her bend over to turn on the console on the floor
&gt;dat ass
&gt;of course it turns on to mortal kombat 
&gt;she’s been a huge fan since she was little
&gt;she has about 7,000 hours clocked in across all games
&gt;mental
&gt;not much has changed since you last hung out with her
&gt;the screen turns on to mortal kombat 11
&gt;”c’mon, sit on the bed with me”
&gt;of course, you comply
&gt;she’s oddly close to you
&gt;start playing
&gt;you pick d’vorah
&gt;she picks kotal kahn
&gt;she claims it’s fair cause he’s low tier but she still kicks your ass anyways
&gt;not today though
&gt;so far you’ve won four of the six games you’ve played 
&gt;that’s more than all previous sessions combined 
&gt;odd, but you’re not complaining 
&gt;you end the next game with a brutality
&gt;you pop off, that’s the first time you’ve gotten one on her
&gt;she congratulates you, but she looked less and less interested in the game as it goes on
&gt;she’s distracted by something 
&gt;”can we take a break? i need to recharge so I can stop losing”
&gt;uh-huh 
&gt;you recline against the wall on her bed
&gt;she suddenly climbs on top of you and lays down
&gt;what is she doing
&gt;”shh... just let me enjoy this”
&gt;kinda weird... kinda cute
&gt;she’s making small, barely audible whimpers as she cuddles against you
&gt;the whimpers slowly get more and more loud as she crawls closer to your face
&gt;uhh
&gt;at first it was cute, but now it’s starting to get weird
&gt;with how hot it is in here, you’re sweating a lot
&gt;and she not helping 
&gt;with her intense cuddling and body heat 
&gt;it’s kinda hot, in a sexual way
&gt;you start to get hard
&gt;fuck, this is awkward
&gt;”aren’t you hot in this getup? c’mon, cool down a little”
&gt;yeah you are actually
&gt;you can loose the jacket
&gt;and maybe roll up your sleeves
&gt;”you must be hot in those pants too”
&gt;ok what the fuck
&gt;your best friend is now cuddling up against you, while you’re in your boxers
&gt;in a hot room, while sweating profusely
&gt;she’s not even trying to hide it now
&gt;those short shorts are pressed against your erection
&gt;her breasts are pressed against your chest
&gt;fuck, you better say something
&gt;uhh
&gt;uhh
&gt;uhh
&gt;what do you say?
&gt;reject her? talk dirty?
&gt;rejecting her could end this all and likely preserve the friendship, but this is the closest you’ve been to sex
&gt;talking dirty could enhance the mood
&gt;c’mon, think anon, think!
&gt;your rambling thoughts are interrupted by her whispering something to you
&gt;”i need you, anon”
&gt;fuuuuck
&gt;she’s grinding against you now
&gt;porn never prepared you for this
&gt;&gt;let me your wheel, angel
&gt;...
&gt;”...what?” 
&gt;FUCK
&gt;you had one chance you say something and you fucked it up
&gt;you tried saying four different pickup lines at once
&gt;her confident and lusty visage is broken by your awful line
&gt;you stutter out a few incoherent sounds before she shushes you
&gt;”shh it’s okay. I’ll take the lead, i guess”
&gt;you ruined the mood
&gt;now, even as she’s pulling your boxers down and grasping your cock, you can’t get back into the it
&gt;you could’ve tried kissing
&gt;that was actually a good idea
&gt;fuck, why didn’t you think of that
&gt;she gave your member a long lick
&gt;it feels good
&gt;...yeah
&gt;she’s giving you a blowjob now, or what she interprets as one
&gt;she’s taking barely any of it, and teeth are kind of painful
&gt;what do you even say
&gt;it’s so quiet in here
&gt;all you have hear is her trying to suck you off
&gt;after a while, she stops
&gt;she crawls closer to you and hovers her cooch over your cock
&gt;she has a look of uncertainty on her face
&gt;”here goes...” 
&gt;your cock enters her
&gt;you did it
&gt;you’re not a virgin anymore, but at what cost?
&gt;your friendship?
&gt;your dignity?
&gt;a chance at a relationship with her? 
&gt;she’s slowly inserting it into herself
&gt;fuck it’s tight
&gt;her visage of an experienced fox is long gone
&gt;you’re unsure of what to do now
&gt;hug her? is that what you do during sex?
&gt;you raise your hands and place them on her hips as she shakily continues to lower herself
&gt;she’s moaning and whimpering, but you can’t help but stay completely quiet
&gt;eventually she stops and puts a concerned look on her face
&gt;”everything alright, anon? do you want me to stop?”
&gt;you stutter as you try to explain how it’s your first time and you’re anxious
&gt;her face changes from a concerned look to a soft smile
&gt;as you continue stuttering, she places a finger over your mouth and makes a shushing sound
&gt;”it’s alright we don’t need to rush things. i’m a virgin as well, so you don’t need to feel obliged to do anything more”
&gt;she removes herself from your cock and cuddles up to you
&gt;”i may be in heat, but i haven’t lost self-control. i can wait a few more hours”
&gt;she moves up to your lips for a kiss
&gt;you make an honest-to-god attempt at not fucking it up this time
&gt;her lips meet yours
&gt;her wet nose brushes against your face as you two meet lips
&gt;you don’t want this to end
&gt;her tongue prods at your mouth, waiting to enter
&gt;you oblige, letting her take control
&gt;your tongues wrestle for dominance
&gt;you lose, not that you’re upset about it
&gt;her tongue explores every crevice of your mouth as you submit to her strength
&gt;eventually she pulls away, leaving a trail of saliva as she does
&gt;you both sit and stare at each other in silence
&gt;but this time, it isn’t awkward
&gt;it feels like this is an embrace 
&gt;like her eyes are pulling you into a warm hug
&gt;she smiles 
&gt;”c’mon. let’s go try something else, we can save this for later”
&gt;but isn’t she still in heat?
&gt;”yea, and it burns, but i’ll save myself for when you’re ready” 
&gt;you both clothe yourselves and sit back on her bed
&gt;”sorry if i rushed things. i couldn’t take the heat anymore, and sorry if i forced myself upon you” 
&gt;you tell her it’s alright, at least the friendship wasn’t ruined</textarea>
