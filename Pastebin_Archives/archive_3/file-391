class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Awesome</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fan-Fucking-Tastic</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is what I get for going after the big bad sorcerer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A one way inter-dimensional trip to god knows where</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Encased in an ice-cube for that matter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I have no clue for how long I was frozen in ice before someone got me out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All I know is that when I woke up I was in a cave and there were three huge ass rats walking on two feet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Of course my instincts made themselves immediately known and I kicked their shit thinking they were wild animals</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And now I have three poor sods unconscious in my feet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To make matters worse, they’re not even people</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well… maybe they were people</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But not, you know, my people</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A trio of sneaky looking anthropomorphic rats on tomb thieving garb</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or were they adventure garb?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s been so long since I’ve seen any that I don’t know which is which</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anyway</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I squat down next to the body of one of these rat people to get a good look at them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They’re about the size of a teen, maybe that of a 12 year old human kid</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Got digitigrade legs, with fleshy rat feet just like actual rats from back home</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Aside from the feet, overall body structure seems similar to humans</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A pink thin tail</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Five fingered hands with opposing thumbs an all</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Legs are a bit shorter if compared to our proportions though</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But even after looking at the little guy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I still can’t get over it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Despite the fact that I should</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I’m no stranger to other races and creatures</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I’ve seen elves, dwarves, centaurs, druids, gnomes, goblins, orcs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ghouls, dragons, unicorns, griffons, mermaids</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And so and so forth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But animal people is completely new to me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A centaur would count, I guess?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But still have a human’s torso, so I guess it doesn’t</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hmm?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oho, what do we have here?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Don’t mind me, just making myself at home”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I mutter to myself while I snatch a small bag tied to the rat’s hip</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I feel the weight in my hands, and the sound of clanking metal</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And just as I thought, gold</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I take one gold coin and turn it around between my fingers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Huh, some things don’t change I guess”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I flick the gold coin up in the air and grab it back as it falls</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;My eyes continue to inspect the rat, and fall on a sheathed blade hanging from the other side of its hip</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“What do we have here?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I take the blade’s grip and pull it from the sheath</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A crooked dagger</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I inspect the blade, throwing it up and catching when it came down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Well, looks like you’re thieves after all”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I plunge the blade’s entire length into the rocky floor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Then I won’t feel so bad for taking your gold”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I mean, have anyone seen a good guy with a crooked weapon?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I certainly haven’t</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And that’s enough confirmation for me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Rounding up the other two, I loot whatever they have that can be useful to me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Unfortunately I don’t find a lot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mostly because I don’t know what the fuck they’re carrying and what they do</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s a bunch of artifacts, but none of them seen useful in any way</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So I just grab the basics</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The gold coins from the other two rats</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A map which I can’t read because I don’t know shit about this place yet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And a weapon to defend myself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I’m pretty confident in my ass kicking abilities</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But having a weapon to stab someone works far better than punching their faces in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now all I have to do is get out of this cave</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Find a way to go back to my world</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And hand that sorcerer’s ass to him</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With my priorities set, I start my way out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The caveis pretty damn dark</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But that’s about everything interesting with this hole</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nothing to fight</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nothing to find</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just darkness and cold rock walls</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It took some time, but I finally got out of the cave</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And now I’m in a mountain side, way high near the top of a mountain</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;God damn, that sorcerer was pretty specific when he sent me hear it seems</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The view was pretty kick ass though</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There was a shit ton of green everywhere I looked</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With villages, cities, lakes, forests, some ruins, and all that jazz sprinkled around</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And far away into the horizon I could make out the ocean and a port city</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Look down, I realize just how tall tall this place is</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s kind of impressive that the three rats managed to climb all the way up here </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still, high or not, this is nothing I haven’t overcome before</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hopping down the mountain side, I connect my armored feet against the rock surface and slide my way down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While sliding down the mountain, I catch sight of a city, the nearest one from my position</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And now I know where I have to go next to get me one step closer to going home</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As soon as the ground floor started getting closer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I jump off the mountain side, into the forest below that surrounded the mountain</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And make a mad dash to the direction where I last saw that city</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If this place is anything like home, magic is a thing, and there must be magic spells for inter-dimensional travel</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Chapter 2</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Look at that!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“What is that?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Is it a monster?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“It doesn’t look like one”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“But it’s so weird looking”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Maybe it’s an animal”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Why would an animal need a blade and armor?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Maybe it’s a familiar”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“A…a familiar? Does that mean a witch is nearby?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Or it could be a summon, you know, from those magic users&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yeahm I heard some of them summon creatures from another realm”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“That would explain the strange appearance”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Why is it crouched in front of that sign?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“It looks like it’s trying to read it”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Ah! It got angry and left”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;God dammit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I sigh out loud in frustration, running a hand through my hair</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Turns out their written system is completely different</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thankfully we speak the same ‘language’</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But I still can’t understand shit in that sign </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And if I can’t understand shit, I can’t read shit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And if I can’t read shit, books and scrolls are useless to me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And that fact alone just made my quest a whole lot harder than it should be</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I drag my hands down my face in frustration</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, at least there’s solace in this whole situation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And they’re big</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Furry</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And come in all sizes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ohoho, yes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I think I might enjoy my stay in here</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This city also looks pretty nice</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Very much like the ones from back home</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Only inhabited by animal people, rather than people people.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Everything is kinda like home honestly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s like someone made a copy of my world and swapped the humans for whatever these guys are called, and the fauna for weird looking creatures</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Of course not everything was exactly the same</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It seems things over here are built to accommodate these guys’ needs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like some houses have bigger doors and windows than others</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And I’m pretty that those wooden perchs all around the rooftops</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And door entrances above some houses’ rooftops are meant for bird people</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And there’s even water pathways running along the streets on this city</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Although I have yet to see any fish people swimming on those</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe those are just rivers and I’m overthinking it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Either way</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I need to find someone with at the very least some decent knowledge on magic around here</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I’d try to talk to the townsfolk, but they seem pretty wary of me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So my best bet is going to the castle sitting in the end of the city</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And that’s where I would go</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If I wasn’t interrupted immediately after</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Halt, creature!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I hear someone call from behind</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And all around me other of these animal people showed up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;These were armed and armored though</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All of their armors bearing the same design and patterns</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Guess they must be city guards or something</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Standing in a circle formation, they had their spears pointed toward me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All of them were dogs though</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Which makes sense</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Who better to guard some place than a dog?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And is kinda funny too</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Guards</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Dogs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get the idea</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“State your business”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I turn to the one calling to me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He’s a bit bigger than the rest of the dogs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And bulkier as well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Compared to me though, he a bit on the short side</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I think he’s a bulldog</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With those saggy, flaccid cheeks and droopy, bored eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like he desperately needs to sleep</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Definitely a bulldog</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Strange, why would the bulldog be taller than the rest?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They’re short as shit compared to other dogs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This place doesn’t make sense</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Answer me!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He gets frustrated at my lack of response and aims his spear close to my face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I go cross eyed trying to see the tip of the spear right between my eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Okay, alright, geez”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All of them gasp and go wide eyed when they hear me talk</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What the fuck?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They ask me to answer and get surprised when I do?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What were they expecting me to do?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bark?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I take the tip of the spear near my face between my fingers and push it down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“If you really need to know what I want, I need to speak to your king, or whatever higher power you have in this place”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The bulldog snaps out of his stupor and pulls the spear from my grip</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once again aiming it at my head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“What does a creature like you needs with our leader?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The other dogs come out of their funk as well and form a tighter circle around me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“This creature”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I hold both hands up and point to my face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Needs a way to go back home, and I believe your leader can help me”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The bulldog pulls the spear away and steps closer to me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I have to hold my breath as soon as he gets his ugly mug near my face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Dog breath is as universal as gold coins apparently</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Humph, and you want me to believe that? You look pretty suspicious, what even are you?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I have to lean my head back in order to take a deep, refreshing breath</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I’m a human”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The bulldog turns his head left and right while keeping an eye on me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;An eye ridge lifted all the while, showing his suspicion</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“A hooman?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He spells it out slowly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eh, it’s a good shot for someone hearing the word for the first time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So I nod in confirmation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Never heard of one”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He mutters slowly to my face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The rest of the dogs under his command comment the same</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So there really aren’t any humans in this place</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“So, hooman”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He snaps his head closer to mine in a quick movement</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“What are your true intentions?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;True inte-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I just told you what I want!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Do you think I’m dumb? I have never seen anything like you before&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;And you’re even carrying a crooked weapon, what ensures me you’re not lying through your teeth, huh?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The crooked weapon, I shoud&#039;ve known</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;God, I feel stupid</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Well, I have never seen anything like you ether, yet here I am, asking for help!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;We butt heads and try to push the other back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“And you expect me to help just because of that?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He tries to push me back by bumping chest against mine</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Suffice to say it doesn’t work, I don’t even budge</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“No, I expected you to help me because that’s part of your job”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I raise a hand and tap the side of his had with finger</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“But I guess that’s too much for a dog to process”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;From the growls I’m hearing around me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;My response struck a nerve</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Is this disregard toward authority I hear?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He tries to push me back once again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Maybe it is, what are ya gonna do, big boy?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This time it’s my turn to push him back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I’m gonna take you to prison, that’s what!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He opens his arms and tries to catch me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But I just step back, letting him lose his balance</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And that’s when I decide to strike</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I give the mutt a good headbutt to the face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And use his broad shoulders to vault over his body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You’ll have to catch me first!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The bulldog fall face first against the ground</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I give them a shitty grin and hightail out of there</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Hey, get back here!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I hear the bulldog shout out loud</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I hear their heavy footsteps behind me when they start giving chase</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I weave the incoming people in an attempt to lose them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But they’re keeping up pretty good</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Granted I’m too tired to go full speed right now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So I end up being chased all around town</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I make turns all over, slidning under carts and jumping over stands on purpose to get them to trip</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“What the hell is your problem!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shouts an angry vendor when I almost smash his products when jumping over the his stand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“My bad!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Damn, they’re a persistent bunch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But sucks for them, I found a way to lose them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If they’re as dumb as I think they are, they’ll fall for it </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I make a sharp turn and enter an alleyway between two tall houses</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Immediately jump up at the rooftop and lay down on it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I hear footsteps getting closer and into the alleyway</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Where did he go?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now I hear feet shuffling in place</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I then hear a stomp</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Damn it, keep looking for him!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They exit the alleyway</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And just like that, the chase ended</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I crouch on the edge of the rooftop and look down at the streets, watching the dumb guards still trying to find me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thinking I’m hiding on ground level</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And from the looks of it, they won’t stop any time soon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*Sigh*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With the guards after me like a criminal, they’ll certainly tell their boss I’m one</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Probably that I’m an assassin that came to kill it or some shit like that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thanks to this retarded weapon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I just had to go and pick it up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And since it’s the guard of this leader’s own city, the odds of whoever this person is helping me are next to none </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And it doesn’t help that the people around here doesn’t seem to like my face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Which is a bummer, I AM a handsome devil</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Tch, guess I’ll have to find another town to help with my little issue”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You’re not going anywhere, creature”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I raise my eyebrows in surprise</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And turn my head to see whoev-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh my</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What do we have here?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A deer, huh?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not bad I guess</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Too bad I can’t see shit under those loose robes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still, not a bad face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Despite her overly serious expression</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looks pretty cute</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I stand up and pat the dust off my armor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Well, hello there, what do I own the honor of your presence?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I close my eyes and bow down in front of her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I suddenly feel something tightening around my leg and wrists </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And I open my eyes in surprise to see white foreign letters floating around my wrists and legs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I try to move them, but they’re completely stuck in place</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A binding spell!?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You are under arrest for disregarding, assaulting, and resisting authority, as well as disturbing public peace”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She says it all in one go, the focused expression on her face not changing one bit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Direct to the point I see”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I give her the best smirk I can muster</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yet she completely ignores it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The mage walks up to me and forcefully grabs my chin to pull my body up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Man, she’s tall</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And her fur is damn soft</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“What an intriguing creature you are”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She mutters while turning my head left and right</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I’m intriguing in a lot of ways”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She instantly stops analyzing my face and looks me in the eye</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*Humph*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She the pushes her arm forward and I feel gravity pulling me down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh fuck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I fall from the edge of the rooftop and fall on my head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Ow!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fuck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Gezz, what a hard floor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I wouldn’t be surprised if the warm feeling in my head is blood right now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I try to get up, but with my entire legs tied by magic I’m as mobile as a cripple</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And I can only achieve turning around and laying on my back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And there is that mage</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking down on me from her spot in the rooftop</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Great”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I mutter to myself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Suddenly my vision goes slightly darker</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thanks to a shadow casted by a groups now surrounding me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I turn my head to look who’s-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh god dammit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The same bulldog from before grins at me and cracks his knuckles</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And I can’t help but laugh nervously</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Aha..haha..haahhh”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Chapter

his fists tightening around the halberd’s wooden pole</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I make myself confortable against the stone wall and continue to flick my coin up and down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After being on the receiving end of a few punches to the head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*Flick*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The bulldog guard realized my skull was just too hard for him</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And all he was achieving was smashing his fist into a bloody pulp</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So he decided to arrest me at once to save face for damaging himself more than he damaged me</div></li><li class="li1"><div

class="de1">&gt;But he had arms that ended in talons much like his feet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And a pair of wings on his back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*Flick*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“At ease, young one”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The eagle waves his hand to calm the guard down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He had a soothing, aging voice, with a lot of experience to accompany it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The weasel guard instantly stopped saluting and took a more relaxed stance</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Any reason to come down here, sir”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yes, I came to see our new prisoner”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*Catch*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I catch the coin and stop playing with it, turning my eyes to the eagle now looking at me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now that I can see his front, aside from being tall, he looks pretty strong as well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a large frame and wide shoulders</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Are you sure, sir?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The weasel asks while glaring at me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yes, I’d also like to speak to him in private”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The weasel jumps in surprise by this Reynfred guy’s request, and even I raise an eyebrow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why would he want to speak to me by himself?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I-if that’s your wish”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yes, please, leave us be”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The weasel gives a short bow, and walks away to leave the two of us alone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The eagle man continues to stare at me from his side of the bars</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;His analytical eagle eyes running all over my body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He doesn’t say anything</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just stands there, staring at me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If he’s not gonna say anything, might as well continue to keep myself occupied</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*Flick*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*Catch*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*Flick*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*Catch*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*Flick*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“So…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*Catch*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I heard you assaulted one of my guards”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I contemplate a little before nodding</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yup”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The eagle sighs and places his hands behind his back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“May I know the reason why?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I look up in though and scratch my chin in a mocking way</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Well, he tried to arrest me because I looked suspicious to him”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I tell him with a shrug</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The eagle‘s eyes turn to me and he stares deeply into my own</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“That’s not just it, is it?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I wanted to say that yes, it was</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But something about this eagle man compelled me to tell the truth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like I could trust him</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I sigh audibly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I can’t believe I’m gonna say this</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hopefully he won’t try to overfill my ass with magic spells to keep me imprisoned</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or else I’ll have to bust myself out this place</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Alright, I got frustrated he wasn’t being any help to me”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I admitted to the eagle man</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He nodded in my direction, but continued to stare at me in the eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What the hell is with that unblinking stare?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s fucking unsettling</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“And I was porting a weapon too”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I admit that as well with a huff</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This… Rainfield, was it? Nods again, and this time looks content in my answers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“And did you need to headbutt him?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And here we go, another question</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But this time I got you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Well, he DID try to grab and arrest me without evidence before I hit him, so I can’t be faulted for that”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I shrug my shoulders with a knowing smirk</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Self-defense, you know”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The eagle man looked at me with a slightly surprised expression</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before it eased and he started chuckling softly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Huh?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I audibly make my confusion known</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I guess you are correct”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I sit up straight, crossing my legs and then leaning forward with my elbows on my knees</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And give him a look with surprised all over it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Aren’t you… mad I hit your guard?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I say slowly, leaning forward a little more</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“A bit yes, but in the end, no harm was done”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“And I believe they deserved the opposition”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why would he think that?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I mean, I think that guy deserved what he got from me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But why would the Town’s very own leader?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And as if he was reading my mind</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The eagle man opens his beak to speak to me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You ran into the trouble makers of our Town Guard”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“They are generally good people, but that group in particular tends to jump to conclusions very fast”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I stroke my chin with my fingers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That would explain why the bulldog guy was so fast to assume I was some kind of crook</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I also want to know, why did they believe you to suspicious?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Really?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You haven’t noticed it yet?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;How about a little reminder?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I raise both my hands, and aim my forefingers at my face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Making sure my face told him it was the most obvious thing in the world</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Y-yes, I already knew that”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sure, eagle man</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But I heard that stutter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He brings one of his talons to his beak and coughs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Anyway, was there anything else that might’ve done it?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anything else…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hmmm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I guess saying I needed your help to go back home might’ve sounded a little to direct for their tastes”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I scratch the side of my head in wonder</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Aside from that damn crooked weapon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That’s the only thing I can think of</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I see”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The eagle cups the base of his beak with his talon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You said you want help, but why would you need mine?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Alright, here’s the thing, eagle man”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I even see him mouthing eagle man in surprise</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I can’t read shit in this place, and I need someone who’s at the very least decent at magic to help me get back home”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I extend an arm in his direction</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“And who better than the town’s very own chief to find someone fit for the job”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He coughs again, and collects himself from his surprised state</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I… guess you’re right…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then I see his eye ridges burrow in confusion</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“But why would you need a mage to help you?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Because…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I put my hands on my knees and pull myself up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Believe it or not, I’m from a different dimension”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;His eyes widen in shock at my claim</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He grabs the cells with his talons and leans closer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“A different dimension, that’s preposterous”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;My ass is preposterous</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Preposterously beautiful, that’s what</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Magic is a powerful art, eagle man”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I walk forward and meet him by the bars</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Touching them, and letting the energy force push my armored hand back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I lift my hand up to eye level, and show him the trail of smoke coming out of a charred patch on my gauntlet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I take you’re not well versed in it”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He slowly shakes his head left and right</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“There’s much more to it than chucking fireballs, or levitating objects”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“At the hands of a powerful mage, magic can be used to bend reality, go back in time, and of course”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I wave at myself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Hop between dimensions”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;From the look on his face he still doesn’t quite believe me yet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Tell me, have you ever seen anyone like me before?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;My question seems to have gotten him out of his funk</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“No, I can’t say I have”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He crosses his arms over his chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“But I still have my doubts about it. I find it hard to believe you’re from a different… dimension, and yet speaks our language so fluently”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I shrug my shoulders</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You just have to believe me”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I walk back to the far end of the cell and drop down against the wall</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Gotta get used to the cold wall I’m gonna stay locked up in this place</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I watch the eagle as he continues to stare</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;His eye ridges furrowing even further than before</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Clearly thinking deeply about something</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I see his chest rising as he inhaled air</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Only to release it all in a loud sigh</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Alright…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I lean forward</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Is my request a go?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“…I’ll help you” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh Yeah!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One step closer, baby</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;First day and I’m already making progress</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All I had to do was nearly smash someone’s skull in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I’ll have to look, but I’m sure there’s a mage available to help you”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“But because you assaulted someone, and an authority at that”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He the raises a talon and points one of his claws at me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I’ll place you under the Mage’s watch until I deem you a non-threat to my people’</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I press a finger on my temple</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I have a bad feeling about this</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Okay, I guess, as long as I get the mage”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I shrug my shoulders</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Then it’s settled, tomorrow morning I’ll be back with the mage I promised”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The eagle man tucks his talons inside the sleeves of his robs and leaves</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Leaving me alone in this prison</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I can feel a yawn coming</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I should just go rest already</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s been a pretty wild ride</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fighting sorcerers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Becoming an ice cube</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Getting kicked into dimensional portals</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Beating rats up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Running miles nonstop</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And getting chased by guards </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yeah, I think I should hit the sack already</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And sleep doesn’t take long because it comes before I even-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*ZZZZ*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*Clank*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*Clank*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*Clank*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Um, huh, wha?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What the fuck?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Where am I?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I rub the sleep off my eyes and look around</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh yeah</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I’m in jail</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I stifle a yawn</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*Clank*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*Clank*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">*Clank*</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Alright, god dammit, just wait a bit” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I yawn again as I turn my head to the bars</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And like promised the day before</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There was the eagle man in all of his glory</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And with him two companions</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The first one being a different guard from the one guarding me yesterday</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A bird as well, smaller than eagle man, and a bit smaller than me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looks like a hawk</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He’s hawk man for now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And he’s already at guard beside the prison cell</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And on the other side of eagle man was a little lizard</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At least that’s what I think it is</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With scales like that, it’s certainly no fish</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Boy or girl, I have no clue</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Cute kid though</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And the mage he promised is nowhere to be seen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Awesome</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I run a hair through my hair and stand up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Stretching my back and limbs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And only stopping after hearing the satisfying pop of my joints</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“So…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I lean my head left and right</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sighing in satisfaction after feeling it crack</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Where’s the mage”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eagle man moves his hand and pats the kid on its head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Getting a giggle from it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I turn my eyes back to the kid</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now that I got a good look at it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s wearing a white hooded robe with red triangle lining patter on the base and ends of the sleeves</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The hood was pulled back, giving me a chance to get a good look on the kid’s face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Light green scales, bright golden eyes, black slits for iris</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I have no idea what a young lizard is supposed to look</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But I guess the kid fits the criteria?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The kid also had a wooden staff strapped on…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Oh…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I turn my eyes to eagle man</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And answering my recent suspicion, he nodded in confirmation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I turn my eyes back to the kid, who looks at me with a smile on its face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No way</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No fucking way</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh come on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Seriously?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“A… kid?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I look back to eagle man, my hands motioning for the kid</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“He’s a talented kid, came from his home country to study magic and science”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh, so it’s a he</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At least I don’t need to call him an IT again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“He’s still a kid”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eagle man crosses his arms over his chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Is that a curve I see at the base of his beak?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Well, you’re not going anywhere, so I don’t see the problem with it”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I raise my finger to try and argue with him</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But stop midway with my mouth handing open</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He’s got a point</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So I just snap my fingers in frustration</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You look disappointed”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh really?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I expected the cutie that got me, to be honest”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He looks at me with an eye ridge raised, but doesn’t speak anything a about it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I look down at the lizard kid, and he looks ecstatic to see me for some reason</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I can even see his robes swishing around behind him</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The tip of his tail going crazy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A lizard wagging its tail, now I’ve seen it all</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I approach the bars and squat down in front of the kid</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“So, kid”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;His golden eyes following my every movement</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“How come you’re so happy to meet a convict?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Honest to god question</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why would a kid want to meet someone stuck in a prison cell?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This way I’ll start thinking common sense doesn’t exist for this boy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I’m excited to learn about, and from zee new species”</div></li><li class="li1"><div

up while waving my hand, telling him not to mind</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yeah, I guess this is good enough”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And better than nothing too, I guess</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I scratch the back of my head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“If the kid is as good as you say, I don’t think it’ll be too

that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Only I’m allowed to smirk like that, eagle man</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“And that’s it, basically, all you have to do is behave,

&gt;Great
&gt;Awesome
&gt;Fan-Fucking-Tastic
&gt;This is what I get for going after the big bad sorcerer
&gt;A one way inter-dimensional trip to god knows where
&gt;Encased in an ice-cube for that matter
&gt;I have no clue for how long I was frozen in ice before someone got me out
&gt;All I know is that when I woke up I was in a cave and there were three huge ass rats walking on two feet
&gt;Of course my instincts made themselves immediately known and I kicked their shit thinking they were wild animals
&gt;And now I have three poor sods unconscious in my feet
&gt;To make matters worse, they’re not even people
&gt;Well… maybe they were people
&gt;But not, you know, my people
&gt;A trio of sneaky looking anthropomorphic rats on tomb thieving garb
&gt;Or were they adventure garb?
&gt;It’s been so long since I’ve seen any that I don’t know which is which
&gt;Anyway
&gt;I squat down next to the body of one of these rat people to get a good look at them
&gt;They’re about the size of a teen, maybe that of a 12 year old human kid
&gt;Got digitigrade legs, with fleshy rat feet just like actual rats from back home
&gt;Aside from the feet, overall body structure seems similar to humans
&gt;A pink thin tail
&gt;Five fingered hands with opposing thumbs an all
&gt;Legs are a bit shorter if compared to our proportions though
&gt;But even after looking at the little guy
&gt;I still can’t get over it
&gt;Despite the fact that I should
&gt;I’m no stranger to other races and creatures
&gt;I’ve seen elves, dwarves, centaurs, druids, gnomes, goblins, orcs
&gt;Ghouls, dragons, unicorns, griffons, mermaids
&gt;And so and so forth
&gt;But animal people is completely new to me
&gt;A centaur would count, I guess?
&gt;But still have a human’s torso, so I guess it doesn’t
&gt;Hmm?
&gt;Oho, what do we have here?
“Don’t mind me, just making myself at home”
&gt;I mutter to myself while I snatch a small bag tied to the rat’s hip
&gt;I feel the weight in my hands, and the sound of clanking metal
&gt;And just as I thought, gold
&gt;I take one gold coin and turn it around between my fingers
“Huh, some things don’t change I guess”
&gt;I flick the gold coin up in the air and grab it back as it falls
&gt;My eyes continue to inspect the rat, and fall on a sheathed blade hanging from the other side of its hip
“What do we have here?”
&gt;I take the blade’s grip and pull it from the sheath
&gt;A crooked dagger
&gt;I inspect the blade, throwing it up and catching when it came down
“Well, looks like you’re thieves after all”
&gt;I plunge the blade’s entire length into the rocky floor
“Then I won’t feel so bad for taking your gold”
&gt;I mean, have anyone seen a good guy with a crooked weapon?
&gt;I certainly haven’t
&gt;And that’s enough confirmation for me
&gt;Rounding up the other two, I loot whatever they have that can be useful to me
&gt;Unfortunately I don’t find a lot
&gt;Mostly because I don’t know what the fuck they’re carrying and what they do
&gt;There’s a bunch of artifacts, but none of them seen useful in any way
&gt;So I just grab the basics
&gt;The gold coins from the other two rats
&gt;A map which I can’t read because I don’t know shit about this place yet
&gt;And a weapon to defend myself
&gt;I’m pretty confident in my ass kicking abilities
&gt;But having a weapon to stab someone works far better than punching their faces in
&gt;Now all I have to do is get out of this cave
&gt;Find a way to go back to my world
&gt;And hand that sorcerer’s ass to him
&gt;With my priorities set, I start my way out
&gt;The caveis pretty damn dark
&gt;But that’s about everything interesting with this hole
&gt;Nothing to fight
&gt;Nothing to find
&gt;Just darkness and cold rock walls
&gt;It took some time, but I finally got out of the cave
&gt;And now I’m in a mountain side, way high near the top of a mountain
&gt;God damn, that sorcerer was pretty specific when he sent me hear it seems
&gt;The view was pretty kick ass though
&gt;There was a shit ton of green everywhere I looked
&gt;With villages, cities, lakes, forests, some ruins, and all that jazz sprinkled around
&gt;And far away into the horizon I could make out the ocean and a port city
&gt;Look down, I realize just how tall tall this place is
&gt;It’s kind of impressive that the three rats managed to climb all the way up here 
&gt;Still, high or not, this is nothing I haven’t overcome before
&gt;Hopping down the mountain side, I connect my armored feet against the rock surface and slide my way down
&gt;While sliding down the mountain, I catch sight of a city, the nearest one from my position
&gt;And now I know where I have to go next to get me one step closer to going home
&gt;As soon as the ground floor started getting closer
&gt;I jump off the mountain side, into the forest below that surrounded the mountain
&gt;And make a mad dash to the direction where I last saw that city
&gt;If this place is anything like home, magic is a thing, and there must be magic spells for inter-dimensional travel

Chapter 2

“Look at that!”
“What is that?”
“Is it a monster?”
“It doesn’t look like one”
“But it’s so weird looking”
“Maybe it’s an animal”
“Why would an animal need a blade and armor?”
“Maybe it’s a familiar”
“A…a familiar? Does that mean a witch is nearby?”
“Or it could be a summon, you know, from those magic users&quot;
&quot;Yeahm I heard some of them summon creatures from another realm”
“That would explain the strange appearance”
“Why is it crouched in front of that sign?”
“It looks like it’s trying to read it”
“Ah! It got angry and left”
&gt;God dammit
&gt;I sigh out loud in frustration, running a hand through my hair
&gt;Turns out their written system is completely different
&gt;Thankfully we speak the same ‘language’
&gt;But I still can’t understand shit in that sign 
&gt;And if I can’t understand shit, I can’t read shit
&gt;And if I can’t read shit, books and scrolls are useless to me
&gt;And that fact alone just made my quest a whole lot harder than it should be
&gt;I drag my hands down my face in frustration
&gt;Well, at least there’s solace in this whole situation
&gt;And they’re big
&gt;Furry
&gt;And come in all sizes
&gt;Ohoho, yes
&gt;I think I might enjoy my stay in here
&gt;This city also looks pretty nice
&gt;Very much like the ones from back home
&gt;Only inhabited by animal people, rather than people people.
&gt;Everything is kinda like home honestly
&gt;It’s like someone made a copy of my world and swapped the humans for whatever these guys are called, and the fauna for weird looking creatures
&gt;Of course not everything was exactly the same
&gt;It seems things over here are built to accommodate these guys’ needs
&gt;Like some houses have bigger doors and windows than others
&gt;And I’m pretty that those wooden perchs all around the rooftops
&gt;And door entrances above some houses’ rooftops are meant for bird people
&gt;And there’s even water pathways running along the streets on this city
&gt;Although I have yet to see any fish people swimming on those
&gt;Maybe those are just rivers and I’m overthinking it
&gt;Either way
&gt;I need to find someone with at the very least some decent knowledge on magic around here
&gt;I’d try to talk to the townsfolk, but they seem pretty wary of me
&gt;So my best bet is going to the castle sitting in the end of the city
&gt;And that’s where I would go
&gt;If I wasn’t interrupted immediately after
“Halt, creature!”
&gt;I hear someone call from behind
&gt;And all around me other of these animal people showed up
&gt;These were armed and armored though
&gt;All of their armors bearing the same design and patterns
&gt;Guess they must be city guards or something
&gt;Standing in a circle formation, they had their spears pointed toward me
&gt;All of them were dogs though
&gt;Which makes sense
&gt;Who better to guard some place than a dog?
&gt;And is kinda funny too
&gt;Guards
&gt;Dogs
&gt;You get the idea
“State your business”
&gt;I turn to the one calling to me
&gt;He’s a bit bigger than the rest of the dogs
&gt;And bulkier as well
&gt;Compared to me though, he a bit on the short side
&gt;I think he’s a bulldog
&gt;With those saggy, flaccid cheeks and droopy, bored eyes
&gt;Like he desperately needs to sleep
&gt;Definitely a bulldog
&gt;Strange, why would the bulldog be taller than the rest?
&gt;They’re short as shit compared to other dogs
&gt;This place doesn’t make sense
“Answer me!”
&gt;He gets frustrated at my lack of response and aims his spear close to my face
&gt;I go cross eyed trying to see the tip of the spear right between my eyes
“Okay, alright, geez”
&gt;All of them gasp and go wide eyed when they hear me talk
&gt;What the fuck?
&gt;They ask me to answer and get surprised when I do?
&gt;What were they expecting me to do?
&gt;Bark?
&gt;I take the tip of the spear near my face between my fingers and push it down
“If you really need to know what I want, I need to speak to your king, or whatever higher power you have in this place”
&gt;The bulldog snaps out of his stupor and pulls the spear from my grip
&gt;Once again aiming it at my head
“What does a creature like you needs with our leader?”
&gt;The other dogs come out of their funk as well and form a tighter circle around me
“This creature”
&gt;I hold both hands up and point to my face
“Needs a way to go back home, and I believe your leader can help me”
&gt;The bulldog pulls the spear away and steps closer to me
&gt;I have to hold my breath as soon as he gets his ugly mug near my face
&gt;Dog breath is as universal as gold coins apparently
“Humph, and you want me to believe that? You look pretty suspicious, what even are you?”
&gt;I have to lean my head back in order to take a deep, refreshing breath
“I’m a human”
&gt;The bulldog turns his head left and right while keeping an eye on me
&gt;An eye ridge lifted all the while, showing his suspicion
“A hooman?”
&gt;He spells it out slowly
&gt;Eh, it’s a good shot for someone hearing the word for the first time
&gt;So I nod in confirmation
“Never heard of one”
&gt;He mutters slowly to my face
&gt;The rest of the dogs under his command comment the same
&gt;So there really aren’t any humans in this place
“So, hooman”
&gt;He snaps his head closer to mine in a quick movement
“What are your true intentions?”
&gt;True inte-
&gt;What?
“I just told you what I want!”
“Do you think I’m dumb? I have never seen anything like you before&quot;
&quot;And you’re even carrying a crooked weapon, what ensures me you’re not lying through your teeth, huh?”
&gt;The crooked weapon, I shoud&#039;ve known
&gt;God, I feel stupid
“Well, I have never seen anything like you ether, yet here I am, asking for help!”
&gt;We butt heads and try to push the other back
“And you expect me to help just because of that?”
&gt;He tries to push me back by bumping chest against mine
&gt;Suffice to say it doesn’t work, I don’t even budge
“No, I expected you to help me because that’s part of your job”
&gt;I raise a hand and tap the side of his had with finger
“But I guess that’s too much for a dog to process”
&gt;From the growls I’m hearing around me
&gt;My response struck a nerve
“Is this disregard toward authority I hear?”
&gt;He tries to push me back once again
“Maybe it is, what are ya gonna do, big boy?”
&gt;This time it’s my turn to push him back
“I’m gonna take you to prison, that’s what!”
&gt;He opens his arms and tries to catch me
&gt;But I just step back, letting him lose his balance
&gt;And that’s when I decide to strike
&gt;I give the mutt a good headbutt to the face
&gt;And use his broad shoulders to vault over his body
“You’ll have to catch me first!”
&gt;The bulldog fall face first against the ground
&gt;I give them a shitty grin and hightail out of there
“Hey, get back here!”
&gt;I hear the bulldog shout out loud
&gt;I hear their heavy footsteps behind me when they start giving chase
&gt;I weave the incoming people in an attempt to lose them
&gt;But they’re keeping up pretty good
&gt;Granted I’m too tired to go full speed right now
&gt;So I end up being chased all around town
&gt;I make turns all over, slidning under carts and jumping over stands on purpose to get them to trip
“What the hell is your problem!”
&gt;Shouts an angry vendor when I almost smash his products when jumping over the his stand
“My bad!”
&gt;Damn, they’re a persistent bunch
&gt;But sucks for them, I found a way to lose them
&gt;If they’re as dumb as I think they are, they’ll fall for it 
&gt;I make a sharp turn and enter an alleyway between two tall houses
&gt;Immediately jump up at the rooftop and lay down on it
&gt;I hear footsteps getting closer and into the alleyway
“Where did he go?”
&gt;Now I hear feet shuffling in place
&gt;I then hear a stomp
“Damn it, keep looking for him!”
&gt;They exit the alleyway
&gt;And just like that, the chase ended
&gt;I crouch on the edge of the rooftop and look down at the streets, watching the dumb guards still trying to find me
&gt;Thinking I’m hiding on ground level
&gt;And from the looks of it, they won’t stop any time soon
*Sigh*
&gt;With the guards after me like a criminal, they’ll certainly tell their boss I’m one
&gt;Probably that I’m an assassin that came to kill it or some shit like that
&gt;Thanks to this retarded weapon
&gt;I just had to go and pick it up
&gt;And since it’s the guard of this leader’s own city, the odds of whoever this person is helping me are next to none 
&gt;And it doesn’t help that the people around here doesn’t seem to like my face
&gt;Which is a bummer, I AM a handsome devil
“Tch, guess I’ll have to find another town to help with my little issue”
“You’re not going anywhere, creature”
&gt;I raise my eyebrows in surprise
&gt;And turn my head to see whoev-
&gt;Oh my
&gt;What do we have here?
&gt;A deer, huh?
&gt;Not bad I guess
&gt;Too bad I can’t see shit under those loose robes
&gt;Still, not a bad face
&gt;Despite her overly serious expression
&gt;Looks pretty cute
&gt;I stand up and pat the dust off my armor
“Well, hello there, what do I own the honor of your presence?”
&gt;I close my eyes and bow down in front of her
&gt;I suddenly feel something tightening around my leg and wrists 
&gt;And I open my eyes in surprise to see white foreign letters floating around my wrists and legs
&gt;I try to move them, but they’re completely stuck in place
&gt;A binding spell!?
“You are under arrest for disregarding, assaulting, and resisting authority, as well as disturbing public peace”
&gt;She says it all in one go, the focused expression on her face not changing one bit
“Direct to the point I see”
&gt;I give her the best smirk I can muster
&gt;Yet she completely ignores it
&gt;The mage walks up to me and forcefully grabs my chin to pull my body up
&gt;Man, she’s tall
&gt;And her fur is damn soft
“What an intriguing creature you are”
&gt;She mutters while turning my head left and right
“I’m intriguing in a lot of ways”
&gt;She instantly stops analyzing my face and looks me in the eye
*Humph*
&gt;She the pushes her arm forward and I feel gravity pulling me down
&gt;Oh fuck
&gt;I fall from the edge of the rooftop and fall on my head
“Ow!”
&gt;Fuck
&gt;Gezz, what a hard floor
&gt;I wouldn’t be surprised if the warm feeling in my head is blood right now
&gt;I try to get up, but with my entire legs tied by magic I’m as mobile as a cripple
&gt;And I can only achieve turning around and laying on my back
&gt;And there is that mage
&gt;Looking down on me from her spot in the rooftop
“Great”
&gt;I mutter to myself
&gt;Suddenly my vision goes slightly darker
&gt;Thanks to a shadow casted by a groups now surrounding me
&gt;I turn my head to look who’s-
&gt;Oh god dammit
&gt;The same bulldog from before grins at me and cracks his knuckles
&gt;And I can’t help but laugh nervously
“Aha..haha..haahhh”
&gt;Shit

Chapter 3


*Flick*
*Catch*
*Flick*
*Catch*
*Flick*
*Catch*
*Flick*
*Catch*
“Will you stop that!? It’s making me nervous!”
&gt;I turn my head the weasel prison guard just sitting outside of my cell keeping an eye on me and send him a smirk
*Flick*
“No”
*Catch*
&gt;He just groans and turns around
&gt;But it doesn’t really help him much because I can see his ears twitch to the sound
&gt;And his fists tightening around the halberd’s wooden pole
&gt;I make myself confortable against the stone wall and continue to flick my coin up and down
&gt;After being on the receiving end of a few punches to the head
*Flick*
&gt;The bulldog guard realized my skull was just too hard for him
&gt;And all he was achieving was smashing his fist into a bloody pulp
&gt;So he decided to arrest me at once to save face for damaging himself more than he damaged me
*Catch*
&gt;I didn’t came out unscathed though
&gt;My skin isn’t made of steel, so I got a few black &amp; blue bruises on my face
&gt;Now here I am, stuck on a boring cell that smells like shit
*Flick*
&gt;And being guarded by a weasel who looks like he’d rather be doing something else 
&gt;My only source of entertainment is the gold coin I managed to bring with me
&gt;And now pissing the weasel off
*Catch*
*Flick*
&gt;I’m pretty sure the reason he haven’t opened that cell and taken the coin from me yet
&gt;Is because he’s afraid I might beat him up because of it
&gt;And maybe escape
&gt;But he’s more afraid of getting hit
*Catch*
&gt;The sound of footsteps invade my ears all of a sudden
&gt;And it looks like the weasel heard it do
*Flick*
&gt;He turns his head to the far end of the corridor
&gt;Where the staircase leading to the offices
&gt;As for me, I can’t see shit
*Catch*
&gt;But the footsteps I’m hearing are getting closers and closer
&gt;The weasel immediately stands up from the stool rested on and saluted to the incoming whoever
“Town Chief Reynfred!”
&gt;Town chief?
*Flick*
&gt;And into the fray, from beyond the bars, comes an eagle, taller than me, and wearing a regal looking set of robes
&gt;The kind more suited to a priest, or a nobleman
&gt;Although I don’t see any religious imagery on his robes
&gt;Nor do I see jewels and gold adorning the entirety of it
&gt;They’re just really fancy looking robes
*Catch*
&gt;What surprised me the most was that he had arms and wings
&gt;I thought the bird people’s arms would be their wings
&gt;But he had arms that ended in talons much like his feet
&gt;And a pair of wings on his back
*Flick*
“At ease, young one”
&gt;The eagle waves his hand to calm the guard down
&gt;He had a soothing, aging voice, with a lot of experience to accompany it
&gt;The weasel guard instantly stopped saluting and took a more relaxed stance
“Any reason to come down here, sir”
“Yes, I came to see our new prisoner”
*Catch*
&gt;I catch the coin and stop playing with it, turning my eyes to the eagle now looking at me
&gt;Now that I can see his front, aside from being tall, he looks pretty strong as well
&gt;With a large frame and wide shoulders
“Are you sure, sir?”
&gt;The weasel asks while glaring at me
“Yes, I’d also like to speak to him in private”
&gt;The weasel jumps in surprise by this Reynfred guy’s request, and even I raise an eyebrow
&gt;Why would he want to speak to me by himself?
“I-if that’s your wish”
“Yes, please, leave us be”
&gt;The weasel gives a short bow, and walks away to leave the two of us alone
&gt;The eagle man continues to stare at me from his side of the bars
&gt;His analytical eagle eyes running all over my body
&gt;He doesn’t say anything
&gt;Just stands there, staring at me
&gt;If he’s not gonna say anything, might as well continue to keep myself occupied
*Flick*
*Catch*
*Flick*
*Catch*
*Flick*
“So…”
*Catch*
“I heard you assaulted one of my guards”
&gt;I contemplate a little before nodding
“Yup”
&gt;The eagle sighs and places his hands behind his back
“May I know the reason why?”
&gt;I look up in though and scratch my chin in a mocking way
“Well, he tried to arrest me because I looked suspicious to him”
&gt;I tell him with a shrug
&gt;The eagle‘s eyes turn to me and he stares deeply into my own
“That’s not just it, is it?”
&gt;I wanted to say that yes, it was
&gt;But something about this eagle man compelled me to tell the truth
&gt;Like I could trust him
&gt;I sigh audibly
&gt;I can’t believe I’m gonna say this
&gt;Hopefully he won’t try to overfill my ass with magic spells to keep me imprisoned
&gt;Or else I’ll have to bust myself out this place
“Alright, I got frustrated he wasn’t being any help to me”
&gt;I admitted to the eagle man
&gt;He nodded in my direction, but continued to stare at me in the eyes
&gt;What the hell is with that unblinking stare?
&gt;It’s fucking unsettling
“And I was porting a weapon too”
&gt;I admit that as well with a huff
&gt;This… Rainfield, was it? Nods again, and this time looks content in my answers
“And did you need to headbutt him?”
&gt;And here we go, another question
&gt;But this time I got you
“Well, he DID try to grab and arrest me without evidence before I hit him, so I can’t be faulted for that”
&gt;I shrug my shoulders with a knowing smirk
“Self-defense, you know”
&gt;The eagle man looked at me with a slightly surprised expression
&gt;Before it eased and he started chuckling softly
“Huh?”
&gt;I audibly make my confusion known
“I guess you are correct”
&gt;I sit up straight, crossing my legs and then leaning forward with my elbows on my knees
&gt;And give him a look with surprised all over it
“Aren’t you… mad I hit your guard?”
&gt;I say slowly, leaning forward a little more
“A bit yes, but in the end, no harm was done”
“And I believe they deserved the opposition”
&gt;What?
&gt;Why would he think that?
&gt;I mean, I think that guy deserved what he got from me
&gt;But why would the Town’s very own leader?
&gt;And as if he was reading my mind
&gt;The eagle man opens his beak to speak to me
“You ran into the trouble makers of our Town Guard”
“They are generally good people, but that group in particular tends to jump to conclusions very fast”
&gt;I stroke my chin with my fingers
&gt;That would explain why the bulldog guy was so fast to assume I was some kind of crook
“I also want to know, why did they believe you to suspicious?”
&gt;Wow
&gt;Really?
&gt;You haven’t noticed it yet?
&gt;How about a little reminder?
&gt;I raise both my hands, and aim my forefingers at my face
&gt;Making sure my face told him it was the most obvious thing in the world
“Y-yes, I already knew that”
&gt;Sure, eagle man
&gt;But I heard that stutter
&gt;He brings one of his talons to his beak and coughs
“Anyway, was there anything else that might’ve done it?”
&gt;Anything else…
&gt;Hmmm
“I guess saying I needed your help to go back home might’ve sounded a little to direct for their tastes”
&gt;I scratch the side of my head in wonder
&gt;Aside from that damn crooked weapon
&gt;That’s the only thing I can think of
“I see”
&gt;The eagle cups the base of his beak with his talon
“You said you want help, but why would you need mine?”
“Alright, here’s the thing, eagle man”
&gt;I even see him mouthing eagle man in surprise
“I can’t read shit in this place, and I need someone who’s at the very least decent at magic to help me get back home”
&gt;I extend an arm in his direction
“And who better than the town’s very own chief to find someone fit for the job”
&gt;He coughs again, and collects himself from his surprised state
“I… guess you’re right…”
&gt;Then I see his eye ridges burrow in confusion
“But why would you need a mage to help you?”
“Because…”
&gt;I put my hands on my knees and pull myself up
“Believe it or not, I’m from a different dimension”
&gt;His eyes widen in shock at my claim
&gt;He grabs the cells with his talons and leans closer
“A different dimension, that’s preposterous”
&gt;My ass is preposterous
&gt;Preposterously beautiful, that’s what
“Magic is a powerful art, eagle man”
&gt;I walk forward and meet him by the bars
&gt;Touching them, and letting the energy force push my armored hand back
&gt;I lift my hand up to eye level, and show him the trail of smoke coming out of a charred patch on my gauntlet
“I take you’re not well versed in it”
&gt;He slowly shakes his head left and right
“There’s much more to it than chucking fireballs, or levitating objects”
“At the hands of a powerful mage, magic can be used to bend reality, go back in time, and of course”
&gt;I wave at myself
“Hop between dimensions”
&gt;From the look on his face he still doesn’t quite believe me yet
“Tell me, have you ever seen anyone like me before?”
&gt;My question seems to have gotten him out of his funk
“No, I can’t say I have”
&gt;He crosses his arms over his chest
“But I still have my doubts about it. I find it hard to believe you’re from a different… dimension, and yet speaks our language so fluently”
&gt;I shrug my shoulders
“You just have to believe me”
&gt;I walk back to the far end of the cell and drop down against the wall
&gt;Gotta get used to the cold wall I’m gonna stay locked up in this place
&gt;I watch the eagle as he continues to stare
&gt;His eye ridges furrowing even further than before
&gt;Clearly thinking deeply about something
&gt;I see his chest rising as he inhaled air
&gt;Only to release it all in a loud sigh
“Alright…”
&gt;I lean forward
&gt;Is my request a go?
“…I’ll help you” 
&gt;Oh Yeah!
&gt;One step closer, baby
&gt;First day and I’m already making progress
&gt;All I had to do was nearly smash someone’s skull in
“I’ll have to look, but I’m sure there’s a mage available to help you”
“But because you assaulted someone, and an authority at that”
&gt;He the raises a talon and points one of his claws at me
“I’ll place you under the Mage’s watch until I deem you a non-threat to my people’
&gt;I press a finger on my temple
&gt;I have a bad feeling about this
“Okay, I guess, as long as I get the mage”
&gt;I shrug my shoulders
“Then it’s settled, tomorrow morning I’ll be back with the mage I promised”
&gt;The eagle man tucks his talons inside the sleeves of his robs and leaves
&gt;Leaving me alone in this prison
&gt;I can feel a yawn coming
&gt;I should just go rest already
&gt;It’s been a pretty wild ride
&gt;Fighting sorcerers
&gt;Becoming an ice cube
&gt;Getting kicked into dimensional portals
&gt;Beating rats up
&gt;Running miles nonstop
&gt;And getting chased by guards 
&gt;Yeah, I think I should hit the sack already
&gt;And sleep doesn’t take long because it comes before I even-
*ZZZZ*




*Clank*
*Clank*
*Clank*
“Um, huh, wha?”
&gt;What the fuck?
&gt;Where am I?
&gt;I rub the sleep off my eyes and look around
&gt;Oh yeah
&gt;I’m in jail
&gt;I stifle a yawn
*Clank*
*Clank*
*Clank*
“Alright, god dammit, just wait a bit” 
&gt;I yawn again as I turn my head to the bars
&gt;And like promised the day before
&gt;There was the eagle man in all of his glory
&gt;And with him two companions
&gt;The first one being a different guard from the one guarding me yesterday
&gt;A bird as well, smaller than eagle man, and a bit smaller than me
&gt;Looks like a hawk
&gt;He’s hawk man for now
&gt;And he’s already at guard beside the prison cell
&gt;And on the other side of eagle man was a little lizard
&gt;At least that’s what I think it is
&gt;With scales like that, it’s certainly no fish
&gt;Boy or girl, I have no clue
&gt;Cute kid though
&gt;And the mage he promised is nowhere to be seen
&gt;Awesome
&gt;I run a hair through my hair and stand up
&gt;Stretching my back and limbs
&gt;And only stopping after hearing the satisfying pop of my joints
“So…”
&gt;I lean my head left and right
&gt;Sighing in satisfaction after feeling it crack
“Where’s the mage”
&gt;Eagle man moves his hand and pats the kid on its head
&gt;Getting a giggle from it
&gt;I turn my eyes back to the kid
&gt;Now that I got a good look at it
&gt;It’s wearing a white hooded robe with red triangle lining patter on the base and ends of the sleeves
&gt;The hood was pulled back, giving me a chance to get a good look on the kid’s face
&gt;Light green scales, bright golden eyes, black slits for iris
&gt;I have no idea what a young lizard is supposed to look
&gt;But I guess the kid fits the criteria?
&gt;The kid also had a wooden staff strapped on…
&gt;Oh?
“Oh…”
&gt;I turn my eyes to eagle man
&gt;And answering my recent suspicion, he nodded in confirmation
&gt;I turn my eyes back to the kid, who looks at me with a smile on its face
&gt;No way
&gt;No fucking way
&gt;Oh come on
&gt;Seriously?
“A… kid?”
&gt;I look back to eagle man, my hands motioning for the kid
“He’s a talented kid, came from his home country to study magic and science”
&gt;Oh, so it’s a he
&gt;At least I don’t need to call him an IT again
“He’s still a kid”
&gt;Eagle man crosses his arms over his chest
&gt;Is that a curve I see at the base of his beak?
“Well, you’re not going anywhere, so I don’t see the problem with it”
&gt;I raise my finger to try and argue with him
&gt;But stop midway with my mouth handing open
&gt;He’s got a point
&gt;So I just snap my fingers in frustration
“You look disappointed”
&gt;Oh really?
“I expected the cutie that got me, to be honest”
&gt;He looks at me with an eye ridge raised, but doesn’t speak anything a about it
&gt;I look down at the lizard kid, and he looks ecstatic to see me for some reason
&gt;I can even see his robes swishing around behind him
&gt;The tip of his tail going crazy
&gt;A lizard wagging its tail, now I’ve seen it all
&gt;I approach the bars and squat down in front of the kid
“So, kid”
&gt;His golden eyes following my every movement
“How come you’re so happy to meet a convict?”
&gt;Honest to god question
&gt;Why would a kid want to meet someone stuck in a prison cell?
&gt;This way I’ll start thinking common sense doesn’t exist for this boy
“I’m excited to learn about, and from zee new species”
&gt;What the fuck?
&gt;Is that German accent I hear?
&gt;So what, are you gonna tell me there’s a language here for each one back home now?
“Hmm, Vat is zee matter, mister?”
&gt;My face must’ve been pretty out there for the kid to ask that
*Sigh*
“It’s nothing, kid”
&gt;I stand up while waving my hand, telling him not to mind
“Yeah, I guess this is good enough”
&gt;And better than nothing too, I guess
&gt;I scratch the back of my head
“If the kid is as good as you say, I don’t think it’ll be too much of a hassle” 
&gt;Eagle man nods, and asks the lizard kid to remove the spell on the cell bars
&gt;And orders hawk man to open the cell for me
&gt;I walk past the open doorway as soon as I can
&gt;But it seems birdy here still have something to say
&gt;Because he extends an arm over my chest to keep me from going
“Before you go, here are the ground rules”
&gt;I sigh loudly in frustration, but turn my head to listen to him
“You are going to live with him from now on”
&gt;…
&gt;I turn my head between eagle man, the kid, and back to eagle man
&gt;And point a hand toward the kid
&gt;Eagle man, much to my dismay, nods in confirmation
&gt;The kid’s house?
&gt;God dammit, what did I set myself up to?
&gt;Well, it beats having to sleep on the cell’s floor
&gt;So one positive, I guess 
&gt;I take a quick gander at the kid to see what he thinks about it
&gt;And he don’t look the least bit uncomfortable with that
 “You are to always be under watch from him”
&gt;He points at the boy, who waves his hand at me
“That means, you can only leave the house you’ll be staying if he’s to accompany you”
&gt;So I’ll be babysat around town
&gt;By a kid no less
&gt;Fantastic
&gt;I can already feel my fingers instinctively pinching the bridge of my nose without me actually doing it myself 
“If you step out of line even once, we’ll put you back into that cell for good”
&gt;Now that’s one promise I know you can’t fulfill eagle man
&gt;If I wanted to get out of here I would’ve done it already
&gt;But I need your mage, so I’ll play your game
“Alright, I’ll be a good boy”
&gt;I smirk when I see the edges of his beak turn down with a frown
&gt;I guess he’s not really fond of sarcasm
&gt;He chose not to comment on it though
“And you’re not allowed to leave until you finish helping all the owners of the carts and stands that you damaged on your chase”
&gt;What?
“But I didn’t smash any of their carts”
&gt;I get to his face, demanding an explanation
“You didn’t do it directly, but my guards smashed through a lot of the carts you used as obstacles for them”
“And because it was your fault, you’ll be the one responsible”
&gt;Those fucking dogs
“This is bullshit!”
&gt;The biggest
“If you didn’t ran, none of this would’ve happened”
&gt;I tighten my fists in annoyance, hearing them pop
&gt;He had a point
“You win this one, eagle man”
&gt;Oh… I see that smirk
&gt;Cease that
&gt;Only I’m allowed to smirk like that, eagle man
“And that’s it, basically, all you have to do is behave, and you’ll not have trouble”
&gt;…
“Yes, sir”
&gt;I manage to grunt between my teeth
“Good, then I bid you adieu”
&gt;He patted me on my shoulder plate armor and left
“And one more thing”
&gt;He stopped midway and turned back to face me
“The name is Reynfred”
&gt;Yeah, whatever, eagle man
&gt;And with that, he left for good
&gt;Leaving me, the kid, and hawk man alone
&gt;I run my hand through my hair, and sigh audibly
&gt;The sound echoing through the prison’s corridors
&gt;I look down at the kid, who’s still staring at me with excitement and curiosity
“So… what’s your name kid?”</textarea>
