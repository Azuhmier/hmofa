you say as you slow down to let him take the lead.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Aight, got your gun on non lethal right? not gonna shoot me in the back or anything&quot; he says as he walks past you, eyeing your handcannon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You melodramatically spin the cylinder to from lethal to non-lethal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Happy?&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He only answers with a smile that grows and grows and has too many teeth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You blink hard and his normal face returns.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you continue up the stairs for a while until Gabriel stops at a door, checks his phone for a moment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The door has the words &quot;Dance hall: Rave&quot; on them in bright holographic letters that shimmer and change color.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Faint music can be heard from beyond it, as the letters being to warp into snakes which slither down the wall to begin to wrap around Gabriel&#039;s legs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The fact he doesn&#039;t notice or care which tells you that you&#039;re the only one seeing it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;He in there?&quot;

aren&#039;t distinguishable at all instead being a mass of neon outlines.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Flares&quot; of neon light shoot out from the group and create neon fires where they land.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Focus, keep your gun up and eyes open, drugs be damned.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The mark is in here, and probably dangerous.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look around and hope to find him but fail to make out anything.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;There he is&quot;

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Blaring music jolts you awake as the heavy bass of some &quot;song&quot; drops.
&gt;Quickly you get up and rush to your open window and slam it shut, cursing yourself for leaving it open again.
&gt;You had hoped that the loud rain from the electrical storm would keep up and let you get a decent nights sleep.
&gt;It had sounded so peaceful...
&gt;The ceiling above you rumbles as the Bass drops again.
&gt;Ugh your new neighbors...Ever since they moved in they&#039;ve been playing that weird cheeki breeki music with the heavy bass.
&gt;It was bad enough you live in a shitty part of the city, but you also had no where else to move.
&gt;No one wants to deal with an implant less bounty hunter, too much of a risk.
&gt;Luckily (or unluckily in this case) you found this one &quot;apartment&quot; that was run by an AI, so it didn&#039;t care if you didn&#039;t have an implant, but similarly, it didn&#039;t care about your complaints of loud music.
&gt;You grumble to yourself as you shuffle to your &quot;kitchen&quot; and hit a few buttons on your food synth for something resembling food.
&gt;It shudders a few times until you hit it on the side; then it chokes out something looking like ham, cheese, and eggs.
&gt;You take the meal and are about to begin looking through bounties when your Holophone rings and displays a small Hologram of Gabriel.
&gt;&quot;Whats up?&quot; you ask before you shovel in a mouthful of food.
&gt;&quot;Geez dude you just wake up? you look like you lost a fight with a street sweeper&quot; Gabriel says with an amused smile, looking you over.
&gt;Gabriel&#039;s face always reminded you of a piece of steel made to look like a man, all sharp angles and grey eyes; today his dark brown hair is slicked back and down past his ears.
&gt;&quot;Bite me, those fucking cheeki breekis have made sleeping hard&quot; you say between mouthfuls of food.
&gt;Gabriel&#039;s smile goes away and is replaced by one of annoyance.
&gt;&quot;You tried talking to them about it?&quot; he asks as he slides his metal left arm into place.
&gt;You nod as you finish scarfing down your food.
&gt;&quot;Yea man, they yelled at me in Russian or something then turned it up louder&quot; you respond as you begin getting ready for the day.
&gt;&quot;I haven&#039;t found us a mark yet&quot; you call out to him as you pull your shirt and gun belt on.
&gt;This is how it usually goes, you find a good bounty; then Gabriel and you track them down, with Gabriel providing transportation.
&gt;Hard to drive around the city without the right implants to make a car go, let alone start up.
&gt;&quot;All good, I got a good one lined up&quot; is Gabriel&#039;s almost giddy response.
&gt;Which immediately tells you somethings up.
&gt;&quot;Whoa whoa NO! What&#039;s going on&quot; you demand, grabbing your holophone and looking Gabriel&#039;s hologram and his surroundings over.
&gt;&quot;Nothing! Why you gotta be so paranoid Null?&quot; he asks, giving an over exaggerated shrug.
&gt;He&#039;s in his speeder, nothing out of the ordinary in it.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s my Job to be paranoid, and I have been since you tried to sicc Fox&#039;s cousin on me&quot; you quip, loading your handgun and sliding into your holster.
&gt;&quot;You focus TOO much on your job and She was in HEAT dude!&quot; Gabriel responds as though that should be a good excuse.
&gt;&quot;She tried to Knife me!&quot; you shoot back.
&gt;&quot;SHE. WAS. IN. HEAT.&quot; he responds louder and slower.
&gt;You sigh and pinch the bridge of your nose, trying to push back what you knew would be a headache later.
&gt;&quot;Whatever, whats the mark? anything special?&quot; you sigh in exasperation.
&gt;&quot;Nothing special, I&#039;ll be there in 5&quot; he responds before his hologram winks out, leaving you alone in your one room apartment.
&gt;Well, nothing special means you don&#039;t have to grab any extra firepower, but you did notice he didn&#039;t answer who the mark was.
&gt;You do a final pat down to make sure you have all the gear that you would usually carry.
&gt;Your handcannon Rose, a powerful shock knife, extra non lethal shots, electromag cuffs and your Holophone.
&gt;The final touch is your Leather Jacket.
&gt;Satisfied that you have everything, you head outside and frown as you hear your neighbors music blast louder.
&gt;Yea guys, everyone wants to hear your shitty music...
&gt;You step out of the building and under an awning to try stay dry as you wait for Gabriel. 
&gt;The street is a mass of plants and garbage with water constantly flowing through the gutters.
&gt;The rain in the city never stops, so people gave up trying to stop the plants from growing.
&gt;Humans and anthros bustle by, some with umbrellas, some with augments to keep the rain off them and some just getting wet.
&gt;Speeders zoom by ignoring pedestrians for the most part, they hover after all so they don&#039;t kick water up like the vehicles of old.
&gt;You admire a few of the people walking by, looking at their augments.
&gt;How do they choose?
&gt;That guy has eyes that can see through walls to do wiring.
&gt;That ladies hair can connect into multiple computers to download whatever info she needs...
&gt;That lion ha-
&gt;&quot;YO NULL, QUIT DAYDREAMING&quot; comes a loud familiar voice.
&gt;You&#039;re pulled from your thoughts by Gabriel&#039;s yelling and him waving you over to his speeder.
&gt;You shrug at him as you walk to his speeder, popping your jacket collar to protect your neck from the Bone chilling rain.
&gt;His speeders passenger door opens and you climb in, finding a few things on your seat.
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s this?&quot; you ask as you hold up whats obviously a thermos and food container.
&gt;&quot;Leftover Korean barbecue and Black tea, the tea leaves were fresh from Fox&#039;s Garden&quot; he replies as he speeds off into the rain.
&gt;&quot;Nice&quot; 
&gt;Fox always makes the best food and her little garden has all sorts of great stuff.
&gt;As you open the thermos a warm mist steams up, smelling of tea and Honey.
&gt;A Sip warms your insides as your jacket drips cold water into the speeder.
&gt;You take a hearty swig, savoring the ambrosia before snapping back to reality.
&gt;&quot;Where are we going? You didn&#039;t answer me before&quot; you ask before drinking more of the hot tea.
&gt;&quot;We&#039;re heading to Gary&#039;s House of cards, gonna catch this guy&quot; He responds, hitting a few buttons on his phone.
&gt;&quot;That shitty casino under the megaway?&quot; you ask as your phone beeps and a hologram of a horse that looks overly sparkly appears.
&gt;&quot;Yea, That&#039;s the one&quot; Gabriel answers nonchalantly 
&gt;You frown.
&gt;&quot;We&#039;re going after a unicorn wannabe?&quot; you ask incredulously, looking at Gabriel in disbelief &quot;The bounty isn&#039;t even that big&quot;
&gt;&quot;Someone big will owe us a favor&quot; Gabriel responds with a simple shrug.
&gt;Oh...
&gt;In your line of work, someone owing you a favor was something worth its weight in gold.
&gt;You silently nod and down the last of your tea, then stare out the window organizing your thoughts.
&gt;Gary&#039;s house of cards is a shitty casino but that doesn&#039;t mean this wannabe unicorn wont have friends or something with him.
&gt;Best bet is to slip in the back door and...
&gt;You blink hard for a moment and shake your head.
&gt;For a moment the rain had...
&gt;You shake your head again and delve back into your thoughts.
&gt;Go in the back and try to find the implant scanner, see where the mark went and...
&gt;Again you blink hard.
&gt;The rain on the window..looked like you were below the surface of a lake; ripples forming perfect circles above you.
&gt;You literally slap yourself lightly and groan, trying to focus your head.
&gt;What the fuck.
&gt;The ripples take different colors of neon, mixing where they collide and erupting in explosions of color.
&gt;&quot;You Ok Null?&quot; Gabriel asks, amusement in his voice.
&gt;&quot;Y-yea just things are a little odd&quot; you respond then look at him
&gt;Gabriel&#039;s arms have switched and he has a third eye in the center of his forehead; he smiles a MUCH too wide smile with chesher cat like teeth.
&gt;&quot;Ooooooh it&#039;s kicked in already&quot; he says with that far to wide smile
&gt;You blink hard and focus, making some of the colors disappear.
&gt;&quot;WHAT has kicked in?!&quot; you shout, causing Gabriel to laugh.
&gt;&quot;I mighta dosed you, but just a drop&quot; he says with a big laugh.
&gt;You blink for a moment then look at the thermos.
&gt;&quot;You fucking put LSD in my TEA?!&quot; you yell, letting your anger focus things.
&gt;OK this works, stay mad and you can get through this.
&gt;&quot;Yea man you&#039;re always focused on work, relax, enjoy the trip&quot; Gabriel insists, checking his Holophones GPS.
&gt;&quot;We have a JOB to do today!&quot; you retort as the Speeder glove box smiles and winks at you.
&gt;&quot;Relax its a joke of a mark, just chill Null&quot; he says with a smile.
&gt;You groan and close your eyes. 
&gt;Focus.
&gt;Breathe.
&gt;Don&#039;t let it affect you.
&gt;You open your eyes and feel like you&#039;ve entered cartoon land from &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;
&gt;Fuck, you swear you see Jessica rabbit waving to you from the street.
&gt;&quot;We&#039;re here, stay... Well just follow me&quot; Gabriel muses, pulling behind Gary&#039;s house of cards.
&gt;You blink hard and try to will the colors and shapes invading your vision out of existence.
&gt;This of course doesn&#039;t work.
&gt;You groan and pull your handcannon out of its holster and follow your partner.
&gt;Gabriel smiles and gets out of the speeder, and you follow suit; blinding hard to try to keep the colors out of your vision.
&gt;The back door doesn&#039;t stand a chance against Gabriel&#039;s mechanical arm.
&gt;Only one very strong punch from it sends the door flying into some unfortunate guard.
&gt;The staircase is pretty standard for casinos, a implant scanner to identify whoever enters it.
&gt;You have enough wits about you to pull the cables out of the scanner before colors flood back into your vision.
&gt;It can&#039;t scan you, but it can log Gabriel, and bounty hunting is all about not being there.
&gt;&quot;Heyyyyy good job Null&quot; Gabriel cheerfully says as colorful smoke begins rocketing out of his ears.
&gt;As if the rockets weren&#039;t weird enough the total silence makes them even worse.
&gt;Angrily, you silently yell into your hands as Gabriel&#039;s head erupts into fireworks.
&gt;More and more colors spill into your vision and you clench your teeth against them.
&gt;You physically push them aside with your hand only to face up the stairs and begin jogging up them.
&gt;Clear your head, move, push it aside.
&gt;After 5 minutes of jogging you don&#039;t seem any closer to the next floor.
&gt;You begin running up the stairs in a hurry, only to see Gabriel SOMEHOW keeping up with you.
&gt;While not moving his legs...
&gt;His face forms out of the smoke where his head had been and he begins laughing.
&gt;&quot;WHAT!?&quot; you grunt angrily, trying not to focus on one thing for too long.
&gt;Keep shifting your eyes, don&#039;t let the hallucinations get you.
&gt;&quot;If you wanna go up the stairs, you might wanna trying actually going up them, not walking in place on the bottom step dude&quot;
&gt;What.
&gt;You look down and see you are in,fact running in place.
&gt;With a groan of frustration you begin actually going up the stairs, using the handrails to pull yourself up and prevent walking in place.
&gt;&quot;You were just gonna let me keep going huh?&quot; you quip to Gabriel who smiles more.
&gt;&quot;Nah I would have stopped you eventually&quot; 
&gt;Sou sigh and shake your head, partially from annoyance but mainly to try to shoo away the hallucination of tongues coming out of the walls.
&gt;&quot;Take point, I cant like this&quot; you say as you slow down to let him take the lead.
&gt;&quot;Aight, got your gun on non lethal right? not gonna shoot me in the back or anything&quot; he says as he walks past you, eyeing your handcannon.
&gt;You melodramatically spin the cylinder to from lethal to non-lethal.
&gt;&quot;Happy?&quot; 
&gt;He only answers with a smile that grows and grows and has too many teeth.
&gt;You blink hard and his normal face returns.
&gt;The two of you continue up the stairs for a while until Gabriel stops at a door, checks his phone for a moment.
&gt;The door has the words &quot;Dance hall: Rave&quot; on them in bright holographic letters that shimmer and change color.
&gt;Faint music can be heard from beyond it, as the letters being to warp into snakes which slither down the wall to begin to wrap around Gabriel&#039;s legs.
&gt;The fact he doesn&#039;t notice or care which tells you that you&#039;re the only one seeing it.
&gt;&quot;He in there?&quot; you ask as the snakes writhe and coil up his body. 
&gt;He nods, stashes his phone in his jacket and pulls out his own oversized revolver, made to fit his larger mechanical arm and hand.
&gt;Using his normal hand, Gabriel pushes the door open.
&gt;You immediately wish he hadn&#039;t as waves of flashing lights and loud electronic music blast out of the opening.
&gt;The hallucinations you had been somewhat been pushing back Flash to life with a vengeance.
&gt;You grit your teeth and try to push them away as Gabriel just smiles at you.
&gt;&quot;Ready?&quot; he muses, still smiling.
&gt;&quot;Bite me and lead the way&quot; you hiss in response, trying to focus.
&gt;He simply nods and pushes into the room.
&gt;You close your eyes and pinch the bridge of your nose for a moment, knowing that this WILL be a headache later.
&gt;But now is not the time to worry about that.
&gt;Quickly, you follow Gabriel and look around.
&gt;The people and anthros dancing to the &quot;music&quot; aren&#039;t distinguishable at all instead being a mass of neon outlines.
&gt;&quot;Flares&quot; of neon light shoot out from the group and create neon fires where they land.
&gt;Focus, keep your gun up and eyes open, drugs be damned.
&gt;The mark is in here, and probably dangerous.
&gt;You look around and hope to find him but fail to make out anything.
&gt;&quot;There he is&quot; You barely hear Gabriel over the din of the music.
&gt;You step beside him and try to focus on the general direction he&#039;s looking.
&gt;Of course there he is behind the bar, looking like a goddammed disco ball from hell.
&gt;A horse with a horn implant, and looks like most of his skin has been replaced by some reflective something.
&gt;Too much shimmering and color in your opinion but you cant really judge right now.
&gt;&quot;Hurry up and get him, last thing we need is someone to notice us&quot; you quietly yell to Gabriel, loud enough for him to hear you over the music but not loud enough for anyone else to hear.
&gt;&quot;You got this dude&quot; Gabriel answers, pushing you forwards with his flesh hand.
&gt;You look at him and gives him a &quot;what the fuck&quot; look, only for him to smile and twirl his hand cannon on a metal finger.
&gt;Goddamit, you just want this over so you can get home and come down from this trip.
&gt;&quot;Fine&quot; you think to yourself, stashing Rose and drawing your Shock knife &quot;I&#039;ll do it myself&quot;
&gt;You shake out the colors creeping into your mind and block out the dancers who have turned into a giant undulating blob of color and flashing lights.
&gt;The lights from the mark are so bright you find yourself blinking rapidly as you approach.
&gt;The Bar itself seems to grow like a mountain the closer you get to it and you can feel your confidence waiver.
&gt;What the fuck are you doing?
&gt;You feel your feet come to a halt as the bar now cliff looms over you.
&gt;You&#039;re in a casino, tripping on something, completely unaugmented and hunting down a unicorn for &quot;a favor&quot;.
&gt;This is stupid.
&gt;You start to turn away when a voice cuts through your thoughts.
&gt;That gives you enough of something else to focus on.
&gt;&quot;Ohhh it&#039;s that freak I&#039;ve read about, what do you want freak?&quot;
&gt;The Cliff falls away revealing the wanna be unicorn who stands taller than you by over 2 feet.
&gt;A condescending sneer is on that stupid long face of his.
&gt;You frown and stride to the bar, hating his smirk; the one everyone gives you when they don&#039;t give you pity.
&gt;As you step to the bar colors and shapes flow around the horse, everything around you and him blurs.
&gt;but HE doesn&#039;t, from his stupid horn to his dumb hand hoof thing on the bar.
&gt;&quot;What do you want freak? Order something or get out&quot;.
&gt;Freak...that&#039;s you.
&gt;But him? He&#039;s dead.
&gt;You slam your Un-powered shock knife though his hand, into the bar.
&gt;An un-powered shock knife works similar to how your would think; just like a normal knife.
&gt;Before he can scream Gabriel manages to get his metal hand around the horses face, stifling him
&gt;You twist the knife sharply then activate shock, which makes the horse convulse and slump forward onto the bar.
&gt;Sharply you pull you knife out and look around.
&gt;The seething masses of dancers having stopped for a moment.
&gt;Colors once more flood your vision and you feel yourself stumble a bit.
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s get out of here&quot; you groan, grabbing your electromag cuffs and snapping them onto the horses wrist.
&gt;&quot;Yea let&#039;s go, but you just cuffed yourself to the kegarator&quot; Gabriel laughs as he starts dragging the mark towards the door.
&gt;You look down and see that you did indeed cuff yourself.
&gt;Fuck these drugs...
&gt;Quickly (well as quickly as you can manage) you uncuff yourself and follow to help drag the mark downstairs.
&gt;It doesn&#039;t take long with the two of you dragging him non to gently down to the speeder, where you dump him into the trunk as per usual.
&gt;Once the mark is tied up and in Gabriel&#039;s trunk you relax and allow the color to take you.
&gt;Every moment since you realized something was up, you had been somewhat holding it at bay.
&gt;Like a drunk man who can REALLY focus on the sober things.
&gt;As Gabriel&#039;s speeder zooms through the city, you just try to enjoy the colors which invade your mind and vision.
&gt;It&#039;s actually a little pretty now that you don&#039;t have to worry.
&gt;Neon lights blurring and chasing along side the speeder, fighting for your attention.
&gt;You don&#039;t even notice as Gabriel stops in front of your apartment.
&gt;&quot;YO NULL!, you&#039;re home! Don&#039;t go wandering off&quot; he informs you.
&gt;You can barely recall what you said to him, all you remember is the flash of colors as his speeder zoomed away.
&gt;But home!
&gt;You allow the drugs to take you as you stumble up the stairs and enter your apartment.
&gt;God, this place looks like an emperors respite when on drugs.
&gt;Maybe you could just lay down and enjoy this....
&gt;A heavy bass drops and rattles you from your thoughts.
&gt;THOSE CHEEKI BREEKIS.
&gt;You&#039;re only half aware as you storm out of your apartment and pound on your neighbors door.
&gt;The same fuck as always answers with his usual cigarette half hanging out of his mouth and a bottle of vodka in his hand.
&gt;&quot;??? ?? ??????, ?????? ?????&quot; he...somethings, it sounds like he&#039;s talking backwards.
&gt;&quot;Turn down the music&quot; you demand, pointing at the speakers behind him.
&gt;The Russian follows your finger for a moment then laughs in your face.
&gt;&quot;??? ????? ???? ????!&quot; he just about screams in your face before he attempts to slam the door like every time before.
&gt;Except your steel toed boot stops the door.
&gt;Your muscle memory draws Rose from its holster as you kick the door open.
&gt;With practiced movements, you swiftly bash your hand cannons barrel into his nose, then fire 4 shots into his speaker system.
&gt;You look down at the Russian, who is holding his face bloodied nose and point Rose at him.
&gt;He flinches and shrinks down as you mimic pulling the trigger.
&gt;Without another word, you holster Rose and shut the apartments door, then go to your own apartment.
&gt;As you step into it the hallucinations flood back into your vision, once again making your apartment look like it was made for a king.
&gt;It&#039;s actually nice to kick off your gear and relax in the relative quiet of your apartment.
&gt;You flick on your holophone and pull up videos of cats playing with stuff and sink into your chair.
&gt;Maybe you should relax like this more.
&gt;But only if its just a Drop.</textarea>
