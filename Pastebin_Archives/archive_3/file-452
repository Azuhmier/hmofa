Unlikely. But possible.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Observing the open garage you are greeted by several trays of cigarettes and empty beer bottles, some clothing presumably for exercise littered on the floor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What stuck out the most was that the garage was now converted to a gym.

Prologue
&gt;Be you, a teenage shithead.
&gt;Do teenage shithead things, like skateboarding, pranks, and eating yogurt from a tube.
&gt;Earn a reputation as the town asshats with your human buddy Todd
&gt;No one escapes your crudely drawn penises and confetti bombs.
&gt;No one but Ms. Heltzer.
&gt;Not many has seen her, yet none have actually interacted with her outside of a terrifying one second of eye contact.
&gt;Feeling bold one day, you and Todd begin scheming
&gt;You swooce onto her lawn and spray paint a smiling don&#039;t across the front lawn and plant confetti bombs in front of the front door. After chucking a few water balloons at her house to drive the hag outside, trigger the bomb, and leave her with a dong to attend to.
&gt;Todd coined the name &quot;Dong Dong Ditch.&quot;
&gt;It&#039;s late evening and the time has come
&gt;And so have I (and Todd)
&gt;The bomb has been planted and the bright orange penis has been planted, although it didn&#039;t shine as well due to her lawn being patchy and overgrown. 
&gt;She doesn&#039;t go out much.
&gt;Stationed on the sidewalk, you bozos begin throwing balloons from a bucket.
&gt;The bucket eventually empties with no response from the witch. 
&gt;The sun would be setting soon, so you get ready to pack your shit
&gt;Then from the left walkway of the house, a figure is sprinting towards you
&gt;Ohhellnaw.gif
&gt;You turn to face Todd
&gt;He&#039;s booking it down the street like a Kenyan cheetah on cocane running from a white human police officer
&gt;You barely lift your feet off the ground before you&#039;re tackled like a quarterback
&gt;ohshitohshitohshit
&gt;Your arms are being held down, your legs crushed under hers
&gt;You glance left, Todd &quot;the Coward&quot; is gone
&gt;If you make it out alive, you were going to kick his ass.
&gt;Looking back up, you see her face
&gt;Between her shadow and the setting sun, you couldn&#039;t see much details
&gt;She was a canine, looking predatory as fuck (especially compared to poodles, a species of pussies)
&gt;But her face had unusual ridges, complemented by a death glare that seemed to shine despite the low light
&gt;You squirm but she&#039;s stronger than you will ever be
&gt;Screaming won&#039;t help, you&#039;re the town asshat and she&#039;s too scary for even the police
&gt;She learns in closer, and begins to speak in an undeniably feminine but rough, somewhat masculine voice
&gt;&quot;You and your bitch of a friend will come back here tomorrow morning and clean this mess. If you don&#039;t, you will regret it.&quot;
&gt;She relieves her weight on you, and you book it down the street like a rhino on heroin running from a white human police officer. 
&gt;Heltzer is fucking terrifying, and she has her sights on you and Todd
&gt;You&#039;re gonna kick his ass

Chapter 1: Rub the Penis
&gt;Mischief is how you were spending your teenage years.
&gt;You and Todd aren&#039;t in jail yet, so why stop? 
&gt;Heltzer, for one
&gt;You had to see her today with Todd
&gt;After literally kicking your bitch of a friend&#039;s ass for ditching you like that, you explain the situation.
&gt;&quot;No Todd, we can&#039;t jump off the bridge for a &#039;quick death.&#039;&quot;
&gt;Slowly biking your way to the South side of town, you notice how the roads and sidewalks get more cracked, illuminated by the morning light.
&gt;You&#039;re forced to have Todd in tow on the back due to his bike shattering after a half assed BMX attempt.
&gt;A few twists and turns later you arrive at Heltzer&#039;s, a slightly run down small house that showed some evidence of repairs by the awkwardly place boards on next to the porch.
&gt;Your penis, rather the painted one, was proudly displayed across the lawn. 
&gt;Both of you would have laughed in pride, but Heltzer was on the porch.
&gt;Doing... pushups?
&gt;Trying to ignore the fact that Tod was shivering and you wanting to cry, you ring your bike bell.
&gt;Shit, now she&#039;s walking towards you.
&gt;Todd is now a Hitachi Magic Wand.
&gt;She&#039;s a Doberman, a mean looking one.
&gt;A noticable scar seems to run from her left cheek down behind her left shoulder on her neck, back up the shoulder and crossing her right breast diagonally. 
&gt;Another &quot;X&quot; shaped scar on the left side of her abdomen, with some more horizontal cuts along her legs.
&gt;As she got closer, you realize that she&#039;s ripped. She probably has a bigger dick than you.
&gt;All this was barely hidden, as she wore a black sports bra and panties
&gt;She looks down on the both of you next to your bike.
&gt;Your head is a little lower than her chest hieght while sitting on the bike. 
&gt;You would have considered this to be a lucky situation if a mangled, angry, Heltzer wasn&#039;t looking down on you.
&gt;That same voice from last night churns again.
&gt;&quot;You two dipshits are going to scrub my lawn clean. There&#039;s soap and water on the porch, a hose in the garage and a pump on the right side. get off your asses and move.&quot;
&gt;Wait. We&#039;re gonna scrub a lawn?
&gt;The backseat pussy was now seismic. 
&gt;It was bad enough that she could probably smell fear, now she&#039;s seeing it personified as two clowns on a bike.
&gt;For your own hide, you march your way to your tools.
&gt;Up the steps you notice a pair of buckets filled with soapy water and sponges.
&gt;Picking up a set, you turn to hand a set to your friend, only to notice that he&#039;s not there.
&gt;He&#039;s still on the fucking bike, Heltzer chewing him out for being a wimp. 
&gt;Then the absolute madman does the unthinkable.
&gt;He shoves her, hops in the front seat, and peddles away.
&gt;Heltzer gruffly barks and gives chase.
&gt;Damn, this bitch can run.
&gt;She&#039;s on the bikes tail, most likely yelling at how she&#039;ll kill Todd.
&gt;You hear him screech like the baby he is, even from down the street.
&gt;Ms.Heltzer can run, but the coward can peddle faster.
&gt;By the sheer force of pussy power alone, he breaks free.
&gt;The beast begins jog back, and you curse yourself realizing you could have escaped during his fit of fear.
&gt;Might as well begin the job, alone.
&gt;Cursing Todd and yourself, you begin rubbing the penis starting from the head.
&gt;The penis on the lawn, of course.

Chapter 2: Shitty Day, Shitty Lawn
&gt;This lawn looked like shit.
&gt;At least the dick looked less noticeable. 
&gt;If you squint, you would be able to see the faint orange nutsack. Look harder and you would see what were once proud pubes, now fading away due to a determined hose and soap.
&gt;But to a normal eye, the drowned greenery, mud and upturned dirt became more of an eyesore than the dilapidated house it belonged to.
&gt;Hopefully some rain will finish your job.
&gt;You now had to check in with that freak show. If you didn&#039;t, she threatened you with a vague but horrifying punishment.
&gt;There are things that you just don&#039;t fuck with, Heltzer was now one of them.
&gt;She was in the open garage, with only the sound of heavy, rapid breathing exiting from that den.
&gt;Is she giving birth to more hellspawn? Unlikely. But possible.
&gt;Observing the open garage you are greeted by several trays of cigarettes and empty beer bottles, some clothing presumably for exercise littered on the floor.
&gt;What stuck out the most was that the garage was now converted to a gym. A smelly one.
&gt;You could smell musk, blood, and tears. All from her.
&gt;In the center she was going to town on a big. Thick. Black. Punching bag.
&gt;Those things were made to be abused, but even the sack of sand wanted a break from the onslaught.
&gt;Hopefully it was sand, and not a sack of babies or something.
&gt;&quot;H-Hey Scarface, I finished your lawn. It still looks like shit though. Y&#039;know, like in the first place.&quot;
&gt;That was kinda cold, but she doesn&#039;t own you.
&gt;She calms her arms and hugs the bag to a standstill.
&gt;Grabbing a nearby water bottle from a the table filled with beer and cigarettes, she poured it on her head,
&gt;This would have been hot if it weren&#039;t for those cuts. 
&gt;But those teenage hormones are persistent.
&gt;She bumps you aside and steps outside to admire your handiwork.
&gt;Her voice was a lot less feral, but still gruff
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re right. This lawn does look like shit. Come back tomorrow morning.&quot;
&gt;Bitch what. No way you&#039;re wasting this summer bending your back over some diseased hag.
&gt;You protest, but she rejects your pleas.
&gt;You know what? Fuck her.
&gt;You throw a punch at her face.
&gt;?
&gt;She didn&#039;t even really flinch. She took it like a tank.
&gt;She chuckled.
&gt;&quot;Wow. That sucked.&quot;
&gt;Your blood turns cold as your ego drops like a rock.
&gt;&quot;Hit me again! I love it!&quot;
&gt;She doesn&#039;t falter at your blows. She laughed a few times.
&gt;&quot;Alright my turn...&quot;
&gt;Aw fuck.
&gt;You pull a 180 turn to run, but she grabs you.
&gt;Holtzer has you in a headlock.
&gt;It&#039;s hard to breathe, but you still can can grasp  for air.
&gt;She then whispers in your ear, her voice a bit more graceful and feminine, but keeping that trademark gruffness.
&gt;&quot;Today you will go home, take a shower, eat your fucking dinner, go to bed, and just pray that you have enough energy for what we have in store for tomorrow.&quot;
&gt;&quot;And you fucking better not be staying up all night jacking off all night &#039;cuz can smell everything.&quot;
&gt;You are relieved of the hold and you bolt off like a giraffe on meth running away from a white human police officer.</textarea>
