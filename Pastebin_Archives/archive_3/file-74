Thunderstorms in particular.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As a result, she had been having quite the tough time lately.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;During the past couple days, every time a clap of thunder would ring out, you would see Sarah jump a bit, followed by some quiet whimpering and seeking the nearest blanket to cover herself with.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It would be pretty sad if it wasn&#039;t so cute.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Poor Sarah.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Currently, you were just laying in bed, letting the sound of rain lull you to sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just as you&#039;re about to drift off though, you hear a noise out in the hallway.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The sound of claws softly clacking against the wood floor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You slowly flip over, facing the door just as it creaks open.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sure enough, illuminated by the light from her phone, stands Sarah in your doorway.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;A-Anon?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There&#039;s another sudden flash of lightning, and a roll of thunder that seems to shake the floor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can her a loud yip from Sarah, who very nearly drops her phone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You softly speak to her, acknowledging her presence.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She whines loudly, shuffling inside your room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m sorry to bother you... I know you&#039;re trying to sleep.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;But... Um...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her ears flop down, and she frowns.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;C-Can I share the bed with you? Just for tonight!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Another clap of thunder, and this time she -does- drop her phone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With the light out, you can&#039;t see her anymore.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shush her whines, pulling the blanket back for her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah crawls into bed, pressing against you and pulling the covers over her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was only a Twin sized bed, so she had to get real close to keep herself from falling off the edge of the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was warm, her soft fur pressing against your bare chest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Another crack of thunder and lightning, and she quickly wraps her arms around you, her legs curling up close between the two of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Without a word, she buries her muzzle into your shoulder, and you can hear her take a couple quick sniffs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She seems to relax almost immediately, her grip on you loosening.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pat the top of her head, earning yourself a satisfied huff.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you just lay there, listening to the sound of rain and the occasional crack of thunder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She of course shivers each time it happens, gripping you tighter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lucky for you, you know the perfect method to calm her down. Sixty percent of the time, it works every time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You free one of your arms from her grip, eliciting an annoyed grumble as she tries to wrangle it back into her floof.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stops in her tracks though as soon as your fingers make contact with her head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You start to softly stroke the fluff on the top of her head, and she practically melts into you, going completely limp.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Within minutes, you&#039;re pretty certain she&#039;s fast asleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s snoozing softly, her head nestled into your neck under the blankets.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Good girl.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her fur tickles against your skin, but it&#039;s something you&#039;ve become used to by now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In any case, it feels good to have Sarah by your side.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Patting the Collie one last time, you stop and get ready to fall asleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah clearly has objections to that plan though, as the second you stop petting her, she begins to whine in her sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not wanting to disappoint, you keep on petting her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re not sure how long you run your hands over her soft fluffy head, but you end up falling asleep as you do it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You crack your eyes open, deeply exhaling through your nose.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yawning, you try to sit up, only to be stopped by a mysterious weight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At first, you&#039;re confused, until you look directly to your left.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah was still laying here, having your torso in a deathgrip as her muzzle was buried into your shoulder, blowing warm air onto your neck with every breath.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had almost forgotten about last night...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh boy, here comes the fun part. Trying to stand up without waking her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Alright. Baby steps first.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to scooch over to the right side of the bed, only to be met by the first problem.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The second you jostle her even a little, she lets out a cute little whine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yeah, this is gonna be a problem...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re gonna have to just take it slow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Around 20 minutes later, you&#039;ve achieved an almost impossible task.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You managed to get up out of bed, and exit the bedroom without waking Sarah.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It took some advanced maneuvering, but you left her alone in bed with a large pillow in her grip instead of your body.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Being your pillow, it smelled like your head too, to which her nose would know none the wiser.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now that you were free, you looked around the apartment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was dark, with the rain still going.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If you remember the forecast, most of the storm should have passed on by now, leaving only some scattered showers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can&#039;t hear any thunder, so you suppose it must have been correct.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a quick bathroom break, you walk into the kitchen for a glass of water, looking at the clock on the microwave.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was still early, only 7 AM.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Usually Sarah would be up for a run by now, but it didn&#039;t seem like that was gonna happen with the rain going on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She had always been firmly against getting her fur wet, especially for no good reason.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Filling a glass, you look over at the cupboards and fridge. An idea flashes through your mind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hey. Sarah hasn&#039;t been feeling too great because of the weather the past few days. Why not treat her?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your mind made up, you set the now empty glass next to the sink.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were gonna make her some blueberry pancakes (her favorite), and there wasn&#039;t a damn thing  in the world that could stop you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before Sarah wakes up and ruins the surprise, you&#039;re quick to take out all the ingredients you need.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And since you weren&#039;t very good at cooking, the ingredients consist of just bisquick, milk, and eggs. You couldn&#039;t forget the blueberries, either. She had picked them up for you from the store, since she knew you liked them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You slap most of the ingredients into a bowl, and mix them up good. You add the blueberries, and then get prepared to cook up a nice amount of pancakes. Sarah may not look like it, but boy could she get an appetite sometimes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Taking a moment to grease up a pan, you get some batter in a pan and start cooking the sweet discs up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;20 minutes later, you have a good amount of pancakes cooked.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sure, some of them may be a little dark around the edges, but you&#039;ll eat those ones.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As if right on cue, you hear your door click open.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking into the hallway, you can see a tired Collie peeking through the crack.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her nose twitches, sniffing the air.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She perks up as soon as the scent of blueberry pancakes hits her nose, the door flying open as she rushes over to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She had a huge smile on her face, her nose sniffing at the air madly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon! You made pancakes!?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stops in the kitchen, admiring the stack you had sitting on a plate.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;With blueberries, too... My favorite...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks to you with a teary eyed grin, before pouncing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re wrapped in a tight hug, the Collie gal rubbing her muzzle against your neck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You&#039;re the best, Anon...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Smiling, you tell her to take a seat. You&#039;d fix her up a nice plate.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not wasting any time, she quickly plops herself down at the table, her tail wagging the whole time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Putting a plate in front of her, she begins to butter the pancakes, not wanting to put any jam or syrup on them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As much as it must pain her, she waits to eat until you&#039;re sitting with her at the table, a plate of your own in front of her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You put some butter on your pancakes as well, and then both of you dig in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After all, pancakes always tasted better when you had them with a friend.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sarah turned to look at you, swallowing a mouthful of pancake.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hey, Anon...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gave you a shy smile, her ears swiveling back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Do you, uh, think we could go back to bed after this? I&#039;m, um, still a little tired.

&gt;Be Anon
&gt;You were 27 years old, standing at a height of 5&#039;11&quot;.
&gt;It was Saturday night, during late Summer.
&gt;The weather had been cooler lately, with several large thunderstorms rolling through the state as of lately.
&gt;Right now, for example.
&gt;Currently, you were laying in your twin bed, staring at the window.
&gt;Through the blinds, you could see (and hear) fat drops of rain beating against the windowpanes.
&gt;Every minute or so, the room would be lit up for a split second by lightning, which would be quickly followed by the deep rumble of thunder.
&gt;You thought it was relaxing, as you&#039;ve always liked storms.
&gt;Unfortunately, your roommate in no way shared your feelings for the current weather.
&gt;Your roommate, an Anthro Border Collie gal named Sarah, has always been kinda skittish around storms. Thunderstorms in particular.
&gt;As a result, she had been having quite the tough time lately.
&gt;During the past couple days, every time a clap of thunder would ring out, you would see Sarah jump a bit, followed by some quiet whimpering and seeking the nearest blanket to cover herself with.
&gt;It would be pretty sad if it wasn&#039;t so cute.
&gt;Poor Sarah.

&gt;Currently, you were just laying in bed, letting the sound of rain lull you to sleep.
&gt;Just as you&#039;re about to drift off though, you hear a noise out in the hallway.
&gt;The sound of claws softly clacking against the wood floor.
&gt;You slowly flip over, facing the door just as it creaks open.
&gt;Sure enough, illuminated by the light from her phone, stands Sarah in your doorway.
&gt;&quot;A-Anon?&quot;
&gt;There&#039;s another sudden flash of lightning, and a roll of thunder that seems to shake the floor.
&gt;You can her a loud yip from Sarah, who very nearly drops her phone.
&gt;You softly speak to her, acknowledging her presence.
&gt;She whines loudly, shuffling inside your room.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m sorry to bother you... I know you&#039;re trying to sleep.&quot;
&gt;&quot;But... Um...&quot;
&gt;Her ears flop down, and she frowns.
&gt;&quot;C-Can I share the bed with you? Just for tonight!&quot;
&gt;Another clap of thunder, and this time she -does- drop her phone.
&gt;With the light out, you can&#039;t see her anymore.
&gt;You shush her whines, pulling the blanket back for her.
&gt;Sarah crawls into bed, pressing against you and pulling the covers over her.
&gt;It was only a Twin sized bed, so she had to get real close to keep herself from falling off the edge of the bed.
&gt;She was warm, her soft fur pressing against your bare chest.
&gt;Another crack of thunder and lightning, and she quickly wraps her arms around you, her legs curling up close between the two of you.
&gt;Without a word, she buries her muzzle into your shoulder, and you can hear her take a couple quick sniffs.
&gt;She seems to relax almost immediately, her grip on you loosening.
&gt;You pat the top of her head, earning yourself a satisfied huff.

&gt;The two of you just lay there, listening to the sound of rain and the occasional crack of thunder.
&gt;She of course shivers each time it happens, gripping you tighter.
&gt;Lucky for you, you know the perfect method to calm her down. Sixty percent of the time, it works every time.
&gt;You free one of your arms from her grip, eliciting an annoyed grumble as she tries to wrangle it back into her floof.
&gt;She stops in her tracks though as soon as your fingers make contact with her head.
&gt;You start to softly stroke the fluff on the top of her head, and she practically melts into you, going completely limp.
&gt;Within minutes, you&#039;re pretty certain she&#039;s fast asleep.
&gt;She&#039;s snoozing softly, her head nestled into your neck under the blankets.
&gt;Good girl.
&gt;Her fur tickles against your skin, but it&#039;s something you&#039;ve become used to by now.
&gt;In any case, it feels good to have Sarah by your side.
&gt;Patting the Collie one last time, you stop and get ready to fall asleep.
&gt;Sarah clearly has objections to that plan though, as the second you stop petting her, she begins to whine in her sleep.
&gt;Not wanting to disappoint, you keep on petting her.
&gt;You&#039;re not sure how long you run your hands over her soft fluffy head, but you end up falling asleep as you do it.

&gt;You crack your eyes open, deeply exhaling through your nose.
&gt;Yawning, you try to sit up, only to be stopped by a mysterious weight.
&gt;At first, you&#039;re confused, until you look directly to your left.
&gt;Sarah was still laying here, having your torso in a deathgrip as her muzzle was buried into your shoulder, blowing warm air onto your neck with every breath.
&gt;You had almost forgotten about last night...
&gt;Oh boy, here comes the fun part. Trying to stand up without waking her.
&gt;Alright. Baby steps first.
&gt;You try to scooch over to the right side of the bed, only to be met by the first problem.
&gt;The second you jostle her even a little, she lets out a cute little whine.
&gt;Yeah, this is gonna be a problem...
&gt;You&#039;re gonna have to just take it slow.

&gt;Around 20 minutes later, you&#039;ve achieved an almost impossible task.
&gt;You managed to get up out of bed, and exit the bedroom without waking Sarah.
&gt;It took some advanced maneuvering, but you left her alone in bed with a large pillow in her grip instead of your body.
&gt;Being your pillow, it smelled like your head too, to which her nose would know none the wiser.
&gt;Now that you were free, you looked around the apartment.
&gt;It was dark, with the rain still going.
&gt;If you remember the forecast, most of the storm should have passed on by now, leaving only some scattered showers.
&gt;You can&#039;t hear any thunder, so you suppose it must have been correct.
&gt;After a quick bathroom break, you walk into the kitchen for a glass of water, looking at the clock on the microwave.
&gt;It was still early, only 7 AM.
&gt;Usually Sarah would be up for a run by now, but it didn&#039;t seem like that was gonna happen with the rain going on.
&gt;She had always been firmly against getting her fur wet, especially for no good reason.
&gt;Filling a glass, you look over at the cupboards and fridge. An idea flashes through your mind.
&gt;Hey. Sarah hasn&#039;t been feeling too great because of the weather the past few days. Why not treat her?
&gt;Your mind made up, you set the now empty glass next to the sink.
&gt;You were gonna make her some blueberry pancakes (her favorite), and there wasn&#039;t a damn thing  in the world that could stop you.
&gt;Before Sarah wakes up and ruins the surprise, you&#039;re quick to take out all the ingredients you need.
&gt;And since you weren&#039;t very good at cooking, the ingredients consist of just bisquick, milk, and eggs. You couldn&#039;t forget the blueberries, either. She had picked them up for you from the store, since she knew you liked them.
&gt;You slap most of the ingredients into a bowl, and mix them up good. You add the blueberries, and then get prepared to cook up a nice amount of pancakes. Sarah may not look like it, but boy could she get an appetite sometimes.
&gt;Taking a moment to grease up a pan, you get some batter in a pan and start cooking the sweet discs up.

&gt;20 minutes later, you have a good amount of pancakes cooked.
&gt;Sure, some of them may be a little dark around the edges, but you&#039;ll eat those ones.
&gt;As if right on cue, you hear your door click open.
&gt;Looking into the hallway, you can see a tired Collie peeking through the crack.
&gt;Her nose twitches, sniffing the air.
&gt;She perks up as soon as the scent of blueberry pancakes hits her nose, the door flying open as she rushes over to you.
&gt;She had a huge smile on her face, her nose sniffing at the air madly.
&gt;&quot;Anon! You made pancakes!?&quot;
&gt;She stops in the kitchen, admiring the stack you had sitting on a plate.
&gt;&quot;With blueberries, too... My favorite...&quot;
&gt;She looks to you with a teary eyed grin, before pouncing.
&gt;You&#039;re wrapped in a tight hug, the Collie gal rubbing her muzzle against your neck.
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re the best, Anon...&quot;
&gt;Smiling, you tell her to take a seat. You&#039;d fix her up a nice plate.
&gt;Not wasting any time, she quickly plops herself down at the table, her tail wagging the whole time.
&gt;Putting a plate in front of her, she begins to butter the pancakes, not wanting to put any jam or syrup on them.
&gt;As much as it must pain her, she waits to eat until you&#039;re sitting with her at the table, a plate of your own in front of her.
&gt;You put some butter on your pancakes as well, and then both of you dig in.
&gt;After all, pancakes always tasted better when you had them with a friend.
&gt;Sarah turned to look at you, swallowing a mouthful of pancake.
&gt;&quot;Hey, Anon...&quot;
&gt;She gave you a shy smile, her ears swiveling back.
&gt;&quot;Do you, uh, think we could go back to bed after this? I&#039;m, um, still a little tired. O-Or we could just hang out on the couch!&quot;
&gt;You chuckle, making the Collie whine and hide her face.
&gt;Of course you would cuddle with her some more.
&gt;Just as soon as you finish these pancakes, of course.
