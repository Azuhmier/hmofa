&gt;anon had his heartbroken by his hummie girlfriend
&gt;his anthro childhood friend, Sarah, invites him over to talk about it
&gt;at her apartment he lets everything out
&gt;the lying, the manipulation, the cheating
&gt;and how she had an excuse to blame him for all of her behavior
&gt;he was going to propose
&gt;how could he be so stupid?
&gt;the wolf girls white fur absorbed his tears
&gt;she always knew human males were sensitive and needed protection
&gt;she decided to go and get them some take-out so they could stay in and talk some more
&gt;he thanked her as she promised to be right back
&gt;unbeknownst to both of them her sister and roommate had been waiting for such a moment
&gt;she came into the living room
&gt;&quot;heard about the break up, so you&#039;re unattached now huh?&quot; 
&gt;anon was uneasy, Rebecca, the black furred wolf always seemed indifferent to him in the past
&gt;now she was leering down at him with her yellow eyes from the end of the couch
&gt;she crawled over the armrest and shoved him on his back
&gt;&quot;I assumed Sarah would take you in time.&quot;
&gt;she put one strong paw on his shoulder and pulled at his shirt
&gt;&quot;but she&#039;s too romantic. I&#039;m going to have to claim you like she should have years ago.&quot;
&gt;&quot;no no no&quot; anon whispered softly as his shirt was ripped away
&gt;beginning at his naval she took a long lick up his body covering his face with her tongue
&gt;&quot;you taste better than I thought you would&quot;
&gt;a claw stroked his tear soaked cheek 
&gt;he couldn&#039;t handle anymore and tried to roll out from under her
&gt;weirdly, she let him up, but as he went for the door her foot reached out to trip him
&gt;she practically pounced on the human
&gt;&quot;such easy prey, you can&#039;t even run five steps&quot; 
&gt;with a knee in his back and a paw holding his head down she started to rip off his pants
&gt;&quot;please don&#039;t&quot; he pleaded, his voice surprisingly hoarse from the crying earlier
&gt;she rolled him over and his erection flopped into view
&gt;&quot;see I knew you wanted this. that&#039;s what every hummie wants, right?&quot;
&gt;he shook his head
&gt;&quot;yeah, you want to be taken by an alpha bitch like me&quot;
&gt;&quot;you don&#039;t want to wait around for anthros like my sister to make a move.&quot;
&gt;she stood up, her one foot on his chest enough to hold him down
&gt;anon struggled but all he succeeded in doing was lightly scratching himself with her claws
&gt;she pulled her sundress over her head and threw it aside
&gt;her delicate panties were literally ripped away in a gratuitous display of strength
&gt;her pussy was dripping and as hungry as the look on her face
&gt;she practically fell onto anons dick
&gt;the pain from her full weight pressing him down made him remember his voice
&gt;he tried to yell for help but a powerful paw covered his mouth
&gt;&quot;shut up and fuck me&quot; she commanded as she roughly slammed herself into him over and over
&gt;he couldn&#039;t breath and weakly struggled to move her arm away
&gt;instead she grabbed one of his arms and twisted it above his head
&gt;she was so strong, his wrist was bruising, and his face hurt from her grip
&gt;he could do nothing but lay there and cry as she did whatever she wanted
&gt;soon she clamped down on him like a vice and shuddered
&gt;a low howl came out of her as she orgasmed
&gt;she looked down &quot;you didn&#039;t come&quot; she said accusingly
&gt;&quot;we&#039;re not done here til you mark me, so get with the program&quot;
&gt;anon closed his eyes, unsure of how much more he could endure
&gt;they both looked up as the front door unlocked
&gt;Sarah walked in with some plastic bags of food
&gt;it took her a moment to process the scene on the floor
&gt;she dropped the take-out and rushed the pair growling at her sister
&gt;anon felt some relief as his rapist stood to confront her
&gt;&quot;calm down&quot; Rebecca said casually &quot;he didn&#039;t mark me yet&quot;
&gt;&quot;YET?&quot; yelled Sarah in outrage
&gt;Sarah rarely won scraps with her sister when they were pups
&gt;but Sarah had never been this mad before
&gt;still her sister dodged her wild swipes as she talked
&gt;&quot;yeah. yet. so he can mark you first if you want&quot;
&gt;&quot;what&quot; Sarah said throwing her ears back in shock at the suggestion
&gt;&quot;how many more dumb relationships are you going to let him have before you take him?&quot; Rebecca asked
&gt;Anon&#039;s thrill at seeing his friend began to wane as she looked down at him
&gt;he had seen that look from other anthros before, but never Sarah
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t know why, but you care about this one&quot;
&gt;&quot;you can protect him from himself if you mark him&quot; 
&gt;Rebecca&#039;s words were like honey in Sarah&#039;s ear. 
&gt;&quot;I couldn&#039;t...&quot; Sarah said her anger suddenly disarmed by her secret desire heard out loud
&gt;&quot;You can take him and we can share. You know, whenever I need to relieve my heat&quot;
&gt;anon had sat up as the two wolves talked over him
&gt;Sarah leaned down to comfort him
&gt;Anon reflexively pulled away from her touch
&gt;he felt vulnerable in his nakedness and pain
&gt;&quot;I need to leave&quot; was all he could think to say, unable to hold his tears back
&gt;&quot;No&quot; Sarah said stroking his head and gently shushing him
&gt;she stood up, bringing him to a standing position with her
&gt;she pulled him into a hug, though he recoiled from it at first before surrendering
&gt;&quot;you don&#039;t need to leave&quot; she said softly to calm him
&gt;&quot;you&#039;re right where you need to be&quot;
&gt;Rebecca had already opened up the take-out to dig in
&gt;she watched as her sister pulled the human down the hall to her bedroom
&gt;he seemed to know what was coming and was now trying to pull away from her
&gt;anon&#039;s weak protests were punctuated by new sobs
&gt;the last thing she heard before the door closing was her sister telling him
&gt;&quot;this is for your own good&quot;

-----

&gt;Sarah closed the door behind her
&gt;Anon sat on the bed rubbing his sore wrist
&gt;his friend loomed over him as he feared the worst
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not going to take you against your will&quot; she said softly
&gt;Anon let out a sob of relief
&gt;&quot;I just had to get you away from Rebecca.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t think I can fight her off&quot;
&gt;&quot;But she won&#039;t take you if she thinks I will.&quot;
&gt;he had no response for her
&gt;&quot;Can I... Is it alright if I sit next to you?&quot;
&gt;Anon nodded wordlessly
&gt;Sarah rubbed his back and tried to comfort him
&gt;&quot;Why?&quot; was all Anon could ask after a while
&gt;&quot;I think it&#039;s my fault&quot; Sarah said
&gt;&quot;I told her how I&#039;ve wanted us to be more than friends&quot;
&gt;&quot;She insisted I just.. Well she wanted me to be more forward&quot;
&gt;&quot;She thought she was helping I guess&quot;
&gt;Anon held up his bruised wrist
&gt;&quot;Does this look like help?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I thought she was going to kill me...&quot;
&gt;Sarah was aghast &quot;Rebecca would never do that...&quot;
&gt;&quot;taking a mate is just different for us than humans...&quot;
&gt;&quot;she doesn&#039;t understand humans like I do&quot;
&gt;Anon shook his head &quot;I just want to go home&quot;
&gt;&quot;you can&#039;t&quot; Sarah sighed
&gt;&quot;If you try to leave without a mark on you, shes going to start again&quot;
&gt;Anon finally raised his voice &quot;then call the police so I can leave&quot;
&gt;Sarah tried rubbing his head to calm him down but he pulled away
&gt;&quot;Anthro police won&#039;t do much about a domestic dispute&quot;
&gt;&quot;You came here voluntarily and you are unmarked... it&#039;s... it&#039;s complicated&quot;
&gt;Anon finally looked at her &quot;So we just wait here and then pretend nothing happened?&quot;
&gt;Sarah shrugged &quot;I can&#039;t stop you doing anything once you leave&quot;
&gt;&quot;But you probably can&#039;t come back, once shes got her mind set to something, well you know&quot;
&gt;Anon looked at her disgusted
&gt;&quot;So we cant be friends now because your sister is a predator?&quot;
&gt;He hung his head &quot;first my girlfriend, now I&#039;m loosing my best friend?&quot;
&gt;Sarah couldn&#039;t help herself, she had to leap at the chance
&gt;&quot;You could... trade one for the other...&quot; she said meekly
&gt;Anon just stared at her
&gt;&quot;You can&#039;t be suggesting that I just become your boyfriend?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Like she wanted. Like you wanted this whole time!?&quot;
&gt;Sarah stood up and anon scrambled away from her
&gt;&quot;I really like you, no, I love you&quot; she said
&gt;Anon stopped backing away
&gt;&quot;You can&#039;t be serious, we&#039;re just friends&quot;
&gt;Sarah uncharacteristically asserted herself
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t want to just be friends&quot;
&gt;&quot;and after tonight we&#039;re either not friends anymore or we&#039;re something else&quot;
&gt;&quot;I hate that my sister forced this. But that&#039;s all we&#039;re left with&quot;
&gt;Anon felt like he was at an emotional breaking point for the third time that night
&gt;&quot;Can we just lie down?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I just need quiet and time to think&quot;
&gt;Sarah&#039;s tail fluttered &quot;Yeah sure, lets just lay down here&quot;
&gt;She wrapped Anon up in her arms and pulled him to her
&gt;Sarah must have been very contented to have Anon so close
&gt;because soon she was asleep
&gt;Anon carefully lifted her arm
&gt;he approached the door as quietly as possible
&gt;his heart was pounding in his ears but he heard nothing outside
&gt;he just had to get to the living room to grab his clothes and phone
&gt;then out the front door and down the hall to the stairwell
&gt;get dressed, call a cab, just run
&gt;he played his plan in his head over and over
&gt;he hesitantly opened the door
&gt;across the hall stood Rebecca in the door frame of her room
&gt;&quot;Going somewhere?&quot; she said sniffing the air heavily
&gt;&quot;Not like that you aren&#039;t...&quot;
&gt;she smiled wickedly &quot;I&#039;ll give you a sporting chance...&quot;
&gt;&quot;If you can make it to the front door before I get my claws on you, then you&#039;re free to go&quot;
&gt;Anon looked at her gold eyes, his vision already blurring from fear induced tears
&gt;he broke away from her stare and began to close the door
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s what I fucking thought&quot; Rebecca said with derisive laugh
&gt;the sound of the door shutting caused Sarah to stir
&gt;Anon went to her side and gently woke her
&gt;&quot;Anon?&quot; she asked sleepily &quot;Oh, how long did I sleep for?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Just a few minutes&quot; he said
&gt;&quot;I thought about it and I want to give this a try&quot;
&gt;Sarah suddenly woke up at that
&gt;&quot;You mean, give &#039;us&#039; a try?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes&quot; said Anon seeing no other way out of his situation
&gt;Sarah jumped up to him and held him tight, her tail wagging wildly
&gt;&quot;I know this isn&#039;t how either of us wanted this to happen...&quot;
&gt;&quot;So I won&#039;t say I&#039;m glad, I just hope you can forgive me...&quot;
&gt;&quot;And I&#039;ll do everything I can to make it up to you&quot;
&gt;Sarah removed her clothes and invited Anon to the bed
&gt;Anon, despite himself, couldn&#039;t help but feel attracted to his friend
&gt;as conflicted as he was currently, he had always seen her as beautiful
&gt;such that her lack of boyfriends never made sense to him, until tonight
&gt;Sarah licked at his face and gently embraced him
&gt;she smelled so good and her fur was so soft
&gt;his body had the natural response
&gt;she laid onto her back
&gt;as much as she wanted to mount him she held back
&gt;she knew he was in far too delicate a state to overwhelm him like that
&gt;Anon climbed onto her and entered her
&gt;he was getting flashbacks to earlier as he tried to please her
&gt;the smell and feel of wolf fur, the sound of her panting, her pads on his arms
&gt;it was all too much and he collapsed on her
&gt;Sarah was too excited to let him stop
&gt;her normally empathetic self was giving into lust and her long unfulfilled desire for Anon
&gt;she rolled over him and started gyrating her hips
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry Anon, I&#039;ll take care of you&quot; she said
&gt;&quot;here&quot; she said taking his hands into hers and placing them on her tits
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not her, I love you Anon. I want you to love me too&quot;
&gt;she leaned down and licked his face
&gt;her voice was helping Anon come back to the moment
&gt;he moved his hand to her hips and began to participate
&gt;that was more than enough to get Sarah panting
&gt;&quot;Please, Anon, please mark me, for us...&quot;
&gt;her sweet voice was enough for Anon to let go
&gt;as he filled Sarah up she came as well
&gt;that warmth spread through her and filled her lungs with a howl
&gt;she wrapped her legs around him as she rolled to her side
&gt;she milked Anon for every last drop and licked his face happily
&gt;Anon, exhausted as he was, fell asleep immediately
&gt;Sarah couldn&#039;t help but be pleased as she twirled his hair and stared at his sleeping face.</textarea>
