        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Growing up in Louisiana, you&#039;d never put much thought into some of the more trivial things. 

&gt;What your own little slice of Heaven was a small pit of Hell for her. She can&#039;t look you in the eyes and you know she won&#039;t say a word.

&gt;The sound of rain pitter-pattering on the bedroom window would normally lull you into sleep&#039;s comforting embrace, but tonight is a little different.

There 
        was 
             a
                 flash 
                         of

&gt;You read somewhere that light travels at a speed of over six hundred million miles per hour. In that instant of bright flash through 
 the bedroom window, your mind takes a crystal clear snapshot of the room.
   &gt;The Best Buddies certificate and PhD. that both hang proudly side by side on the whitewashed wall
      &gt;The small revolver on the bedside table.
         &gt;The metal crutches that lean next to the window sill.
            &gt;The dusty-gray love of your life that clings to you like a lost child.
&gt;Her fur feels just as soft as it looks. The hair on the top of her head is a chestnut brown
&gt;As your try to keep her from yipping, your hands glide over her form taking in all the little details that you know so well
&gt;Her thin shoulders, the floof on her sternum, the small mounds on her chest, and her trim waistline.

&gt;Cassie&#039;s tremors refuse to stop as the thunderstorm continues to barge through the night. You know that tonight will most likely be a 
 sleepless one.
&gt; You just wish that you could gaze into those mesmerizing blue eyes of hers.
&gt; As many times as you&#039;ve begged her to move away from here she adamantly refuses to leave.
&gt;&quot;I-I-I grew up here, silly! Why w-would I wanna...move...m-move away? This is my home.&quot;
&gt;Her tail is curled between both of y&#039;all&#039;s legs, and she continues to hug you as close as possible.
&gt;The fluffy fur on the top of her head tickles your mouth as she keeps her head tucked under your chin.
&gt;Home should not be a place where you are kept up three nights a week.

&gt;For some reason, a warm anger washes over you. 
&gt;You take care of her.
&gt;You helped her study for those countless hours to help her achieve her dream of getting a Doctorate.
&gt;You handle the taxes every April.
&gt;You cook every meal every day: Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
&gt;You showed her the exciting world of motor sports and even bought tickets to that one race.
&gt;If she would just stop being a fucking child for a single fucking second and not whine like a puppy...

&gt;And as soon as the anger came over you, it leaves; a whole other feeling comes crashing down.
&gt;Guilt
&gt;It&#039;s not her fault that she was put into this disposition.
&gt;Every other kid in school either ignored her or made her life a living nightmare
&gt;She fought so hard all these years past her CP and Aspergers to get where she is.
&gt;She was the one who asked to be more than friends.
&gt;She was your first partner, and your only as far as you&#039;re concerned.
&gt;You don&#039;t deserve her.
&gt;The fact that she has accomplished so much on her own, despite her disabilities is a testament to her sheer strength.
&gt;And when she needs you the most, you have such cowardly thoughts and let your feelings get the best of you.

&gt;It&#039;s as if Cassie can feel your own inward battle, despite her being the one physically shaking.
&gt;Her shivering stops, and she looks up from being buried onto your chest.
&gt;Those pure pools of water pierce your very soul.
&gt;&quot;Anon, I love you. Th-thanks for being w-with me.&quot;
&gt;Her head is wet, but she is not the one crying.

&gt;&quot;I love you, too. So very much.&quot;
