        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;ah thats much better
&gt;after that shower you&#039;re feeling much cleaner and greatly de-stressed 
&gt;you towel off and put on your bathrobe 
&gt;before leaving the bathroom you take a quick look up the skylight to see if your peeping tom is still there
&gt;surprisingly enough he&#039;s gone
&gt;with that you unlock the door and swagger out into the living with all the confidence you can muster
&gt;but you demeanor is brutally shattered by the sight that greets you
&gt;baily is kneeling on the couch with her face pressed into a pillow, butt in the air and a horrified expression on her face
&gt;coco is crouched behind bailey with her snout pressed firmly and tightly under the cats tail and a similarly horrified expression on her face
&gt;you 3 share a few moments of silence before you have to cover your mouth to prevent your sudden mad giggling from being heard
&gt;you fail miserably 
&gt;coco and bailey seem to calm down when they realize you&#039;re amused instead of mad but they don&#039;t move an inch from their compromising position
&gt;coco is the first to break the silence on your pets side with 3 loud sniffs against baileys bottom
&gt;baileys horrified expression comes back with a vengeance
&quot;Coco stop that you dumb dog!&quot;
&gt;bailey pushes coco away with her feet and covers her butt by sitting down on it
&quot;Bailey language, I don&#039;t want to hear any speciesism in this house, especially against the members of it&quot;
&gt;her ear flatten again
&quot;Sorry&quot;
&quot;Apologize to coco not me&quot;
&gt;bailey rolls her eyes and looks over at coco
&quot;Sorry for calling you a dumb dog coco&quot;
&gt;coco gives bailey a scratch behind her ears
&quot;It&#039;s okay bailey, I know you didn&#039;t mean it&quot;
&gt;bailey looks miffed at cocos obvious sucking up
&gt;you wait for them to explain themselves
&gt;they just sit there and look at you
&gt;you clear your throat
&quot;So what were you girls up to just now? I thought cats and dogs weren&#039;t supposed to get along, I didn-&quot;
&gt;bailey lets out a loud aha and points her finger at you
&quot;Cats and dogs hating each other is a speciesist and untrue stereotype perpetuated by old slapstick cartoons&quot;
&gt;she crosses her arms and smirks like she just won a great victory
&quot;I think you owe us both an apology&quot;
&gt;you have to smirk and chuckle at her antics
&gt;you walk over scratch their heads
&quot;I&#039;m real sorry girls, can you ever forgive&quot;
&gt;coco immediately begins nodding her head vigorously while bailey makes a show of thinking it over
&quot;I guess I can, but don&#039;t ever let it happen again&quot;
&quot;Oh don&#039;t worry I&#039;ve learned my lesson&quot;
&gt;with that out of the way you move on over to the fridge
&gt;you suppose breakfast is long overd-
&quot;Hey wait a second, don&#039;t change the subject, what were you 2 just doing?&quot; 
&gt;you turn around just in time to see them deflate from their hopes of not having to explain this being crushed
&gt;you cross your arms and wait for whoevers the first one to speak up 
&gt;turns out to be bailey
&quot;Uh well you see..., I wanted to pay coco back for helping me clean myself so...&quot;
&gt;bailey hides her face behind the armrest of the couch
&quot;So you let her smell your butt?&quot;
&gt;bailey points at coco while hiding herself
&quot;It&#039;s what she asked for&quot;
&gt;you turn your attention to coco who looks very nervous at the moment
&gt;you hold your silence for a few moments as the pressure gets to her
&quot;What? You can learn a lot about a person from how their butthole smells&quot;
&gt;she seems to realize how dumb that explanation sounds as toward the end it turns into a whisper
&quot;Oh really? So what did you learn about her?&quot;
&gt;she brings up her finger as if she going to launch into a long explanation but it instead trails off into a long uhhhhhhhhhhhh
&gt;then she perks up as she seems to get an idea
&quot;I learned that bailey is deep down a very nice person&quot;
&gt;coco seems very pleased with herself for that save
&gt;but you&#039;ve had enough embarrassing your pets for today
&gt;you give coco a nod of acceptance and go back to the fridge
&gt;your not in the mood for a fancy breakfast so you just take the half pack of wieners left over from last night and throw them into a pot of water and wait for it to boil
&gt;your food situation is getting pretty dire
&gt;but you also haven&#039;t gotten any of the stuff taking care of a pair of pets requires
&gt;and you&#039;re not exactly made of money right now
&gt;you planned on going out to town to pick up some stuff but it becomes obvious you can&#039;t get everything you need right now
&gt;you&#039;re going to have to make some tough choices</textarea>
