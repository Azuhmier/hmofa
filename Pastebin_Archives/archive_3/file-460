I&#039;m going to see it through to the end... but I just...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You put down your food, swallow all that&#039;s in your mouth and grip her hand for strength</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I know sweetie. We&#039;ll have to wait to start up a proper family for a while, but I promise you the first moment you&#039;re free of it we&#039;re going to take a nice vacation and have a night to remember.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pulls your hand up to her face and cries gently as you pet her to calm her nerves, whispering softly to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Mi vida, Mi alma, Mi corazón.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your words cause a trill purr to escape from her chest, and her smile slowly creeps back into her face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She leans over and gives you a loving kiss on your before taking a bite out of her own burrito and light salsa</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You both eat in a happy silence, scooting your seats a bit closer so that you can hold hands and feed one another</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You accidentally dip her burrito into your salsa, but decide to let her have a bite anyway and she gives you a wry smile while biting into it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A bite or two like that here or there wasn&#039;t any trouble, and she was certainly happy for the small treat you were risking something to give to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every bite after that seems to ramp up her happiness and excitement, her hand going from holding yours to on your lap</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As she finishes the last bite of her breakfast, she moves towards your hand and tenderly begins to lick your fingers clean</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She inches ever so much closer to you, and her hand begins to wander a bit closer to your belt as she begins to teasingly lick your hand clean</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every finger gets a delicate and more arousing treatment until she reaches your index finger, which she goes all out on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nibbles the tip, very softly licking it before taking it into her mouth as suckling on it for a moment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A very mischievous purr comes form within her chest as she sucks softly, letting her mouth slowly slide off with a pop as she smiles at you with hungry eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No words are said as she stands up to her full 4&#039;11 height and guides you up the stairs to the bedroom</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You both ditch most of your clothes as she leaps onto the bed, fiddling to get her right arm to release itself so it doesn&#039;t spasm out during her orgasm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She begins to growl angrily as she struggles with it, so you walk over to her and put your shirt over her like a jacket to calm her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She happily buttons it up at the collar and wears it like a cape as you carefully click small indentions in the mechanical limb, clicking it off gently and placing it on the stand beside your shared bed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You open a drawer in the stand and retrieve a brush and some fur lotion, using your hand to tell your smol cat to get onto her belly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still in your boxers you straddle on top of her, putting a squirt or two of lotion into your hand and flipping up your shirt up while you work the lotion into her back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Gentle half moon circles on her shoulders start your massage, and she melts as your magic fingers begin to carefully tug years of stress out of her lithe body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every loving press into her make the line between desire for your body and your gentle touch burn slightly brighter than the last</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Moving from her shoulders to the nape of her neck she begins to return your loving touch as she tries to gently move her hips to tease you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Working lotion deep into her soft body, you kiss her on the ears and whisper for her to wait patiently for her pampering to be done</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Unfortunately, she&#039;s a bit more than excited and she has some very bad chocie words in return for your gentle affection</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The normally docile cat is very tempted by your hands as you continue your work, pulling the shirt down and working over her legs slowly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see her body&#039;s hot zone dripping with desire, but you&#039;re intent on getting this gentle care done with before she can have that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You rub her tail up and down, from the tip to the base and feed into her desire as your stroke the bottom of her tail with a bit more of a direct rub, causing her pinned legs to wiggle with excitement</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A dab of more lotion on your hands and you take gentle care to rub around her excited lips, enjoying her squirming and soft begs as her fierce nature dies down into a more primal begging urge</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;None of that for now though, as you flip her over and work her belly softly with more of the delicately scented lotion</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every second your work down towards her crotch, rubbing directly everywhere around her lips as she continue to whine and beg</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her legs get pull up onto your shoulders as you embrace your own evil, purposefully placing your own crotch directly against her burning desire and making her shudder as you delicately pat down her thigh fur</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A final dab or two gets applied to her chest as you go from kneading in the lotion to delicately teasing her perky nubs, moving left and right delicately with your own hips as she begins to heat up more and more</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When her entire body is finally covered, and her small chest is fully teased, you finally move into your final stage of torture</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You slowly but surely thrust against her burning lower body as her normally tamed cat like meows give way into more feral noises most ocelots make</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She doesn&#039;t want to have to say the words, but every second of waiting for her is torture and she knows it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every thrust soaks your boxers just a hair more, and finally she breaks with a growling meow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Por favor... mi corazoncito.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Without saying a word, you lean into to gently kiss her on the neck, a shudder running up her spine as she feels you gently enter as your boxers are thrown across the room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Of course, mi bomboncita.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You make love as slow and delicately as you did when stress could have once killed her, transported back in time to when you ran the deep jungles of Brazil as the head of your former employers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every thrust took you back in the day, every gentle moan sinking your mind peering carefully over the shrouding treelines and bushes of old</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gets closer and closer, body losing power as her medicine robs her of strength and you take more and more control to ensure she has a powerful finish</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Which she most certainly does, her small body vert literally clamping down harshly enough to hold you in place as you both finish</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She begins to slow drift off to sleep in your arms soon after she rolls off or your hips, and you share an embrace as you both flutter off into dreamland</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You eventually wake up still basking in the afterglow, so it only makes sense that at some point something would interrupt this perfect day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Slag carefully opens your door, her beak pointed away from you as she looks at you and whispers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We have a problem boss.

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Another beautiful day on your private stretch or paradise starts as it usually does
&gt;Paz is downstairs in the Kitchen making a nice Hispanic breakfast
&gt;A big skillet of chorizo and eggs is placed at the center of the table with Tortillas done up how you love them, a tender amount of crisp and a small amount of butter for a bit more flavor
&gt;Paz had always loved traditional corn tortillas until she met you and you showed her the light of perfectly cooked flour disks
&gt;Homemade chunky salsa sits in two mason jars, the lighter of the too also being the more delicately spiced
&gt;Paz would love nothing more right now than to fill up a tortilla with nothing but the chorizo and hot salsa, but her medicines are limiting her pallet
&gt;As she watches you take the first bites of your own breakfast burrito, a frown begins to creep across her face, and you know what she wants to say
&gt;&quot;I want this medication regimen to end, sweetie. I&#039;m going to see it through to the end... but I just...&quot;
&gt;You put down your food, swallow all that&#039;s in your mouth and grip her hand for strength
&gt;&quot;I know sweetie. We&#039;ll have to wait to start up a proper family for a while, but I promise you the first moment you&#039;re free of it we&#039;re going to take a nice vacation and have a night to remember.&quot;
&gt;She pulls your hand up to her face and cries gently as you pet her to calm her nerves, whispering softly to her
&gt;&quot;Mi vida, Mi alma, Mi corazón.&quot;
&gt;Your words cause a trill purr to escape from her chest, and her smile slowly creeps back into her face
&gt;She leans over and gives you a loving kiss on your before taking a bite out of her own burrito and light salsa
&gt;You both eat in a happy silence, scooting your seats a bit closer so that you can hold hands and feed one another
&gt;You accidentally dip her burrito into your salsa, but decide to let her have a bite anyway and she gives you a wry smile while biting into it
&gt;A bite or two like that here or there wasn&#039;t any trouble, and she was certainly happy for the small treat you were risking something to give to her
&gt;Every bite after that seems to ramp up her happiness and excitement, her hand going from holding yours to on your lap
&gt;As she finishes the last bite of her breakfast, she moves towards your hand and tenderly begins to lick your fingers clean
&gt;She inches ever so much closer to you, and her hand begins to wander a bit closer to your belt as she begins to teasingly lick your hand clean
&gt;Every finger gets a delicate and more arousing treatment until she reaches your index finger, which she goes all out on
&gt;She nibbles the tip, very softly licking it before taking it into her mouth as suckling on it for a moment
&gt;A very mischievous purr comes form within her chest as she sucks softly, letting her mouth slowly slide off with a pop as she smiles at you with hungry eyes
&gt;No words are said as she stands up to her full 4&#039;11 height and guides you up the stairs to the bedroom

&gt;You both ditch most of your clothes as she leaps onto the bed, fiddling to get her right arm to release itself so it doesn&#039;t spasm out during her orgasm
&gt;She begins to growl angrily as she struggles with it, so you walk over to her and put your shirt over her like a jacket to calm her
&gt;She happily buttons it up at the collar and wears it like a cape as you carefully click small indentions in the mechanical limb, clicking it off gently and placing it on the stand beside your shared bed
&gt;You open a drawer in the stand and retrieve a brush and some fur lotion, using your hand to tell your smol cat to get onto her belly
&gt;Still in your boxers you straddle on top of her, putting a squirt or two of lotion into your hand and flipping up your shirt up while you work the lotion into her back
&gt;Gentle half moon circles on her shoulders start your massage, and she melts as your magic fingers begin to carefully tug years of stress out of her lithe body
&gt;Every loving press into her make the line between desire for your body and your gentle touch burn slightly brighter than the last
&gt;Moving from her shoulders to the nape of her neck she begins to return your loving touch as she tries to gently move her hips to tease you
&gt;Working lotion deep into her soft body, you kiss her on the ears and whisper for her to wait patiently for her pampering to be done
&gt;Unfortunately, she&#039;s a bit more than excited and she has some very bad chocie words in return for your gentle affection
&gt;The normally docile cat is very tempted by your hands as you continue your work, pulling the shirt down and working over her legs slowly
&gt;You can see her body&#039;s hot zone dripping with desire, but you&#039;re intent on getting this gentle care done with before she can have that

&gt;You rub her tail up and down, from the tip to the base and feed into her desire as your stroke the bottom of her tail with a bit more of a direct rub, causing her pinned legs to wiggle with excitement
&gt;A dab of more lotion on your hands and you take gentle care to rub around her excited lips, enjoying her squirming and soft begs as her fierce nature dies down into a more primal begging urge
&gt;None of that for now though, as you flip her over and work her belly softly with more of the delicately scented lotion
&gt;Every second your work down towards her crotch, rubbing directly everywhere around her lips as she continue to whine and beg
&gt;Her legs get pull up onto your shoulders as you embrace your own evil, purposefully placing your own crotch directly against her burning desire and making her shudder as you delicately pat down her thigh fur
&gt;A final dab or two gets applied to her chest as you go from kneading in the lotion to delicately teasing her perky nubs, moving left and right delicately with your own hips as she begins to heat up more and more
&gt;When her entire body is finally covered, and her small chest is fully teased, you finally move into your final stage of torture
&gt;You slowly but surely thrust against her burning lower body as her normally tamed cat like meows give way into more feral noises most ocelots make
&gt;She doesn&#039;t want to have to say the words, but every second of waiting for her is torture and she knows it
&gt;Every thrust soaks your boxers just a hair more, and finally she breaks with a growling meow
&gt;&quot;Por favor... mi corazoncito.&quot;
&gt;Without saying a word, you lean into to gently kiss her on the neck, a shudder running up her spine as she feels you gently enter as your boxers are thrown across the room
&gt;&quot;Of course, mi bomboncita.&quot;

&gt;You make love as slow and delicately as you did when stress could have once killed her, transported back in time to when you ran the deep jungles of Brazil as the head of your former employers
&gt;Every thrust took you back in the day, every gentle moan sinking your mind peering carefully over the shrouding treelines and bushes of old
&gt;She gets closer and closer, body losing power as her medicine robs her of strength and you take more and more control to ensure she has a powerful finish
&gt;Which she most certainly does, her small body vert literally clamping down harshly enough to hold you in place as you both finish
&gt;She begins to slow drift off to sleep in your arms soon after she rolls off or your hips, and you share an embrace as you both flutter off into dreamland
&gt;You eventually wake up still basking in the afterglow, so it only makes sense that at some point something would interrupt this perfect day
&gt;Slag carefully opens your door, her beak pointed away from you as she looks at you and whispers
&gt;&quot;We have a problem boss. I know you were havin a good day and all that, but we gotta deal with it now.&quot;
&gt;Your rub Paz&#039;s ears delicately, making sure she&#039;s fast asleep as you grab your shotgun from the closet and carefully move across your bedroom towards Slag
&gt;You pick up your clothes from the floor, save for your plaid shirt which Paz was still wearing, and walk down the stairs behind her as she clues you in on the situation

&gt;From the porch Slag points to your massive mutant apple tree in the distance, something rustling up a storm and throwing down apples it didn&#039;t want
&gt;You rack your shotgun and fire somewhere into the tree, hoping that your normal load of beanbags hits your target dead center
&gt;&quot;Get the fuck out of my tree!&quot;
&gt;You watch as a bat screeches and flies away from your tree back towards the forest, a large apple in it&#039;s mouth
&gt;&quot;I didn&#039;t know we even had bats here. Why didn&#039;t you go after her?&quot;
&gt;Slag jumps up and flutters her feathered arms at you
&gt;&quot;I can barely glide with these things boss. Ravens and crows evolved as anthros to be bigger and stockier than our shitty inbred tweeter cousins.&quot;
&gt;That&#039;s actually a fair comeback, you have to admit
&gt;You tell Slag to pick up the apples the bat didn&#039;t want, bring them to the kitchen to salavage what she could, and wait for am ambush tonight when the bat felt safe
&gt;Hours pass as you silently set up floodlights and dress up in a ghillie suit for the hunt tonight
&gt;When darkness falls you&#039;re in position in the treeline near the forest, cords running to floodlights from your house, and massive speakers near you
&gt;The brave bat flies towards your massive apple tree and lands in the branches, taking a moment to look around to make sure it&#039;s safe
&gt;The second Slag hears a crunch of an apple being eaten from your tree the floodlights blast on, causing the bat to flee
&gt;She glides towards you, and you turn the volume all the way up as &quot;Slay the orcs&quot; by 3 Inches of Blood assaults her gentle hearing so bad that she falls out of the sky

&gt;As she tries to stand her eyes look wild, and you work fast to break her in by firing a riot slug into her chest, sending her screaming backwards
&gt;As you rush over she holds her ears and screeches in pain, so you use her open defenses against her and smash the butt of your Ithaca harshly into her ribs, repeatedly slamming the butt down on her as she struggles to fight the music and your blows
&gt;The music fades for a moment as she begins to fight back better, pushing away as her large leathery wings flap wildly under her arms
&gt;A sudden barrage of guitars thanks to the Mors Pricnipum Est&#039;s &quot;Parasites of Paradise&quot; makes her retreat to her ears again as you slam into her repeatedly, bruising her fragile belly and arms rapidly with a mix of shots and strikes
&gt;She does her best to run, but trips and lands incorrectly and dislocates a finger causing her to go into immense pain
&gt;With little mercy in your heart you leap onto her arm, pushing down on her wrist viciously with leg as you kneel and painfully pop her finger into position
&gt;She manages to somehow kick you off of her, and she attempts to get up as the music blares louder and loud, causing her to shake and wobble
&gt;She screams out in pain as the second half of Venetian Snare&#039;s &quot;All the Children&quot; begins to play, and tries to run away as you fire at her again, missing by an inch
&gt;She seems to run closer to the speakers in an attempt to stop it, but the power of the music gets to her and manages to somehow send her falling to the ground limp
&gt;Did the pain of her sudden wounds and stress kill her?
&gt;A quick check as Slag cuts power to your non lethal weapons and you pull your ear muffs off tells you she&#039;s in some kind of mind altered trance
&gt;All of the loud noises and flashing lights must have somehow broken her mind, because when you pick her up she seems to be staring through you

&gt;The usual fare of messy and painful torture is instead exchanged for depriving her of sleep and keeping her trance up as the doctor treats her wounds carefully between sessions
&gt;She only catches sleep during these times, because after he spends an hour or two treating her the music blares over and over
&gt;Every day the song changes to something more powerful or completely different
&gt;The second night has her crying to Car Bomb&#039;s &quot;Lights Out&quot;, doing her best to try to sleep but failing and falling into despair
&gt;The third day cracks her mind open a bit, causing her to cower in the corner every time you look at her through a ghillie mesh with the doors open
&gt;By the fifth day she&#039;s barely able to comprehend reality, covering her ears and staring blankly at the speakers as Blind Guardian&#039;s A Voice in the Dark assaults her
&gt;On the seventh day she&#039;s a wreck, trying to flee and hide in the shadows as Iron Savior&#039;s Tyranny of Steel breaks her down and your bush like frame causes her to panic and throw herself under the mattress to hide
&gt;On the eight day no music is necessary, and she doesn&#039;t even seem to understand what she was listening to anymore, forcing her to fall asleep in front of the bushy terror that first caught her
&gt;You decide now is the time for a test, and send in the doctor to check up on her
&gt;The entire time she begs for him to take her away to safety, away from the horrifying screams of the bush monster
&gt;Time to call up a buyer

&gt;You play metal softly on a walkman as you approach the door, loud enough for her to easily hear from the other side
&gt;You don&#039;t hear any crying, but instead a soft cry for help from the other side, and open the door slowly 
&gt;The bat sits in the back corner of the room, her pupils the size of dimes as you smack an axe handle against the door frame, fake blood covering the wood
&gt;She yelps and you wait a moment to turn the lights on, no disguise covering your body as you stare at her as if confused
&gt;&quot;How long have you been down here for? Did the monster take you?&quot;
&gt;She doesn&#039;t move, staring at you and shaking harder 
&gt;Fear is the appropriate response for first contact, now to see if she&#039;s playing into step two of your mental conditioning
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not going to hurt you sweety. The fighting is already over, you don&#039;t have to worry anymore.&quot;
&gt;You throw the handle down and away from you, kneeling down and opening your arms towards the frightened bat
&gt;Like clockwork, she runs into your arms crying and afraid of the big bad monster that was hurting her
&gt;Lifting her up, you tell her to close her eyes and relax, so she does exactly as you say
&gt;The music she was once afraid of doesn&#039;t register as a fearful thing to her, instead seeming to somehow calm her as you wonder if you overdid it a bit with this one
&gt;A short walk up the stairs of your basement and out onto your front porch leads you directly into the buyer&#039;s path
&gt;He&#039;s dressed in an inviting with a button up shirt and tie, the absolute apex of friendly attire
&gt;You slowly set the bat down, and she looks towards the man who&#039;s smiling at her
&gt;Taking your warlike attire to mean that you aren&#039;t supposed to be her caretaker, she runs into his arms and continues crying and begging for him to keep her safe
&gt;He nods to her, smiling at you for a moment before taking her into a waiting SUV and slowly driving off into the sunset with her
&gt;Taking a note in your mind that bats are easier to break than you thought, you head back into your house and towards the kitchen
&gt;A glance over to the window shows all of the cooling pies are still in place, meaning that black handed vixen you had only caught a glimpse or two of up until now hadn&#039;t come back for more treats just yet
&gt;Heading back up your stairs and into your bedroom where Paz lies sleeping in some rather lacy nightwear, you throw that thought out of your mind
&gt;Enjoy what you have while you can, because you may not get too many more peaceful days with no interruptions if your latest guest was anything to go by</textarea>
