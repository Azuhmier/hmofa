            RAW Paste Data        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Due to a clerical error, you were loaded onto a prisoner transport vessel bound for Euren- an all-female prison located on an asteroid
&gt;A maximum security prison
&gt;On top of being sent to the wrong facility, you had been sent to the wrong KIND of facility, and your protests had fallen on deaf ears
&gt;Long rows of benches stretched down the length of the ship, with several armed guards on each lane; your wrists are restrained to a metal ring between your legs
&gt;You&#039;re seated with your back to the hull, attempting to block out the jeers and catcalls sent your way by the other prisoners
&gt;Your neighbor, a musclebound Tigris woman, is attempting to show off her (admittedly) impressive physique by flexing her biceps
&gt;Each time she flexes, she quickly glances in your direction to gauge your response
&gt;So far you&#039;ve ignored her, but this is getting old
&gt;You shift in your seat to face her and her ears swivel towards you
&gt;&quot;Hey, nice gains&quot;, you say
&gt;Her head whips around toward you and she beams
&gt;&quot;HAHA! THANKS!&quot; she booms
&gt;You flinch
&gt;Holy shit, is that her inside voice?
&gt;The Tigran goes back to her odd display, and sends you more glances than before
&gt;Great
&gt;The woman to your opposite side chuckles
&gt;&quot;I believe she&#039;s courting you,&quot; she whispers
&gt;You turn towards the woman, a lean Lutra
&gt;”Oh?”
&gt;She nods
&gt;”Tigran females are the breadwinners in their culture, so they’re more proactive with finding potential mates- there’s a male for every four females, so you can have any number of them courting a single male. They’ll participate in feats of strength-”
&gt;”FEATS OF STRENGTH!” you shout, laughing
&gt;”Uh, what?” she narrows her eyes at you
&gt;”My bad, old Earth TV reference. Please continue.”
&gt;”Anyway- they compete to show the male which of them is the most capable. It’s been that way for millennia, apparently.”
&gt;”Hmm”, you say. You rub your face on the rough fabric of your uniform, hitting an itch on your nose
&gt;”Their males sound like limp noodles,” you say, after a stretch of silence
&gt;The otter-like woman snorts
&gt;You turn towards the Tigran woman to see her going all out on the flexing
&gt;....
&gt;Apparently she was trying to get your attention while you were speaking to the Lutran 
&gt;Haha, was she jealous?
&gt;Her arm, shoulder, and back muscles are flexed and prominent
&gt;She grunts from the strain
&gt;The fabric of her shirt is stretched tight across her back and you swear you hear a seam rip
&gt;She sees that she’s caught your attention, and her eyes gleam while she holds the pose
&gt;It seems she’s waiting for another compliment- fuck it, you’ll humor her
&gt;”Wow,” you say, “you must be very strong.”
&gt;She smiles at you and nods violently
&gt;An idea strikes you, and you flex right back at her
&gt;You’re nowhere near her level of physique, but years of jiu jitsu had left you with a decent body
&gt;The tiger’s eyes glitter and she gives you a tight nod of approval
&gt;You spot another Tigran an aisle over attempting to join in on the muscle display
&gt;You choke down a laugh
&gt;”You two are perfect for each other,” the Lutran deadpans
&gt;The Tigran gives a saintly nod
--------
&gt;The three of you introduce yourselves and chat for a while before the Lutran, Sari, addresses the elephant in the room
&gt;”You’re male, right? May I ask why you’re being sent to-”
&gt;”A women’s prison?” you ask, finishing her question
&gt;She nods once, before looking away in embarrassment 
&gt;”Not sure, honestly- everyone I’ve spoken to has just given me the cold shoulder. Makes me wonder if my being here is something more than a simple error.”
&gt;”If that’s the case, then I don’t envy you. You’ve already gotten a lot of looks from the other prisoners- it’ll only get worse when we arrive there”
&gt;Jesus
&gt;”Is that supposed to make me feel better?”, you laugh
&gt;”Shit- I mean, uh- you just-”, she blubbers
&gt;You suppress a laugh as she squirms in her seat
&gt;You sit back and let her backpedal a little longer before you decide to spare her
&gt;”Relax, I know what you’re saying; I’ll have to play it safe,” you say, winking at her
&gt;She exhales in relief and visibly relaxes
&gt;”Maybe cozy up to a mafioso,” you continue
&gt;”That’s not what I meant,” she giggles
&gt;Mae bumps her head against your shoulder, and shoots you a winsome grin
&gt;”AND I’VE GOT YOUR BACK, HUMAN- SO THERE’S NOTHING TO FEAR.”
&gt;Your ears ringing, you thank Mae and remind yourself to have the inside/outside voice talk with her in the near future
--------
&gt;The ship docks and the prisoners are escorted out without incident
&gt;You’re brought to a large atrium where the inmates are lined up in orderly rows, and guards process each person by scanning their subdermal implants
&gt;It’s finally your turn, and once scanned you’re directed to a bare room with two female guards
&gt;You’re instructed to strip
&gt;”CHEEKS OUT, BALLS UP”, the first guard shouts
&gt;&quot;Always wanted to say that,&quot; she says, turning to her sniggering coworker
&gt;Oh no
&gt;”About that, I’ve been-”
&gt;”CHEEKS OUT, BALLS UP”, she repeats, pulling on a pair of disposable gloves
&gt;Please, no
&gt;You sigh
--------
&gt;The guard had looked you over twice, taking much longer than was necessary
&gt;“Just in case”, she’d told her giggling coworker
&gt;You wanted to curl up and die
&gt;...
&gt;After what feels like an eternity, the second guard clears her throat and taps her wrist
&gt;Your molester slaps your ass and tells you you’re free to go
&gt;You quickly dress and scurry from the room
--------
&gt;You’re directed to a mid sized assembly hall, where the warden will (presumably) address the group of prisoners
&gt;Guards are stationed across the room, closely watching the assembled inmates
&gt;You make your way through, searching for your two shuttle buddies while ignoring the jeers and catcalls of the other prisoners
&gt;”How’d it go?”, Sari asks, once you find her in the crowd
&gt;”My ass hurts, and I might be traumatized. Other than that...”, you shrug
&gt;She frowns
&gt;”Your... ass hurts?” she asks
&gt;”From the cavity search”
&gt;”From the cavity search?” she repeats, frowning
&gt;”Uh-huh. Do you not remember that bit?”
&gt;”Uh, I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this- but, ah-”
&gt;”Spit it out”, you snap, getting irritated
&gt;”Cavity searches are outmoded- they aren’t necessary, you were scanned as soon as you entered that room”
---------
&gt;The acoustics in the hall were fantastic
&gt;After your outburst, the room went dead quiet, except for your echoing “FUCK”
&gt;And now they’re all staring at you again
&gt;It seems it caught Mae’s attention, she bounds up to you excitedly
&gt;”HI HUMAN!” she shouts, grinning down at you
&gt;Your poor eardrums
&gt;You didn’t notice this when you were seated next to her, but she’s fairly tall, standing roughly a head and a half higher than you
&gt;”HI MAE!” you shout, grinning up at her
&gt;She beams
&gt;Sari grimaces and rubs her small furry ears
&gt;”Mae,” you begin, “we need to talk abo-”
&gt;”Wanna ditch those two, handsome? I’ll keep you safe, for a lil’ sumthin’”, a voice behind you cuts in
&gt;You turn around to reveal…
&gt;Nobody
&gt;”Down here”, the voice huffs
&gt;It’s a literal shortstack
&gt;A Marmotan, you think
&gt;The small rodent looks you up and down, raising an eyebrow suggestively
&gt;”What’s a ‘lil sumthin’?” you ask, innocently
&gt;She snorts
&gt;”You know what I mean, honey. ‘Favors’.”
&gt;”Favors?”, you continue, feigning confusion
&gt;”SEX!”, she shouts, dragging a paw down her face in exasperation
&gt;You giggle
&gt;An orange furry paw rests on your shoulder
&gt;Mae gingerly nudges you aside to kneel down in front of the small woman
&gt;Her ears are laid back, and her pupils are dilated
&gt;”FUCK OFF, CUNT!!” she roars
&gt;The poor woman scampers away
&gt;You shoot a concerned look at Sari, you hadn’t expected such a reaction out of the friendly Tigran
&gt;”Com-pe-ti-tion”, Sari mouths, pointing at the fleeing figure and then at you
&gt;Suddenly, a horrible, screeching feedback assaults your ears
&gt;&quot;Whoopsy, fuc- fricking thing. Ms. Peabody, could you-&quot; a small attendant rushes on stage and immediately fixes the mic for the warden
&gt;&quot;Ah, yes- thank you Ms. Peabody.&quot;
&gt;The warden stands tall at roughly three and a half feet, some kind of squat ferret
&gt;She&#039;s dressed in a charcoal suit and skirt, but her countenance betrays her business attire- she&#039;s positively beaming
&gt;&quot;Now then! HELLLLLLLO LAAAAAADIES!&quot; the warden announces
&gt;&quot;WELCOME TO ST. EUUUUUUUURENS!&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s addressing the audience like they&#039;re attending a pep rally!
&gt;You tell your thoughts to Sari, who shushes you and faintly smiles
&gt;The warden spends the next half hour instructing everybody on what to expect during their time at the prison
&gt;Take away message: toe the line and you&#039;ll be alright
&gt;You weren&#039;t so optimistic, eventually you were going to be forced to be somebody&#039;s bottom bitch
&gt;If not the whole prison&#039;s
&gt;Christ, how is she so chipper?
&gt;The warden then spouts some inspirational bullshit about perseverance and believing in yourself, but by this point you&#039;ve completely tuned her out
&gt;You&#039;re then instructed to form lines and wait to be sorted (again), which you do
---
&gt;A guard approaches you shortly after the lines are formed- she&#039;s another species you&#039;re unfamiliar with, but resembles a dolphin
&gt;&quot;EEEEEE EEE EEEEEEEE EEEEEEE&quot;, she ululates 
&gt;You tilt your head, confused
&gt;&quot;Uh?&quot;
&gt;The dolphins huffs and leaves, bringing another guard back with her
&gt;&quot;EEEEE EEE EEEEEE E EEEEEE&quot;, she says to the guard, pointing at you and then herself
&gt;&quot;Warden wants to see ya, follow her&quot;, the guard translates
&gt;You laugh
&gt;&quot;Why didn&#039;t she just say that?&quot;
&gt;This apparently pisses the dolphin off, she quickly closes the distance between you and begins furiously ululating, forcefully prodding your chest for emphasis
&gt;&quot;EEEEEE,&quot; poke &quot;EEEEEEEEE,&quot; poke &quot;EE,&quot; poke &quot;EEEEEEEEEEEEEE EE,&quot; poke
&gt;&quot;Her-&quot; 
&gt;&quot;translator&#039;s&quot;
&gt;&quot;broken&quot;
&gt;&quot;is why&quot;, the other guard translates, miming the dolphin&#039;s cadence
&gt;&quot;hot stuff&quot;, the translator finishes
&gt;The dolphin glares at the other guard, who winks at you- apparently the last bit was the second guard&#039;s addition
&gt;You hear Sari choking down laughter
&gt;Mae looks pissed that the dolphin touched you, but is demonstrating an impressive amount of restraint
&gt;You make a mental note to reward her later, maybe you&#039;ll touch her bicep while she flexes
---
&gt;The dolphin shoves you into the warden&#039;s office, apparently having had enough of your company
&gt;The room smells of perfume, a spicy, fruity scent
&gt;The warden looks up sharply from her desk when you enter, and quickly tosses a dogeared paperback behind her
&gt;You catch a glimpse of a bedroom-eyed, shirtless and muscled Lupan male on the cover
&gt;The dolphin situates herself in the far corner and the warden motions for you to have a seat in front of her desk
&gt;The warden&#039;s desk is scaled down to her size, so you&#039;re practically looming over her in your chair
&gt;Her office is about what you expected
&gt;Countless cutesy porcelain figures clutter her desk
&gt;Thick, serious looking tomes sit on her bookshelf
&gt;MACRAME AND YOU
&gt;THE KITTEN COMPENDIUM
&gt;There&#039;s even a number that have been turned backwards, so the spines aren&#039;t exposed
&gt;Probably more garbage romance novels
&gt;She clears her throat to catch your attention, and opens up a file- presumably yours
&gt;She smiles up at you
&gt;&quot;Now then, Jaime- I&#039;m sure you&#039;re wondering what you&#039;re doing here, correct?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes ma&#039;am&quot;, you reply
&gt;&quot;Well, I&#039;d like to assure you that it was no mistake. It&#039;s part of a recent initiative we&#039;ve undertaken to ensure our inmates&#039; happiness- think of yourself as, uh... a mascot... for the prison!&quot;
&gt;&quot;....A mascot, ma&#039;am?&quot;
&gt;She nods her head vigorously
&gt;&quot;Oh yes, a mascot.&quot;
&gt;...is she serious?
&gt;&quot;Can I be straight with you, warden?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Of course, I want you to be!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m a little worried about my safety, being the only male inmate.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Hah, nonsense! My ladies would never lay a hand on you&quot;, she says, almost hysterically, attempting to wave your concerns away
&gt;Your concerns have just doubled
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll tell you what, though-&quot; she says, continuing &quot;considering your circumstances, I&#039;m willing to give you a few special accommodations. How about a cell with a shower? I&#039;ll even allow you to pick your cellmate.&quot;
&gt;You breathe a sigh of relief, you&#039;d been especially worried about the shower situation
&gt;&quot;That&#039;d be fine, ma&#039;am. I&#039;d like to have Mae as my cellmate- she&#039;s the Tigran who sat beside me on the transport.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Consider it done- Tina here will escort you to your new quarters and get you situated.&quot;
&gt;&quot;EEEEE EEE EEEEEEEE E&quot;, Tina chirps
&gt;The warden frowns
&gt;&quot;Please get your translator fixed, Tina&quot;
--------
&gt;You&#039;re currently sitting on the bottom bunk in your cell
&gt;It suddenly occurs to you that you never asked what your capacities were as the prison&#039;s &quot;mascot&quot;
&gt;You&#039;ll have to ask the warden next time you see her
&gt;The door opens, disrupting your thoughts
&gt;It&#039;s Mae, escorted in by a guard
&gt;Her face lights up when she spots you
&gt;&quot;HUMAN!&quot;
&gt;She pulls you in for a bonecrushing hug
&gt;The fur poking out of the neck of her uniform tickles your face as she starts rubbing her head over yours, a deep, rolling rumble filling her chest
&gt;She abruptly pulls away, looking embarrassed
&gt;&quot;AH! SORRY, HUMAN!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t sweat it- I&#039;m glad to see you too, buddy&quot;, you grin, nudging her side with an elbow
&gt;She flashes a bright smile at you, exposing her sharp teeth
&gt;You suddenly remember the reward you&#039;d promised yourself to give Mae
&gt;&quot;Oh, hey! Could I ask you for a favor?&quot;
&gt;Her tail, which had been lazily flicking back and forth, suddenly goes still
&gt;You&#039;ve caught her interest
&gt;&quot;OH? SURE!&quot; she says, attempting (and failing) to appear nonchalant
&gt;&quot;Can I- alright, this is going to sound weird. But, can I touch your biceps?&quot;
&gt;&quot;HAHA, THAT&#039;S ALL? OF COURSE!&quot;
&gt;Mae looks ecstatic
&gt;She takes your hand and places it on her arm, flexing
&gt;You squeeze- solid as a rock
&gt;&quot;Jesus Christ you&#039;re ripped. Very impressive, 10 out of 10.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Thanks for indulging me&quot;, you say, winking
&gt;Mae giggles, beaming at you
-------
&gt;You head to shower in the lavatory, which is separated from the cell by a door
&gt;Thank god
&gt;You were relieved, you&#039;d always been uncomfortable bathing around others- and the prospect of doing your business in front of someone else had really freaked you out
&gt;Stepping into the hot stream of water, you sigh
&gt;The next few minutes are pure bliss
&gt;The water abruptly stops as your time runs out, cutting you off heaven
&gt;You towel off and step back into the cell, dressed in a fresh uniform
&gt;Mae&#039;s doing crunches next to your bunk, heavily sweating
&gt;&quot;Mae. You going to have one? Hot water, I was surprised.&quot;
&gt;Mae jumps up
&gt;&quot;SURE!&quot;
&gt;As she passes you, she sniffs your head
&gt;A brief frown crosses her face
&gt;&quot;Everything alright there, Mae?&quot; you ask, puzzled
&gt;&quot;O-OH, IT&#039;S NOTHING, HUMAN. HAHAHAHAHA.&quot; she says, laughing longer than necessary
&gt;She practically flees into the bathroom
&gt;You&#039;ll have to tell her your name at some point
&gt;Collapsing onto the bottom bunk, you sigh in relief- your first day in prison could have gone worse
&gt;You had your own digs, a shower, and a very enthusiastic bodyguard
