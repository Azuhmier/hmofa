        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Be you, Inmate #A0382916
&gt;Not for long, however
&gt;After promising the military a sizable chunk of your life, a small incident overseas landed you a sudden PCS to Fort Leavenworth
&gt;Do not pass go, do not collect $200
&gt;Fortunately, your contract was coming up and re-enlistment wasn&#039;t an option
&gt;You remember walking out of there with the single-minded determination to just get to your death-bed without too much more trouble
&gt;You took a quick inventory of the items you were allowed to have back
&gt;Clothes, old backpack, plastic baggy filled with little sundries, a map of the surrounding area, an old phone, and a wallet running on empty
&gt;Taking a quick stroll around town, you eventually crash on a nearby park bench and consider your current situation
&gt;Family made their stance on you perfectly clear
&gt;Along the lines of &quot;Fuck off, you gave this family a bad name, we never want to see you again&quot;
&gt;Charming
&gt;Couldn&#039;t go to anyone in the service now, and civilian friends were few and far between
&gt;You&#039;re a vagabond now, and not even the cool leather jacket biker kind
&gt;Sun was starting to set now, interrupting your melancholic brainstorm
&gt;As much as you enjoyed your time passed out on benches before, you&#039;re in unfamiliar territory
&gt;Screw it, you may not be wanted back there, but at least you knew your old town somewhat
&gt;You pulled out your phone and called for a cab
&gt;Fare: $34.23. There went a meal or a comfortable night
&gt;Now, for accommodations 
&gt;A couple of hours later, you found out that every single fucking motel in a straight line from your drop-off point was &quot;booked&quot;
&gt;Bullshit, they just didn&#039;t want you in there, like you got some sort of &quot;taint&quot; about you
&gt;You decided to just keep walking, until you notice a strange change in your surroundings
&gt;It was unmistakable, you had managed to waltz your way into the ghetto, and not the kind you&#039;re used to 
&gt;Weighing your options, you eventually decided that at least, you could probably crash at some cheap roach hotel
&gt;As you headed deeper into the area, you catch the occasional glimpse of some of the ghetto&#039;s lovely inhabitants
&gt;Anthros, every single last one
&gt;You&#039;ve dealt with quite a few in your time, some with friendly intention, most with hostility
&gt;When the two cultures clashed, you were at the front lines, playing escort and keep-away
&gt;Sometimes, you like to joke that you were the reason humans and anthros could live together in relative peace 
&gt;You doubt your current audience would find it funny
&gt;Trying to avoid the damning glares you could feel coming from nearly everywhere, you dunk inside an alleyway...
&gt;And immediately get the attention of 3 anthros stationed at the other end
&gt;Details were hard to see in the dark, but they didn&#039;t look so friendly
&quot;Fuck you think you doing here, skinhead?!&quot;
&quot;Excuse me?&quot;
&gt;The largest one from the pack moved his way closer to you
&gt;Without any lights, you could still make out some features: possibly dog, mohawk-looking haircut, and... surprisingly small?
&quot;I said what the fuck you think you doing around these parts?! You a long way from home, asshole!&quot;
&gt;You decide now would be a good time to take your own step forward
&gt;You were always told you had a presence that could scare a corpse
&gt;And as you begin to size yourself against your possible threat, you can&#039;t help but grin from ear-to-ear
&gt;You just lost everything, finally left prison, could be basically considered left for dead
&gt;And a fucking chihuahua is trying to mug you! 
&gt;And to top it off, at around 6&#039;, you have at least 3 feet over him!
&gt;But if his mind can comprehend it, he isn&#039;t showing it
&gt;He just keeps eyeing you down like he could kill you in a heartbeat
&quot;Look, I&#039;m just trying to find a place to stay. I don&#039;t want any trouble.&quot;
&quot;Well, it just came looking for you, dumbass. Maybe if you pay up, I&#039;ll let you run along.&quot;
&gt;Okay, you are not going to deal with this shit, not today
&gt;You lunge forward, grabbing your potential charity case and slamming him into the wall head-first 
&gt;Taking a quick glance away while he&#039;s dazed, you make sure his friends aren&#039;t going to rush in to make this more of a fair fight
&gt;They probably didn&#039;t care TOO much for him
&gt;Picking up the fallen assailant, you hoist him up to eye level (holy fuck, he is light), and pin him against the wall
&quot;Listen! We can do this the easy way or the hard way.&quot;
&gt;Good job, Mr. Fucking Cliche
&quot;FUCKYOUfuckyoufhuhchkyhohufuchkyohufhuchkyuufuuuuuu&quot;
&gt;Damn, this little bastard has no sense of self-preservation
&gt;...Wait, no, shit, you&#039;re choking him
&gt;You&#039;ve already committed assault in the first day out of the pen, let&#039;s not add murder to that
&gt;You ease your elbow off of his throat while maintaining the attachment to the wall
&quot;Sorry about that&quot;
&gt;18 years in the military, and you&#039;re still a social bumblefuck
&gt;Your new friend just growls at you
&quot;Look, can you just dire-&quot;
&gt;Your request is interrupted by a wad of spit hitting you in the face
&gt;Today is not your day, and you have all but lost patience
&gt;You remember a &quot;little maneuver&quot; an old friend used before to get info out of guys he had carte blanche on
&gt;Falling back on that memory, you pull your left arm back
&gt;And, in a flash, thrust it forward and clutch the ever-loving shit out of your victim&#039;s crotch
&gt;In hindsight, your friend may have been gay
&gt;Placing your right hand over your casualty&#039;s mouth, you tighten your grip and listen to the muffled yips
&gt;Hang on...
&gt;You take a moment of assessment and realize something
&gt;You&#039;re not squeezing any balls...
&gt;In shock, you jump back and let your new girlfriend hit the ground, coughing
&gt;Assault, both physical AND sexual?! You&#039;re just batting a million today
&gt;Paralyzed from astonishment, you just stare at the anthro as she slowly stabilizes herself on the concrete
&gt;She catches your glance and with a pathetic scowl, points  towards the other end of the alleyway
&quot;Out there, take a right, big sign...&quot;
&quot;Um... thanks?...S-sorry about...&quot;
&gt;Why do you do this to yourself?
&gt;You decide to just enact your American culture and give her $20 for her troubles
&gt;That was either the most disturbing tour guide, or cheapest hooker you&#039;ve ever experienced
&gt;You&#039;re just glad the cops were absent during the whole endeavor
&gt;Following her instructions, sure enough, you come across one of the shadiest hooker-murder motels you&#039;ve ever seen
&gt;You can even see crime scene tape on one of the doorways
&gt;If there is a benevolent god, you&#039;d probably be getting that room
&gt;Walking around the place to examine it some more, you notice nothing else too terribly shady
&gt;Nobody&#039;s fucking, nobody&#039;s screaming blood murder. 
&gt;It&#039;s oddly peaceful
&gt;Before you enter the main building, you catch sight of the person working the front desk and stop yourself 
A catgirl, with tuxedo pattern fur? Could that...? No, that can&#039;t be!
&gt;With a deep breath, you push open the door, and hear a familiar voice that confirms your speculation
&quot;Hello, and welcome to th- wait a second, Anon?&quot;
&quot;B-Beth?&quot;
&gt;With surprising speed, Beth leaps over the table and nearly pounces on you as she wraps her arms around you
&gt;Guess this day isn&#039;t that bad
&quot;OMIGAWD!IHAVEN&#039;TSEENYOUINSOLONG!IT&#039;SBEENLIKEFOREVER!&quot;
&gt;As she runs herself dry rambling into your chest, you reminisce about how you knew her
&gt;She was your best friend as a child, much to the disapproval of your family, but you two stuck together through thick and thin
&gt;You recall she did always have the biggest crush on you, but the only time she tried to make a move on you, it did not end well.
&gt;Not because of you, but your father caught you two. Beat you something fierce, and forbid you from seeing her.
&gt;Considering how many times you&#039;ve pissed off your family, you&#039;re surprised this is the final straw.
&gt;Snapping out of your nostalgic haze, you realize that Beth hasn&#039;t been talking for awhile and has just been staring at you as you mentally drift off
&gt;Being a man of action, you return the embrace and lift her up in the process, earning a cute little squeak from her as she surrenders herself to your side of the hug
&gt;You eventually lower her down and start rubbing her head, so you can get a good look at her
&gt;As she purrs happily into your hand with closed eyes, you see the classic Beth characteristics
&gt;Only the right ear stands up, cute white nose, and white fluffy chest
&gt;You remember, the night before you shipped out, you had shared a bed with her for the first time!
&gt;Well, that was the only time you&#039;ve shared a bed with anyone, and it was more you used her as a bed, but it was still great for both parties!
&gt;Remembering what you came here for, you cut your intimacy short and cleared your throat, getting Beth&#039;s attention
&quot;Oh, sorry, it&#039;s just, I haven&#039;t seen you in a while!&quot;
&quot;I think I can tell that you&#039;re more than happy to see me.&quot;
&gt;Beth chuckles softly as she returns to her previous spot behind the front desk
&quot;So what&#039;d you come here for? Come to see about the crime scene?&quot;
&quot;I need a room.&quot;
&quot;You always were so direct. What, did you have no better choices?&quot;
&gt;You recounted your past day to Beth, telling her how you just got out of Leavenworth, how you took a bus here, and how you ambulated your way here
&quot;Quick question: Did poor old little Anon happen to run into a big mean gang of roving dogs?&quot;
&gt;Taken aback, you try to stammer out a lie about coming here without any incident, but she busted out laughing
&gt;You never were a good liar
&quot;Let me guess, they snatched your wallet and ganged up on you?&quot;
&quot;N-no, I... uh... got into a bit of a scuffle with the leader...&quot;
&quot;And...?&quot;
&gt;Just wanting to get it off of your chest, you blurt the rest of the tale out
&quot;Ithrewhimagainstawallandhisfriendsranaway! IpinnedhimupagainstthewalltryingtofindoutaplacetosleepbutIwaschokinghimsoIadjustedmyselfandtriedtoaskhimagainbuthespitinmyfacesoIirongrippedhisdickbuttherewasnodickanditwasactuallyafemalesoIlethergoandshepointedmetohere!&quot;
&gt;She just stood there, mind trying to comprehend what you just said 
&gt;Ultimately, she snickered at your recollection 
&quot;The first day out of prison and you just immediately go for pussy, huh? Maybe I can help?&quot;
&gt;She leaned herself forward, pressing her breasts onto the desk and allowing you to get a glimpse, no, a good eyeful of her cleavage
&gt;She was always more on the leaner side when you were both in high school
&gt;How the fuck did she get so curvy?
&gt;Easy now, Richard, we came here for a specific purpose, and no succubus will tempt us!
&gt;But...maybe you could try your irresistible charm here
&gt;Not that you&#039;ve ever tried it before, and you&#039;re pretty sure it&#039;s resistible
&gt;Fuck it, you have fingers. Anthros fucking love human fingers
&gt;You quickly close the gap between you and instantly begin working your magic on her fur
&gt;She gasps in mock surprise and soon lays her head on the table, purring like V8 as you run your hand around her head
&gt;You wonder off-hand about getting a job at that one human-anthro porn company, what was it, Petterz?
&quot;Listen, love, I&#039;ve traveled a long ways to get her, and I could really use a bed. Maybe someone to help me warm it up too?&quot;
&gt;As you finish saying that, you see Beth&#039;s tail grab a set of keys from the hooks behind her and drop it on the counter
&gt;You give the tail a good pet as thank you, and pick up the keys
&quot;Here you go, room 07. Sorry, but I won&#039;t be able to meet you in there. Someone has to be out here, but still, you can come and see me anytime.&quot;
&quot;Thanks, love! How much do I owe you?&quot;
&quot;Like I said, just come and see me.&quot;
&quot;I think I will.&quot;
&gt;Before walking out, you grab Beth close and give her a quick chaste kiss, just to really tease her
&gt;You step outside and give yourself a full round of mental hi-fives
&gt;You find your room and drop your backpack off, as you make your way to the bathroom
&gt;Again, surprisingly not-as-shady as you would think
&gt;No mold, no guy without kidneys, no lipstick on the mirror
&gt;Speaking of which, you give yourself a quick once-over
&gt;You got scars, stubble, and your classic bald dome
&gt;You took note to grow a beard out now that you could, but keep shaving your head
&gt;But for now, you needed sleep
&gt;So you threw your clothes off, and fell face-first on the bed, clad only in underwear, as you let the a/c&#039;s hums slowly lull you to sleep</textarea>
