&gt;You look over at your bedside clock, checking the time. 
&gt;It was 11:47 P.M.
&gt;It was late December, the temperature outside sitting at a solid 12° Fahrenheit. There was a snowstorm outside, fat flurries of snow visible through the window as they fell.
&gt;Currently, you were at your girlfriends house, laying in her bed.
&gt;The two thin blankets she used didn&#039;t really help you stay warm, and it felt like your toes were about to turn blue and fall off.
&gt;If you were being honest, it was pretty cold in the room. You were really wishing you hadn&#039;t taken your socks off...

&gt;When she pulls away, she presses her head against your face, a light whine leaving her body.
&gt;&quot;Nonny... You, um, mind helping me out? I have an itch...&quot;
&gt;She pasues to give you another warm kiss on your forehead. 
&gt;&quot;I know you&#039;re tired... I promise to be gentle.&quot;
&gt;You give your response by pulling your shorts down.
&gt;Your girlfriend sighs happily as she feels your swelling length slide in between her hips as she eases herself down.
&gt;&quot;Thank you Nonny~...&quot;
&gt;She slowly grinds back and force against your length, spreading her slick juices over her shaft as it dribbles  out of her steaming folds.
&gt;When she feels that you&#039;ve been sufficiently lubed up, she gently grips your throbbing shaft, angling it towards her tight slit.
&gt;As she slowly drops her hips, her hot folds swallowing your length, she reaches out and takes your hands.
&gt;When your hips finally meet, she lets out a satisfied sigh, rolling her hips as she interlocks her fingers with yours.
&gt;She settles into a slow, steady rhythm, smiling at you as she takes you for a ride.
&gt;As her hips slowly rise and lower, she keeps leaning forward to lick your face and kiss you, whispering in your ear how much she loves you.
&gt;The session lasts for nearly 45 minutes. 45 minutes spent blissed out, holding hands with your wolfess girlfriend as the two of you make love.
&gt;She lets out several soft moans, speeding up a bit.
&gt;When she finally reaches her climax, she makes it known, throwing her head back and howling, squeezing your hands.
&gt;Her insides clench around you, milking you of your seed as you fill her womb like a proper mate.
&gt;She flops forward onto your chest, a wide, blissed out smile on her face.
&gt;&quot;Mmm... Thank youuuu Nonnyyyyy...&quot;
&gt;She rolls off of you, your dick popping out as a thin stream of your combined fluids leaks out of her.
&gt;She pulls you close, wrapping you in a warm hug as she kisses and licks at your face.
&gt;Your head is pressed back into her soft, sweet-smelling fur as she gets the two of you comfortable.
&gt;You&#039;re pulled close as she presses her nose into your hair, taking in your scent.

&gt;The two of you cuddle for a bit, smiles on both of your faces.
&gt;She falls asleep before you do, a grin remaining on her face even as she snoozes.
&gt;Her soft arms hold you tight, keeping you safe and secure in her grasp.
&gt;You happily sigh, closing your eyes as you relish her warm hug.
&gt;It doesn&#039;t take long for you to fall asleep, the last thoughts you have being that of your love for the wolf-woman laying next to you.
