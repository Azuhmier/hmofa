&gt;That is not your birthname
&gt;When you were young something happened in school, and most of your childhood was thrown up in the air
&gt;Spend the next ten/fifteen years regularly moving house across the country
&gt;Parents divorce, Stay with mother, who as an aside ends up with an ex-military Tiger anthro.
&gt;Make your way through the state education system, and get decent grades.
&gt;Get yourself a job in the city on the other side of the country from your parents. They&#039;re supportive of your decision.
&gt;Have good work ethic and have positive relations with your bosses and management.
&gt;That feel when life is good despite all the shit in your younger years.
&gt;Have a day off work, and decide to wonder around the city, being a little bit of a tourist.
&gt;The turns into a late afternoon in autumn, so pretty dark pretty quickly.
&gt;Crossing large landmark bridge back home and notice an anthro just ahead of you. From this distance you can tell they&#039;ve not been taking care of their fur as evidenced by their tail.
&gt;Get a bit lost in thought about anthros and how their personal care is so different to humans.
&gt;It starts to rain.
&gt;The anthro is front of you has stopped roughly in the middle of the bridge, and is looking out towards the bay area.
&gt;YFW they start to climb over the railings.
&gt;No thinking, just action. immediately run forward and grab hold of their top, you can tell from the touch its a pretty heavy material which would soak up water. Notice they seem to have the worst clothing possible for being into water, the kind that really drags you down.
&gt;Adrenaline fuels you, and you quickly pull the anthro back onto the safe side of the railing.
&gt;They&#039;re pissed at you, and start shouting and clawing. They&#039;re demanding you let them kill themselves.
&gt;Voice definitely a females.
&gt;A few minutes of struggle, before they begin to calm down, weeping in your arms.
&quot;Why can&#039;t I just kill myself?&quot;
&gt;She asks no one in particular. Slowly she loosens up and is somewhat flopped on the ground with you.
&quot;You can let go now. Just another day another failed attempt to die.&quot;
&gt;Slowly let go and stand up, helping her up as well.
&gt;She hasn&#039;t looked at you, probably in shame.
&gt;You feel urge to not let her do this to herself again at all.
&gt;Suggest that the world would be less beautiful is she wasn&#039;t in it.
&gt;she turns to look you in the eyes, and you now look like you&#039;ve seen a ghost.
&gt;somehow you know who she is.
&gt;she is Mrs Serval
&gt;You accidentally drop her name
&gt;She now looks like a deer caught in headlights.
&gt;She tries to back away but you put up you hands for her to stop.
&gt;Apologise profusely
&gt;Point out how you&#039;re both getting soaked, and it would be better if you went to your place to talk
&gt;She agrees, but stays fully out of arms reach from you.
Later
&gt;She&#039;s in your modest apartment
&gt;She refused to take her soaked top, but took a towel to try and dry off.
&gt;You&#039;ve made hot drinks for both of you, but now you apartment is awkwardly silent.
&gt;Decide to take the initiative.
&gt;Open up. Tell her that you don&#039;t hate her, but you certainly couldn&#039;t forgive her. etc.
&gt;She listens and watches you. Her eyes betray an internal feeling of dread and terror.
&gt;Awkward silence returns
&gt;Now its her turn.
&gt;She tells you about her prison sentencing. What happened in the prison. Her court ordered hysterectomy, along with how she is not allowed to work with or care for any individual under 16, nor work in any capacity in a place of education.
&gt;She lifts up the sleeve of her top. most of her fur is cut away along with dozens of old and new scars. The pulls the puffy collar down to reveal where her fur has been worn away from multiple attempts to hang herself.
&gt;And that is just the physical evidence of attempted suicide she tells you about.
&gt;When she is finished, she looks deflated, but she turns to you and smiles.
&quot;At least you turned out to be a good man.&quot;
&gt;Note how late it is, and say she can stay the night on your couch.
&gt;Get up, but as you pass in front of her you kneel and carefully cup her cheek.
&gt;With a soft smile, remind her that she can always do something positive with her second chance at life if she tries, and that suicide is too easy and out for someone who clearly has tortured themselves enough.
&gt;Walk away, feel guilty as you can hear her crying.</textarea>
