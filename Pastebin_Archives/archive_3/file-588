get ahead of the storm rolling in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can already see the wind picking up outside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you pull off your gloves and check your phone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;only 10 minutes till closing time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you head to the back to grab some cellophane wrap, you need to start putting stuff away in case the power goes out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re worrying about what to do with the frozen goods when you hear the door chime</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;one more customer it seems</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you walk back to the counter freezing mid stride as a soft buzzing fills the room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;oh god please not her, anyone but her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;grimacing you slowly walk up to the front, you know she can sense you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;making it to the register you see &quot;her&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a worn and muddy wide collared trench coat with an ancient looking hat to hide her face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;two floppy antennae poke up from crudely made holes in the hat, they perk up as you come into view.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;everyone else thinks she&#039;s just a loon in a bug mask, so did you at first</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but no its real, its all very real</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she showed you one night after closing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she was waiting by your car </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as you got close she let the coat fall to the ground</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;four segmented arms moving in unison, a slender abdomen with deadly looking stinger</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;and those eyes, those blank dark eyes staring into yours</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you think she knew you were scared, after what seemed like an eternity she coverd her face an ran off into the night leaving you alone in the dark parking lot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;still she came back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Its always the same now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she comes in when there are no other customers takes an unhealthy amount of candy then rushes out the door after paying</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she almost never speaks, when she does her voice is soft</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but it sounds forced and unnatural like something desperately trying to sound human</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she mainly just points or nods to what she wants letting out the occasional click or buzz</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you nervously check your phone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its nearly time to close </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you tap your foot and try to keep your eyes off her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you make candy, bugs have been a constant problem for you since ants took over your familys kitchen as a kid</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but they were always something you could deal with, something small</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;now one could bite your head off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;finally she finishes her selection</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you wonder if somethings going on, she&#039;s usually much quicker</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you start to ring her up when something grabs your wrist</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;one of her other arms</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its all you can do to not scream</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she looks at you her mouth parts slowy moving almost like she&#039;s trying to say something</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she pushes something into your hand and runs out the door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;looking at your hand you let out a sigh</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you put the wad of bills into the register</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she always pays too much and never waits for her change</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you see her outside fighting against the wind</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she looks cold</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">it takes almost an extra hour to finish cleaning up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;so much for closing time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you switch off the lights and step into the cold</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the storms really picked up, the wind could probably knock you on your ass if you let it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you manage to get to your car turning on the heat and head off towards home</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the roads are deserted but it feels like you could crash at any moment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the rain is coming down in sheets you can barely see</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;suddenly you hit a huge puddle in the middle of the road</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you feel your car start to slide as you struggle to keep a grip on the wheel</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you spin to a stop on the side of the road, your headlights illuminating the small lake you just drove through</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re about to head out when you see it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a bag from your store floating in the water a few pieces of candy dissolving around it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">no.....no it can&#039;t be</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you pull on your hood and slowly get out if the car</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you pick up and look inside the bag, the receipts still there</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its dated less than an hour ago</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you start looking around for anything else when you see it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the back of a beige trench coat sticking out of the mud on the other side of the road</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;shit shit shit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;without even thinking you run out across the street soaking yourself completely</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you reach the coat, she&#039;s still in it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;frantically you pull her head out of the water and lean her on the curb</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s not moving, her whole body feels stiff</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you pull off the waterlogged coat before recoiling in shock</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;goddamn it </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can&#039;t help it, her body just seems wrong somehow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you close your eyes and pick her up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can&#039;t just leave her here</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s so light, you nearly loose your grip on her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you trudge back to your car </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as you reach the door she starts twitching and sputtering in your arms</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she starts to lash out at you </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you feel a rough hard fist slamming into your gut</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she leaps from your arms clicking and buzzing wildly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; you starts to charge at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you practically leap into your car slamming the the door behind you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hear popping sound and look to see a dagger like stinger protruding from your car door, missing your leg by inches</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you look up just in time to see her reel before shattering your car window raining glass on you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;then she just stops</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she stands there staring at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she slowly starts backing away her stinger sliding out of your car door with a scrunch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she starts to run away but she seems slow now her manic energy gone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she wobbles a bit before falling back against your car</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re pretty sure you just wet yourself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">what the hell are you going to do now?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you carefully peek out the window she seems down for the count</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re tempted to just drive off but something holds you back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you took biology in school if you leave her here she might drown</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you just can&#039;t bring yourself to do that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;even to a big bug person thing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you get out and pick her up, gently slideing her into your back seat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you pause and then go over to collect her coat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;there&#039;s still a relatively dry bag of candy in one of the pockets</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can&#039;t seem to find her hat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;heading back to the car you shake out some of the water then lay it down on the floor board beside her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hop in and crank up the engine driving off as wind and rain whistle through your ventilated door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;well now what</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you had a gaint half drowned bug passed out in your back seat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;where were you going to go</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;was she even still alive, you can&#039;t even tell if she&#039;s breathing or not</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you pull off into a residential street and park on the curb</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you flick on the overhead light and turn around to check on her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you never really noticed before but she looks like some kind of wasp</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;without her coat she&#039;s completely naked save for what look like bandages wrapped around her chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you look her up and down but can&#039;t see anything wrong with her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with the cold and the wind she might have simply collapsed in the storm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you remember the makeshift bug traps you made as a kid, you guess even gaint wasps can&#039;t handle too much water.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you sigh and look back over her still form</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its strange but in the dim orange light of the car her strange body almost seems beautiful</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you pull off one of your gloves and reach out to her but stop yourself at the last second</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you sit back down in your seat with a squelch, the rain forming a nice little puddle in your lap</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you put your car into gear and pull out the surviving bag of candy popping it open</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;behind you a pair of antennae start to twitch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">taking out a peice you look it over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its some of the hard candy you made for new years, probably the last of the batch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re about to put it in your mouth when you notice something move out of the corner of your eye</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s up and she&#039;s looking right at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she tilts her head inquisitively her antenna moving around sensing the air</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she looks away from you and starts scanning the car, you get the impression she&#039;s still a little out of it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you move a little in your seat causing her to snap back to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she slowly starts moving closer </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hold up the price of candy in front of her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she stops her antennae both point at </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">your hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;faster than you can blink one of her clawed hands dart out

switching them off, letting out a series of happy clicks and buzzes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;oh right</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;last night happend</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you try and act as relaxed as possible</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she notices you standing there and spins around</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;now that you think about it between those eyes and those antennae there&#039;s probably very little she doesn&#039;t notice</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hey! Morning! Made food!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she got her voice back it seems and......wait did she say food?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she rushes you to the table and runs back to the kitchen returning with two small chunks of meat on the ends of a stick, so that&#039;s what was buring</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she lays out a bunch of paper towels in the middle of the table and rests the stick on it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she lays more paper towels out at her and your table spot </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she pulls out the stick and proudly drone the meat at your spot before sitting down with her own</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you look over your &quot;meal&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it looks like it was some kind of small bird, looking closely you notice it looks like the head was pulled off rather than cut .</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you try and get up to get a plate and utensils but she holds out a hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;cut? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she jumps up and walks over too you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she takes one of her long hand claws and and deftly cuts the bird into chunks </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she looks you proudly, Happy to...help!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;at least it looks fully cooked this time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she eats hers in a single crunch and starts to chew on the paper towels</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you take a bite</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its a bit bland but edible</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you sprinkle some salt on it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;that&#039;s better</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you glance up, she&#039;s looking at you funny</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she points to the salt shaker, Sugar?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hold it out for her to see</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you tell her its called salt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Salllllllt? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you nod encouragingly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she takes it from you, peering into the small glass bottle </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Smells....funny</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she then screws the top off and pours the whole thing into her mouth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;so this is your life now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your dining room is trashed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;there are several new holes in your walls</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your arms are cut to ribbons</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re covered head to toe in wasp vomit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;and you&#039;ve spent the past 3 hours on your hands and knees on the bathroom floor playing nursemaid to a gaint bug who thought eating a whole bottle of salt was a good idea</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you feel a weak tug on your sleeve</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you switch on the hot water agian letting some more steam fill room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you need to be careful not to let it get too high</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she takes a deep breath of the humid air before laying back in the tub</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you sprinkle some root beer on your hand holding it out for her to lick up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her tounge looks almost burnt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you wince a little as one of those sharp hairs dig into your hand but you hold steady</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s starting to get her strengh back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after her initial freakout she collapsed and started spasming</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;getting her to water was just a lucky guess, you nearly drowned her yourself trying to get her to drink something</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you silently pray there&#039;s no serious damage </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you wipe your hand off with a towel and get ready to let some more water into the tub</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hey......</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you look down at her her voice is raspy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I.....don&#039;t.....think I...like...salt....very.....muuuu</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she lets out a wheeze and tries to pull herself up nearly falling over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you grab her and help her out off the tub and on to the bathroom rug next to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you get a damp towel ready and wrap it around her legs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she leans into you her antennae brushing against your face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I&#039;m...sorry...about......food</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;not saying anything, you hold her head in your lap and start gently rubbing her antennae</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh......that......feels.....mmmm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you feel her relax in your arms</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you slowly reach over, turning on the the hot water filling the room with a fresh cloud of steam</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you keep massaging her antenna, smiling as they twitch whenever you find a sensitive spot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;yep this is your life now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after another hour in the makeshift sauna she seems to be getting her strength back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you help her into the living room wrapping her towel around her neck and resting her on the sofa</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you head to the kitchen, sighing as you pass what remained of your dining room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you peel and separate an orange for her putting it into a bowl and resting it on the floor near by</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you tell her to relax while you start clean yourself up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she nods, reaching down and trying an orange slice</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you laugh as her mandibles bite down a little too hard causing a mini juice explosion</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;letting out a few happy clicks she takes the bowl in her lap and goes to town</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re probably going to need to work down the couch later but its great to see she&#039;s getting back to her energetic self</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you leave her to it and go the bathroom, you really need a shower</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it takes nearly 30 minutes to get the last of the salty bug vomit off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;looking at all your cuts you really hope you haven&#039;t contracted any strange infections</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you dry off and get dressed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;checking the clock its just about one thirty</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you peel out into the living rokm, wondering if she&#039;s still hungry for lunch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the couch is empty and your front door is wide open</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;son of a bitch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you run outside, you don&#039;t see her anywhere</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hear a loud bang and run over to your driveway</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you see a big yellow bug butt sticking out of your now overturned recycle bin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;okay this is taking the whole wasp thing a little too far</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you knock on the side of the bin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she shoots out like a bullet, stinger outstretched and buzzing angrily</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her arms full of old newspaper</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;once she sees you she immediately calms down </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she clicks and gives you a thumbs up before rushing back inside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you just stand there dumbfounded</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;looking down your driveway you see a couple out walking their dog staring at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you wave awkwardly, you wonder how much of that they saw</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">you slam your door shut</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;that was embarrassing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;now what the hell is she up to</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you find her sitting on the floor in the dining room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hear a wet chewing noise</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you walk up and give her a light tap</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she turns and looks up at you, her mouth full of newspaper</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re not sure how to respond to this</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she spits it out into her hands molding it into a ball</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she leans over and presses it into one of the holes she put in the wall</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she expertly smooths it out you can already see it drying </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she hops up and proudly gestures at her handiwork</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Taaa daaa</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;instant paper mache huh</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;that&#039;s pretty handy as long as it holds.......waaait a second</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;is that what her house was coverd in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you REALLY don&#039;t want your home looking like a gaint bug nest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you politely tell her her you have some caulk in the back and that......</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s already done</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she scoots by you and walks over to the table laying on its side</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she reaches down under it with one hand, as if to pick it up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you tell her to hold on a second, that things pretty heavy and she&#039;s going to need help</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with a yank she filps it up, grabbing it and spinning it around before letting it fall with a loud think</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she looks at you questingnly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;well then you guess you&#039;ll just pick up the small things then</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;looks like she&#039;s recovered at least</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;alright then, you drop the tablecloth into the laundry pile, time for lunch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your new housemate buzzes around you excitedly, as you take some things out of the fridge</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you have no clue what wasps normally eat but she seems to really like meat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you figure burgers would be fine</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she hovers over the ingredients, antennae brushing over them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you push her out of the kitchen telling her you have a surprise for her and she needs to wait outside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you shut the door crossing your fingers she won&#039;t do anything crazy while you&#039;re busy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you keep things simple, not much sesoning in the meat, and plain buns with a little lettuce and ketchup</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you leave hers a little undercooked just in case</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;they aren&#039;t anything fancy but they should be better than what&#039;s she&#039;s used to</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you bump the door open, calling out that lunch is ready</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;oh....she&#039;s right there</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she tackles you, nearly knocking the plate out of your hands</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;if she was any heavier you would probably be on your ass right now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hungry! Food! Thank you!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she snatches a burger looking it over for second before shoveing the whole thing in her mouth, sending bits of meat and bun everywhere</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its gone in seconds, she looks back to the other one</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you sigh and hold it out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she practically inhales it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you put the empty plate on the table when you feel her arms wrap around you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;sooo.....gooooood</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thank.....you....salt.......made me...hungry</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you smile and pat one of her hands</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;happy to help you tell her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you usually spend most most weekends out walking or at the local library</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you really don&#039;t have much of a social circle beyond your employees so you don&#039;t have many commitments outside work</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;that being said you doubt waking around town with a giant wasp would go over well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;while you try and come up with a plan you feel a tap on your shoulder</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s looking up and pointing out the window</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Its going to.....rain</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;huh, you ask her what she&#039;s talking about</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it was supposed to only be a little overcast today</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she just points to her antennae</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;thinking about it you don&#039;t really want to debate her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you have no idea what those fuzzy things can actually do</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;ok then if you&#039;re gonna have a lazy Saturday what better way to spend then watching some movies!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you ask if she would want to watch some tv or something</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her whole body starts to vibrate like one of those electric back massagers, letting out a low buzzing sound</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;tvvvvv? With....you? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;uh yeah, you tell her you have one in the back of the house</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she lets out a quiet

class="de1">&gt;has she ever even seen a working tv? you think to yourself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after some time digging around a closet you find it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your old converter box and a pair of bunny ears, she isn&#039;t the only one with antennae you chuckle to yourself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you have to pause for a moment to consider why your brain thought that was an acceptable thing to come up with</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you walk back in, she&#039;s still staring at the screen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after a few trys the converter flashes green and you hit the input button untill you find the right one</div></li><li class="li1"><div

of rye crackers </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you notice the light in the kitchen is on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re not sure how something so goofy

class="de1">&gt;you finish the whole bag of crackers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;when you go to brush off your shirt and toss the wrapper you hear a wet rapid licking sound </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;guess you&#039;re out of jam too</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;okay time to start getting ready for bed</div></li><li

clean jam jar in her hands</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;good sweet goop!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;did.....you make?</div></li><li class="li1"><div

is</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you think about taking her sometime but the mental image of you having to explain to a store clerk why your girlfriend demolished the candy isle makes you reconsider</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;wait.....girlfriend?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you shake your head, what are you thinking? you just met her and besides she&#039;s like a giant 5 year old you could never.....</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the a/c clicks on snapping you out of your thoughts</div></li><li class="li1"><div

her head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;no....I keep myself nice and.......clean</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re not sure how but you temper your curiosity</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its probably something you don&#039;t need to know right before going to sleep</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you go and take a shower, almost immediately you feel better and more clear headed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the heat you felt earlier just seems to melt away under the water</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Drying off and tossing on some pajamas you go to say goodnight</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s already curled up on the living room couch, it looks like she fished that jam jar out of the bin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s holding it like a stuffed animal</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you shake your head and turn off the lights</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you wake up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you honestly can&#039;t remember if you were having a bad

panic</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its her, its just her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she gets to her feet, her wings twitching behind her</div></li><li

sleeping too</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you tell her to stay put and you&#039;ll go get some water for her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you wonder if she might need a bedtime story</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you walk back into your room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s in your bed</div></li><li class="li1"><div

single gulp</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you feel a little hot all of a sudden</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she opens her mandibles and daintily laps it up with her long dark tongue</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you lay on top of the covers next to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you try and ignore how weird this all is</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she finishes her water and sets it down on the bedside table</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you ask if she could get the lights</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;there&#039;s a struggle, you hear something fall to the floor with a clatter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hear a cord pop out from a socket and the room goes dark</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;looks like you&#039;ll need to explain how electric lights work too</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after a few minutes you finally start to relax</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;hey.....still awake?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;looks like it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I just wanted to say thank you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;thank you for putting up.....with me</div></li><li class="li1"><div

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her voice, she&#039;s not pausing as much anymore it doesn&#039;t sound as forced</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you compliment her on the improvement</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you feel a buzz through the bed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I&#039;ve never talked this much....before</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it helps</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you close your eyes, you can&#039;t hold back any more</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you

class="de1">&gt;you start feeling a bit embarrassed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re about to apologize when you feel the covers shift and a hand rest on your shoulder</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can&#039;t see much but you know she&#039;s looking at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hear her take a deep breath, it sounds a little like a soft whistle</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I was at my.......home since I was little</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I didn&#039;t move much then</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I.......remeber it being dark a lot, and when it wasn&#039;t there were.........others</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;they were......big......shapes that would move around me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;and when they........left it would be dark agian</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;besides that I remember.......eating......growing...and not much else</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its hard to......explain but I didn&#039;t think...the same.....back then</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she pauses taking another breath, you feel her move a little closer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as I grew things got......brighter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I could move and sense things around me</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;everything started to feel clearer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the big things stoped coming then</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I was confused......at first, I didn&#039;t know what I was doing or where I was</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it took me.......along time to even find a way out, and when I did I was too scared to take it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I started getting hungry, but there were these sliver things......cans</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was faint but........I could smell them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I would just crush them in my mouth, I had no idea what they were but they tasted soooo good</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;and there was water too but.....but...b...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she starts to trail off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she tries to take another breath and you feel her body shudder</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re a little shocked, you&#039;ve never heard her seem so lucid before</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hear her start to talk agian, but all that comes out is what sounds like a rough wheeze.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;worried you start to get up to see if she&#039;s okay but she lightly pushes you back down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;sorry.....it..gets....hard.....</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you sigh, relaxing a little</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you still have so many questions</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hit the remote to the overhead fan and crawl under the covers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you feel her move a little, another one of her hands wraps around you, and you start to press up against her rough body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its weird, and a little uncomfortable but you can&#039;t bring yourself to push her away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hear a soft buzzing as you fall asleep</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you wake up feeling sweaty and sore, you honestly feel kinda funny</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;weird dreams agian</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;there&#039;s a little light coming through the blinds </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you try to move to check the clock but something painfully tugs your hair</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you reach up to your head and feel a hard &quot;hand&quot; in our hair</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;oh right, you had a bedbug last night</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you carefully give her hand a few tugs </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it won&#039;t budge, the scales on her hands are like velcro</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she starts to stir, she tries to stretch nearly wacking your head against the head board</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she stops startled, noticing you hanging off her hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she lets out what you think is an apologetic buzz and wiggles her hand a little</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its a little painful but you feel the grip loosening</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you wonder just how much control over her body she has</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;finally you start to feel it come all the way out </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you give one last pull getting free and nearly fall off the bed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she catches you pulls you back over to herself sneaking the two of you back,under the covers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;sorry about......that........my hands can.......grip.........pretty well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you want to finish.......the.....story?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s waiting for a response but somethings off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you feel weird </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your whole body feels hot and the room feels uncomfortably stuffy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the fan is still blowing but the air feels heavy it like its getting hard to breathe</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you mumble something about needing some water and crawl out of bed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it almost feels like you&#039;re drunk, as you stumble a bit before finding the door and making your way to the bathroom</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you pull out a dixe cup and down a few shots of tap water before taking a seat on the side of the tub</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can&#039;t really discribe it, you don&#039;t really feel sick just hot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hear a skittering sound and your impromptu roommate pops up beside you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you okay?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you do your best to tell her you&#039;re fine but she obviously knows somethings up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she leans in her antenna brushing up against your cheek</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she moves back a little tilting her head from side to side</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you smell.......nice</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you always smell good......but this is........different</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she leans back into you, forcing you to reach out for something to hold on to</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s practically sitting in you lap at this point</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the air in the small room starts to get stuffy as you feel that same heat from earlier</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s scanning you up and down with her antennae her movements starting to seem increasingly stiff and robotic</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;one of her sets of arms wraps around you causing the two of you to slide into the tub</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you barley manage to avoid wacking your head on anything</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;letting out a strained grunt to try and force her off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she tightens her hold on you pressing you into her hard lithe body </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you forgot how strong she could be</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you lay like that for some time stareing into her huge emotionless eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her mandibles opening and closing inches from your face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it feels like you&#039;re buring up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as calmly as possible you try and talk to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you don&#039;t get any response</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you ask if she could let you up for a minute</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you see her head shake a little but she doesn&#039;t let up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you grimace as you feel her claws start to dig into your back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with her free hands she starts pawing at your shirt </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you let out a gasp as her claws tear through the fabric cutting into your chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she starts to get more and more animated her whole body twitching and jerking as she tears at your clothes </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you cry out for her to stop, she&#039;s practically mauling you at this point</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;even with the pain its getting harder and harder to think, it&#039;s like you&#039;re trapped in some sort of fever dream </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you feel like you&#039;re almost.....excited</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;an increasingly loud tapping snaps you out of your trance</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;looking down in horror you see her stinger slam into the floor of the tub, her entire thorax curled up in a striking position</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it comes down agian leaving behind strands of a sticky clear fluid</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its getting increasingly close to your crotch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;giving it your all you try one last time to break free</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with a loud tearing sound you manage to pull your arm free, leaving most of your sleeve hanging from her exoskeleton</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you desperately grope around for something to grab onto </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you find one of the knobs and hold onto it, trying to pull yourself up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with a metallic creak it turns in your hands sending down a cascade of cold water from the shower head above</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the water seems to clear the air and you feel yourself start to cool off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;using your free hand you manage to pry the gaint bug off your chest putting a few inches of space between the two of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;disturbingly she dosent even seem to notice, continuing to &quot;hump&quot; the floor of the tub</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you sit there transfixed by the freakish sight untill finally she starts to slow down </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with one final slow thrust her entire body shudders to a halt like some kind of huge wind up toy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;at this point you don&#039;t really know what to do</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s clearly not well but your mind is screaming at you to run the hell out of there</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;suddenly she pokes her head up </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you get ready to bolt but she just stays there looking at you, water dripping down her face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she takes a minute looking around the room before turning back to you </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;did....you fall?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she tries to stand up in the tub slipping in the water and landing on top of you with a splash </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you feel a sharp pain in your leg </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;looking down you see the end up her abdomen pressing into your thigh</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you start to go numb</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;sliding down into the tub the last thing you notice before closing your eyes is the strange oily sheen of the water</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you wake up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you immediately wish you hadn&#039;t</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a combination of pain, numbness, and that feeling you get when you take a bad nap hit you like a truck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you lay there feeling like crap while your brain tries to catch up with whatever the hell is going on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the last thing you remember was passing out in the bathroom after the giant wasp you let into your house tried to do &quot;something&quot; to you </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;now you&#039;re......</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;wait where are you exactly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its too dark to see much but you&#039;re definitely not in the bathtub anymore</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;on top of that you can&#039;t tell for sure but it almost feels like somethings on you, pressing you down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;even with how surreal this situation is you can&#039;t help but think that this is totally the part where the facehugger comes in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after a little more time waiting for feeling to come back to your limbs you try and wiggle yourself free</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you rub up against something soft bumping it over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with a light thud wherever you are collapses on your face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;blinking a few times to get used to the light you pull yourself out of the wreckage and try to get your bearings</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it looks like you&#039;ve been sleeping in the gaint wasp version of a pillow fort</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you really hope that newspaper scrubs out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;getting back to priorities, you realize you&#039;re buck naked save for some more papermache spread around your chest and arms with a particularly big clump on your leg</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;oh right....that&#039;s where she got you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;unable to fully stand you pull one of the fallen couch cushions under you and take a seat and stretch out your leg</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;bracing yourself you gently pull back the makeshift bandage praying you aren&#039;t about to kill yourself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it stings but you manage to get a good look</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the wound is swollen and a little discolored but its more a small cut than the human hole punch you were afraid of</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she must have only gotten you with the tip, still the fact such a little sting put you down is concerning in its own right</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;either way you feel slightly better now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;pressing the paper back down you relax a bit and look up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s right above your head </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you don&#039;t know how long she&#039;s been there but you really hope you aren&#039;t about to get a repeat of earlier</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;taking a deep breath you try and talk to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the words catch in your throat as you see her claws come out of the plaster and she starts to fall towards you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with a buzz that shakes the room her wings fold out and she starts to fly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its not exactly an elegant sight as she repeatedly rams into the wall as she lowers herself to the floor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she lands on top of you like a black and yellow battering ram sending you both sprawling out across the floor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s all over you and for a second you think your about to get shanked agian</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but as the buzzing dies down you realize she&#039;s saying something</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;yes yes yes yes yes yes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she keeps repeating in a quiet strained voice as her hands run over your body poking and proding you </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;not dead.....not dead....not dead....not dead</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you reach out to try and calm her down but to

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she doesn&#039;t continue, you can only imagine how many times she&#039;s run this though her head as she waited for you to wake up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;carefully you try and get to your feet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you still feel like you&#039;ve been on an all day road trip but you&#039;re happy to move agian</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;bracing yourself on a bookshelf you try to stretch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after a few satisfying/concerning pops and cracks you stand up straight and walk over to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can tell she&#039;s nervous around you but you rest your hand on her shoulder keeping her steady</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its hard to wrap your head around all everything but you know none of this has been easy for her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; few days ago she was living in a shack on a diet of half cooked game meat and candy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;then you just barged in and pulled her into your life in a world she had only ever known through old magazines and free newspapers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you wrap your arms around her and tell her your sorry for making her worry</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she lets out a confused buzz but she doesn&#039;t move away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you stand there with her untill she starts to relax her buzzing slowly fading out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you feel her arms slide around you and with a slight tug she pulls you off your feet </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she carries you over to the pile of pillows gently laying you down after setting up a little bed with her free hands</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she crouches down next you </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;can I get you anything</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re about to tell her you&#039;re fine when you realize how dry your throat is </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;feeling bad about asking anything of her you try and get up but she gently pushes back down wagging a finger at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you relent quietly asking for some water</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after some loud clattering she comes back with an entire pitcher proudly presenting it to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;too thirsty to care you take it thanking her profusely</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you down half of it in a matter of seconds setting it down with a burp that makes both of you burst out laughing or &quot;happily vibrating&quot; in her case</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;settling down the two of you sit together on your little bed pile</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;outside the sun starts to set slowly filling the room with pinkish orange light</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you sit there with her silently watching the day end </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;slowly you move up next to her taking one of her hands </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she looks down at you and before you know it you&#039;ve pulled her into a kiss</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you pull back blinking</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;what the hell did you just do</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s staring at you her mandibles agape</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;slowly she reaches up to the spot where you kissed her </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you sit there stammering, trying desperately to think of something to say</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you never get the chance</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;before you can even blink she has you in her arms holding you tightly to her hard chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;this time she&#039;s kissing you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her mandibles lock around your face pinching your cheeks, you feel her tounge enter your mouth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its the strangest thing you&#039;ve ever felt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the way it feels, the way it moves, the way it tastes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;and it keeps coming, spreading across your own tounge and filling your mouth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her grip starts to get tighter, you can feel the air being pressed out our you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you realize you can&#039;t breathe</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you try and struggle but she&#039;s like a vice</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;just as you really start to panic she repeats loosening her grip a,d letting you fall back on the cushions</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you lay there gasping for air as she looms over you, saliva dripping down her mouth parts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with every breath a familiar heat starts to enter your body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can feel it in the air, that same strange humidity from this morning</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its coming from her, radiating off her body like a fine light mist</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you take a deep breath</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you want her more than anything in the world</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she slowly starts to lower herself over you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you let out a gasp as her cool exoskeleton presses against your exposed skin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can hear her claws tear into the cushions around you as she pulls herself over you getting into position</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the chemical scent in the air grows stronger, you don&#039;t know how much longer you can just lay there</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as she adjusts her position the dark inner plating of her thighs starts to rub over your cock</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;small stiff hairs teasing your increasingly sensitive tool</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her movements are stiff and slow, nothing like the manic energy you&#039;re used too form her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you don&#039;t know if this is her way of staying in control of her own impulses but its starting to get to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;finally she brings her crotch down, your tip pressing into her smooth dark nethers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;finally giving in to your own impulses you wrap your arms around her and thrust into her depths</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;only to have your cock slide up against her underbelly leaving a trail of warm pre</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;confused you pull back and thrust again and again at where you know SOMETHING has to be</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the pheromones in the air robbing you of complex thought, you pull back and stare at her pleadingly letting out an pathetic whine</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she brings a finger to your lips, shushing you and gently pushing your head back down </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you swear you can hear her giggle as she starts to move agian crawling up and over your prone body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;dazed, horny, and confused you start to look around, your addled mind trying and failing to get a grip on the situation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;finally a tearing sound catches your attention and you look down between your legs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your heart skipping a beat as you see her abdomen pulling close, her stinger tearing though fabric as it nears your genitals</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you try and scramble away but your back runs up against the rough stone of your fire place</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;sensing your panic she slows down bringing her lower set of arms down around your shoulders </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;gently she starts to run her hands up and down your back, the tips of her claws lightly pressing in to your muscles </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re not sure what she&#039;s doing but she keeps at it, going up and down in smooth fluid motions you didint even know she was capable of</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she starts to move up to your head her fingers gently gliding though your hair, massaging your scalp careful not to get her Velcro like hairs tangled with your own</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;between the increasing pheromone filled air and the rhythmic massage your mind finally gives up and you relax into her arms desperately aroused yet oddly comfortable.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she caresses your head pressing you against her upper thighs, blocking out the rest of the room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you feel something press up against your cock and starts to slowly slide up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;something wet starts to drip down your shaft</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it stops at your tip lightly pressing down on it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with a loud schlick you enter her for the first time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her whole body goes ridged, you let out a gasp as her thighs clamp around your head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you feel the muscles in her abdomen tighten as well trapping you in place from both ends</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her insides felt alien, it was an almost cold sensation broken up by small waves of warm sticky liquid that left your skin tingling</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she begins to push down on you sliding you both off the wall and down into the covers, her smooth null &quot;crotch&quot; rubbing against your face as your cock continues to throb helplessly inside her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her body starts to tremble, the walls of her abdomen pulling even tighter around your member</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after a few seconds she relaxes and you feel her move above you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can hear something pierce the fabric around you and she stiffens as if to brace herself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;then she starts to vibrate</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its almost gentle at first, a smooth buzz running through both your bodies</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she keeps it going, getting more and more intense</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can feel you body start to protest as the room itself starts to shake</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the vibrations start to travel down her body into her abdomen </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you let out a stammering gasp any discomfort forgotten</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her walls squeeze and pulse around your cock, while the vibrations rock you to your core</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you start to moan, the vibrations turning it into a long drawn out sigh</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you don&#039;t know if your body can even take all this but you&#039;re well beyond caring at this point</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with a massive jolt that causes you to nearly scream out in.....well you couldn&#039;t even say, her body hits you with the biggest wave yet before going still</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as the last of the vibrations run their course you start to climax </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it goes on for what seems like forever a warm low pulse that sends everything you have into her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as it finally ends and you lay there panting you realize all you can feel is relief</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Police this morning have reported yet another.....&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wake up to the tv blaring and something hard jabbing you in the side.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;shielding your eyes from the sunlight now streaming in through the windows you fumble around eventually pulling the remote out from under you and hitting the mute button</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you flop back down only and trun away from the windows trying to get some more sleep</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;two massive compound eyes are looking right at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;oh yeah you two........</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;oh shit what the hell did you do!?</div></li><li

Sugar wasp update</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;okay you&#039;re starting to get restless now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;

complete with two very large scoops of cinnamon-sugar minus the cinnamon along with two tall glasses of ice water</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you promise yourself that you&#039;ll cook her a real meal next time and make your way back to your little love nest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s sitting up now doing something with her.....oh..ohhh</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;blushing you set the food down on the coffee table not sure what to say</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;for once much to your surprise she doesn&#039;t immediately pounce on you or the food, seemingly content with.....exploring her body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can&#039;t help but watch as she runs her hands over her &quot;vagina&quot; letting out a happy buzz each time a finger slides inside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;moving a bit closer she finally notices you </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;you knooooow what&#039;s weird?&quot; She asks without even looking up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I didint even know what this felt  like untill now&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;suddenly she&#039;s on her feet and right up in your face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;and then there&#039;s this thing&quot; she says as you feel a long, slick, wet claw glide around the base of your rapidly hardening member</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;oh yeah pants, you knew you were forgetting something.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she brings her face close, spreading open her mandibles and letting her unnaturally long tounge slide out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the flared tip presses against your lips its hairs tickling your nose</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you close your eyes and go in for a kiss </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;WHAT IS THAT!?&quot;

spikes and claws have gotten hopelessly tangled in the sheets </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as you burst out laughing she lets out a little cry and tries to roll away only serving to turn her into a bug burrito</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its not funny she pouts in a crackly voice as you sit down and and start to unravel her still chuckling to yourself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it was a good morning</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after the two of you finish your breakfast shenanigans you finally go about getting your day started</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you have your clothes on, washed your face, took some generic acetaminophen, and put up the dirty dishes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re ready to be a functioning member of society</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;now to see if you can help a gaint wasp lady do the same</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the two of you spend some time cleaning up after yourselves, washing the sheets and getting to work on the mess in the livingroom</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she seems almost sad when you start to disassemble the collapsed pillow fort</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it was a good little nest, she says watching as you sort out the damaged and soggy cushions </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you finish and she picks up the huge stack and starts to carry it back to the laundry room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she turns back to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ill make an even better one next time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once that&#039;s all wrapped up for the time being you reach the most difficult chore of the day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;grocery shopping</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;which means leaving her here alone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after a quick break for drinks you take her by the hand and lead her around the house </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;this time showing her everything, doing your best to make her feel at home</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;satisfied, you head to the door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as you&#039;re about to leave you pause and look her in the eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after a awkward pause you tell her you need to get something off your chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;listen, I&#039;ve loved having you here the past few days but I realize this was all kind of sudden</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I just sort of pulled you into my home without asking you permission and I wanted to say sorry for that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;if you ever feel uncomfortable, or homesick please tell me and I&#039;ll do whatever I can to get you back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I don&#039;t want you to feel trapped here </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after another awkward silence she leans in, pinching your nose with the tips of her mandibles</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;once its clear you got the message she relents pulling you into a bear(bug?) hug</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;ve done so much for me you silly little pink thing and I&#039;ve been such a.......bother, she says glancing back at her stinger</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;anyone else.....look....just don&#039;t start saying stuff like that ok?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you plant a kiss in between her inner eyes and apologize</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she slowly lets you back down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you know if either of you exchange any more sappy lines you&#039;ll spend the rest of the day laying around cuddling</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;and as appealing as that sounds you do need to eat some real food</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you look her in the eyes and promise her you&#039;ll be back as soon as possible before walking out the door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you pause a moment in the driveway taking in the dismal state of your car door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you get in and take a (thankfully) dry seat, starting the car and pulling down the driveway</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you see her in the window as you pull out onto the street, you give her a wave as you drive off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the fresh air flowing in as you drive perks you up a bit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as you pull onto the main road it occurs to you you&#039;ve been feeling a little foggy today you just haven&#039;t really noticed it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a side effect of whatever your &quot;nestmate&quot; was pumping out into the air yesterday maybe</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you push it from your mind and try to focus on the road but your thoughts keep drifting back to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;was it really okay to leave her all alone I mean......</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No, you have to stop thinking like that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she can be a little off sure, but she&#039;s not stupid and she&#039;s not just some wild animal</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you know she can take care of herself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you have nothing to worry about.......</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she stands there watching as his car disappears from view</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the house is quiet, she is alone agian</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it is a strange feeling, the sudden lack of stimulation after so many days of insanity</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a small part of her realizes she hasn&#039;t moved in quite some time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her thoughts slowly dim as she stands there, fixated on the road below</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;something moves next to her breaking the trace, a large roach making its way down the wall</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;instinctively, a hand juts out crushing the bug with a wet pop</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she hastily scarfs the roach down licking her hand clean</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after a nice stretch she looks around still coming out of her daze</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A small digital clock sitting near a box full of old travel supplies shows the time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she grabs her antennae in frustration, she had been standing there for nearly two hours</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she rushes into the other room trying to get her mind going again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she paces around the living room cursing her own lack of focus</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a few days with another living creature and already falling into passivity and instinct</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;ooookaaaay okayyyy&quot; she says outloud, stretching out the words to flex her throat muscles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;stay........focused....</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;grabbing the remote she flicks on the t.v. and starts going though channels</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;struggling to hold onto the smooth plastic, she accidentally digs a claw into one of the rubber buttons and down into the plastic below with a crunch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the tv pops to a strange station, a nearly blank blue screen with a small black box in the middle</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;oh.....shit&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;fearing the worst she frees her digit as carefully and non destructively as possible and runs over to the small television</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;work....don&#039;t break....oh please......don&#039;t break&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;cautiously she tries pressing a few buttons, inadvertently turning up the volume</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;oh!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it was a music station</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as the the room filled with the soft music of instruments she had no names for, her panic subsided</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;placing the remote down, she crawls onto the couch contemplating her situation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she lays there listening to the tune</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its different than than the music she used to listen to in her home, more complex and meloudius </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it gives her something to think about something to keep her mind going</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it feels so odd living like this. So relaxed and unburdened by the outside world </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it would be so easy to lose it all, the skills she spent her whole life learning,</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;to let it all go and fall back onto instinct </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but no, she has never fully understood what she is but she knows that passivity does not suit her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she has the beginnings of a real life now, a life with another living thinking creature</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her whole conscious existence she has forced herself to be better, the pressure of survival and isolation pushing her to find something better</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;now that she has it she will not let complacency overtake her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she holds a up a hand, the afternoon sun making the chitinous pads on her palm seem almost translucent </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she still had so much to learn, about herself and about the outside world </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;so no she would not stop here</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she would keep reading, keep practicing speech, keep learning, keep advancing </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she would make this new life work, she would not be a burden to her saviour, she would go to bed each night pressed against his warm soft body knowing all was right In the world</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a name, her mandibles twitched as she flexed her &quot;vocal chords&quot; I need a name</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Side story part 1</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hello Professor Yeo,</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I just wanted to update you on the situation here at site A</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the property is perfect for our needs and should serve as comfortable place for the team to lay low while things blow over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;we&#039;ve already converted the back few rooms into an adequate lab space and Lucas and Paul are working on getting the steel shed put together by the end of the week</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the kids are all in good health and while we haven&#039;t noticed any aberrant behavior so far I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll appreciate being able to settle down for a bit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;I know these have been hectic times for the project but I want you to know we&#039;re all behind you one hundred percent.

going back to the &quot;real world&quot; after the pure insanity of the past few days</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;looking around at a red light you see people, human people going about their day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;no giant bug monsters, no near death experiences, just the regular sights and sounds you&#039;ve know you&#039;re whole life</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as you drive on, you try to keep your mind off of just how insane your life is now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;out of the house and away from it all it almost seems silly now, like some crazy fever dream</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;like you&#039;ll get home and it&#039;ll all be back to normal, your sofa will be in one piece, your walls won&#039;t be covered in paper mache, and there won&#039;t be a makeshift bandage wrapped around your leg</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;ll eat dinner, go to bed, and go to work in the morning the exact same way you&#039;ve done for the past six years</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you take a turn into the grocery store parking lot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but no here you are going shopping for two, a very sweet, very strange girl waiting for you at home</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you smile to yourself as you park the car</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;thinking about her is almost addicting, her smooth cool body pressing against you, the cute clicking sounds she makes when she messes up trying to talk, that little glint her eyes get when the light is just right...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;really, despite everything you just can&#039;t help but feel like you&#039;re the luckiest guy on earth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;okay, crackers </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;check</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;canned salmon </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;check </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;eggs </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;check</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;milk</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;check</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you go down your shopping list as you push your cart up to the cashier </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you have tonight&#039;s dinner all planned out and have a pretty good idea what the meal plan for the rest of the week is going to be</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;that poor girl isn&#039;t going to live off raw meat and old candy on your watch!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after checking out you go out to your car optimistic for the evening ahead </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;while loading up the cooler in your trunk you momentarily consider what state your house will be in when you get back but you decide it really doesn&#039;t matter at this point anyway </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re in this for the long haul and you&#039;re going to need to learn how to roll with the punches </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;still, on the way home you stop in at the hardware store and spend about an hour grabbing all the essentials for basic home repairs and upkeep </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as well as some more esoteric items that might come in handy later</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;finally you pull back up your own driveway almost a full hour later</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;traffic had been horrendous getting home, it seemed nearly every major road to your house had a wreck and a small army of cops running around </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but hey you made it back and you&#039;re about to cook a beautiful woman the best meal of her life!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;what could possibly go wrong?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;grabbing as many of the bags as you can in one go you carefully unlock the door and step inside </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the house is dark and the living room tv is on some kind of classical music channel </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you flick on the lights as you head to the kitchen, surprisingly the house seems completely untouched </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you weren&#039;t expecting her to trash the place but with how excited she seemed you thought she&#039;d at least go exploring </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;in fact you can&#039;t find her at all as you peek around the house on your way back to the car</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;getting the rest of the groceries to the kitchen and locking up you notice the door to your room is open a crack and go peek in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s curled up peacefully in your bed several books wrapped up in the sheets</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;around her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you slowly open the door and tip to up next to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;its nearly pitch black in your room, the only light coming from the half open door and a what little can escape the blackout curtains</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;despite that however her body seems to have a soft shine to it as you kneel down next to the bed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as you try to bring yourself to wake her up one of her hands lifts from the bed and softly caresses your cheek</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;even as her head lies still you can feel the attention of her eyes shift to you as she draws your head into her arms</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;welcome home....I missed you</div></li></ol>        </div>

            RAW Paste Data        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">you take the last tray of the night out to cool
&gt;you sent everyone else home an hour ago to get ahead of the storm rolling in
&gt;you can already see the wind picking up outside
&gt;you pull off your gloves and check your phone
&gt;only 10 minutes till closing time
&gt;you head to the back to grab some cellophane wrap, you need to start putting stuff away in case the power goes out.
&gt;you&#039;re worrying about what to do with the frozen goods when you hear the door chime
&gt;one more customer it seems
&gt;you walk back to the counter freezing mid stride as a soft buzzing fills the room
&gt;oh god please not her, anyone but her
&gt;grimacing you slowly walk up to the front, you know she can sense you
&gt;making it to the register you see &quot;her&quot;
&gt;a worn and muddy wide collared trench coat with an ancient looking hat to hide her face
&gt;two floppy antennae poke up from crudely made holes in the hat, they perk up as you come into view.
&gt;everyone else thinks she&#039;s just a loon in a bug mask, so did you at first
&gt;but no its real, its all very real
&gt;she showed you one night after closing
&gt;she was waiting by your car 
&gt;as you got close she let the coat fall to the ground
&gt;four segmented arms moving in unison, a slender abdomen with deadly looking stinger
&gt;and those eyes, those blank dark eyes staring into yours
&gt;you think she knew you were scared, after what seemed like an eternity she coverd her face an ran off into the night leaving you alone in the dark parking lot
&gt;still she came back
Its always the same now
&gt;she comes in when there are no other customers takes an unhealthy amount of candy then rushes out the door after paying
&gt;she almost never speaks, when she does her voice is soft
&gt;but it sounds forced and unnatural like something desperately trying to sound human
&gt;she mainly just points or nods to what she wants letting out the occasional click or buzz
&gt;you nervously check your phone
&gt;its nearly time to close 
&gt;you tap your foot and try to keep your eyes off her
&gt;you make candy, bugs have been a constant problem for you since ants took over your familys kitchen as a kid
&gt;but they were always something you could deal with, something small
&gt;now one could bite your head off
&gt;finally she finishes her selection
&gt;you wonder if somethings going on, she&#039;s usually much quicker
&gt;you start to ring her up when something grabs your wrist
&gt;one of her other arms
&gt;its all you can do to not scream
&gt;she looks at you her mouth parts slowy moving almost like she&#039;s trying to say something
&gt;she pushes something into your hand and runs out the door
&gt;looking at your hand you let out a sigh
&gt;you put the wad of bills into the register
&gt;she always pays too much and never waits for her change
&gt;you see her outside fighting against the wind
&gt;she looks cold
it takes almost an extra hour to finish cleaning up
&gt;so much for closing time
&gt;you switch off the lights and step into the cold
&gt;the storms really picked up, the wind could probably knock you on your ass if you let it
&gt;you manage to get to your car turning on the heat and head off towards home
&gt;the roads are deserted but it feels like you could crash at any moment
&gt;the rain is coming down in sheets you can barely see
&gt;suddenly you hit a huge puddle in the middle of the road
&gt;you feel your car start to slide as you struggle to keep a grip on the wheel
&gt;you spin to a stop on the side of the road, your headlights illuminating the small lake you just drove through
&gt;you&#039;re about to head out when you see it
&gt;a bag from your store floating in the water a few pieces of candy dissolving around it
no.....no it can&#039;t be
&gt;you pull on your hood and slowly get out if the car
&gt;you pick up and look inside the bag, the receipts still there
&gt;its dated less than an hour ago
&gt;you start looking around for anything else when you see it
&gt;the back of a beige trench coat sticking out of the mud on the other side of the road
&gt;shit shit shit
&gt;without even thinking you run out across the street soaking yourself completely
&gt;you reach the coat, she&#039;s still in it
&gt;frantically you pull her head out of the water and lean her on the curb
&gt;she&#039;s not moving, her whole body feels stiff
&gt;you pull off the waterlogged coat before recoiling in shock
&gt;goddamn it 
&gt;you can&#039;t help it, her body just seems wrong somehow
&gt;you close your eyes and pick her up
&gt;you can&#039;t just leave her here
&gt;she&#039;s so light, you nearly loose your grip on her
&gt;you trudge back to your car 
&gt;as you reach the door she starts twitching and sputtering in your arms
&gt;she starts to lash out at you 
&gt;you feel a rough hard fist slamming into your gut
&gt;she leaps from your arms clicking and buzzing wildly
&gt; you starts to charge at you
&gt;you practically leap into your car slamming the the door behind you
&gt;you hear popping sound and look to see a dagger like stinger protruding from your car door, missing your leg by inches
&gt;you look up just in time to see her reel before shattering your car window raining glass on you
&gt;then she just stops
&gt;she stands there staring at you
&gt;she slowly starts backing away her stinger sliding out of your car door with a scrunch
&gt;she starts to run away but she seems slow now her manic energy gone
&gt;she wobbles a bit before falling back against your car
&gt;you&#039;re pretty sure you just wet yourself
what the hell are you going to do now?
&gt;you carefully peek out the window she seems down for the count
&gt;you&#039;re tempted to just drive off but something holds you back
&gt;you took biology in school if you leave her here she might drown
&gt;you just can&#039;t bring yourself to do that
&gt;even to a big bug person thing
&gt;you get out and pick her up, gently slideing her into your back seat
&gt;you pause and then go over to collect her coat
&gt;there&#039;s still a relatively dry bag of candy in one of the pockets
&gt;you can&#039;t seem to find her hat
&gt;heading back to the car you shake out some of the water then lay it down on the floor board beside her
&gt;you hop in and crank up the engine driving off as wind and rain whistle through your ventilated door
&gt;well now what
&gt;you had a gaint half drowned bug passed out in your back seat
&gt;where were you going to go
&gt;was she even still alive, you can&#039;t even tell if she&#039;s breathing or not
&gt;you pull off into a residential street and park on the curb
&gt;you flick on the overhead light and turn around to check on her
&gt;you never really noticed before but she looks like some kind of wasp
&gt;without her coat she&#039;s completely naked save for what look like bandages wrapped around her chest
&gt;you look her up and down but can&#039;t see anything wrong with her
&gt;with the cold and the wind she might have simply collapsed in the storm
&gt;you remember the makeshift bug traps you made as a kid, you guess even gaint wasps can&#039;t handle too much water.
&gt;you sigh and look back over her still form
&gt;its strange but in the dim orange light of the car her strange body almost seems beautiful
&gt;you pull off one of your gloves and reach out to her but stop yourself at the last second
&gt;you sit back down in your seat with a squelch, the rain forming a nice little puddle in your lap
&gt;you put your car into gear and pull out the surviving bag of candy popping it open
&gt;behind you a pair of antennae start to twitch
taking out a peice you look it over
&gt;its some of the hard candy you made for new years, probably the last of the batch
&gt;you&#039;re about to put it in your mouth when you notice something move out of the corner of your eye
&gt;she&#039;s up and she&#039;s looking right at you
&gt;she tilts her head inquisitively her antenna moving around sensing the air
&gt;she looks away from you and starts scanning the car, you get the impression she&#039;s still a little out of it
&gt;you move a little in your seat causing her to snap back to you
&gt;she slowly starts moving closer 
&gt;you hold up the price of candy in front of her
&gt;she stops her antennae both point at 
your hand
&gt;faster than you can blink one of her clawed hands dart out staching away from you and bringing it to her face
&gt;a chill runs down your spine as her mouth parts split open like some kind of organic puzzle box
&gt;a long forked tongue slides out coverd in barbs
&gt;holding the candy in her hands she starts loudly licking it
&gt;you turn away more than a little disturbed
&gt;its going to be a long night
you sit there getting rained on
&gt;you&#039;re too nervous to move 
&gt;so you sit there, just holding the bag of candy as your passenger loudly slurps them down behind you
&gt;whenever she finishes one she quickly grabs another
&gt;finally just when you think you&#039;re about to get hypothermia she finishes
&gt;she takes the bag from your hand and you can hear the tearing of paper as she kicks up every stray grain of sugar
&gt;in the calmest tone you can manage you ask if she&#039;s okay and if she needs to go somewhere
&gt;it goes quiet
&gt;two arms grab you by the shoulders pinning you to the seat
&gt;you try to struggle but they have an inhuman grip to them and all you manage is too have her claws dig into your jacket
&gt;you feel her move in the back, something hard presses down on your head
&gt;you glance up up all you can see is a pair of mandibles inches from your skull
&gt;with one of her free &quot;hands&quot; she points down the road and clicks her mandibles together
&gt;you don&#039;t know if she&#039;s threatening you or not but youer not going to test it 
&gt;you hit the gas and speed off down the dark rainy road
&gt;you keep following her finger going down several left turns and back roads
&gt;you have no clue how she knows where she&#039;s going, you can barely even see the road
&gt;finally you reach a dirt road in the middle of nowhere
&gt;its practically a river of mud at this point but your back seat driver enthusiastically gestures too it
&gt;you power through, almost getting stuck several times but you make it to a grassy patch in the woods
&gt;you look out the window to see where you are
&gt;shit
&gt;you just drove to a fucking murder cabin
&gt;in the middle of nowhere
&gt;with a gaint wasp who punched a hole in your car like it was paper 
&gt;you......
&gt;your train of thought is interrupted as she lets go off you and starts bouncing in the back seat letting out a loud buzz
&gt;she leaps out of the car and runs to your side, grabbing you by the arm she nearly pulls pull you out of the window before you manage manage to get out
&gt;she starts rushing you to the door clearly uncomfortable in the cold rain
&gt;you can&#039;t really do anything to stop her as she shoves you inside and slams the door
&gt;its pitch black
&gt;you can feel her moving around you deeper into the darkness
&gt;you slowy start to step back to feel for the door when you step on something with a cruntch
&gt;suddenly you&#039;re blinded by a bright flickering light
&gt;you host has returned carrying a anceint looking oil lamp
&gt;she pushes you aside and leans over brushing whatever you just broke into a little pile in the corner
&gt;it looks disturbingly like bone
&gt;you take in your surroundings
&gt;its not much better looking than the outside. The walls and ceiling are coated with a brown paper like substance, you can make out what look like old bits of newspaper here and there
&gt;some water slowly seeps through into a cracked bucket on the floor
&gt;you look at the wasp lady as she finishes &quot;tidying up&quot;
&gt;she turns back to you and does a little .....dance? You&#039;re not sure
&gt;she takes you by the hand and pulls you deeper into the house down a dark hallway
&gt;you emerge into a much cleaner looking room 
&gt;an old well worn couch sits in the middle of the room surrounded by stacks old magazines and newspaper, an antique television with a broken screen leans against the wall
&gt;you look over the piles
&gt;its mostly housekeeping mags and the lifestyle sections from cheap local papers
&gt;some date back to the late 90s
&gt;before you can see much else she forces you onto the couch
&gt;you gulp as she stands over you her hands clasped together
&gt;she reaches down and pulls the bandages off her chest letting a pair of dark translucent wings fold out
&gt;she neatly folds the white cloth and puts it on one of the piles 
&gt;she shakes her wings getting the last of the water out before looking down at you
&gt;her mouth starts to move in an odd way and it sounds like she&#039;s trying to suck in air
&gt;you tense up getting ready to bolt
&gt;t......tvvvv?
&gt;wait what?
she walks over to the broken tv reaching into the shattered screen and pulling out a old plastic weather radio
&gt;with a click it comes to life, blaring static
&gt;you can almost hear someone talking through the hiss
&gt;she doesn&#039;t seem to mind and sets it back down into the tv set before walking over and flopping down next to you
&gt;you watch her carefully more bewildered that scared at this point
&gt;she seems to actually be enjoying the white noise, bobbing her head and clicking her mandibles as it goes up and down
&gt;the shock starting to fade you begin to notice other things in the dark house
&gt;mainly that it smells really bad
&gt;you don&#039;t know what it is but there&#039;s something stilfeing in the air
&gt;the more you think about it the more you start to feel sick
&gt;you cover your nose and mouth
&gt;she turns and looks at you her head tilted 
&gt;food?.....food!
&gt;she leaps up and runs out of the room taking the lantern with her leaving you with the darkness and radio static
&gt;you hear a bang and something open and close before the patter of claws on old wood start getting closer
&gt;she comes in holding two chunks of......something in her lower arms
&gt;the smell is over powering now
&gt;its some kind of meat and there&#039;s a bone sticking out of it you filp it over in your lap
&gt;one side is almost burnt while the other is raw and glistening
&gt;you let it fall to the floor
&gt;oblivious she digs into hers with glee, tearing off chunks and slurping them down
&gt;you really don&#039;t feel well
&gt;watching her eat, the way she tears the meat apart........
&gt;it gets to you
&gt;your mind starts bringing up old memories
&gt;books and pictures depicting desiccated corpses writhing with maggots, poor creatures laying helpless as parasites crawled within them
&gt;you start to shiver
&gt;she notices agian, is she watching you?
cold! She blurts out
&gt;she gently puts down her meal and grabs a chunk of paper from one if the piles molding it together she puts it in front of you and awkwardly lights it with the lantern
&gt;she sees your meat and takes 
&gt;she lets out a noise that sounds like a laugh and holds it up to your face
&gt;its.....its just too much 
&gt;you don&#039;t know why you&#039;ve played along with this, why you even helped her
&gt;but its too goddamn much
&gt;the smell of old meat and burnt moldy paper fill the air
&gt;you have to get out of here
&gt;you knock the meat away and run from the couch
&gt;in the dark room you slip on a story magazine falling back into a bigger pile 
&gt;you feel your ankle twist
&gt;you jump up but quickly trip again
&gt;you hear panicked buzzing behind you
&gt;You grit your teeth and get up running back the way you came
&gt;you can&#039;t see anything
&gt;no doors no windows no light
&gt;you&#039;re trapped
&gt;you freeze
&gt;you metallic clicking followed by the sound if rusty hinges
&gt;then footsteps
&gt;she&#039;s coming
&gt;you back into a wall with a third sending dust and what feels like more magazines skidding around you
&gt;her light shines into view
&gt;she&#039;s here
&gt;oh god you don&#039;t want to die like this
&gt;she walks over too you slowly
&gt;she takes your hand and presses something into it
&gt;you look down terrified
&gt;Its money
&gt;she stares at you for what seems like forever before backing away
&gt;she nods to something behind you
&gt;the door is right next to you
&gt;you look back at her
&gt;thank you....sorry to.....do this...to you she says so quietly you can barely make it out
what the hell is going on
&gt;you look down at the bills in your hand
&gt;old 50s and 100s the same she always pays with at the store
&gt;you notice something by your foot
&gt;one of her magazines
&gt;the cover is a slightly water damaged picture of a couple sitting in front of a fire place
&gt;you look around the floor 
&gt;they all have something similar, a family eating together in a fancy kitchen, a young couple laying out in front of a tv
&gt;it starts to dawn on you
&gt;was she trying to be nice to you
&gt;a thank you for saving her?
&gt;she notices you aren&#039;t moving
&gt;go? She says pointing towards the door
&gt;you keep looking around
&gt;everything here is old and worn
&gt;there&#039;s no power, no water, she doesn&#039;t seem to understand how things work
&gt;this dark shed is her whole world isn&#039;t it
&gt;Youer probably the first person she&#039;s ever brought here
&gt;she seems concerned now, she doesn&#039;t know what&#039;s going on
&gt;you.....okay.....did I.....hurt?
&gt;you slide down the old paper covered wall to the floor
&gt;mites crawl out from under you
&gt;with a startled buzz she runs to you
&gt;she reaches out but stops herself
&gt;sorry......I know ...I...scared you
&gt;you take her hand
you don&#039;t know what to say
&gt;you&#039;re exhausted, nervous, and a little guilty for being so afraid
&gt;you reassure her you&#039;re not hurt and that she dosent have to apologize
&gt;you give her back the money, you can tell she&#039;s confused
&gt;you thank her for her hospitality but you have to go now
&gt;killer or not you really need some fresh air
&gt;you crack the door and peek outside
&gt;the rains died down but the wind is still going strong
&gt;you go out into the cold walking towards your car
&gt;you reckon if you&#039;re careful you can make it back to the main road and use your GPS to go from there
&gt;as you reach the car you turn back to the small dilapidated house
&gt;she&#039;s standing in the doorway shivering, her lantern swinging in the wind
&gt;you&#039;re struck with a pang of guilt
&gt;can you leave her here
&gt;even if she&#039;s not human it can&#039;t be good to live like that, especially in this weather
&gt;she starts to head in, you make up your mind
&gt;sprinting to the door you catch it just in time
&gt;she looks at you startled 
&gt;you ask if she would like to come with you
&gt;her body goes stiff
&gt;her antennae start to move and her mouth parts open and close as if she&#039;s trying to say something but nouthing comes out
&gt;you wonder just how hard it is for her to talk
&gt;you&#039;re about to leave when she takes your hand and nods
&gt;the two of you rush back to your car through the rain 
&gt;a waterfall comes out of the drivers seat as you open the door
&gt;she tries to sit next to you but she can&#039;t seem to fit, after some struggle she gives up and lays down in the back her wings wacking against your seat as she drys herself
&gt;you start the engine and get going
&gt;you really hope you can find your way back
&gt;by the time you find the road you cars even more of a mess
&gt;maybe you should have kept that money after all
&gt;the storms dying down for real at least
&gt;you glance at your passenger
&gt;she seems oddly quiet and subdued
&gt;you wonder if somethings wrong, but you keep your focus on the road
&gt;eventually you make it back to familiar territory
&gt;you relax a little, you&#039;ll be home in a few minutes
&gt;you pull up your darkend driveway, you made it
&gt;you help her crawl out of the back seat and on their her feet
&gt;you lead her up to your porch, unlocking the door and holding it open for her, inviteing her inside
&gt;you flick on a light, showing off your living room, you smile a little as she nearly jumps into the air
&gt;her wings flap excitedly but she stops herself 
&gt;you ask her what&#039;s wrong
&gt;she turns around her mouth moving but no sound coming out
&gt;she looks down at her feet
&gt;you&#039;re getting worried when she finally speaks up
&gt;Why?......why did.... you....do....this?
&gt;you don&#039;t understand what she means
&gt;I..... know you....are...afraid
&gt;I know....I scare.......you
&gt;I can......smell
&gt;she points up to her antennae
&gt;after a moment of silence you gently put your hand on her shoulder
&gt;her skin is hard and warm
&gt;you tell her you just didn&#039;t understand her
&gt;you&#039;re not afraid any more
&gt;she looks up at you
&gt;you take her to your sofa and sit down she lays down next to her head resting on your arm
&gt;you sit like that for a while listening to the wind
&gt;you look down at her, you can&#039;t say for sure but you think she&#039;s asleep
&gt;you know back in the car when you first saved her you were right
&gt;her yellow and black body nearly shines in the light, and her large black eyes and alien face give her an strangely innocent look, like a kid in a costume
&gt;she really is beautiful
&gt;you slowly slide out from under her, finding a blanket to cover her
&gt;you cover her one last look before switching off the light and heading to bed
&gt;you open your eyes. you&#039;re in your bed
&gt;a pale light illuminates the room
&gt;you feel itchy
&gt;somethings wrong
&gt;you try to move but your covers hold you down
&gt;you can&#039;t see them but you can feel them
&gt;like your bed is filled with ants
&gt;crawling all over you
&gt;you manage to pull your arm free
&gt;you tear off the covers.....
&gt;you wake up
&gt;you&#039;re room is dark and empty, its still night
&gt;you fall back to sleep
&gt;you smell something strange
&gt;its familiar but you don&#039;t know what to call it
&gt;the air starts to feel heavy
&gt;you feel hot, you feel very hot
&gt;it feels like you&#039;re pouring sweat 
&gt;no matter what you do you can&#039;t get comfortable 
&gt;you wake up
&gt;its dawn
&gt;you get up and stretch
&gt;you look down
&gt;your covers and pillow lay in a heap at your feet
&gt;damn you just washed them
&gt;you toss them back on to the bed, you&#039;ll deal with that later
&gt;wait.......
&gt;you smell something, you vaguely recall a dream
&gt;but this is real
&gt;somethings burning
&gt;you rush down the stairs to the kitchen
&gt;you nearly have a heart attack
&gt;a giant wasp is standing over your stove
&gt;they seem to be turning it on and off letting the flames get as high as possible before switching them off, letting out a series of happy clicks and buzzes.
&gt;oh right
&gt;last night happend
&gt;you try and act as relaxed as possible
&gt;she notices you standing there and spins around
&gt;now that you think about it between those eyes and those antennae there&#039;s probably very little she doesn&#039;t notice
&gt;Hey! Morning! Made food!
&gt;she got her voice back it seems and......wait did she say food?
&gt;she rushes you to the table and runs back to the kitchen returning with two small chunks of meat on the ends of a stick, so that&#039;s what was buring
&gt;she lays out a bunch of paper towels in the middle of the table and rests the stick on it
&gt;she lays more paper towels out at her and your table spot 
&gt;she pulls out the stick and proudly drone the meat at your spot before sitting down with her own
&gt;you look over your &quot;meal&quot;
&gt;it looks like it was some kind of small bird, looking closely you notice it looks like the head was pulled off rather than cut .
&gt;you try and get up to get a plate and utensils but she holds out a hand
&gt;cut? 
&gt;she jumps up and walks over too you
&gt;she takes one of her long hand claws and and deftly cuts the bird into chunks 
&gt;she looks you proudly, Happy to...help!
&gt;at least it looks fully cooked this time
&gt;she eats hers in a single crunch and starts to chew on the paper towels
&gt;you take a bite
&gt;its a bit bland but edible
&gt;you sprinkle some salt on it
&gt;that&#039;s better
&gt;you glance up, she&#039;s looking at you funny
&gt;she points to the salt shaker, Sugar?
&gt;you hold it out for her to see
&gt;you tell her its called salt
&gt;Salllllllt? 
&gt;you nod encouragingly
&gt;she takes it from you, peering into the small glass bottle 
&gt;Smells....funny
&gt;she then screws the top off and pours the whole thing into her mouth
&gt;so this is your life now
&gt;your dining room is trashed
&gt;there are several new holes in your walls
&gt;your arms are cut to ribbons
&gt;you&#039;re covered head to toe in wasp vomit
&gt;and you&#039;ve spent the past 3 hours on your hands and knees on the bathroom floor playing nursemaid to a gaint bug who thought eating a whole bottle of salt was a good idea
&gt;you feel a weak tug on your sleeve
&gt;you switch on the hot water agian letting some more steam fill room
&gt;you need to be careful not to let it get too high
&gt;she takes a deep breath of the humid air before laying back in the tub
&gt;you sprinkle some root beer on your hand holding it out for her to lick up
&gt;her tounge looks almost burnt
&gt;you wince a little as one of those sharp hairs dig into your hand but you hold steady
&gt;she&#039;s starting to get her strengh back
&gt;after her initial freakout she collapsed and started spasming
&gt;getting her to water was just a lucky guess, you nearly drowned her yourself trying to get her to drink something
&gt;you silently pray there&#039;s no serious damage 
&gt;you wipe your hand off with a towel and get ready to let some more water into the tub
&gt;Hey......
&gt;you look down at her her voice is raspy
&gt;I.....don&#039;t.....think I...like...salt....very.....muuuu
&gt;she lets out a wheeze and tries to pull herself up nearly falling over
&gt;you grab her and help her out off the tub and on to the bathroom rug next to you
&gt;you get a damp towel ready and wrap it around her legs
&gt;she leans into you her antennae brushing against your face
&gt;I&#039;m...sorry...about......food
&gt;not saying anything, you hold her head in your lap and start gently rubbing her antennae
&gt;Oh......that......feels.....mmmm
&gt;you feel her relax in your arms
&gt;you slowly reach over, turning on the the hot water filling the room with a fresh cloud of steam
&gt;you keep massaging her antenna, smiling as they twitch whenever you find a sensitive spot
&gt;yep this is your life now
&gt;after another hour in the makeshift sauna she seems to be getting her strength back
&gt;you help her into the living room wrapping her towel around her neck and resting her on the sofa
&gt;you head to the kitchen, sighing as you pass what remained of your dining room
&gt;you peel and separate an orange for her putting it into a bowl and resting it on the floor near by
&gt;you tell her to relax while you start clean yourself up
&gt;she nods, reaching down and trying an orange slice
&gt;you laugh as her mandibles bite down a little too hard causing a mini juice explosion
&gt;letting out a few happy clicks she takes the bowl in her lap and goes to town
&gt;you&#039;re probably going to need to work down the couch later but its great to see she&#039;s getting back to her energetic self
&gt;you leave her to it and go the bathroom, you really need a shower
&gt;it takes nearly 30 minutes to get the last of the salty bug vomit off
&gt;looking at all your cuts you really hope you haven&#039;t contracted any strange infections
&gt;you dry off and get dressed
&gt;checking the clock its just about one thirty
&gt;you peel out into the living rokm, wondering if she&#039;s still hungry for lunch
&gt;the couch is empty and your front door is wide open
&gt;son of a bitch
&gt;you run outside, you don&#039;t see her anywhere
&gt;you hear a loud bang and run over to your driveway
&gt;you see a big yellow bug butt sticking out of your now overturned recycle bin
&gt;okay this is taking the whole wasp thing a little too far
&gt;you knock on the side of the bin
&gt;she shoots out like a bullet, stinger outstretched and buzzing angrily
&gt;her arms full of old newspaper
&gt;once she sees you she immediately calms down 
&gt;she clicks and gives you a thumbs up before rushing back inside
&gt;you just stand there dumbfounded
&gt;looking down your driveway you see a couple out walking their dog staring at you
&gt;you wave awkwardly, you wonder how much of that they saw
you slam your door shut
&gt;that was embarrassing
&gt;now what the hell is she up to
&gt;you find her sitting on the floor in the dining room
&gt;you hear a wet chewing noise
&gt;you walk up and give her a light tap
&gt;she turns and looks up at you, her mouth full of newspaper
&gt;you&#039;re not sure how to respond to this
&gt;she spits it out into her hands molding it into a ball
&gt;she leans over and presses it into one of the holes she put in the wall
&gt;she expertly smooths it out you can already see it drying 
&gt;she hops up and proudly gestures at her handiwork
&gt;Taaa daaa
&gt;instant paper mache huh
&gt;that&#039;s pretty handy as long as it holds.......waaait a second
&gt;is that what her house was coverd in
&gt;you REALLY don&#039;t want your home looking like a gaint bug nest
&gt;you politely tell her her you have some caulk in the back and that......
&gt;she&#039;s already done
&gt;she scoots by you and walks over to the table laying on its side
&gt;she reaches down under it with one hand, as if to pick it up
&gt;you tell her to hold on a second, that things pretty heavy and she&#039;s going to need help
&gt;with a yank she filps it up, grabbing it and spinning it around before letting it fall with a loud think
&gt;she looks at you questingnly
&gt;well then you guess you&#039;ll just pick up the small things then
&gt;looks like she&#039;s recovered at least
&gt;alright then, you drop the tablecloth into the laundry pile, time for lunch
&gt;your new housemate buzzes around you excitedly, as you take some things out of the fridge
&gt;you have no clue what wasps normally eat but she seems to really like meat
&gt;you figure burgers would be fine
&gt;she hovers over the ingredients, antennae brushing over them
&gt;you push her out of the kitchen telling her you have a surprise for her and she needs to wait outside
&gt;you shut the door crossing your fingers she won&#039;t do anything crazy while you&#039;re busy
&gt;you keep things simple, not much sesoning in the meat, and plain buns with a little lettuce and ketchup
&gt;you leave hers a little undercooked just in case
&gt;they aren&#039;t anything fancy but they should be better than what&#039;s she&#039;s used to
&gt;you bump the door open, calling out that lunch is ready
&gt;oh....she&#039;s right there
&gt;she tackles you, nearly knocking the plate out of your hands
&gt;if she was any heavier you would probably be on your ass right now
&gt;Hungry! Food! Thank you!
&gt;she snatches a burger looking it over for second before shoveing the whole thing in her mouth, sending bits of meat and bun everywhere
&gt;its gone in seconds, she looks back to the other one
&gt;you sigh and hold it out
&gt;she practically inhales it
&gt;you put the empty plate on the table when you feel her arms wrap around you
&gt;sooo.....gooooood
&gt;Thank.....you....salt.......made me...hungry
&gt;you smile and pat one of her hands
&gt;happy to help you tell her
&gt;you usually spend most most weekends out walking or at the local library
&gt;you really don&#039;t have much of a social circle beyond your employees so you don&#039;t have many commitments outside work
&gt;that being said you doubt waking around town with a giant wasp would go over well
&gt;while you try and come up with a plan you feel a tap on your shoulder
&gt;she&#039;s looking up and pointing out the window
&gt;Its going to.....rain
&gt;huh, you ask her what she&#039;s talking about
&gt;it was supposed to only be a little overcast today
&gt;she just points to her antennae
&gt;thinking about it you don&#039;t really want to debate her
&gt;you have no idea what those fuzzy things can actually do
&gt;ok then if you&#039;re gonna have a lazy Saturday what better way to spend then watching some movies!
&gt;you ask if she would want to watch some tv or something
&gt;her whole body starts to vibrate like one of those electric back massagers, letting out a low buzzing sound
&gt;tvvvvv? With....you? 
&gt;uh yeah, you tell her you have one in the back of the house
&gt;she lets out a quiet squeel
&gt;you blink and she&#039;s gone, you hear her call out from the back of the house
&gt;ready!
&gt;she really likes tv
&gt;you walk in and sit next to her 
&gt;you take out the remote, she seems confused
&gt;strange.....tvvvv
&gt;you click it on, the screen lights up a no connection alert is all that appears
&gt;oh yeah, you stopped paying for tv about a year ago
&gt;no worries you have a massive collection of old movies
&gt;lets see, Robo Cop, Terminator, Jurassic Park, old bond films, alien, aliens........
&gt;so yeah you&#039;re not really prepared to host a lady let alone an easily excitable wasp lady
&gt;ok you have one last trick up your sleeve
&gt;you apologize for the delay but you need to go get something
&gt;you&#039;re not sure she heard you she seems completely enamored with the no connection pop up which is now bouncing up and down the screen
&gt;has she ever even seen a working tv? you think to yourself
&gt;after some time digging around a closet you find it
&gt;your old converter box and a pair of bunny ears, she isn&#039;t the only one with antennae you chuckle to yourself
&gt;you have to pause for a moment to consider why your brain thought that was an acceptable thing to come up with
&gt;you walk back in, she&#039;s still staring at the screen
&gt;after a few trys the converter flashes green and you hit the input button untill you find the right one
&gt;you look back she&#039;s at the edge of her seat
&gt;your channels.....are.....bright
&gt;mine.....just.....noise
&gt;you sit back down, she&#039;s going to love this
&gt;you flip though the channels its mostly old sports clips
&gt;then you hear it
&gt;that theme song
&gt;no way it can&#039;t be that show cannot be still running
&gt;that shit was the bomb when you were a kid
&gt;hell you secretly watched it untill you were 12
&gt;you glance over to her
&gt;she looks like she might explode she&#039;s so excited
&gt;colors.....pictures......moving
&gt;the show starts to play
&gt;she&#039;s like a kid seeing a magic trick for the first time
&gt;you know you as weird as all this is always hoped you would find a girl who liked cheesy old cartoons
&gt;you gotta show her a movie later if she can handle it
&gt;you finish the episode and she seems to break out of her trance
&gt;she looks at you
&gt;more?
&gt;just then the theme starts up again 
&gt;looks like its a marathon
&gt;heck yeah
&gt;after a few more episodes you notice she&#039;s looking at you more and more
&gt;when the theme starts up agisn she slowly starts to lean over to you
&gt;before you know it her whole body&#039;s laying over your lap her head propped up on a cushion
&gt;looks like you&#039;re in it for the long haul now
&gt;oh my god
&gt;did you really just spend 5 hours watching pbs kids
&gt;you can&#039;t feel your legs 
&gt;you&#039;re still trapped 
&gt;you thought she was a bug not a cat
&gt;you gently shake her a little
&gt;she stirs, looking around before slowly climbing off you laying back down at the end of the couch
&gt;you speedwalk to the bathroom
&gt;after doing your business you take look out the window
&gt;its definitely raining
&gt;you wonder what she&#039;ll want for dinner
&gt;you hear a loud crunching sound as you walk back 
&gt;she&#039;s still curled up on the couch having somehow obtained a bag of rye crackers 
&gt;you notice the light in the kitchen is on
&gt;you&#039;re not sure how something so goofy can be so quick but you&#039;re not going to question it now
&gt;she takes another bite sending bits of cracker flying around the room
&gt;she holds out one to you
&gt;you tell her to hold on a second 
&gt;you grab some jam, a knife and a plate and head back 
&gt;you sit down next to her, taking a cracker and showing how to spread out the jam
&gt;she takes the craker and bites into it
&gt;ooooooooohhhhhhhh
&gt;sweet!
&gt;you make one for yourself
&gt;she takes the jar from you dumping on an excessive amount
&gt;she eats it in one loud crunch
&gt;noisy...food...huh, she says licking her fingers 
&gt;sure is
&gt;she lets out what you think is a giggle, before pulling you close
&gt;you finish the whole bag of crackers
&gt;when you go to brush off your shirt and toss the wrapper you hear a wet rapid licking sound 
&gt;guess you&#039;re out of jam too
&gt;okay time to start getting ready for bed
&gt;you start the dishwasher and go back into check up on her
&gt;she&#039;s sitting on the couch holding the now perfectly clean jam jar in her hands
&gt;good sweet goop!
&gt;did.....you make?
&gt;you smile and tell her no, rubbing the base of her antenna you take the jar from her
&gt;she probably has no clue what a grocery store is
&gt;you think about taking her sometime but the mental image of you having to explain to a store clerk why your girlfriend demolished the candy isle makes you reconsider
&gt;wait.....girlfriend?
&gt;you shake your head, what are you thinking? you just met her and besides she&#039;s like a giant 5 year old you could never.....
&gt;the a/c clicks on snapping you out of your thoughts
&gt;she&#039;s standing really close to you now, for some reason you feel hot
&gt;are you okay.......you......stoped
&gt;you blink a few times, and tell her you&#039;re fine
&gt;you drop the jar in the recycling and ask her how she usually gets ready for bed
&gt;oh bed......I, she cocks her head, I don&#039;t really.....know
&gt;I just find a nice place......and.....turn off
&gt;you ask if she needs to shower, or brush her teeth or anything
&gt;she shakes her head
&gt;no....I keep myself nice and.......clean
&gt;you&#039;re not sure how but you temper your curiosity
&gt;its probably something you don&#039;t need to know right before going to sleep
&gt;you go and take a shower, almost immediately you feel better and more clear headed
&gt;the heat you felt earlier just seems to melt away under the water
Drying off and tossing on some pajamas you go to say goodnight
&gt;she&#039;s already curled up on the living room couch, it looks like she fished that jam jar out of the bin
&gt;she&#039;s holding it like a stuffed animal
&gt;you shake your head and turn off the lights
&gt;you wake up
&gt;you honestly can&#039;t remember if you were having a bad dream or not
&gt;you check the clock, 12:00 on the dot
&gt;damn its going to be tough getting up tommorw
&gt;thank god its Sunday
&gt;wait shit
&gt;you&#039;re going to have to miss curch
&gt;suddenly your bedroom door rattles
&gt;you stop and listen for a moment
&gt;you hear what sounds like chewing just outside your room
&gt;your door starts to slowly open, the rapidly speeds up slamming against the wall and sending a shadowy figure swinnging to the ground
&gt;you turn on your bedside lamp and jump out of bed in a panic
&gt;its her, its just her
&gt;she gets to her feet, her wings twitching behind her
&gt;sorry about.....that
&gt;I saw some spiders on....your door
&gt;I&#039;d thought I&#039;d just......
&gt;I&#039;m sorry, I didn&#039;t mean to wake you
&gt;I can&#039;t.......sleep
&gt;after a deep breath, you tell her it&#039;s fine
&gt;you were having some trouble sleeping too
&gt;you tell her to stay put and you&#039;ll go get some water for her
&gt;you wonder if she might need a bedtime story
&gt;you walk back into your room
&gt;she&#039;s in your bed
&gt;you take a few more deep breaths
&gt;fuck it
&gt;you hand her the water and chug your own in a single gulp
&gt;you feel a little hot all of a sudden
&gt;she opens her mandibles and daintily laps it up with her long dark tongue
&gt;you lay on top of the covers next to her
&gt;you try and ignore how weird this all is
&gt;she finishes her water and sets it down on the bedside table
&gt;you ask if she could get the lights
&gt;there&#039;s a struggle, you hear something fall to the floor with a clatter
&gt;you hear a cord pop out from a socket and the room goes dark
&gt;looks like you&#039;ll need to explain how electric lights work too
&gt;after a few minutes you finally start to relax
&gt;hey.....still awake?
&gt;looks like it
&gt;I just wanted to say thank you
&gt;thank you for putting up.....with me
&gt;you smile to yourself, you really can&#039;t get mad a my her even when she&#039;s.....
&gt;you realize something
&gt;her voice, she&#039;s not pausing as much anymore it doesn&#039;t sound as forced
&gt;you compliment her on the improvement
&gt;you feel a buzz through the bed
&gt;I&#039;ve never talked this much....before
&gt;it helps
&gt;you close your eyes, you can&#039;t hold back any more
&gt;you drop the question
&gt;&quot;who are you?&quot;
its quiet again
&gt;you start feeling a bit embarrassed
&gt;you&#039;re about to apologize when you feel the covers shift and a hand rest on your shoulder
&gt;you can&#039;t see much but you know she&#039;s looking at you
&gt;you hear her take a deep breath, it sounds a little like a soft whistle
&gt;I was at my.......home since I was little
&gt;I didn&#039;t move much then
&gt;I.......remeber it being dark a lot, and when it wasn&#039;t there were.........others
&gt;they were......big......shapes that would move around me
&gt;and when they........left it would be dark agian
&gt;besides that I remember.......eating......growing...and not much else
&gt;its hard to......explain but I didn&#039;t think...the same.....back then
&gt;she pauses taking another breath, you feel her move a little closer
&gt;as I grew things got......brighter
&gt;I could move and sense things around me
&gt;everything started to feel clearer
&gt;the big things stoped coming then
&gt;I was confused......at first, I didn&#039;t know what I was doing or where I was
&gt;it took me.......along time to even find a way out, and when I did I was too scared to take it
&gt;I started getting hungry, but there were these sliver things......cans
&gt;It was faint but........I could smell them
&gt;I would just crush them in my mouth, I had no idea what they were but they tasted soooo good
&gt;and there was water too but.....but...b...
&gt;she starts to trail off
&gt;she tries to take another breath and you feel her body shudder
&gt;you&#039;re a little shocked, you&#039;ve never heard her seem so lucid before
&gt;you hear her start to talk agian, but all that comes out is what sounds like a rough wheeze.
&gt;worried you start to get up to see if she&#039;s okay but she lightly pushes you back down
&gt;sorry.....it..gets....hard.....
&gt;you sigh, relaxing a little
&gt;you still have so many questions
&gt;you hit the remote to the overhead fan and crawl under the covers
&gt;you feel her move a little, another one of her hands wraps around you, and you start to press up against her rough body
&gt;its weird, and a little uncomfortable but you can&#039;t bring yourself to push her away
&gt;you hear a soft buzzing as you fall asleep
&gt;you wake up feeling sweaty and sore, you honestly feel kinda funny
&gt;weird dreams agian
&gt;there&#039;s a little light coming through the blinds 
&gt;you try to move to check the clock but something painfully tugs your hair
&gt;you reach up to your head and feel a hard &quot;hand&quot; in our hair
&gt;oh right, you had a bedbug last night
&gt;you carefully give her hand a few tugs 
&gt;it won&#039;t budge, the scales on her hands are like velcro
&gt;she starts to stir, she tries to stretch nearly wacking your head against the head board
&gt;she stops startled, noticing you hanging off her hand
&gt;she lets out what you think is an apologetic buzz and wiggles her hand a little
&gt;its a little painful but you feel the grip loosening
&gt;you wonder just how much control over her body she has
&gt;finally you start to feel it come all the way out 
&gt;you give one last pull getting free and nearly fall off the bed
&gt;she catches you pulls you back over to herself sneaking the two of you back,under the covers
&gt;sorry about......that........my hands can.......grip.........pretty well
&gt;you want to finish.......the.....story?
&gt;she&#039;s waiting for a response but somethings off
&gt;you feel weird 
&gt;your whole body feels hot and the room feels uncomfortably stuffy
&gt;the fan is still blowing but the air feels heavy it like its getting hard to breathe
&gt;you mumble something about needing some water and crawl out of bed
&gt;it almost feels like you&#039;re drunk, as you stumble a bit before finding the door and making your way to the bathroom
&gt;you pull out a dixe cup and down a few shots of tap water before taking a seat on the side of the tub
&gt;you can&#039;t really discribe it, you don&#039;t really feel sick just hot
&gt;you hear a skittering sound and your impromptu roommate pops up beside you
&gt;you okay?
&gt;you do your best to tell her you&#039;re fine but she obviously knows somethings up
&gt;she leans in her antenna brushing up against your cheek
&gt;she moves back a little tilting her head from side to side
&gt;you smell.......nice

&gt;you always smell good......but this is........different
&gt;she leans back into you, forcing you to reach out for something to hold on to
&gt;she&#039;s practically sitting in you lap at this point
&gt;the air in the small room starts to get stuffy as you feel that same heat from earlier
&gt;she&#039;s scanning you up and down with her antennae her movements starting to seem increasingly stiff and robotic
&gt;one of her sets of arms wraps around you causing the two of you to slide into the tub
&gt;you barley manage to avoid wacking your head on anything
&gt;letting out a strained grunt to try and force her off
&gt;she tightens her hold on you pressing you into her hard lithe body 
&gt;you forgot how strong she could be
&gt;you lay like that for some time stareing into her huge emotionless eyes
&gt;her mandibles opening and closing inches from your face
&gt;it feels like you&#039;re buring up
&gt;as calmly as possible you try and talk to her
&gt;you don&#039;t get any response
&gt;you ask if she could let you up for a minute
&gt;you see her head shake a little but she doesn&#039;t let up
&gt;you grimace as you feel her claws start to dig into your back
&gt;with her free hands she starts pawing at your shirt 
&gt;you let out a gasp as her claws tear through the fabric cutting into your chest
&gt;she starts to get more and more animated her whole body twitching and jerking as she tears at your clothes 
&gt;you cry out for her to stop, she&#039;s practically mauling you at this point
&gt;even with the pain its getting harder and harder to think, it&#039;s like you&#039;re trapped in some sort of fever dream 
&gt;you feel like you&#039;re almost.....excited
&gt;an increasingly loud tapping snaps you out of your trance
&gt;looking down in horror you see her stinger slam into the floor of the tub, her entire thorax curled up in a striking position
&gt;it comes down agian leaving behind strands of a sticky clear fluid
&gt;its getting increasingly close to your crotch
&gt;giving it your all you try one last time to break free
&gt;with a loud tearing sound you manage to pull your arm free, leaving most of your sleeve hanging from her exoskeleton
&gt;you desperately grope around for something to grab onto 
&gt;you find one of the knobs and hold onto it, trying to pull yourself up
&gt;with a metallic creak it turns in your hands sending down a cascade of cold water from the shower head above
&gt;the water seems to clear the air and you feel yourself start to cool off
&gt;using your free hand you manage to pry the gaint bug off your chest putting a few inches of space between the two of you
&gt;disturbingly she dosent even seem to notice, continuing to &quot;hump&quot; the floor of the tub
&gt;you sit there transfixed by the freakish sight untill finally she starts to slow down 
&gt;with one final slow thrust her entire body shudders to a halt like some kind of huge wind up toy
&gt;at this point you don&#039;t really know what to do
&gt;She&#039;s clearly not well but your mind is screaming at you to run the hell out of there
&gt;suddenly she pokes her head up 
&gt;you get ready to bolt but she just stays there looking at you, water dripping down her face
&gt;she takes a minute looking around the room before turning back to you 
&gt;did....you fall?
&gt;she tries to stand up in the tub slipping in the water and landing on top of you with a splash 
&gt;you feel a sharp pain in your leg 
&gt;looking down you see the end up her abdomen pressing into your thigh
&gt;you start to go numb
&gt;sliding down into the tub the last thing you notice before closing your eyes is the strange oily sheen of the water
&gt;you wake up
&gt;you immediately wish you hadn&#039;t
&gt;a combination of pain, numbness, and that feeling you get when you take a bad nap hit you like a truck
&gt;you lay there feeling like crap while your brain tries to catch up with whatever the hell is going on
&gt;the last thing you remember was passing out in the bathroom after the giant wasp you let into your house tried to do &quot;something&quot; to you 
&gt;now you&#039;re......
&gt;wait where are you exactly
&gt;its too dark to see much but you&#039;re definitely not in the bathtub anymore
&gt;on top of that you can&#039;t tell for sure but it almost feels like somethings on you, pressing you down
&gt;even with how surreal this situation is you can&#039;t help but think that this is totally the part where the facehugger comes in
&gt;after a little more time waiting for feeling to come back to your limbs you try and wiggle yourself free
&gt;you rub up against something soft bumping it over
&gt;with a light thud wherever you are collapses on your face
&gt;blinking a few times to get used to the light you pull yourself out of the wreckage and try to get your bearings
&gt;it looks like you&#039;ve been sleeping in the gaint wasp version of a pillow fort
&gt;you really hope that newspaper scrubs out
&gt;getting back to priorities, you realize you&#039;re buck naked save for some more papermache spread around your chest and arms with a particularly big clump on your leg
&gt;oh right....that&#039;s where she got you
&gt;unable to fully stand you pull one of the fallen couch cushions under you and take a seat and stretch out your leg
&gt;bracing yourself you gently pull back the makeshift bandage praying you aren&#039;t about to kill yourself
&gt;it stings but you manage to get a good look
&gt;the wound is swollen and a little discolored but its more a small cut than the human hole punch you were afraid of
&gt;she must have only gotten you with the tip, still the fact such a little sting put you down is concerning in its own right
&gt;either way you feel slightly better now
&gt;pressing the paper back down you relax a bit and look up
&gt;she&#039;s right above your head 
&gt;you don&#039;t know how long she&#039;s been there but you really hope you aren&#039;t about to get a repeat of earlier
&gt;taking a deep breath you try and talk to her
&gt;the words catch in your throat as you see her claws come out of the plaster and she starts to fall towards you
&gt;with a buzz that shakes the room her wings fold out and she starts to fly
&gt;its not exactly an elegant sight as she repeatedly rams into the wall as she lowers herself to the floor
&gt;she lands on top of you like a black and yellow battering ram sending you both sprawling out across the floor
&gt;she&#039;s all over you and for a second you think your about to get shanked agian
&gt;but as the buzzing dies down you realize she&#039;s saying something
&gt;yes yes yes yes yes yes
&gt;she keeps repeating in a quiet strained voice as her hands run over your body poking and proding you 
&gt;not dead.....not dead....not dead....not dead
&gt;you reach out to try and calm her down but to your surprise she recoils jumping off of you
&gt;I&#039;m sorry so.......sorry....I...I..didn&#039;t mean...
&gt;she starts to pace around you 
&gt;I don&#039;t....you were being so....close
&gt;started feeling weird
&gt;felt......good stoped..........thinking
&gt;I didn&#039;t want to hurt you.....
&gt;she stops in front of you her nails digging into the hardwood floor
&gt;when I saw.....I thought....you
&gt;she doesn&#039;t continue, you can only imagine how many times she&#039;s run this though her head as she waited for you to wake up
&gt;carefully you try and get to your feet
&gt;you still feel like you&#039;ve been on an all day road trip but you&#039;re happy to move agian
&gt;bracing yourself on a bookshelf you try to stretch
&gt;after a few satisfying/concerning pops and cracks you stand up straight and walk over to her
&gt;you can tell she&#039;s nervous around you but you rest your hand on her shoulder keeping her steady
&gt;its hard to wrap your head around all everything but you know none of this has been easy for her
&gt; few days ago she was living in a shack on a diet of half cooked game meat and candy
&gt;then you just barged in and pulled her into your life in a world she had only ever known through old magazines and free newspapers
&gt;you wrap your arms around her and tell her your sorry for making her worry
&gt;she lets out a confused buzz but she doesn&#039;t move away
&gt;you stand there with her untill she starts to relax her buzzing slowly fading out
&gt;you feel her arms slide around you and with a slight tug she pulls you off your feet 
&gt;she carries you over to the pile of pillows gently laying you down after setting up a little bed with her free hands
&gt;she crouches down next you 
&gt;can I get you anything
&gt;you&#039;re about to tell her you&#039;re fine when you realize how dry your throat is 
&gt;feeling bad about asking anything of her you try and get up but she gently pushes back down wagging a finger at you
&gt;you relent quietly asking for some water
&gt;after some loud clattering she comes back with an entire pitcher proudly presenting it to you
&gt;too thirsty to care you take it thanking her profusely
&gt;you down half of it in a matter of seconds setting it down with a burp that makes both of you burst out laughing or &quot;happily vibrating&quot; in her case
&gt;settling down the two of you sit together on your little bed pile
&gt;outside the sun starts to set slowly filling the room with pinkish orange light
&gt;you sit there with her silently watching the day end 
&gt;slowly you move up next to her taking one of her hands 
&gt;she looks down at you and before you know it you&#039;ve pulled her into a kiss
&gt;you pull back blinking
&gt;what the hell did you just do
&gt;She&#039;s staring at you her mandibles agape
&gt;slowly she reaches up to the spot where you kissed her 
&gt;you sit there stammering, trying desperately to think of something to say
&gt;you never get the chance
&gt;before you can even blink she has you in her arms holding you tightly to her hard chest
&gt;this time she&#039;s kissing you
&gt;her mandibles lock around your face pinching your cheeks, you feel her tounge enter your mouth
&gt;its the strangest thing you&#039;ve ever felt
&gt;the way it feels, the way it moves, the way it tastes
&gt;and it keeps coming, spreading across your own tounge and filling your mouth
&gt;her grip starts to get tighter, you can feel the air being pressed out our you
&gt;you realize you can&#039;t breathe
&gt;you try and struggle but she&#039;s like a vice
&gt;just as you really start to panic she repeats loosening her grip a,d letting you fall back on the cushions
&gt;you lay there gasping for air as she looms over you, saliva dripping down her mouth parts
&gt;with every breath a familiar heat starts to enter your body
&gt;you can feel it in the air, that same strange humidity from this morning
&gt;its coming from her, radiating off her body like a fine light mist
&gt;you take a deep breath
&gt;you want her more than anything in the world

&gt;she slowly starts to lower herself over you
&gt;you let out a gasp as her cool exoskeleton presses against your exposed skin
&gt;you can hear her claws tear into the cushions around you as she pulls herself over you getting into position
&gt;the chemical scent in the air grows stronger, you don&#039;t know how much longer you can just lay there
&gt;as she adjusts her position the dark inner plating of her thighs starts to rub over your cock
&gt;small stiff hairs teasing your increasingly sensitive tool
&gt;her movements are stiff and slow, nothing like the manic energy you&#039;re used too form her
&gt;you don&#039;t know if this is her way of staying in control of her own impulses but its starting to get to you
&gt;finally she brings her crotch down, your tip pressing into her smooth dark nethers
&gt;finally giving in to your own impulses you wrap your arms around her and thrust into her depths
&gt;only to have your cock slide up against her underbelly leaving a trail of warm pre
&gt;confused you pull back and thrust again and again at where you know SOMETHING has to be
&gt;the pheromones in the air robbing you of complex thought, you pull back and stare at her pleadingly letting out an pathetic whine
&gt;she brings a finger to your lips, shushing you and gently pushing your head back down 
&gt;you swear you can hear her giggle as she starts to move agian crawling up and over your prone body
&gt;dazed, horny, and confused you start to look around, your addled mind trying and failing to get a grip on the situation
&gt;finally a tearing sound catches your attention and you look down between your legs
&gt;your heart skipping a beat as you see her abdomen pulling close, her stinger tearing though fabric as it nears your genitals
&gt;you try and scramble away but your back runs up against the rough stone of your fire place
&gt;sensing your panic she slows down bringing her lower set of arms down around your shoulders 
&gt;gently she starts to run her hands up and down your back, the tips of her claws lightly pressing in to your muscles 
&gt;you&#039;re not sure what she&#039;s doing but she keeps at it, going up and down in smooth fluid motions you didint even know she was capable of
&gt;she starts to move up to your head her fingers gently gliding though your hair, massaging your scalp careful not to get her Velcro like hairs tangled with your own
&gt;between the increasing pheromone filled air and the rhythmic massage your mind finally gives up and you relax into her arms desperately aroused yet oddly comfortable.
&gt;she caresses your head pressing you against her upper thighs, blocking out the rest of the room
&gt;you feel something press up against your cock and starts to slowly slide up
&gt;something wet starts to drip down your shaft
&gt;it stops at your tip lightly pressing down on it
&gt;with a loud schlick you enter her for the first time.
&gt;her whole body goes ridged, you let out a gasp as her thighs clamp around your head
&gt;you feel the muscles in her abdomen tighten as well trapping you in place from both ends
&gt;her insides felt alien, it was an almost cold sensation broken up by small waves of warm sticky liquid that left your skin tingling
&gt;she begins to push down on you sliding you both off the wall and down into the covers, her smooth null &quot;crotch&quot; rubbing against your face as your cock continues to throb helplessly inside her.
&gt;her body starts to tremble, the walls of her abdomen pulling even tighter around your member
&gt;after a few seconds she relaxes and you feel her move above you
&gt;you can hear something pierce the fabric around you and she stiffens as if to brace herself
&gt;then she starts to vibrate
&gt;its almost gentle at first, a smooth buzz running through both your bodies
&gt;she keeps it going, getting more and more intense
&gt;you can feel you body start to protest as the room itself starts to shake
&gt;the vibrations start to travel down her body into her abdomen 
&gt;you let out a stammering gasp any discomfort forgotten
&gt;her walls squeeze and pulse around your cock, while the vibrations rock you to your core
&gt;you start to moan, the vibrations turning it into a long drawn out sigh
&gt;you don&#039;t know if your body can even take all this but you&#039;re well beyond caring at this point
&gt;with a massive jolt that causes you to nearly scream out in.....well you couldn&#039;t even say, her body hits you with the biggest wave yet before going still
&gt;as the last of the vibrations run their course you start to climax 
&gt;it goes on for what seems like forever a warm low pulse that sends everything you have into her
&gt;as it finally ends and you lay there panting you realize all you can feel is relief

&gt;&quot;Police this morning have reported yet another.....&quot;
&gt;You wake up to the tv blaring and something hard jabbing you in the side.
&gt;shielding your eyes from the sunlight now streaming in through the windows you fumble around eventually pulling the remote out from under you and hitting the mute button
&gt;you flop back down only and trun away from the windows trying to get some more sleep
&gt;two massive compound eyes are looking right at you
&gt;oh yeah you two........
&gt;oh shit what the hell did you do!?
&gt;you turn back over in a cold sweat
&gt;holy crap what the hell is wrong with you? You damn pervert
&gt;you just met her! You don&#039;t know how old she is, her name, or even where she&#039;s from! 
&gt;hell you practically dragged her from her home and now you&#039;re.....she&#039;s not even.....
&gt;you hear a soft munching sound
&gt;glancing over you see her gently chewing on your hair, sticky drool dripping onto the cushions
&gt;reaching back you take one of her hands
&gt;some small voice is still trying to tell you this is all wrong but you can&#039;t deny you feel something for her
&gt;you relax closing your eyes, drifting off to the feeling of her playing with your hair
&gt;you know its silly but you quietly pray this can last just a little longer. Sugar wasp update

&gt;okay you&#039;re starting to get restless now
&gt; slowly and carefully you slide out and away from your bedmates grasp
&gt;checking to see if you woke her or not you wave your and in front of her face
&gt;she gives a cute little twitch but otherwise doesn&#039;t react, last night must have taken a lot out of her
&gt;and yourself you realize all too late as you try and get up, nearly falling over as what seems like every joint in your body tries to give up on you
&gt;looking around you spot the miraculously still upright waterpicher
&gt;you chug the remainder of the lukewarm water and take a quick breather before pushing yourself up
&gt;limping too the kitchen you wipe the remaining sleep from your eyes and try to put some breakfast together
&gt;after looking around for a bit you give up on making anything fancy and grab a pot and some oatmeal
&gt;a few moments later and you have some hastily cooked &quot;porridge&quot; complete with two very large scoops of cinnamon-sugar minus the cinnamon along with two tall glasses of ice water
&gt;you promise yourself that you&#039;ll cook her a real meal next time and make your way back to your little love nest
&gt;she&#039;s sitting up now doing something with her.....oh..ohhh
&gt;blushing you set the food down on the coffee table not sure what to say
&gt;for once much to your surprise she doesn&#039;t immediately pounce on you or the food, seemingly content with.....exploring her body
&gt;you can&#039;t help but watch as she runs her hands over her &quot;vagina&quot; letting out a happy buzz each time a finger slides inside
&gt;moving a bit closer she finally notices you 
&gt;&quot;you knooooow what&#039;s weird?&quot; She asks without even looking up
&gt;&quot;I didint even know what this felt  like untill now&quot; 
&gt;suddenly she&#039;s on her feet and right up in your face
&gt;&quot;and then there&#039;s this thing&quot; she says as you feel a long, slick, wet claw glide around the base of your rapidly hardening member
&gt;oh yeah pants, you knew you were forgetting something.
&gt;she brings her face close, spreading open her mandibles and letting her unnaturally long tounge slide out
&gt;the flared tip presses against your lips its hairs tickling your nose
&gt;you close your eyes and go in for a kiss 
&gt;&quot;WHAT IS THAT!?&quot; 
&gt;you jump in surprise, as you quickly come back to reality
&gt;she&#039;s standing over her breakfast any lwed advances completely forgotten in the face of food
&gt;you tell her its all hers and start try and explain what oatmeal is but she&#039;s already sticking her entire face into the bowl
&gt;as the wet sound of rapidly disappearing oatmeal fills the room you quietly excuse yourself to go get ready for the day
&gt;sheepishly covering up your fading erection, embarrassed both at being beaten out by a bowl of oats and at your increasingly romaintc feelings towards your houseguest, you make your way back to your room
&gt;falling into your bed you look up at the ceiling
&gt;you stretch yourself out over the mattress trying to work a little of the soreness out of your bug battered body
&gt;you hear a buzzing sound next to you and for once its not a giant wasp
&gt;digging through your sheets you find your work phone vibrating 
&gt;its Monday
&gt;your were supposed to open up today
&gt;looking at the time you see its nearly noon
&gt;trying to ignore the pit in your stomach you answer
&gt;finally dude, what the heck?
&gt;I&#039;ve been calling you all morning!
&gt;embarrassed to the extreme now you think of an excuse the best you can
&gt;Steve I&#039;m so sorry, I came down with something yesterday and I&#039;ve been pretty much bed ridden since
&gt;I&#039;m sorry I didn&#039;t call you sooner 
&gt;there&#039;s a brief moment of silence
&gt;well shit, you picked the perfect day for it.&quot;
&gt;huh? Why  what&#039;s going on?
&gt;the police were here when I showed up, they have the whole parking lot shut down.
&gt;you sit up surprised
&gt;what happened?! Are we in trouble?
&gt;no but I think the front of our store is evidence right now
&gt;its hard to tell what&#039;s going on since they won&#039;t let me close but it looks like a bad accident or something
&gt;and while they won&#039;t say much I have a feeling the cops are going to be here for a bit
&gt;you&#039;re not sure whether to be relieved or worried but there is some minor relief in knowing you won&#039;t be a bother to your co-workers today
&gt;anyway I&#039;ve already given the others a call and told them not to come in today, you rest up and get better
&gt;hopefully this will all blow over by tomorrow
&gt;you say your goodbyes and hang up, still not sure how to feel about all this
&gt;you hear a skittering sound and look up, your door is open
&gt;the bed shakes a something lands behind you
&gt;you get yoinked into a bug hug and fall back onto the bed, a happy buzzing filling the room
&gt;before you can say anything she slides something warm into your lap
&gt;I saved you some
&gt;looking down at the half empty bowl of oatmeal you smile reaching around to hold one of her now very sticky hands 
&gt;you have a lot to do today
&gt;she lets you up to finish your breakfast, moving around on the bed untill she&#039;s sprawled out next to you
&gt;you try and turn away from her as you eat in a halfharted attempt at modesty
&gt;not wanting to be rude you try and think of something to talk about only to be quickly distracting by a soft clacking sound
&gt;turning back you see she&#039;s started to &quot;clean&quot; herself
&gt;slowly running her hands through her mouth parts over and over again while she licks off the last of the sticky residue
&gt;you find it oddly mesmerizing
&gt;you&#039;re watching something that that a few days ago you couldn&#039;t have even dreamed of
&gt;blushing at the strange sight, you pull your eyes away and try to focus on your food
&gt;her body is just so strange, so mechanical. Its not flexible its not maneuverable, its not expressive, its not......human 
&gt;but still there&#039;s a mind behind those large blank eyes that moves it so effortlessly and with such grace that you.....
&gt;there&#039;s a tap on your shoulder and you hear a quiet voice
&gt;uh....a little help please
&gt;you jump up and turn around using the now empty bowl to cover up your &quot;goods&quot; 
&gt;she&#039;s laying at a weird angle her three free hands covering up her face
&gt;she points down to her legs where her spikes and claws have gotten hopelessly tangled in the sheets 
&gt;as you burst out laughing she lets out a little cry and tries to roll away only serving to turn her into a bug burrito
&gt;its not funny she pouts in a crackly voice as you sit down and and start to unravel her still chuckling to yourself
&gt;it was a good morning
&gt;after the two of you finish your breakfast shenanigans you finally go about getting your day started
&gt;you have your clothes on, washed your face, took some generic acetaminophen, and put up the dirty dishes.
&gt;you&#039;re ready to be a functioning member of society
&gt;now to see if you can help a gaint wasp lady do the same
&gt;the two of you spend some time cleaning up after yourselves, washing the sheets and getting to work on the mess in the livingroom
&gt;she seems almost sad when you start to disassemble the collapsed pillow fort
&gt;it was a good little nest, she says watching as you sort out the damaged and soggy cushions 
&gt;you finish and she picks up the huge stack and starts to carry it back to the laundry room
&gt;she turns back to you
&gt;Ill make an even better one next time
&gt;Once that&#039;s all wrapped up for the time being you reach the most difficult chore of the day
&gt;grocery shopping
&gt;which means leaving her here alone
&gt;after a quick break for drinks you take her by the hand and lead her around the house 
&gt;this time showing her everything, doing your best to make her feel at home
&gt;satisfied, you head to the door
&gt;as you&#039;re about to leave you pause and look her in the eyes
&gt;after a awkward pause you tell her you need to get something off your chest
&gt;listen, I&#039;ve loved having you here the past few days but I realize this was all kind of sudden
&gt;I just sort of pulled you into my home without asking you permission and I wanted to say sorry for that
&gt;if you ever feel uncomfortable, or homesick please tell me and I&#039;ll do whatever I can to get you back
&gt;I don&#039;t want you to feel trapped here 
&gt;after another awkward silence she leans in, pinching your nose with the tips of her mandibles
&gt;once its clear you got the message she relents pulling you into a bear(bug?) hug
&gt;you&#039;ve done so much for me you silly little pink thing and I&#039;ve been such a.......bother, she says glancing back at her stinger
&gt;anyone else.....look....just don&#039;t start saying stuff like that ok?
&gt;you plant a kiss in between her inner eyes and apologize
&gt;she slowly lets you back down
&gt;you know if either of you exchange any more sappy lines you&#039;ll spend the rest of the day laying around cuddling
&gt;and as appealing as that sounds you do need to eat some real food
&gt;you look her in the eyes and promise her you&#039;ll be back as soon as possible before walking out the door
&gt;you pause a moment in the driveway taking in the dismal state of your car door
&gt;you get in and take a (thankfully) dry seat, starting the car and pulling down the driveway
&gt;you see her in the window as you pull out onto the street, you give her a wave as you drive off.
&gt;the fresh air flowing in as you drive perks you up a bit
&gt;as you pull onto the main road it occurs to you you&#039;ve been feeling a little foggy today you just haven&#039;t really noticed it
&gt;a side effect of whatever your &quot;nestmate&quot; was pumping out into the air yesterday maybe
&gt;you push it from your mind and try to focus on the road but your thoughts keep drifting back to her
&gt;was it really okay to leave her all alone I mean......
&gt;No, you have to stop thinking like that
&gt;she can be a little off sure, but she&#039;s not stupid and she&#039;s not just some wild animal
&gt;you know she can take care of herself
&gt;you have nothing to worry about.......

&gt;she stands there watching as his car disappears from view
&gt;the house is quiet, she is alone agian
&gt;it is a strange feeling, the sudden lack of stimulation after so many days of insanity
&gt;a small part of her realizes she hasn&#039;t moved in quite some time
&gt;her thoughts slowly dim as she stands there, fixated on the road below
&gt;something moves next to her breaking the trace, a large roach making its way down the wall
&gt;instinctively, a hand juts out crushing the bug with a wet pop
&gt;she hastily scarfs the roach down licking her hand clean
&gt;after a nice stretch she looks around still coming out of her daze
&gt;A small digital clock sitting near a box full of old travel supplies shows the time
&gt;she grabs her antennae in frustration, she had been standing there for nearly two hours
&gt;she rushes into the other room trying to get her mind going again
&gt;she paces around the living room cursing her own lack of focus
&gt;a few days with another living creature and already falling into passivity and instinct
&gt;&quot;ooookaaaay okayyyy&quot; she says outloud, stretching out the words to flex her throat muscles.
&gt;&quot;stay........focused....
&gt;grabbing the remote she flicks on the t.v. and starts going though channels
&gt;struggling to hold onto the smooth plastic, she accidentally digs a claw into one of the rubber buttons and down into the plastic below with a crunch
&gt;the tv pops to a strange station, a nearly blank blue screen with a small black box in the middle
&gt;&quot;oh.....shit&quot;
&gt;fearing the worst she frees her digit as carefully and non destructively as possible and runs over to the small television
&gt;&quot;work....don&#039;t break....oh please......don&#039;t break&quot;
&gt;cautiously she tries pressing a few buttons, inadvertently turning up the volume
&gt;&quot;oh!&quot;
&gt;it was a music station
&gt;as the the room filled with the soft music of instruments she had no names for, her panic subsided
&gt;placing the remote down, she crawls onto the couch contemplating her situation

&gt;she lays there listening to the tune
&gt;its different than than the music she used to listen to in her home, more complex and meloudius 
&gt;it gives her something to think about something to keep her mind going
&gt;it feels so odd living like this. So relaxed and unburdened by the outside world 
&gt;it would be so easy to lose it all, the skills she spent her whole life learning,
&gt;to let it all go and fall back onto instinct 
&gt;but no, she has never fully understood what she is but she knows that passivity does not suit her
&gt;she has the beginnings of a real life now, a life with another living thinking creature
&gt;her whole conscious existence she has forced herself to be better, the pressure of survival and isolation pushing her to find something better
&gt;now that she has it she will not let complacency overtake her
&gt;she holds a up a hand, the afternoon sun making the chitinous pads on her palm seem almost translucent 
&gt;she still had so much to learn, about herself and about the outside world 
&gt;so no she would not stop here
&gt;she would keep reading, keep practicing speech, keep learning, keep advancing 
&gt;she would make this new life work, she would not be a burden to her saviour, she would go to bed each night pressed against his warm soft body knowing all was right In the world
&gt;a name, her mandibles twitched as she flexed her &quot;vocal chords&quot; I need a name

Side story part 1
&gt;Hello Professor Yeo,
&gt;I just wanted to update you on the situation here at site A
&gt;the property is perfect for our needs and should serve as comfortable place for the team to lay low while things blow over
&gt;we&#039;ve already converted the back few rooms into an adequate lab space and Lucas and Paul are working on getting the steel shed put together by the end of the week
&gt;the kids are all in good health and while we haven&#039;t noticed any aberrant behavior so far I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll appreciate being able to settle down for a bit
&gt;I know these have been hectic times for the project but I want you to know we&#039;re all behind you one hundred percent. We all appreciate what you&#039;re doing here and we&#039;re we&#039;re happy to see this through to the end
&gt;even if it means spending a few months pretending to be outdoorsmen
&gt;good luck from all of us,
&gt;Anna
&gt;February 2nd, 1998


&gt;it was weird going back to the &quot;real world&quot; after the pure insanity of the past few days
&gt;looking around at a red light you see people, human people going about their day
&gt;no giant bug monsters, no near death experiences, just the regular sights and sounds you&#039;ve know you&#039;re whole life
&gt;as you drive on, you try to keep your mind off of just how insane your life is now
&gt;out of the house and away from it all it almost seems silly now, like some crazy fever dream
&gt;like you&#039;ll get home and it&#039;ll all be back to normal, your sofa will be in one piece, your walls won&#039;t be covered in paper mache, and there won&#039;t be a makeshift bandage wrapped around your leg
&gt;you&#039;ll eat dinner, go to bed, and go to work in the morning the exact same way you&#039;ve done for the past six years
&gt;you take a turn into the grocery store parking lot
&gt;but no here you are going shopping for two, a very sweet, very strange girl waiting for you at home
&gt;you smile to yourself as you park the car
&gt;thinking about her is almost addicting, her smooth cool body pressing against you, the cute clicking sounds she makes when she messes up trying to talk, that little glint her eyes get when the light is just right...
&gt;really, despite everything you just can&#039;t help but feel like you&#039;re the luckiest guy on earth
&gt;okay, crackers 
&gt;check
&gt;canned salmon 
&gt;check 
&gt;eggs 
&gt;check
&gt;milk
&gt;check
&gt;you go down your shopping list as you push your cart up to the cashier 
&gt;you have tonight&#039;s dinner all planned out and have a pretty good idea what the meal plan for the rest of the week is going to be
&gt;that poor girl isn&#039;t going to live off raw meat and old candy on your watch!
&gt;after checking out you go out to your car optimistic for the evening ahead 
&gt;while loading up the cooler in your trunk you momentarily consider what state your house will be in when you get back but you decide it really doesn&#039;t matter at this point anyway 
&gt;you&#039;re in this for the long haul and you&#039;re going to need to learn how to roll with the punches 
&gt;still, on the way home you stop in at the hardware store and spend about an hour grabbing all the essentials for basic home repairs and upkeep 
&gt;as well as some more esoteric items that might come in handy later
&gt;finally you pull back up your own driveway almost a full hour later
&gt;traffic had been horrendous getting home, it seemed nearly every major road to your house had a wreck and a small army of cops running around 
&gt;but hey you made it back and you&#039;re about to cook a beautiful woman the best meal of her life!
&gt;what could possibly go wrong?
&gt;grabbing as many of the bags as you can in one go you carefully unlock the door and step inside 
&gt;the house is dark and the living room tv is on some kind of classical music channel 
&gt;you flick on the lights as you head to the kitchen, surprisingly the house seems completely untouched 
&gt;you weren&#039;t expecting her to trash the place but with how excited she seemed you thought she&#039;d at least go exploring 
&gt;in fact you can&#039;t find her at all as you peek around the house on your way back to the car
&gt;getting the rest of the groceries to the kitchen and locking up you notice the door to your room is open a crack and go peek in
&gt;she&#039;s curled up peacefully in your bed several books wrapped up in the sheets
&gt;around her
&gt;you slowly open the door and tip to up next to her
&gt;its nearly pitch black in your room, the only light coming from the half open door and a what little can escape the blackout curtains
&gt;despite that however her body seems to have a soft shine to it as you kneel down next to the bed
&gt;as you try to bring yourself to wake her up one of her hands lifts from the bed and softly caresses your cheek
&gt;even as her head lies still you can feel the attention of her eyes shift to you as she draws your head into her arms
&gt;welcome home....I missed you</textarea>
