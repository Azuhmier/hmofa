by Teether

&gt;you sit alone at a bench on the edge high school playground
&gt;Everyone else is broken off into their various cliques, all playing with the newest toys and games
&gt;But you.....your all alone
&gt;You never really fit in with any of the other classmates
&gt;An outcast...an poor to boot
&gt;Suddenly you feel a sharp, weighty, object slam you in the back of the head
&gt;You drop forward off the bench, your fingers brushing through your wet hair
&gt;You bring your fingers in front of your face
&gt;Blood
&gt;Lots of it
&gt;You pick up a small, blood stained, chunk of concrete from the playground mulch infront of you
&quot;Ok? Who-&quot; you say stammering to your feet as you turn around
&gt;Its the biggest bully in Big Town
&gt;Syd the rhino
&gt;face like a slab of quarry granite and muscles of a bodybuilder
&gt;Its almost like he was born to bulley
&gt;&quot;Hey faggot, where&#039;s my usual cut? D&#039;you forget our little agreement? You leave your lunch money on your desk after sixth period and I don&#039;t cave your little monkey face in&quot; said Syd while cracking his boulder-like knuckles
&gt;Your vision wavers a bit as you feel a warm trickle on the back of your neck
&gt;&quot;You g&#039;nnah answer me or am I g&#039;nnah hav&#039;tah break it out of y&#039;ah&quot; said Syd taking a couple steps closer to you
&quot;I-i d-don&#039;t have the money&quot; you say in a wavery voice, your fist clenching around the bloody piece of concrete
&gt;&quot;Whatt was that little B?&quot; said Syd leaning towards you and cupping his ear mockingly
&quot;I-i said I don&#039;t have it, m-my mom said that she&#039;d have to skip th-&quot; you quiver before Syd picks you up by the front of your t-shirt and slams you full force onto the mulch
&gt;&quot;Well little B, thats not g&#039;nna cut it. Now I&#039;ll ask again. Where&#039;s my money?&quot; said Syd before placing a giant foot on your chest
&gt;You could feel all the air being crushed from your lungs as you let out a couple whiny sputters
&gt;The image of Syd ugly grey mug wavers from your blackening sight
&gt;You feel a rush of air and two loud, heavy, thumps as Syd&#039;s weight leaves your chest
&gt;You prop yourself up as you gasp for air
&gt;You look over to see a hyena girl in ratty clothing on top of Syd, now laying on his back
&gt;The hyena girl has Syd&#039;s arms pinned to the ground while she snaps her jaws in his face, &quot;Fuck off Syd! Leave the skin alone!&quot;
&gt;*&quot;skin?&quot; you think running a hand over your arm as you get to your feet
&gt;Syd quickly throws the hyena off of him and gets to his feet, &quot;Fuck off Kyrah, this is between men&quot;
&gt;Kyrah recovers on her feet, fists clenched in front, &quot;No, your shaking down the skins again for easy lunch money. Go take y&#039;er show somewhere else and fuck off&quot;
&gt;Syd glared silently for a couple seconds before lunging at Kyrah
&gt;In a snap of the moment, you throw the piece of bloody concrete as hard as you can at the side of Syd&#039;s head
&gt;It makes contact, stammering Syd to the side just in time to come full face to Kyrah&#039;s fist
&gt;An audible crunch could be heard as Syd plowed backwards onto his ass
&gt;You run over to Kyrah and ask if she&#039;s ok
&gt;&quot;Yeah skins I am fine, just got a little spit on my hand&quot; said Kyrah brushing her hands
&gt;Syd spits out a wad of blood and a couple teeth before getting to his feet
&gt;Side by side you and Kyrah put your fists out, ready for the behemoth to come charging again
&gt;Instead Syd turns around and mumbles, &quot;faggot&quot; under his breath as he walks away
&gt;You both put your fists down as the adrenaline dies
&quot;Whelp....guess I got quite the ass-whoopin ahead of me tomorrow when that talking rock comes back for a little revenge....thanks though&quot; you say to Kyrah as she straightens her jacket collar
&gt;&quot;He&#039;s not gonna bother any of you skins anymore. I&#039;ve seen how the teachers treat the handful of you we got at this school. Letting bullys off the hook, it makes me sick&quot; said Kyrah looking down at you
&gt;You feel a slight flutter in your throat, &quot;R-really, like you mean it?&quot;
&gt;Kyrah nods, &quot;Yup. I keep my word, even to skins&quot;
&quot;So....Are you going to create so sort of &quot;skin-protection squad&quot; or something like that?&quot;
&gt;Kyrah lets out a nerve shattering yeen laugh as you stand unsure of what will happen next
&gt;&quot;You, know hehehe, that&#039;s not such a bad idea.&quot; says Kyrah through a couple of yeen giggles
&quot;What? You mean for real?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah! No seriously, It&#039;ll give me something to do and a reason to pummel Syd&#039;s fat ass somemore. So...What&#039;dah say? Wanna be my first recruit to Big Town&#039;s &#039;Skins-Protection Squad&#039;?&quot;
&quot;B-but, Iam no fighter....I don&#039;t even know how to keep myself from getting beaten, less dole out some beatings&quot; you say looking down into your scrawny hands
&gt;You see two large paws gently grab them
&gt;You look up into Kyrah&#039;s dirt-smudged and beautifully disheleved, furry face
&gt;&quot;Look, my mah was in the military and she taught me everything I know about self-defense. You could come over to my house and I could teach you&quot; said Kyrah with an overly eager face
&gt;Your hearts racing a million miles a second and you feel the warmth of blood rush to your face
&quot;Y-yeah that would be great, I-I&#039;d love to&quot; you spill out as the butterflies grow restless in the pit of your gut
&gt;&quot;Really!? I mean, you&#039;d be the first person I&#039;ve had over in like...in like forever. Just lemme tell my mah and we can start your first lesson after school&quot; said Kyrah, her smile completely exposing two giant rows of sharp teeth
&gt;Everything is going so fast that you only manage out a couple of accepting grunts
&gt;Kyrah forces a slip of paper with her name and number into your hand before giving you a couple, hearty, pats on the back
&gt;&quot;Got all that? Good! I&#039;ll see you at six&quot; said Kyrah waving good bye to you as the bell for the next class period rang
&gt;You wave her goodbye as you look down into the note in your hand
*&quot;This was written before her fight with Syd&quot;
*&quot;........&quot;
*&quot;Did I just get asked on a date?...&quot;
&gt;A large smile crosses your face as you kiss the note, Kyrah&#039;s scent purposely swabbed all over the piece of scrap paper
&gt;You fold it up and place in your breast pocket, safe and close to your heart as you slowly walk off to your next set of classes</textarea>
