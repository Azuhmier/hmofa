Right now I&#039;m on a break.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He smiled, seemingly quite pleased with her answer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Oh don&#039;t worry, I&#039;m not here about the cereal... I was actually looking to talk with you a bit if I could?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Oh?&quot; she responded, cocking a furry eyebrow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Well, I was wondering, what&#039;s a girl like you doing as a mascot when you should be on stage somewhere? I mean, I was watching you in there and you&#039;re too good to just be doing this stuff...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She willingly took the bait.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;You liked what you saw huh? You see anything else you liked?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; His smile grew as he saw she was of like mind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Must be dull, going from place to place and busting the same moves over and over... Care to maybe try a few new ones with me?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She pocketed the vape and smiled back, revealing her set of perfect pearly fangs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Hmm sounds like fun, got somewhere in mind for us to dance Mr Anon?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He looked around, checking the surroundings before answering.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Actually, this is one of the most private places on site, wanna dance right here?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She didn&#039;t need to be asked twice, months of tedium and frustration having built up to near unbearable levels, her dam was fit to burst.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She pulled him in, her claws sinking into his stuffy teachers jacket as she smothered his lips with her own.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The taste of him on her tongue was enough to get her juices flowing, in more ways than one...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; At first his hands were everywhere, pressing on her cheeks (both top and bottom sets), caressing her hips, exploring her back...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Eventually they came to rest on her waist, and he broke the hungry kiss panting.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Damn your hot...&quot; he muttered between breaths.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Toni wasn&#039;t in the mood for idle compliments however, her blood very much up and burning for more.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;Shut up and fuck me!&quot; she hissed into his ear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He didn&#039;t need to be told twice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Reaching down, he pulled his belt apart and dropped his pants, freeing his sizeable member from his boxers in the same motion.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He was already rock hard and, much to her approval, eager to begin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She quickly wriggled out of her tight shorts, undoing the clasp above the base of her tail with ease and dropping her moist panties with them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It only took a wordless look between them to break the tension, and they were once again pulled together and lost in each other&#039;s embrace.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Despite their mutual need, Anon had trouble hitting his mark, he was taller than the tigress, she stood on her tip toes to meet him but it was a no go and he kept missing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; That meant he would have to lift her bodily off the floor or...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She pushed him back, enjoying the growing look of frustration on his flushed face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She turned around to face the shed, bending slightly and pushing her toned but pleasantly sized rump into the air, her tail held aloft.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; This gave him a clear line of sight to her dripping lips, the surrounding fur already soaked and ruffled.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He needed no further prompting.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Bending at the knees, he grabbed her by the hips and slid himself firmly into her from behind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As he grunted in exertion and pleasure, she had to bite her lip to stop herself from screaming out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; This wasn&#039;t her first rodeo, but it was her first human.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her heat had come on her mid circuit and she had been going nuts for days.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; To her pleasant surprise he filled her almost completely, and although his smooth but textured member rippled across her inner walls it lacked the spikes she dreaded, it was a revelation.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She didn&#039;t have time to ponder all the differences however as the human pulled himself out to the tip and pushed back inside in quick succession.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The explosion of sensations nearly drove her to her knees, but she kept herself up through force of will, and with the screech of her claws scraping into the cheap metal sheeting on the shed wall.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He continued to pound himself into her, again and again, as she struggled to keep control.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; As they fell into a sustainable rhythm she was able to move one hand from the wall and reach back, pulling one of his smooth human hands from her hip and directing it up and under her shirt.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He took the cue, feeling his way towards her plump breast and squeezing it tightly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The result was a loud moan, released quite involuntarily from the depths of her throat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Anon seemed to tense up, as if afraid the noise would attract someone from the hall.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; No one came however, and the sudden lull in his attentions gave her the opening to playfully flick her hips back, jolting him back deeper inside and reminding him not to dawdle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; This had the effect of driving him to greater heights of activity, perhaps the fear of discovery was making him desperate, or hitting all his buttons.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He hit home harder and faster, an audible slapping sound echoed out from the confines of their hidey-hole as his hips forcibly connected with her rear again and again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her resolve faltered as the sensation became too much, her tongue lolled out from the side of her mouth and her eyes began to cross.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She couldn&#039;t suppress the needy moans and whimpers any longer as he finally began to scratch her long awaited itch.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Even as he started to mutter about being close she was already on her way, it was all she could do to hold on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; When he tensed, hilted himself entirely inside her, and groaned loudly, she felt him release his hot sticky seed deep within.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The sensation sent her over the edge, her walls reacting to each ropey coating as if electrocuted, writhing and contracting as her body sought to milk every last drop from him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She moaned and mewled uncontrollably, whatever composure she had left shattering an falling to her feet to mix with the pooling juices there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It couldn&#039;t have been more than for a few minutes, but an eternity of bliss stopped any new thoughts forming, until finally it was over.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Spent, Anon pulled himself from her, panting hard and staggering back slightly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She turned and leaned back against the shed wall, out of breath but feeling a sense of liberation.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; The two stood looking at one another for a moment, neither able to form a word between them but silently thanking the other.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Even as Toni wriggled back into her tight shorts, she knew she couldn&#039;t go back inside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Her shorts were soaked with the product of their tryst and she was struggling to even stand up straight, dancing in front of another group of kids was just about impossible.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; To her surprise however, Anon hadn&#039;t left after retrieving his pants.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;That was... something else...&quot; he panted shakily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; &quot;If you want, I can go back in, tell them you&#039;re sick and bring your stuff to the car?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She nodded, not trusting herself to speak just yet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; So as he readjusted his tie, she stumbled back to her car, climbed in and waited.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; In a few minutes he was there, with her props and stage crap packed and ready.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She popped the trunk and he placed it all in easily, slamming it shut again afterwards.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; He looked at her sadly through the car window, the understanding that it was time for her to go.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; Before she pulled away however, she tossed him a crumpled up piece of paper.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She sped off, even as he read it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; It was a phone number, accompanied by a little heart and a T.</div></li></ol>        </div>

            RAW Paste Data        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt; Toni lived a really very boring life.
&gt; She was the travelling mascot for a cereal mega brand, going from place to place promoting a certain brand of sugary morning badness and passing it off as a healthy dietary staple.
&gt; She didn&#039;t wear a suit though, as she was a tigress, slightly shorter than average but still towering over the kids she was charged with converting.
&gt; She had a uniform, bright colored shorts and t-shirt with a promotional sun cap, but it got old fast, particularly in the winter.
&gt; Each day she would go to a school, or a mall, or a supermarket, and do the little dance, sing the little song, and then finish with the catchphrase.
&gt; &quot;They&#039;reeeee great!!!&quot;
&gt; It was a special kind of monotonous hell, but it paid the bills and she had signed a contact so... grin and bear it.
&gt; It was another gig at a high school, typical setup, usual group of shouting and disinterested kids, same old...
&gt; Except &#039;he&#039; was there...
&gt; One of the teachers, a human.
&gt; As she danced about to the music, bopped to the crappy lyrics and otherwise belittled herself for the kids, he watched.
&gt; Not like the others, with amusement, scorn, contempt or pity.
&gt; He watched every move she made with an almost electric hunger.
&gt; His eyes followed every footfall, taking in every movement as if he feared missing even a second.
&gt; She could feel his want, his need, from across the small sports hall.
&gt; So when he followed her outside as she went for her smoke break, she couldn&#039;t help but tingle a little with excitement.
&gt; It had been a while since anyone had shown her that kind of attention, and she was curious to see what he would do away from prying eyes...
&gt; As Toni leaned back against the old equipment shed, nestled in the gap between the hall and main building, she watched as the human came out towards her.
&gt; She had decided to play possum, to see what he came out with rather than instigate anything herself.
&gt; &quot;Hi there, Toni isn&#039;t it?&quot; he asked cheerfully.
&gt; &quot;My name&#039;s Anon and I&#039;m one of the science teachers here.&quot;
&gt; She granted him a disinterested look as she puffed on her vape.
&gt; &quot;Yeah I&#039;m Toni, if you&#039;ve got any questions about the show then you can wait til I&#039;m back inside. Right now I&#039;m on a break.&quot;
&gt; He smiled, seemingly quite pleased with her answer.
&gt; &quot;Oh don&#039;t worry, I&#039;m not here about the cereal... I was actually looking to talk with you a bit if I could?&quot;
&gt; &quot;Oh?&quot; she responded, cocking a furry eyebrow.
&gt; &quot;Well, I was wondering, what&#039;s a girl like you doing as a mascot when you should be on stage somewhere? I mean, I was watching you in there and you&#039;re too good to just be doing this stuff...&quot;
&gt; She willingly took the bait.
&gt; &quot;You liked what you saw huh? You see anything else you liked?&quot;
&gt; His smile grew as he saw she was of like mind.
&gt; &quot;Must be dull, going from place to place and busting the same moves over and over... Care to maybe try a few new ones with me?&quot;
&gt; She pocketed the vape and smiled back, revealing her set of perfect pearly fangs.
&gt; &quot;Hmm sounds like fun, got somewhere in mind for us to dance Mr Anon?&quot;
&gt; He looked around, checking the surroundings before answering.
&gt; &quot;Actually, this is one of the most private places on site, wanna dance right here?&quot;
&gt; She didn&#039;t need to be asked twice, months of tedium and frustration having built up to near unbearable levels, her dam was fit to burst.
&gt; She pulled him in, her claws sinking into his stuffy teachers jacket as she smothered his lips with her own.
&gt; The taste of him on her tongue was enough to get her juices flowing, in more ways than one...
&gt; At first his hands were everywhere, pressing on her cheeks (both top and bottom sets), caressing her hips, exploring her back...
&gt; Eventually they came to rest on her waist, and he broke the hungry kiss panting.
&gt; &quot;Damn your hot...&quot; he muttered between breaths.
&gt; Toni wasn&#039;t in the mood for idle compliments however, her blood very much up and burning for more.
&gt; &quot;Shut up and fuck me!&quot; she hissed into his ear.
&gt; He didn&#039;t need to be told twice.
&gt; Reaching down, he pulled his belt apart and dropped his pants, freeing his sizeable member from his boxers in the same motion.
&gt; He was already rock hard and, much to her approval, eager to begin.
&gt; She quickly wriggled out of her tight shorts, undoing the clasp above the base of her tail with ease and dropping her moist panties with them.
&gt; It only took a wordless look between them to break the tension, and they were once again pulled together and lost in each other&#039;s embrace.
&gt; Despite their mutual need, Anon had trouble hitting his mark, he was taller than the tigress, she stood on her tip toes to meet him but it was a no go and he kept missing.
&gt; That meant he would have to lift her bodily off the floor or...
&gt; She pushed him back, enjoying the growing look of frustration on his flushed face.
&gt; She turned around to face the shed, bending slightly and pushing her toned but pleasantly sized rump into the air, her tail held aloft.
&gt; This gave him a clear line of sight to her dripping lips, the surrounding fur already soaked and ruffled.
&gt; He needed no further prompting.
&gt; Bending at the knees, he grabbed her by the hips and slid himself firmly into her from behind.
&gt; As he grunted in exertion and pleasure, she had to bite her lip to stop herself from screaming out.
&gt; This wasn&#039;t her first rodeo, but it was her first human.
&gt; Her heat had come on her mid circuit and she had been going nuts for days.
&gt; To her pleasant surprise he filled her almost completely, and although his smooth but textured member rippled across her inner walls it lacked the spikes she dreaded, it was a revelation.
&gt; She didn&#039;t have time to ponder all the differences however as the human pulled himself out to the tip and pushed back inside in quick succession.
&gt; The explosion of sensations nearly drove her to her knees, but she kept herself up through force of will, and with the screech of her claws scraping into the cheap metal sheeting on the shed wall.
&gt; He continued to pound himself into her, again and again, as she struggled to keep control.
&gt; As they fell into a sustainable rhythm she was able to move one hand from the wall and reach back, pulling one of his smooth human hands from her hip and directing it up and under her shirt.
&gt; He took the cue, feeling his way towards her plump breast and squeezing it tightly.
&gt; The result was a loud moan, released quite involuntarily from the depths of her throat.
&gt; Anon seemed to tense up, as if afraid the noise would attract someone from the hall.
&gt; No one came however, and the sudden lull in his attentions gave her the opening to playfully flick her hips back, jolting him back deeper inside and reminding him not to dawdle.
&gt; This had the effect of driving him to greater heights of activity, perhaps the fear of discovery was making him desperate, or hitting all his buttons.
&gt; He hit home harder and faster, an audible slapping sound echoed out from the confines of their hidey-hole as his hips forcibly connected with her rear again and again.
&gt; Her resolve faltered as the sensation became too much, her tongue lolled out from the side of her mouth and her eyes began to cross.
&gt; She couldn&#039;t suppress the needy moans and whimpers any longer as he finally began to scratch her long awaited itch.
&gt; Even as he started to mutter about being close she was already on her way, it was all she could do to hold on.
&gt; When he tensed, hilted himself entirely inside her, and groaned loudly, she felt him release his hot sticky seed deep within.
&gt; The sensation sent her over the edge, her walls reacting to each ropey coating as if electrocuted, writhing and contracting as her body sought to milk every last drop from him.
&gt; She moaned and mewled uncontrollably, whatever composure she had left shattering an falling to her feet to mix with the pooling juices there.
&gt; It couldn&#039;t have been more than for a few minutes, but an eternity of bliss stopped any new thoughts forming, until finally it was over.
&gt; Spent, Anon pulled himself from her, panting hard and staggering back slightly.
&gt; She turned and leaned back against the shed wall, out of breath but feeling a sense of liberation.
&gt; The two stood looking at one another for a moment, neither able to form a word between them but silently thanking the other.
&gt; Even as Toni wriggled back into her tight shorts, she knew she couldn&#039;t go back inside.
&gt; Her shorts were soaked with the product of their tryst and she was struggling to even stand up straight, dancing in front of another group of kids was just about impossible.
&gt; To her surprise however, Anon hadn&#039;t left after retrieving his pants.
&gt; &quot;That was... something else...&quot; he panted shakily.
&gt; &quot;If you want, I can go back in, tell them you&#039;re sick and bring your stuff to the car?&quot;
&gt; She nodded, not trusting herself to speak just yet.
&gt; So as he readjusted his tie, she stumbled back to her car, climbed in and waited.
&gt; In a few minutes he was there, with her props and stage crap packed and ready.
&gt; She popped the trunk and he placed it all in easily, slamming it shut again afterwards.
&gt; He looked at her sadly through the car window, the understanding that it was time for her to go.
&gt; Before she pulled away however, she tossed him a crumpled up piece of paper.
&gt; She sped off, even as he read it.
&gt; It was a phone number, accompanied by a little heart and a T.</textarea>
