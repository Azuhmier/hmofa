            RAW Paste Data        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;You never thought you&#039;d be so disappointed that you were going on a cruise.

&gt;When you initially received the news from your one of your close friends, you were stoked.
&gt;How often was it that you got the chance to go on a fucking cruise?
&gt;With your current job, not very often.
&gt;Your (arguably better off) friend explained that he&#039;d be covering all the expenses, so you could do whatever the hell you wanted for the four-day trip.
&gt;It all sounded too good to be true.

&gt;When the big day finally came, you quickly discovered that it was.

&quot;Why the fuck didn&#039;t you tell me it was a singles cruise?!&quot;

&gt;&quot;If I did, would you have agreed to it?&quot;

&quot;Hell no!&quot;

&gt;&quot;Exactly.&quot;

&gt;You resisted the urge to smack the fruity drink out of Kevin&#039;s hand.
&gt;You couldn&#039;t hate him, because you knew he believed he was doing something nice for you, but the anger and frustration was still there.
&gt;You&#039;d been single since high school, mostly due to you focusing on college and other more important (in your mind) things.
&gt;Kevin always gave you shit for it, but in the friendly, well-meaning way.
&gt;Still, he&#039;d try to set you up with a date every now and then.
&gt;He just wanted you to be happy, and you couldn&#039;t really blame him for that.
&gt;Nor could you really blame him for all the shitty ways those dates ended.
&gt;You seriously thought you had some kind of curse placed on you, resulting in every girl you dated just vanishing after (or even during) the first date.
&gt;Eventually, the disappointment just became too much for you, and you gave up on the dating scene all together.
&gt;You told Kevin to stop with the blind dates for a while, and he respected your wishes.

&gt;Or so you thought.

&gt;&quot;Alright, it was wrong of me to leave out the singles part. I&#039;m sorry. Still, it&#039;s a fucking cruise, Anon! You can still have fun! You don&#039;t even have to hook up with anyone if you don&#039;t want to!&quot;

&quot;Never said I didn&#039;t want to...&quot;
&gt;Deep down, you were craving a serious relationship. 
&gt;All the rejections and stand-ups had rendered you desperately lonely.
&gt;You wanted to believe that there was someone out there for you, but all the disappointments made you reconsider that philosophy.

&gt;Kevin puts a hand on your shoulder.
&gt;&quot;Look, Anon, don&#039;t worry about the past. You&#039;ll find someone, alright? And even if you don&#039;t, you&#039;ve still got me. That&#039;s worth something, right?&quot;

&gt;You smile.
&gt;Kevin had been your friend since 4th grade for a reason, and not just because he had a trampoline in his backyard.

&gt;&quot;...I&#039;m going to take your silence as a resounding &#039;yes.&#039; Now, what do you say we get this cruise started and hit the buffet?&quot;

&gt;You can&#039;t really say no to free food, so you nod.
&gt;After devouring as much of the buffet as the staff would allow, you and Kevin explore the rest of the ship. 
&gt;It&#039;s a bit small, as the trip is only a few days long, but it still has plenty to keep you entertained.
&gt;Restaurants, a sports bar, some dance clubs, a spa, a fitness center, etc.
&gt;Even if you didn&#039;t end up with a date at any point, you were still going to make the most out of this free vacation.

&gt;You spend the next few hours messing around, engaging in some cruise activities like bingo and trivia.
&gt;Kevin manages to hit it off with a fox.
&gt;A real fox, mind you; this cruise in particular is a mix of human and anthro passengers.
&gt;You have to give the cruise line credit for being progressive.
&gt;As good as a time you were having with Kevin and his new lady friend, it eventually ended when she asked him to accompany her to her room.
&gt;You told him it was fine if he wanted to go, and the two left the ice cream social eagerly.
&gt;You were happy to see Kevin was enjoying himself, but now you were alone for the next however long he and his date decided to hang out.
&gt;Since you were taking a break from dating, your social skills had all but atrophied, so talking to any other cruise-goers one-on-one was out of the question.

&gt;You resorted to just walking around the various decks, occasionally perusing the art gallery or getting some ice cream on the lido deck. 
&gt;As evening came around, there was still no sign of Kevin anywhere.
&gt;He must&#039;ve been having a lot of fun with his date.
&gt;You&#039;d be lying if you said you weren&#039;t jealous.
&gt;The fun you were having earlier fades from your memory as you ponder about just how lonely you truly are.
&gt;A cruise ship full of single women, and you don&#039;t feel like talking to any of them.
&gt;Some vacation.
&gt;Depressed, you decide to head back in the direction of your cabin, passing by one of the dance venues, full of partying humans and furs.

&gt;That&#039;s when you hear her voice.

Please don&#039;t talk about love tonight
Please don&#039;t talk about sweet love

&gt;It&#039;s coming from inside the club, carrying out into the hallway.
&gt;Your feet move on their own, taking you into the hustle and bustle.
&gt;As you push through the crowd of dancers, the voice and music become louder.

Please don&#039;t talk about bein&#039; true
And all the trouble we&#039;ve been through

&gt;You don&#039;t know what it is about that voice that draws you closer and closer.
&gt;It was smooth as silk and carried the tune of the song perfectly.
&gt;You don&#039;t get ASMR, but you have a feeling it&#039;s something similar to what you&#039;re feeling right now.

Please don&#039;t talk about all of the plans we had
For fixin&#039; this broken romance
I&#039;ve got to go where the people dance
I want some
Action
I want to live

&gt;Finally, you make your way to the front of the crowd.
&gt;You cast your gaze on the stage.
&gt;Front in center is the source of the voice that has you mysteriously entranced.
&gt;She&#039;s a bright blue macaw women, wearing a red dress that compliments her curvy figure.
&gt;You couldn&#039;t care less about her figure, though; you&#039;re more focused on her singing.

Action, I&#039;ve got so much to give
I&#039;ve got to give it
I want to get some too

&gt;The other club-goers around you continue dancing, while you stand completely still, watching the macaw perform.
&gt;You can tell that she&#039;s really into the song, swaying her hips to the beat as she sings.

I love the night life
I&#039;ve got to boogie
On the disco &#039;round

&gt;All you can do is just watch and listen.
&gt;You feel your heart pounding in your chest as the bird finishes her song.
&gt;The crowd erupts into applause and cheer as a human steps onto the stage.

&gt;&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for our very own Jewel of The Sea!&quot;

&gt;The woman gives a wave and a smile to the audience before leaving your sight.
&gt;The band starts up another song, and the crowd gets back to dancing.
&gt;You can&#039;t move; you&#039;re still processing the events that just took place.
&gt;Your heart is beating like a drunk redneck does to his wife, and your brain is muddled with thoughts of the macaw and her voice.

&gt;You expected to leave this cruise without much of an impact on your romantic life.
&gt;What you didn&#039;t expect was falling in love on the first night.

&gt;&quot;She used to be a model! Can you believe that?&quot;

&gt;You snap out of your daze, looking up at Kevin&#039;s excited face across the table.
&quot;Huh? Oh, yeah, that&#039;s cool.&quot;
&gt;You immediately go back to prodding the remains of your soggy waffles with your fork.
&gt;It&#039;s the morning after the first night on the ship.
&gt;While Kevin was going on about his night, your mind drifted back to the alluring macaw woman.
&gt;Ever since you saw her that night, you couldn&#039;t get her out of your head.
&gt;The remnants of her voice echoed endlessly in your brain.

&gt;&quot;Hey, you okay, dude? You seem kind of out of it.&quot;

&gt;Yeah, no kidding.
&gt;&quot;Yeah, I&#039;m fine. I&#039;m glad you had a fun night.&quot;
&gt;You avert your gaze, not wanting to look Kevin in the eye.
&gt;That serves to be a mistake, as you suddenly notice the very same macaw sitting not a few tables away.
&gt;She&#039;s happily chatting with a few of the band members, but she doesn&#039;t seem to notice you.
&gt;You freeze up, nearly dropping your fork.

&gt;Kevin takes notice right away and turns to see just what was affecting you.
&gt;He scans the room for a bit before turning back to you and gesturing to the macaw.
&gt;&quot;Friend of yours?&quot;

&gt;You shake your head.
&quot;No, she&#039;s just the singer at one of the clubs. Saw her perform last night and I recognized her.&quot;
&gt;You busy yourself by grabbing another bite of waffle, keeping your head down.
&gt;Even without looking at Kevin, you&#039;re pretty sure he&#039;s gone back to looking at her.

&gt;&quot;She&#039;s pretty cute. Why don&#039;t you go talk to her?&quot;

&quot;Fuck no.&quot;

&gt;&quot;Come on, Anon, this could be your chance. You guys might hit it off.&quot;

&quot;And if we don&#039;t?&quot;

&gt;Kevin shrugs.
&gt;&quot;There&#039;s other fish in the sea. Or...birds in the tree, if you prefer.&quot;

&gt;That actually gets a smile out of you.
&gt;A small one, but it&#039;s still there.
&gt;You set your fork down and look up at Kevin.
&gt;He gives you a &quot;you got this&quot; look.
&gt;You take a sip of orange juice.
&gt;Fuck it.

&gt;You push yourself up and out of your chair, taking a deep breath. 
&gt;Kevin smiles.
&gt;You begin approaching the band&#039;s table.
&gt;You feel your heart starting to pound in your chest.
&gt;Your forehead feels sweaty.
&gt;You think of what to say to introduce yourself.
&gt;&#039;Hey, your show was pretty good.&#039;
&gt;PRETTY good? It was way better than that!
&gt;&#039;Hey, I tought your show last night was amazing.&#039;
&gt;No, too forward.
&gt;You&#039;re five steps away from her table.
&gt;Four.
&gt;Three.
&gt;Two.
&gt;One...

&gt;You reach the table.
&gt;Your feet don&#039;t stop moving.
&gt;You keep walking.
&gt;You head for the exit.
&gt;The macaw didn&#039;t even notice you.
&gt;You just keep walking, not even looking back to gauge Kevin&#039;s reaction to your bail.
&gt;You start down the stairs.
&gt;You make it all the way to your stateroom.
&gt;You open the door.
&gt;You crawl into bed.
&gt;You decide to spend the rest of the cruise here.</textarea>
