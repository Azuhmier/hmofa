However, the feeling of warmth is an addictive sensation, making even the slightest chill give you the desire to return to its comforting embrace like a drunkard to their mug.

You relax more into your small lover and interlock your fingers with hers, her fast but soon slowing heartbeat thrumming like a drum. With the backdrop of the wind outside and the crackle of the fire, her singing threatens to sap you of all energy and force you into slumber in an instant. You can feel her naked tail curl and wrap itself around your waist, her singing momentarily paused with a breath as she shifts herself closer to you. Finally, after several minutes of her mix of mystical chanting and song it comes to a soothing end, thankfully right as you begin to struggle to keep your eyes open. A relieved sigh leaves her as she rests her head under your chin, her thin ears tickling your cheeks as she positions herself. Before you fall asleep, you lean your mouth to her ear and whisper, &quot;I love you.&quot; And in the same soothing tone, she responds, &quot;I love you too.&quot;</div></li></ol>        </div>
