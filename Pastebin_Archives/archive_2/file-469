More often than not such relationships are forged under the duress of ambush, combat and saving one another’s lives. Men and women finding comfort, safety and camaraderie in one another, blossoming into true brotherhood or, perhaps, even love. Heck, just take a look at any odd couples in the city or in the outskirts with their own businesses. Those two half-orc men owning the Staggered Boar, bickering at each other at the butcher’s and the baker’s shop for their groceries and supplies, met under martial trials and stuck together well into older age, closer to each other than even brothers. That smith down Steel Alley, who happily settled here with his dwarven wife for goodness knows how long, found her after a particular stint in one of the undercities, and they stuck together since. Or the halfling priestesses of Desna at the local orphanage, having travelled together since they were wee lasses and stuck together for tales of high adventure that they still recount to the children to this day. All met under fortunate omens, and their shared hardships and conquests kept them close together even as they retired from the hazards of high adventure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	In that regard, Alexander the Auspicious and Akirabaki met under similar circumstances. One passed the town of the other. Stories were shared. A spark flew between them. She took her father’s barding and fled away from her teachings as an acolyte for the promise of adventure. And off they went for stories to make of their own. Sure, it took a while for the horses to stop being spooked around the weaver. And most people didn’t take kindly to Archaelites (which is a silly moniker to consider, as elves aren’t called Calistrans, or dwarves Toragdans) right off the bat. Come to think of it, plenty of people still don’t. But eventually, the troupe took Akirabaki in among their own, a capable young weaver with a head for history, and a fuzzy touch that could heal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Maybe Alexander always had an eye for the peculiar. Certainly, he had the ease around women that would be commonly attributed to outgoing bards and dashing rogues. But the tall and stately black-haired young man eventually fell head over heels for the donkey-sized giant spider, dressed in dark leather barding that made her snowy white coat stand out all the brighter. In  a sense, she anchored him and actually made him a happier person. Aki, for her part, was smitten by him from the get-go, fond of humans and elves (and to a lesser degree the dour Stonas, but even that old crotchety dwarf gave a damn about the cleric of Archael) with an unquenchable sense of curiosity. They could talk at length for hours, well into the night.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Yes; under the right stars, fighting back to back with one another, through hardships that stretched far along the western coast of Casmaron –and– Avistan alike that Alexander and Aki conquered alongside their friends and allies, the two have grown closer together than anyone could have rightly imagined. A Brevic wizard and a Vudran she-spider. With riches amassed over their journeys, and with friends (and certainly a few foes still left) made across the continent, the two chose to settle sometime when the first gray streaks entered the hairs of the human wizard. Sure, it took some adjusting, and most people still are weary of the giant spiders among us. But few can deny the loyalty and skills a weaver brings, inhuman spider-y appearance notwithstanding.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Alexander shed his title, and over the years became known as Alexander the Tailor. Akirabaki, for her part, surprised many when Alexander entrusted customers just where the treated silk came from. It’s an honest living, occasionally made easier and more comfortable when adventurers came about to look for enchanted linen or silks, or with some gear that could use fixing or modification and some enchanting. Though at times they were met with curious or weary eyes when Aki sauntered into the shop, carrying supplies or cloth across her back. Particularly from other weavers. After all, few spiders wear great golden rings along their pedipalps and the patellas of her walking legs – such is usually only a sign of a very well-off and married ground weaver female.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	And in a sense, isn’t Akirabaki just that?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	The evening approaches again, the shop closes up. A few new orders have come in from the local guard for enchanted garbs of protection, with Akirabaki finishing up a last few stitches on a shirt until the bearded, dark-haired visage of Alexander peers around the wall to check on her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“Dinner’s about ready, fuzzy.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	The nickname stuck over the years. And he’s the only one that makes it sound sensual. It makes her twitch pleasantly from her spinnerets all the way through her abdomen. Pulling the cloth from her chelicerae and her pointed fangs, she stretches it across the low work bench with her pedipalps. Aki rises up on her large, hairy walking legs, scuttling out of the work chamber towards the front of the shop, bumping up against Alexander with her abdomen until he lightly runs his fingers through the thick, plush fur of her hindquarters.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“Good, I’m famished. That shilvered thread ish sush a hasshle to work with, you know,” the snowy weaver responds with fluttering maxillae and labium. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Alexander turns about to join Aki, making their way past a curtain separating the storefront from their living space. Quite a lot of considerations had to be made when they settled – wide openings in the walls, a lack of doors where they could be spared, and open space for that big spider butt (her words) to turn around in. All in all, really, the interior made for a spacious, almost Katapeshi interior, down to the sheer amount of soft pillows strewn about in corners of the house.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“Yes,” Alexander agrees with her, “but three shirts with silver thread in a day? You haven’t lost your touch.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“I would hope sho!” the weaver responds immediately. It’s always hard to say if that’s pride speaking or annoyance until you can feel the feet tap on the wooden floor. Ah, there they go, lightly rustling with every step. “I would hate to end up an old biddy thish shoon.” Akirabaki’s stance widens and exaggerates with twitchy, slow forward motions of her front-most walking legs, causing Alexander to burst out in laughter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“Come on, fuzzy, you’re younger than I am, and you’ll end up older than me yet.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Aki recovers from her playful pantomime, trying not to hard to think about that particular sad fact of life.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“Sho what’sh for dinner, Aleksh?” she lisps through her mouthparts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“Stuffed peahen with that aged dwarf cheese and the spring onions we’ve been pickling,” he responds in turn, moving ahead of the large spider. His hands brush along her bent knees, just above the rings she wears. The weaver shivers again with a pleasant tingle running all the way up her abdomen again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“Peahen? Are you courting me, shir?” she asks with a low tone of voice, slowly wandering towards the centre of the room where a low table has been placed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“And what’s wrong with making your favourite fowl every once in a while?” the wizard shoots back from over his shoulder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Aki remains stationary, shuffling a few pillows aside to comfortably seat her abdomen and sternum while Alexander is making sure the birds he had been cooking are sufficiently done – and rare enough, for that matter. His voice takes on an otherworldly tone for a moment, adjusting the meat of the game birds with a minor Prestidigitation for flavour, with the snowy spider just soaking in the smells wafting through the house. He’s not the best chef, but nothing a little magic can’t fix, right? He cuts the two birds, taking legs and wings apart from the otherwise whole hens, and some bread for the sauce to soak into, while the fat, stuffed birds themselves are all hers. Nothing wrong with making her favourite meal every once in a while, after all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	The meal is set across the table, and the weaver thumps her abdomen against the pillows quite excitedly, her large chelicerae fidgeting just in front of her obscured mouth. Alexander regards his wife with a fond smile, those eight little onyx beads of hers twitching just slightly from her otherwise expressionless pale face. Then, in a flash, those muscular pedipalps latch onto the first game bird, pulling the hen between her mandibles. Her voice is obscured by the hen while her mouthparts slowly make chewing motions – ah, she’s grabbing the bird, rather - with a content and deep hum leaving the weaver as she takes in a first mouthful of liquefying meat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Sure, evening meals tend to be quiet affairs with one half of the couple sucking down the bird’s innards and stuffing gingerly, but they’ve been busy all day, anyway. And it’s the shared calm that matters most. Alexander enjoys his meal while Aki is enjoying hers, devouring the innards and the greased hide of the hen whole. The first words actually leaving him are another casting of Prestidigitation to heat up the second hen’s carcass for Aki right as she finishes up, brushing her mouthparts over one another to get the sauces off her white coat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“Ish perfect, Aleksh. I haven’t had that in a while.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	The wizard smiles over at the large spider, gently brushing a hand across the pedipalps set on the table. “Ah, so I haven’t lost my touch just yet,” he notes with a chuckle. Aki lightly raises his hand and holds it up between her two manipulating legs, gently scratching his palm and the back of his hand with the small claws on the tips of her pedipalps.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“I would hope sho,” she says with a hint of amusement that he can read from the way her feet ruffle against the floor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Alexander slowly pulls his hand from her manipulators, tensing his fingertips against the dull black claws at the end of her right pedipalp. “Meal first, courting later, Akirabaki. You’ve been working all day. Figured you deserved a little extra for the way you’ve been working with that silvered thread.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“That,” Aki notes, this time more slowly grabbing the game hen from the centre of the table to bring it towards her mouthparts, “and probably the advanshe pay from the conshtubalary.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“That, and appreciating every little bit of extra effort you put into your craft, fuzzy.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Oh, shivers again. The weaver fidgets where she sits, slowly drawing her meal between her chelicerae again. The wizard leans back, carefully pulling the meat from another leg with his teeth. Both just soak in each other’s presence and the tastes of a good meal. By the time all that’s left of the peahens is a few stretches of neck and head and the bones, the wizard already makes his prep to clean. The weaver, however, has other plans. Barely did Alexander turn around from the table or he found himself tackled from behind by a three hundred pound amorous giant spider, clutching his waist with the pedipalps and the frontmost pair of legs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“And where do you think you’re going, hushband?” the weaver rumbles low, letting her larger legs slowly curl inwards along his thighs. She pulls back, and the wizard finds it hard not to walk back with Aki.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“Well, to the pillows, apparently,” Alexander notes with a chuckle. So much for cleaning.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“To the pillowsh,” Aki agrees, pulling back along the human’s waist until her plodding, long legs pull them both into the darker corner of what makes up their bed space. Just a giant mound of soft, comfy cushions, half of which filled with the silky white hairs from Akirabaki’s own exoskeleton. With a quick twist of her entire body, Alexander finds himself tossed back into the mound laughing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	She’s rubbing her chelicerae together anxiously, her eyes tensing in their sockets. The spider pushes Alexander down with her two front pairs of legs, her pedipalps traversing across his shirt for his weather-worn bronzed skin. That’s where Alexander slowly lets his own hands wander across his clothing, unclasping the buttons of his shirt where her relatively clumsy pedipalps cannot manage with those small things. Ever so carefully, the weaver pulls the man’s clothing off from his shoulders and his flanks, until her large, monstrous visage is level with his face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Alexander reaches up with a hand to just past the hand-sized sharp incisors of her fangs, brushing the soft downy fur of her mandibles with his fingers until his hand pushes the right chelicera away. Where the spotless white hair thins and grows shorter, rosy red fuzz and dark brown and black skin reside. Soft flesh that twitches against the wizard’s gentle touch, unafraid of the otherwise alien woman hovering above him. He leans up towards the spread mouthparts, his fingers circling the muscular rounded mouth of his wife until he gently parts rostrum and labium. His face sinks between the fluffy mandibles, and he kisses the weaver deeply. Aki lets out a ruffling noise from below, her pedipalps slinking around the back of his head, caressing his dark hair tenderly  while her mouthparts tense and relax. Her fangs settle just across her lover’s shoulder blades, pulling him ever closer with the tiniest pricks of her sharp teeth. The lack of a tongue made reciprocation a little awkward at first, but Aki finds her slow caresses and stroking of the human’s sleek hair to give him all the incentive he needs to let his tongue wander around her shallow mouth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	When Alexander pulls back from Aki, she carefully draws her chelicerae high up and her fangs away from his back. He settles into the pillows, keeping his hands just beneath her mouthparts, stroking down along her hairless sternum, outwards to the prosomal hide and along the swells of her legs’ coxae. For a while, the two regard each other as the wizard caresses the giant spider’s lower half of her cephalothorax, until she leans against his chin and chest with her fluffy chelicerae.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“Take your pantsh off,” she lisps with a soft, low voice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Alexander heeds, lowering his hands down his own body to remove his belt and loosen the waistline of his trousers. The weaver slinks back, her upper body slightly tensing up and down to regard the tailor steadily disrobing himself. The boots come off, revealing his suntanned feet to her. The pants slide off his long legs, his erection bobbing against the waistband until it snaps straight upwards to her. Her pedipalps draw the trousers down until he can kick his legs out of them, dressed in little more than the shirt still clinging to his arms and back. That’s when Aki pushes him down into the pillows with her pedipalps and frontmost legs, humming pleasantly down at the prone man. Her bulk and her limbs turn him around to be on his side. He already knows what’s next, turning further around to his stomach.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“Put your handsh behind your back.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	This wouldn’t be the first time that he had her hold him pinned and slowly twist her large, fluffy rump around on him, tensing the black and white coloured plump spinnerets to his bare wrists. How those hindmost legs then twist a sticky, firm strands of silk from those gooey little spinners, wrapping them around his hands and wrists. Further he feels the sticky silk wrap around him, his muscular stomach getting covered in a light film of strong webbing that barely gives his arms space. He’s seated back into the pillows, facing his wife who’s finishing up the weave of his upper limbs until she can regard his squirming, tanned form with satisfaction. His long limbs have worn to firm muscles, and though the lack of sprinting and forced marching did do a number on what once was a toned abdomen, he still looks every bit as delicious as he did when they first travelled together.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	The weaver leans down towards Alexander’s groin, tensing and ruffling her fluffy chelicerae over one another anxiously as she nears his turgid erection. Her fangs tense against their covers as she spreads her mouthpieces apart before him, her throat letting out a playful ‘aaah~’</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“Please don’t tease me, fuzzy,” Alexander pleads, biting his lower lip. He regards those eight unblinking eyes with doting affection. He’s helpless to her teasing. And she knows it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Akirabaki sinks down her cephalothorax towards his spread groin, letting her pedipalps wander across his firm pectorals and the faint cover of light and dark hair across his chest. His prick brushes against sensitive little hairs, and soon is suffused in heated breath. Then comes moisture, and a slow clenching. The feeling of her hardened lower lip against his root. Alexander groans out low, tensing his thighs and threatening to thrust upwards into her mouth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	The weaver pulls back coyly, ruffling her feet against the floor. “My pashe,” she reminds him. “Now shtay put, Aleksh. Let fusshy take care of thish...”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Alex can’t help but moan appreciatively when she returns her alien mouth to his erection, letting the muscular ring twitch and squeeze around his organ’s tip. How agonizingly slow she is to return to swallowing his entire length. As she pulls back once more, he can hear her moan and lisp in those low, dulcette tones.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“Tashty.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Another slow lewd suck that ends with a moist pop from his cock pulling free from her mouth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“Shalty.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	She sinks down once more on him, her pedipalps wandering over his throat and cheeks, down across his chest, towards his sides. Her claws scratch him tenderly, holding on to him closely as she bobs forward and back with her entire body to suck him down. When she pulls back again, the tip of his organ is covered in a mixture of weaver slobber and his own pre.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“Messhy.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	The wizard tenses his thighs, pressing back against two of her legs holding his own legs down. But he’s not of the mind to struggle –too– much, instead letting Akirabaki set the pace to which she swallows his staff. Her shallow mouth feels like a slick little vent that has him aching against her eager fellatio. Her abdomen visibly swells when she keeps him down in her throat, bobbing bodily back and forth. It’s only when her legs remove themselves from his thighs that Alexander starts to return his thrusts in time to his wife’s moving body, sinking to the root into her silken maw. Even his testicles are lathering in spider spittle when he pumps up past her wide-open labium and rostrum. A low moan spreads through Aki, the vibrations coursing back up through to Alexander. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	His hips hump up towards her faster and faster, Aki finding it difficult to match his speed. The weaver returns her legs to his thighs, pinning him down against the cushions while she pumps her own self bodily up and down his cock, bumping her fuzzy mandibles against his groin and hips with every downwards stroke. Alexander moans out incoherently, throwing his head back in helpless abandon. Aki recognizes the signs of him getting closer. She doubles her efforts, tensing her throat around him, swallowing him as well as her maw allows her to. Her pedipalps wander across his hips, pulling him in closer towards herself. When the wizard can’t take it anymore, he tenses and lets out a short shout, until his voice trails off in a series of groans and breathing in through clenched teeth. His seed surges forth from him, deep into the back of Aki’s mouth. She slowly, oh so slowly, pulls herself from him, her mouthparts feeling bruised at the seams of her joints. But the warmth, the salty taste of his release makes things quite worth it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	She slurps lewdly, parting her various mouthparts to him to show just how much of a mess he’s made of her mouth. But outside of some frothy pre, all of it has gone well down her gullet. She closes her labium and rostrum again, rubbing her chelicerae over one another to start cleaning herself off with again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“I love the way you move when you come, Aleksh,” Akirabaki murmurs up at her husband, rubbing her face and mandibles into his stomach. The wizard, for his part, is just left breathing hard and laboured, needing a little reprieve before he can consider answering. The spider lowers her mouth back to his softening member, carefully brushing her chelicerae across his skin, cleaning him off, too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“You’re absolutely shameless about this, huh?” he finally says, rolling his head a moment before he glances back down at the snowy white weaver. “Sucking me off like that.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“Yesssh,” the weaver hisses out between her mouthparts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“You love fucking me with your face.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Another hiss leaves the weaver as she agrees with Alexander.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“Well how about you untie me and I repay you the favour, Aki?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“How about I make shure you’re rearing to go firsht before I unwrap my preshent?” the weaver asks back saucily, flashing her husband the inside of her mouth again. He can feel his softening prick start to grow firm, though it’s nothing compared to the thrum of Aki’s voice speaking in her own tongue, and for her left pedipalp to faintly glow from the tips of every one of her hairs. She brings her manipulator to his stomach, infusing her man with a small touch of positive, invigorating energy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Alexander groans out as he feels himself grow hard within a moment, his dark erection growing fat and firm once more. Every vein, every uneven bump, everything feels hard to the weaver’s wandering chelicerae. She rubs him, breathes over him, feels his heat and moistened shaft against her insides. But Aki relents, slowly pulling aside to start tearing at the silk with her fangs and with her own spittle to dissolve portions of it around his abdomen. The wizard steadily frees himself from his wife’s web, until he’s pulling himself up to sit in front of the snowy white spider.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“You. On your back. Now.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	There’s some trepidation from Aki. That’s natural – no spider, not even intelligent magical giant spiders, willingly goes up on their backs. But the edge of danger that’s coursing through the weaver’s veins has her slowly step back and lie down in the mound of pillows until her man is rolling her past her side, over her own legs, until she’s flat on her back. Her legs stiffen and curl inwards. Her abdomen shifts, the air rushing past her trachea as she breathes ever faster. She can’t see that well, upside-down, with no way to even turn herself around to see what’s going on. She only knows he’s to her right. That she’s safe. That her man is here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Then comes the warm, broad hands of her Alexander across the swell of her pedicel. The tips of his fingers press into her naked flesh. Brushing up towards the fluffy coat of white across her abdomen. Inwards across her epigynal mound, and way out away from her vulva towards the rosy red hairs surrounding her book lungs. His fingers brush the coarser, shorter hairs, though his breath runs hot across her own tensing breathing gills. She whimpers softly to his careful explorative touches, brushing his fingers through her thick fur, tracing further down her tensing abdomen until he’s caressing her twitching spinnerets.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“Are you comfy, fuzzy?” he asks with a soft voice, so unlike his harsh command and the dirty talk before.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“I will be. Shtroke me shome more?” Aki speaks just as softly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	The wizard gives a chuckle, rising up to press his body against the vulnerable and slightly anxious spider’s cephalothorax and abdomen. His left hand wanders across her soft fur coating her exoskeleton, though he seems to pay more attention to rubbing just past her mouthparts with his right hand’s fingers, letting her suck on his digits while he strokes the sensitive chelicerae. Her breath only hitches when his left hand finds the meaty, plump and hairless epigyne. A black and red protrusion of flesh just barely poking out of her abdomen and from her fur – all puffy mostly due to Alexander’s gentle ministrations and the mounting excitement.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	His fingers dip first in her left ventricle, following the furrow of her flesh until his fingers push the pliant flesh apart to push into soft, warm and very much moist spider pussy. Her book lungs and trachea sigh out with a deep exhalation that causes her abdomen to deflate. Alexander pauses only so much until he’s sure Aki is calm before his pointer and middle finger slowly push in and out of her tight hole.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Leaning in with his face, his moustache and lips brush along the slightly rose scented spider vulva until his lips kiss across the rightmost vent of her epigyne. Aki actually squeaks out when his lips continue to wander across the swollen flesh of her mound, letting his tongue wander into her joined oviduct and spermatheca.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	The weaver squeaks out, her legs tensing inwards. She loves his fingers. His tongue. No weaver could ever match the touch of a human’s fingers. No elf could fall in love with a spider, no dwarf could truly appreciate an arachnid. But this human loves her. Worships her. Gods above she’s moaning out to this human wandering his hard and soft feeling and tasting organs across –both– of her openings at once! Her voice quivers as his flesh probes deep into her. Alexander rises up along her abdomen, embracing her pedicel with his arms. His face stays level with her epigyne, kissing each opening in turn, tasting her twitching holes. The she-spider cries out louder when he pulls his face back from her mound, wordlessly squirming for more. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	He stops, however, instead lifting himself over her prone and vulnerable form. He lowers himself, his thighs spread around the junction of her cephalothorax and her abdomen, until he finds himself angling to her epigyne. His naked body grinds down and up along her fuzzy stomach, until he angles his firm rod to her slightly larger right ventricle. Her abdomen arches up just slightly to meet with him. Then he sinks himself into his wife, slowly but steadily, until she’s keening out for him. Her legs arch behind his back, pressing down against his ribs and spine. He pulls out of her a few inches, only for him to push back inside until he’s in her moist vent to the root. His lips wander across the hairless sternum, hard exoskeleton surrounded by a thin border of reddened skin. Skin he kisses in lieu of a mouth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Akirabaki yowls out for her man, filling her like no weaver could ever do. His turgid spear spreads her clenching oviduct wide. His knees press into her flanks for purchase, pulling out once more until the next thrust fills her until she sees stars. Her body is deliciously warm and moist inside, her contractions no match for any humanoid he’s had the pleasure of bedding. The years didn’t make the act any less earnest or passionate. He pushes himself up against her sternum at last, and fucks her in earnest. Aki’s face – well, her mouthparts, chelicerae and fangs – contorts and moves with the tiniest of contractions as she loses herself in ever mounting pleasure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	The wizard’s hips roll and hump into the weaver’s heavily expanding and contracting abdomen, her epigyne even pushing outwards from her body somewhat in her awkward arching pose. Every inward stroke is joined with the lewd squelching sound from both her juicy vents. She’s the first to squeal and tense, her legs pressing harshly down on his back and never pulling away from him, every juicy bit of her abdomen twitching in pleasure with his every buck and thrust. Her voice cracks and lisps from her hapless maw, until her husband joins with rhythmic grunts and harder rutting thrusts. His hips smack and grind into her body until he stays put, letting the orgasming weaver’s contractions finish him off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	With one final loud grunt and a hiss through clenched teeth, Alexander collapses on top of the upturned Aki, his buttocks twitching and clenching as his seed spills into the snowy white weaver.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	They stay like that for a good while, breathing slowly and steadily, regaining their senses. Human fingers wander through soft, luscious fur, caressing along the long, slender limbs that limply fan out to her sides. He kisses Aki’s sternum a few times before he slowly dislodges from her moist, oozing quim, sliding off from her abdomen and cephalothorax, ever mindful of her legs. After he sits himself in the mound of pillows, Aki begins to stir. With some effort, her hindmost legs twist and push her to turn to her side. Her frontmost legs catch herself. A final stretch of her limbs has her stand back on all eight of her legs again, though wobbly, and very much pleasantly sore. Her coat all along the dorsal sides of her segmented body looks muzzy and unkempt.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	The white spider slowly scuttles to her husband’s side, pressing her right side into his right affectionately. She lays her cephalothorax down across her husband’s lap, her unblinking eyes staring up at him lovingly. He strokes her languidly with one hand, his left stretching out from the spider and towards a small cabinet. His Mage’s Hand grasps invisibly around a broad hairbrush, levitating the object towards the wizard’s open and outstretched hand. Aki giggles with a low tone of voice when she feels the firm bundles of ox hair move through her silky soft coat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“You haven’t losht your toush, Aleksh,” Aki says tiredly. Her legs ruffle across her man’s bare legs, pressing herself down against his lap.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	“I would certainly hope so, fuzzy,” the wizard says with a warm, low tone himself, slowly beginning to straighten his happily shivering wife’s coat out.</div></li></ol>        </div>

	It’s not uncommon for those that have taken up arms together to stay together – adventuring and exploration pretty much come from such lucky circumstance leading to lasting ties. More often than not such relationships are forged under the duress of ambush, combat and saving one another’s lives. Men and women finding comfort, safety and camaraderie in one another, blossoming into true brotherhood or, perhaps, even love. Heck, just take a look at any odd couples in the city or in the outskirts with their own businesses. Those two half-orc men owning the Staggered Boar, bickering at each other at the butcher’s and the baker’s shop for their groceries and supplies, met under martial trials and stuck together well into older age, closer to each other than even brothers. That smith down Steel Alley, who happily settled here with his dwarven wife for goodness knows how long, found her after a particular stint in one of the undercities, and they stuck together since. Or the halfling priestesses of Desna at the local orphanage, having travelled together since they were wee lasses and stuck together for tales of high adventure that they still recount to the children to this day. All met under fortunate omens, and their shared hardships and conquests kept them close together even as they retired from the hazards of high adventure.

	In that regard, Alexander the Auspicious and Akirabaki met under similar circumstances. One passed the town of the other. Stories were shared. A spark flew between them. She took her father’s barding and fled away from her teachings as an acolyte for the promise of adventure. And off they went for stories to make of their own. Sure, it took a while for the horses to stop being spooked around the weaver. And most people didn’t take kindly to Archaelites (which is a silly moniker to consider, as elves aren’t called Calistrans, or dwarves Toragdans) right off the bat. Come to think of it, plenty of people still don’t. But eventually, the troupe took Akirabaki in among their own, a capable young weaver with a head for history, and a fuzzy touch that could heal.

	Maybe Alexander always had an eye for the peculiar. Certainly, he had the ease around women that would be commonly attributed to outgoing bards and dashing rogues. But the tall and stately black-haired young man eventually fell head over heels for the donkey-sized giant spider, dressed in dark leather barding that made her snowy white coat stand out all the brighter. In  a sense, she anchored him and actually made him a happier person. Aki, for her part, was smitten by him from the get-go, fond of humans and elves (and to a lesser degree the dour Stonas, but even that old crotchety dwarf gave a damn about the cleric of Archael) with an unquenchable sense of curiosity. They could talk at length for hours, well into the night.

	Yes; under the right stars, fighting back to back with one another, through hardships that stretched far along the western coast of Casmaron –and– Avistan alike that Alexander and Aki conquered alongside their friends and allies, the two have grown closer together than anyone could have rightly imagined. A Brevic wizard and a Vudran she-spider. With riches amassed over their journeys, and with friends (and certainly a few foes still left) made across the continent, the two chose to settle sometime when the first gray streaks entered the hairs of the human wizard. Sure, it took some adjusting, and most people still are weary of the giant spiders among us. But few can deny the loyalty and skills a weaver brings, inhuman spider-y appearance notwithstanding.

	Alexander shed his title, and over the years became known as Alexander the Tailor. Akirabaki, for her part, surprised many when Alexander entrusted customers just where the treated silk came from. It’s an honest living, occasionally made easier and more comfortable when adventurers came about to look for enchanted linen or silks, or with some gear that could use fixing or modification and some enchanting. Though at times they were met with curious or weary eyes when Aki sauntered into the shop, carrying supplies or cloth across her back. Particularly from other weavers. After all, few spiders wear great golden rings along their pedipalps and the patellas of her walking legs – such is usually only a sign of a very well-off and married ground weaver female.

	And in a sense, isn’t Akirabaki just that?

	The evening approaches again, the shop closes up. A few new orders have come in from the local guard for enchanted garbs of protection, with Akirabaki finishing up a last few stitches on a shirt until the bearded, dark-haired visage of Alexander peers around the wall to check on her.

	“Dinner’s about ready, fuzzy.”

	The nickname stuck over the years. And he’s the only one that makes it sound sensual. It makes her twitch pleasantly from her spinnerets all the way through her abdomen. Pulling the cloth from her chelicerae and her pointed fangs, she stretches it across the low work bench with her pedipalps. Aki rises up on her large, hairy walking legs, scuttling out of the work chamber towards the front of the shop, bumping up against Alexander with her abdomen until he lightly runs his fingers through the thick, plush fur of her hindquarters.

	“Good, I’m famished. That shilvered thread ish sush a hasshle to work with, you know,” the snowy weaver responds with fluttering maxillae and labium. 

	Alexander turns about to join Aki, making their way past a curtain separating the storefront from their living space. Quite a lot of considerations had to be made when they settled – wide openings in the walls, a lack of doors where they could be spared, and open space for that big spider butt (her words) to turn around in. All in all, really, the interior made for a spacious, almost Katapeshi interior, down to the sheer amount of soft pillows strewn about in corners of the house.

	“Yes,” Alexander agrees with her, “but three shirts with silver thread in a day? You haven’t lost your touch.”

	“I would hope sho!” the weaver responds immediately. It’s always hard to say if that’s pride speaking or annoyance until you can feel the feet tap on the wooden floor. Ah, there they go, lightly rustling with every step. “I would hate to end up an old biddy thish shoon.” Akirabaki’s stance widens and exaggerates with twitchy, slow forward motions of her front-most walking legs, causing Alexander to burst out in laughter.

	“Come on, fuzzy, you’re younger than I am, and you’ll end up older than me yet.” 

	Aki recovers from her playful pantomime, trying not to hard to think about that particular sad fact of life.

	“Sho what’sh for dinner, Aleksh?” she lisps through her mouthparts.

	“Stuffed peahen with that aged dwarf cheese and the spring onions we’ve been pickling,” he responds in turn, moving ahead of the large spider. His hands brush along her bent knees, just above the rings she wears. The weaver shivers again with a pleasant tingle running all the way up her abdomen again.

	“Peahen? Are you courting me, shir?” she asks with a low tone of voice, slowly wandering towards the centre of the room where a low table has been placed. 

	“And what’s wrong with making your favourite fowl every once in a while?” the wizard shoots back from over his shoulder.

	Aki remains stationary, shuffling a few pillows aside to comfortably seat her abdomen and sternum while Alexander is making sure the birds he had been cooking are sufficiently done – and rare enough, for that matter. His voice takes on an otherworldly tone for a moment, adjusting the meat of the game birds with a minor Prestidigitation for flavour, with the snowy spider just soaking in the smells wafting through the house. He’s not the best chef, but nothing a little magic can’t fix, right? He cuts the two birds, taking legs and wings apart from the otherwise whole hens, and some bread for the sauce to soak into, while the fat, stuffed birds themselves are all hers. Nothing wrong with making her favourite meal every once in a while, after all.

	The meal is set across the table, and the weaver thumps her abdomen against the pillows quite excitedly, her large chelicerae fidgeting just in front of her obscured mouth. Alexander regards his wife with a fond smile, those eight little onyx beads of hers twitching just slightly from her otherwise expressionless pale face. Then, in a flash, those muscular pedipalps latch onto the first game bird, pulling the hen between her mandibles. Her voice is obscured by the hen while her mouthparts slowly make chewing motions – ah, she’s grabbing the bird, rather - with a content and deep hum leaving the weaver as she takes in a first mouthful of liquefying meat.

	Sure, evening meals tend to be quiet affairs with one half of the couple sucking down the bird’s innards and stuffing gingerly, but they’ve been busy all day, anyway. And it’s the shared calm that matters most. Alexander enjoys his meal while Aki is enjoying hers, devouring the innards and the greased hide of the hen whole. The first words actually leaving him are another casting of Prestidigitation to heat up the second hen’s carcass for Aki right as she finishes up, brushing her mouthparts over one another to get the sauces off her white coat.

	“Ish perfect, Aleksh. I haven’t had that in a while.”

	The wizard smiles over at the large spider, gently brushing a hand across the pedipalps set on the table. “Ah, so I haven’t lost my touch just yet,” he notes with a chuckle. Aki lightly raises his hand and holds it up between her two manipulating legs, gently scratching his palm and the back of his hand with the small claws on the tips of her pedipalps.

	“I would hope sho,” she says with a hint of amusement that he can read from the way her feet ruffle against the floor.

	Alexander slowly pulls his hand from her manipulators, tensing his fingertips against the dull black claws at the end of her right pedipalp. “Meal first, courting later, Akirabaki. You’ve been working all day. Figured you deserved a little extra for the way you’ve been working with that silvered thread.”

	“That,” Aki notes, this time more slowly grabbing the game hen from the centre of the table to bring it towards her mouthparts, “and probably the advanshe pay from the conshtubalary.”

	“That, and appreciating every little bit of extra effort you put into your craft, fuzzy.”

	Oh, shivers again. The weaver fidgets where she sits, slowly drawing her meal between her chelicerae again. The wizard leans back, carefully pulling the meat from another leg with his teeth. Both just soak in each other’s presence and the tastes of a good meal. By the time all that’s left of the peahens is a few stretches of neck and head and the bones, the wizard already makes his prep to clean. The weaver, however, has other plans. Barely did Alexander turn around from the table or he found himself tackled from behind by a three hundred pound amorous giant spider, clutching his waist with the pedipalps and the frontmost pair of legs.

	“And where do you think you’re going, hushband?” the weaver rumbles low, letting her larger legs slowly curl inwards along his thighs. She pulls back, and the wizard finds it hard not to walk back with Aki.

	“Well, to the pillows, apparently,” Alexander notes with a chuckle. So much for cleaning.

	“To the pillowsh,” Aki agrees, pulling back along the human’s waist until her plodding, long legs pull them both into the darker corner of what makes up their bed space. Just a giant mound of soft, comfy cushions, half of which filled with the silky white hairs from Akirabaki’s own exoskeleton. With a quick twist of her entire body, Alexander finds himself tossed back into the mound laughing.

	She’s rubbing her chelicerae together anxiously, her eyes tensing in their sockets. The spider pushes Alexander down with her two front pairs of legs, her pedipalps traversing across his shirt for his weather-worn bronzed skin. That’s where Alexander slowly lets his own hands wander across his clothing, unclasping the buttons of his shirt where her relatively clumsy pedipalps cannot manage with those small things. Ever so carefully, the weaver pulls the man’s clothing off from his shoulders and his flanks, until her large, monstrous visage is level with his face.

	Alexander reaches up with a hand to just past the hand-sized sharp incisors of her fangs, brushing the soft downy fur of her mandibles with his fingers until his hand pushes the right chelicera away. Where the spotless white hair thins and grows shorter, rosy red fuzz and dark brown and black skin reside. Soft flesh that twitches against the wizard’s gentle touch, unafraid of the otherwise alien woman hovering above him. He leans up towards the spread mouthparts, his fingers circling the muscular rounded mouth of his wife until he gently parts rostrum and labium. His face sinks between the fluffy mandibles, and he kisses the weaver deeply. Aki lets out a ruffling noise from below, her pedipalps slinking around the back of his head, caressing his dark hair tenderly  while her mouthparts tense and relax. Her fangs settle just across her lover’s shoulder blades, pulling him ever closer with the tiniest pricks of her sharp teeth. The lack of a tongue made reciprocation a little awkward at first, but Aki finds her slow caresses and stroking of the human’s sleek hair to give him all the incentive he needs to let his tongue wander around her shallow mouth.

	When Alexander pulls back from Aki, she carefully draws her chelicerae high up and her fangs away from his back. He settles into the pillows, keeping his hands just beneath her mouthparts, stroking down along her hairless sternum, outwards to the prosomal hide and along the swells of her legs’ coxae. For a while, the two regard each other as the wizard caresses the giant spider’s lower half of her cephalothorax, until she leans against his chin and chest with her fluffy chelicerae.

	“Take your pantsh off,” she lisps with a soft, low voice.

	Alexander heeds, lowering his hands down his own body to remove his belt and loosen the waistline of his trousers. The weaver slinks back, her upper body slightly tensing up and down to regard the tailor steadily disrobing himself. The boots come off, revealing his suntanned feet to her. The pants slide off his long legs, his erection bobbing against the waistband until it snaps straight upwards to her. Her pedipalps draw the trousers down until he can kick his legs out of them, dressed in little more than the shirt still clinging to his arms and back. That’s when Aki pushes him down into the pillows with her pedipalps and frontmost legs, humming pleasantly down at the prone man. Her bulk and her limbs turn him around to be on his side. He already knows what’s next, turning further around to his stomach.

	“Put your handsh behind your back.”

	This wouldn’t be the first time that he had her hold him pinned and slowly twist her large, fluffy rump around on him, tensing the black and white coloured plump spinnerets to his bare wrists. How those hindmost legs then twist a sticky, firm strands of silk from those gooey little spinners, wrapping them around his hands and wrists. Further he feels the sticky silk wrap around him, his muscular stomach getting covered in a light film of strong webbing that barely gives his arms space. He’s seated back into the pillows, facing his wife who’s finishing up the weave of his upper limbs until she can regard his squirming, tanned form with satisfaction. His long limbs have worn to firm muscles, and though the lack of sprinting and forced marching did do a number on what once was a toned abdomen, he still looks every bit as delicious as he did when they first travelled together.

	The weaver leans down towards Alexander’s groin, tensing and ruffling her fluffy chelicerae over one another anxiously as she nears his turgid erection. Her fangs tense against their covers as she spreads her mouthpieces apart before him, her throat letting out a playful ‘aaah~’

	“Please don’t tease me, fuzzy,” Alexander pleads, biting his lower lip. He regards those eight unblinking eyes with doting affection. He’s helpless to her teasing. And she knows it.

	Akirabaki sinks down her cephalothorax towards his spread groin, letting her pedipalps wander across his firm pectorals and the faint cover of light and dark hair across his chest. His prick brushes against sensitive little hairs, and soon is suffused in heated breath. Then comes moisture, and a slow clenching. The feeling of her hardened lower lip against his root. Alexander groans out low, tensing his thighs and threatening to thrust upwards into her mouth.

	The weaver pulls back coyly, ruffling her feet against the floor. “My pashe,” she reminds him. “Now shtay put, Aleksh. Let fusshy take care of thish...”

	Alex can’t help but moan appreciatively when she returns her alien mouth to his erection, letting the muscular ring twitch and squeeze around his organ’s tip. How agonizingly slow she is to return to swallowing his entire length. As she pulls back once more, he can hear her moan and lisp in those low, dulcette tones.

	“Tashty.”

	Another slow lewd suck that ends with a moist pop from his cock pulling free from her mouth.

	“Shalty.”

	She sinks down once more on him, her pedipalps wandering over his throat and cheeks, down across his chest, towards his sides. Her claws scratch him tenderly, holding on to him closely as she bobs forward and back with her entire body to suck him down. When she pulls back again, the tip of his organ is covered in a mixture of weaver slobber and his own pre.

	“Messhy.”

	The wizard tenses his thighs, pressing back against two of her legs holding his own legs down. But he’s not of the mind to struggle –too– much, instead letting Akirabaki set the pace to which she swallows his staff. Her shallow mouth feels like a slick little vent that has him aching against her eager fellatio. Her abdomen visibly swells when she keeps him down in her throat, bobbing bodily back and forth. It’s only when her legs remove themselves from his thighs that Alexander starts to return his thrusts in time to his wife’s moving body, sinking to the root into her silken maw. Even his testicles are lathering in spider spittle when he pumps up past her wide-open labium and rostrum. A low moan spreads through Aki, the vibrations coursing back up through to Alexander. 

	His hips hump up towards her faster and faster, Aki finding it difficult to match his speed. The weaver returns her legs to his thighs, pinning him down against the cushions while she pumps her own self bodily up and down his cock, bumping her fuzzy mandibles against his groin and hips with every downwards stroke. Alexander moans out incoherently, throwing his head back in helpless abandon. Aki recognizes the signs of him getting closer. She doubles her efforts, tensing her throat around him, swallowing him as well as her maw allows her to. Her pedipalps wander across his hips, pulling him in closer towards herself. When the wizard can’t take it anymore, he tenses and lets out a short shout, until his voice trails off in a series of groans and breathing in through clenched teeth. His seed surges forth from him, deep into the back of Aki’s mouth. She slowly, oh so slowly, pulls herself from him, her mouthparts feeling bruised at the seams of her joints. But the warmth, the salty taste of his release makes things quite worth it.

	She slurps lewdly, parting her various mouthparts to him to show just how much of a mess he’s made of her mouth. But outside of some frothy pre, all of it has gone well down her gullet. She closes her labium and rostrum again, rubbing her chelicerae over one another to start cleaning herself off with again.

	“I love the way you move when you come, Aleksh,” Akirabaki murmurs up at her husband, rubbing her face and mandibles into his stomach. The wizard, for his part, is just left breathing hard and laboured, needing a little reprieve before he can consider answering. The spider lowers her mouth back to his softening member, carefully brushing her chelicerae across his skin, cleaning him off, too.

	“You’re absolutely shameless about this, huh?” he finally says, rolling his head a moment before he glances back down at the snowy white weaver. “Sucking me off like that.”

	“Yesssh,” the weaver hisses out between her mouthparts.

	“You love fucking me with your face.”

	Another hiss leaves the weaver as she agrees with Alexander.

	“Well how about you untie me and I repay you the favour, Aki?”

	“How about I make shure you’re rearing to go firsht before I unwrap my preshent?” the weaver asks back saucily, flashing her husband the inside of her mouth again. He can feel his softening prick start to grow firm, though it’s nothing compared to the thrum of Aki’s voice speaking in her own tongue, and for her left pedipalp to faintly glow from the tips of every one of her hairs. She brings her manipulator to his stomach, infusing her man with a small touch of positive, invigorating energy.

	Alexander groans out as he feels himself grow hard within a moment, his dark erection growing fat and firm once more. Every vein, every uneven bump, everything feels hard to the weaver’s wandering chelicerae. She rubs him, breathes over him, feels his heat and moistened shaft against her insides. But Aki relents, slowly pulling aside to start tearing at the silk with her fangs and with her own spittle to dissolve portions of it around his abdomen. The wizard steadily frees himself from his wife’s web, until he’s pulling himself up to sit in front of the snowy white spider.

	“You. On your back. Now.”

	There’s some trepidation from Aki. That’s natural – no spider, not even intelligent magical giant spiders, willingly goes up on their backs. But the edge of danger that’s coursing through the weaver’s veins has her slowly step back and lie down in the mound of pillows until her man is rolling her past her side, over her own legs, until she’s flat on her back. Her legs stiffen and curl inwards. Her abdomen shifts, the air rushing past her trachea as she breathes ever faster. She can’t see that well, upside-down, with no way to even turn herself around to see what’s going on. She only knows he’s to her right. That she’s safe. That her man is here.

	Then comes the warm, broad hands of her Alexander across the swell of her pedicel. The tips of his fingers press into her naked flesh. Brushing up towards the fluffy coat of white across her abdomen. Inwards across her epigynal mound, and way out away from her vulva towards the rosy red hairs surrounding her book lungs. His fingers brush the coarser, shorter hairs, though his breath runs hot across her own tensing breathing gills. She whimpers softly to his careful explorative touches, brushing his fingers through her thick fur, tracing further down her tensing abdomen until he’s caressing her twitching spinnerets.

	“Are you comfy, fuzzy?” he asks with a soft voice, so unlike his harsh command and the dirty talk before.

	“I will be. Shtroke me shome more?” Aki speaks just as softly.

	The wizard gives a chuckle, rising up to press his body against the vulnerable and slightly anxious spider’s cephalothorax and abdomen. His left hand wanders across her soft fur coating her exoskeleton, though he seems to pay more attention to rubbing just past her mouthparts with his right hand’s fingers, letting her suck on his digits while he strokes the sensitive chelicerae. Her breath only hitches when his left hand finds the meaty, plump and hairless epigyne. A black and red protrusion of flesh just barely poking out of her abdomen and from her fur – all puffy mostly due to Alexander’s gentle ministrations and the mounting excitement.

	His fingers dip first in her left ventricle, following the furrow of her flesh until his fingers push the pliant flesh apart to push into soft, warm and very much moist spider pussy. Her book lungs and trachea sigh out with a deep exhalation that causes her abdomen to deflate. Alexander pauses only so much until he’s sure Aki is calm before his pointer and middle finger slowly push in and out of her tight hole.

	Leaning in with his face, his moustache and lips brush along the slightly rose scented spider vulva until his lips kiss across the rightmost vent of her epigyne. Aki actually squeaks out when his lips continue to wander across the swollen flesh of her mound, letting his tongue wander into her joined oviduct and spermatheca.

	The weaver squeaks out, her legs tensing inwards. She loves his fingers. His tongue. No weaver could ever match the touch of a human’s fingers. No elf could fall in love with a spider, no dwarf could truly appreciate an arachnid. But this human loves her. Worships her. Gods above she’s moaning out to this human wandering his hard and soft feeling and tasting organs across –both– of her openings at once! Her voice quivers as his flesh probes deep into her. Alexander rises up along her abdomen, embracing her pedicel with his arms. His face stays level with her epigyne, kissing each opening in turn, tasting her twitching holes. The she-spider cries out louder when he pulls his face back from her mound, wordlessly squirming for more. 

	He stops, however, instead lifting himself over her prone and vulnerable form. He lowers himself, his thighs spread around the junction of her cephalothorax and her abdomen, until he finds himself angling to her epigyne. His naked body grinds down and up along her fuzzy stomach, until he angles his firm rod to her slightly larger right ventricle. Her abdomen arches up just slightly to meet with him. Then he sinks himself into his wife, slowly but steadily, until she’s keening out for him. Her legs arch behind his back, pressing down against his ribs and spine. He pulls out of her a few inches, only for him to push back inside until he’s in her moist vent to the root. His lips wander across the hairless sternum, hard exoskeleton surrounded by a thin border of reddened skin. Skin he kisses in lieu of a mouth.

	Akirabaki yowls out for her man, filling her like no weaver could ever do. His turgid spear spreads her clenching oviduct wide. His knees press into her flanks for purchase, pulling out once more until the next thrust fills her until she sees stars. Her body is deliciously warm and moist inside, her contractions no match for any humanoid he’s had the pleasure of bedding. The years didn’t make the act any less earnest or passionate. He pushes himself up against her sternum at last, and fucks her in earnest. Aki’s face – well, her mouthparts, chelicerae and fangs – contorts and moves with the tiniest of contractions as she loses herself in ever mounting pleasure.

	The wizard’s hips roll and hump into the weaver’s heavily expanding and contracting abdomen, her epigyne even pushing outwards from her body somewhat in her awkward arching pose. Every inward stroke is joined with the lewd squelching sound from both her juicy vents. She’s the first to squeal and tense, her legs pressing harshly down on his back and never pulling away from him, every juicy bit of her abdomen twitching in pleasure with his every buck and thrust. Her voice cracks and lisps from her hapless maw, until her husband joins with rhythmic grunts and harder rutting thrusts. His hips smack and grind into her body until he stays put, letting the orgasming weaver’s contractions finish him off.

	With one final loud grunt and a hiss through clenched teeth, Alexander collapses on top of the upturned Aki, his buttocks twitching and clenching as his seed spills into the snowy white weaver.

	They stay like that for a good while, breathing slowly and steadily, regaining their senses. Human fingers wander through soft, luscious fur, caressing along the long, slender limbs that limply fan out to her sides. He kisses Aki’s sternum a few times before he slowly dislodges from her moist, oozing quim, sliding off from her abdomen and cephalothorax, ever mindful of her legs. After he sits himself in the mound of pillows, Aki begins to stir. With some effort, her hindmost legs twist and push her to turn to her side. Her frontmost legs catch herself. A final stretch of her limbs has her stand back on all eight of her legs again, though wobbly, and very much pleasantly sore. Her coat all along the dorsal sides of her segmented body looks muzzy and unkempt.

	The white spider slowly scuttles to her husband’s side, pressing her right side into his right affectionately. She lays her cephalothorax down across her husband’s lap, her unblinking eyes staring up at him lovingly. He strokes her languidly with one hand, his left stretching out from the spider and towards a small cabinet. His Mage’s Hand grasps invisibly around a broad hairbrush, levitating the object towards the wizard’s open and outstretched hand. Aki giggles with a low tone of voice when she feels the firm bundles of ox hair move through her silky soft coat.

	“You haven’t losht your toush, Aleksh,” Aki says tiredly. Her legs ruffle across her man’s bare legs, pressing herself down against his lap.

	“I would certainly hope so, fuzzy,” the wizard says with a warm, low tone himself, slowly beginning to straighten his happily shivering wife’s coat out.</textarea>
