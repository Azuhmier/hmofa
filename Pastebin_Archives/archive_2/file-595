clear to the gaggle of clanrats that if they returned without the rumoured warpstone again they would all regret the day their broodmothers birthed them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And set about them with her staff for good measure, as a down payment on her promise</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually bare earth gave way to roughly hewn stone as Skritsnik approached her private warren</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It wouldn&#039;t do for one of her esteemed station to dwell in the dirt like a common rat, after all</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As she turned a corner a pair of Stormvermin clad in the black plate of Clan Rictus and tabards bearing the Grey Seer&#039;s personal rune snapped to attention on either side of a heavy iron and oak door fitted snugly into the stone wall, their halberds clutched tightly in an attempt to appear as if they had never been slouching at all</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Skritsnik motioned wordlessly to the pair, and the door swung inwards with the tortured screeching of neglected hinges</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She paused in the doorway and turned to one of her guards</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I am going to meditate-think, and I am not be disturbed!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A moment&#039;s hesitation followed as she weighed her desire for privacy with the desire to see those incompetents suffer for their crimes against her mighty personage</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”But if that fool-rat Grismatz returns empty-pawed before I emerge, fetch-bring me his head!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The clanking of metal on metal accompanied the black-furred brute&#039;s crisp salute</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”As you wish, oh Gracious One!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Skritsnik stepped into her warren without dignifying him with an acknowledgement, and the huge door swung shut behind her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The main chamber of the Grey Seer&#039;s private residence was typical of the Under-Altdorf elite</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Stone floors, walls, and ceilings to keep out uninvited tunnellers, with light provided by torches burning in iron sconces hammered into the walls</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A finely woven carpet covered much of the floor, its colours and motifs clearly identifying it as having been stolen from some wealthy human from the city above</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Furniture and other curios were arranged about the place, all human-made and all stolen from under their owner&#039;s noses</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Such affection for human objects and trinkets was seen as unhealthy and even degenerate in the rest of the Under-Empire, but countless generations of close contact with the wealthy city of Altdorf above had made them status symbols for those in Under-Altdorf with the means to acquire them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Safe and secure in her own little realm, Skritsnik allowed her shoulders to slump and a heavy sigh to escape her lips</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A show of weakness that would be unacceptable in front of her kin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But dealing with those oafs had been... so tiresome</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A bath would be the perfect way to relax, she decided – an unusual vice even amongst the eccentricity of Under-Altdorf, but an unpleasant encounter with the Pestilent Brotherhood while still a young apprentice left Skritsnik much more cleanliness-minded than most</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One of the side chambers held a tin bath, another item liberated from the surface world</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At the foot of the bath sat a large water barrel, and a quick turn of a tap sent water spilling out into the waiting bath</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The water was replaced every day under the close supervision of one of her Stormvermin, of course, and the slaves doing the refilling always had to sample some of it to prove it clean of any toxins or poisons</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;An extravagance, perhaps, but undoubtedly necessary to Skritsnik&#039;s continued good health</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As the bath filled she discarded her staff in the corner, then pulled the heavy grey robes customary of her station over her head, exposing her naked form in all its glory</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was much slimmer and softer than the average rat-man, with narrow shoulders and wide hips completed with firm, well-rounded buttocks beneath her constantly twitching tail</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nestled between her generous thighs was a puffy vulva, coated in a thin layer of silver fur with the slightest suggestion of pink peeking through the middle</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And of course a pair of generously-sized breasts sat proudly upon her chest, a pair of bright pink nipples peeking out through the plush fur that covered them all over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stretched herself to loosen the joints after wearing her heavy, restrictive robes, providing the stone walls with an extremely pleasant view</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A hand gesture and arcane utterances heated the water in a flash; a very useful spell her old mentor had taught her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before she arranged for an &#039;unstable&#039; tunnel to collapse on him, of course</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She dipped a footpaw into the bath, cooing in satisfaction at the sensation of the hot water soaking into her fur and caressing the sensitive skin beneath</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her other footpaw quickly followed, then the rest of her as she clambered in and laid backwards, letting herself sink in up to her neck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For a few moments she simply lay there, basking in comfort</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A grimace weaselled its way onto her face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Those thrice-damned fools from earlier just would not leave her mind!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She raised her paws to the curved, goat-like horns jutting from either side of her skull, her symbols of office and proof she had been blessed by the Great Horned Rat to stand above the common hordes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Slowly, gently, she began to caress them, running her soft pawpads over their rough surface</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her eyelids drifted closed and a contented sigh left her lips; feeling her horns up like that always took the stresses of dealing with underlings away, reminding her of her innate superiority to the snivelling fools</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Soon visions of frustrated anger were replaced with visions of power and domination, and she felt the stirrings of a familiar heat in her belly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One hand left its horn, drifting downwards and trailing its clawtips through her silver fur</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The heat intensified as her paw traced across the supple flesh of her breast, teasing the nipple with a dragging claw</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She took a pawful of breast and groped, moaning softly as the heat sparked into a fire</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her hardening nipple brushed against her paw, sending small shivers and gasps of pleasure up her spine with every slight movement</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She took the pink nub between two digits and squeezed, drawing a low moan from the Grey Seer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The fire in her belly was growing, and just the one paw would not be enough to stoke the flames</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her other paw left her horn and cupped her other, neglected breast and began to grope and knead it with abandon, all sense of proper decorum lost in the haze of self-pleasure</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She ground her thighs together, rubbing the oh-so-sensitive labia against each other</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Natural lubricant flowed freely, coating the fur on her thighs and mixing with the all-encompassing water</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A paw left her chest and slid down, down across her belly and ever closer to the burning prize between her legs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Skritsnik&#039;s breathing deepened as she inched near</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sparks of white-hot pleasure jolted through her as her paw made contact, brushing against the puffy, swollen pinkness at her centre</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Unashamed moans filled the bathroom as she went in for the kill</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She rubbed at herself vigorously, spreading her sticky fluids across her entire crotch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some small part of herself not lost in pleasure noted it was convenient she was doing this in the bath</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The pleasure mounted higher and the fire burned ever hotter with every pass across her lips and every tug on her nipple</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was getting closer, ever closer to that wonderful release</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She bit her lip and angled her paw over her mound just so</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sparks exploded behind her vision as she thrust a digit deep inside herself, caressing fleshy walls which begged for the touch of a male</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But her own paw would have to do</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She thrust relentlessly in and out of herself, a heavenly cycle of cursed emptiness and blessed fullness</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Soon another digit joined the first, then another, stretching her entrance and walls in the most pleasant way imaginable</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her hips bucked to meet every thrust of her paw</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Water was sloshing about madly, spilling out of the bath and splattering across stone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Faster and faster she played with herself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was close</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was CLOSE</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was -</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The dam burst</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Blinding hot pleasure overcame Skritsnik, setting every nerve ending aflame</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She bucked and spasmed in the throes of orgasm, squeaking her pleasure for all the Under-Empire to hear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Luckily the thick stone of her chambers was nigh-soundproof</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her insides turned to jelly and she collapsed back into the now-shallower bath, a horn connecting to the rim with an unpleasant &#039;clonk&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shuddering, gasping breaths sucked in oxygen, a futile attempt to engage muscles that refused to act in the haze of post-orgasmic bliss</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For a while the Grey Seer lay there half-submerged, robbed of all higher functions</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually things started to respond, and her body updated her brain</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her joints ached</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her back ached</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And her crotch ached in the most delightful of ways</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She grasped the rim of the bath and heaved herself upright on shaking limbs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Water dripped everywhere as she unsteadily stepped out onto the cold stone, but she paid it no heed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The warmth in her belly that had just exploded so spectacularly was back already</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was a tiny spark, but one that danced across bone-dry kindling</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Skritsnik knew it would soon become as furious as a gout of warpflame again until she was properly satisfied</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A paw, as pleasurable as it was, definitely did not count as &#039;properly satisfied&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her thoughts turned to the secret chamber beyond the end of the main hall, and a lecherous grin spread across her features</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In that chamber resided her &#039;special&#039; slave</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The one that came from the surface, like so much else in Under-Altdorf</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She reached for a towel emblazoned with the crest of Reikland</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Today was going to be a very good day, Skritsnik decided, fool-rat Grismatz be damned</div></li><li class="li1"><div

&gt;As she turned a corner a pair of Stormvermin clad in the black plate of Clan Rictus and tabards bearing the Grey Seer&#039;s personal rune snapped to attention on either side of a heavy iron and oak door fitted snugly into the stone wall, their halberds clutched tightly in an attempt to appear as if they had never been slouching at all
&gt;Skritsnik motioned wordlessly to the pair, and the door swung inwards with the tortured screeching of neglected hinges
&gt;She paused in the doorway and turned to one of her guards
&gt;”I am going to meditate-think, and I am not be disturbed!”
&gt;A moment&#039;s hesitation followed as she weighed her desire for privacy with the desire to see those incompetents suffer for their crimes against her mighty personage
&gt;”But if that fool-rat Grismatz returns empty-pawed before I emerge, fetch-bring me his head!”
&gt;The clanking of metal on metal accompanied the black-furred brute&#039;s crisp salute
&gt;”As you wish, oh Gracious One!”
&gt;Skritsnik stepped into her warren without dignifying him with an acknowledgement, and the huge door swung shut behind her
&gt;The main chamber of the Grey Seer&#039;s private residence was typical of the Under-Altdorf elite
&gt;Stone floors, walls, and ceilings to keep out uninvited tunnellers, with light provided by torches burning in iron sconces hammered into the walls
&gt;A finely woven carpet covered much of the floor, its colours and motifs clearly identifying it as having been stolen from some wealthy human from the city above
&gt;Furniture and other curios were arranged about the place, all human-made and all stolen from under their owner&#039;s noses
&gt;Such affection for human objects and trinkets was seen as unhealthy and even degenerate in the rest of the Under-Empire, but countless generations of close contact with the wealthy city of Altdorf above had made them status symbols for those in Under-Altdorf with the means to acquire them
&gt;Safe and secure in her own little realm, Skritsnik allowed her shoulders to slump and a heavy sigh to escape her lips
&gt;A show of weakness that would be unacceptable in front of her kin
&gt;But dealing with those oafs had been... so tiresome
&gt;A bath would be the perfect way to relax, she decided – an unusual vice even amongst the eccentricity of Under-Altdorf, but an unpleasant encounter with the Pestilent Brotherhood while still a young apprentice left Skritsnik much more cleanliness-minded than most
&gt;One of the side chambers held a tin bath, another item liberated from the surface world
&gt;At the foot of the bath sat a large water barrel, and a quick turn of a tap sent water spilling out into the waiting bath
&gt;The water was replaced every day under the close supervision of one of her Stormvermin, of course, and the slaves doing the refilling always had to sample some of it to prove it clean of any toxins or poisons
&gt;An extravagance, perhaps, but undoubtedly necessary to Skritsnik&#039;s continued good health
&gt;As the bath filled she discarded her staff in the corner, then pulled the heavy grey robes customary of her station over her head, exposing her naked form in all its glory
&gt;She was much slimmer and softer than the average rat-man, with narrow shoulders and wide hips completed with firm, well-rounded buttocks beneath her constantly twitching tail
&gt;Nestled between her generous thighs was a puffy vulva, coated in a thin layer of silver fur with the slightest suggestion of pink peeking through the middle
&gt;And of course a pair of generously-sized breasts sat proudly upon her chest, a pair of bright pink nipples peeking out through the plush fur that covered them all over
&gt;She stretched herself to loosen the joints after wearing her heavy, restrictive robes, providing the stone walls with an extremely pleasant view
&gt;A hand gesture and arcane utterances heated the water in a flash; a very useful spell her old mentor had taught her
&gt;Before she arranged for an &#039;unstable&#039; tunnel to collapse on him, of course
&gt;She dipped a footpaw into the bath, cooing in satisfaction at the sensation of the hot water soaking into her fur and caressing the sensitive skin beneath
&gt;Her other footpaw quickly followed, then the rest of her as she clambered in and laid backwards, letting herself sink in up to her neck
&gt;For a few moments she simply lay there, basking in comfort
&gt;A grimace weaselled its way onto her face
&gt;Those thrice-damned fools from earlier just would not leave her mind!
&gt;She raised her paws to the curved, goat-like horns jutting from either side of her skull, her symbols of office and proof she had been blessed by the Great Horned Rat to stand above the common hordes
&gt;Slowly, gently, she began to caress them, running her soft pawpads over their rough surface
&gt;Her eyelids drifted closed and a contented sigh left her lips; feeling her horns up like that always took the stresses of dealing with underlings away, reminding her of her innate superiority to the snivelling fools
&gt;Soon visions of frustrated anger were replaced with visions of power and domination, and she felt the stirrings of a familiar heat in her belly
&gt;One hand left its horn, drifting downwards and trailing its clawtips through her silver fur
&gt;The heat intensified as her paw traced across the supple flesh of her breast, teasing the nipple with a dragging claw
&gt;She took a pawful of breast and groped, moaning softly as the heat sparked into a fire
&gt;Her hardening nipple brushed against her paw, sending small shivers and gasps of pleasure up her spine with every slight movement
&gt;She took the pink nub between two digits and squeezed, drawing a low moan from the Grey Seer
&gt;The fire in her belly was growing, and just the one paw would not be enough to stoke the flames
&gt;Her other paw left her horn and cupped her other, neglected breast and began to grope and knead it with abandon, all sense of proper decorum lost in the haze of self-pleasure
&gt;She ground her thighs together, rubbing the oh-so-sensitive labia against each other
&gt;Natural lubricant flowed freely, coating the fur on her thighs and mixing with the all-encompassing water
&gt;A paw left her chest and slid down, down across her belly and ever closer to the burning prize between her legs
&gt;Skritsnik&#039;s breathing deepened as she inched near
&gt;Sparks of white-hot pleasure jolted through her as her paw made contact, brushing against the puffy, swollen pinkness at her centre
&gt;Unashamed moans filled the bathroom as she went in for the kill
&gt;She rubbed at herself vigorously, spreading her sticky fluids across her entire crotch
&gt;Some small part of herself not lost in pleasure noted it was convenient she was doing this in the bath
&gt;The pleasure mounted higher and the fire burned ever hotter with every pass across her lips and every tug on her nipple
&gt;She was getting closer, ever closer to that wonderful release
&gt;She bit her lip and angled her paw over her mound just so
&gt;Sparks exploded behind her vision as she thrust a digit deep inside herself, caressing fleshy walls which begged for the touch of a male
&gt;But her own paw would have to do
&gt;She thrust relentlessly in and out of herself, a heavenly cycle of cursed emptiness and blessed fullness
&gt;Soon another digit joined the first, then another, stretching her entrance and walls in the most pleasant way imaginable
&gt;Her hips bucked to meet every thrust of her paw
&gt;Water was sloshing about madly, spilling out of the bath and splattering across stone
&gt;Faster and faster she played with herself
&gt;She was close
&gt;She was CLOSE
&gt;She was -
&gt;The dam burst
&gt;Blinding hot pleasure overcame Skritsnik, setting every nerve ending aflame
&gt;She bucked and spasmed in the throes of orgasm, squeaking her pleasure for all the Under-Empire to hear
&gt;Luckily the thick stone of her chambers was nigh-soundproof
&gt;Her insides turned to jelly and she collapsed back into the now-shallower bath, a horn connecting to the rim with an unpleasant &#039;clonk&#039;
&gt;Shuddering, gasping breaths sucked in oxygen, a futile attempt to engage muscles that refused to act in the haze of post-orgasmic bliss
&gt;For a while the Grey Seer lay there half-submerged, robbed of all higher functions
&gt;Eventually things started to respond, and her body updated her brain
&gt;Her joints ached
&gt;Her back ached
&gt;And her crotch ached in the most delightful of ways
&gt;She grasped the rim of the bath and heaved herself upright on shaking limbs
&gt;Water dripped everywhere as she unsteadily stepped out onto the cold stone, but she paid it no heed
&gt;The warmth in her belly that had just exploded so spectacularly was back already
&gt;It was a tiny spark, but one that danced across bone-dry kindling
&gt;Skritsnik knew it would soon become as furious as a gout of warpflame again until she was properly satisfied
&gt;A paw, as pleasurable as it was, definitely did not count as &#039;properly satisfied&#039;
&gt;Her thoughts turned to the secret chamber beyond the end of the main hall, and a lecherous grin spread across her features
&gt;In that chamber resided her &#039;special&#039; slave
&gt;The one that came from the surface, like so much else in Under-Altdorf
&gt;She reached for a towel emblazoned with the crest of Reikland
&gt;Today was going to be a very good day, Skritsnik decided, fool-rat Grismatz be damned
