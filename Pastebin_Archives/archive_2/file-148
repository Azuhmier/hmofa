        <textarea class="textarea">Behold, my apprentice! the great and powerful witch of this land has created the most, powerful potion YET Haha!&quot;
&gt;I thought last time was the most powerful potion&quot;. You cock an eyebrow at the hyperactive witch
&gt;Her ears droop down at the words of your reality buzz-kill
&gt;&quot;Yes okay, but that didn&#039;t work, this time though-THIS WILL BE THE-&quot;
&gt;&quot;the most powerful potion the world has know yes I know. You&#039;ve said this a *million* times today~&quot;.
&gt;That may sound rude and brusk but Anon and the witch have been at this for hours
&gt;Anon and the witch have been practicing dark arts for years, Anon was like an apprentice, getting ingredients, mixing potions, the usual things
&gt;Anon heard about a job opportunity to work alongside a powerful witch, so naturally Anon took the job offer, unfortunately, as the years passed you found out that was probably spread by her
&gt;the witch isn&#039;t as good as she thinks she is, but you love her enthusiastic energy and her child like spirit towards chemistry and the dark arts
&gt;Every day she tries her best and always keeps motivated
&gt;And although you may love to be a bit sarcastic you give her motivation as well
&gt;Today she&#039;s working on a new potion
&gt;Apparently it&#039;s a secret that involves you
&gt;Suddenly she pulls the &quot;powerful potion&quot; from the cauldron 
&gt;&quot;behold Anon, and see *my* potion&quot;.
&gt;She always puts on a performance when she makes a new one &gt;she could easily perform in the theater
&gt;Her tounge rolls off at the end of every sentence always giving her dramatic performance
&gt;You think she&#039;s seen too many other wizard&#039;s
&gt;&quot;Tis a love potion Anon!, as my apprentice: you must try it out..I mean-I can&#039;t because I&#039;m the witch so you know-if you you&#039;d please drink it for me~&quot;.
&gt;She&#039;s too adorable when she wants something
&gt;I wonder what she&#039;s playing at
&gt;Does she think that by drinking this you&#039;ll fall in love with her?
&gt;Even the most novice witches and anybody who uses magic knows love can&#039;t be made into a potion
&gt;Oh well, better just play along I guess
&gt;You take a sip from pink like gloop in the vial
&gt;You fear the worst, but the potion tastes like water
&gt;Wait!, It is water, she must have given you the wrong vial
&gt;How the hell did she turn water into pink sludge?!
&gt;That&#039;s a question for another day
&gt;She looks at you with anticipation, clutching her witch hat tightly turning it in her hands
&gt;You decide to have some fun with her
&gt;&quot;W-what&#039;s happening to me!&quot;
&gt;You put on your own performance for her this time
&gt;&quot;The potion. Working. It&#039;s, taking-over, my, whole body.&quot;
&gt;Shatner would be proud
&gt;&quot;Do you love me now Anon~&quot;
&gt;She beams with excitement waiting for a sign of success
&gt;That was too cute, holy shit muh heart
&gt;You make impression of being under a spell and walk over and hold her waist close
&gt;&quot;I do, more than anything&quot;
&gt;You sound robotic to really sell it your under a spell
&gt;It may look cruel to pretend you&#039;re in love with someone
&gt;But you don&#039;t have to perform what you really feel
&gt;There&#039;s a reason why you&#039;ve stayed so long 
&gt;It wasn&#039;t to become a magician
&gt;You couldn&#039;t care less about that stuff anymore
&gt;Just seeing her face any day was worth being a walking experiment
&gt;The witch throws her hat down and does the same
&gt;&quot;Oh Anon, I&#039;m so happy now I always loved you but I was too scared but now we-&quot;
&gt;She looks behind you to see the original potion on the shelf
&gt;&quot;Wait, how did it work, I didn&#039;t use the-&quot;
&gt;You lay a soft kiss on the witch, her eyes widened and left speechless
&gt;She doesn&#039;t protest and does the same holding your head closer
&gt;You break the passionate and hold her hands tightly
&gt;&quot;You casted your love spell on me years ago&quot;.</textarea>
