Anyway, that&#039;s the last you&#039;re gonna hear my horrid voice, at least for the next hour&quot; You laugh, &quot;Anyway, here&#039;s Rejie Snowleopard, with &quot;Egyptian Luvr.&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you let the next song run, you lean back in your chair muting your mic and taking a swig from your water bottle. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Today&#039;s casting had left you a bit dry throated, and you prayed any listeners couldn&#039;t tell. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you relaxed for the time being, voices could be heard approacing your door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...alright dear, he&#039;s very nice, and won&#039;t put you on the spot too much, I hope&quot; Came the giggly voice of your, boss, Delilah.&quot; Her usually upbeat attitude was in full force today, she was likely showing around a new intern, probably some college studet wanting to get a check on their resume. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;W-well, ok. But I&#039;m not the best at speaking on air.&quot; Came a second, quieter voice, the new intern.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You put on your best smile as the door to yuor studio swings open, revealing the two entrants.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One, was a taller canine, like a fluffy labrador, the kuvasz anthro Delilah.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The other was a female, and quite peculiur. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Despite the ovbiously mouse-like features she had a bushy racoon tail, which was tucked close to her legs in a show of trepidation.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her blue eyes looked around at everything; the floor, the equipment, the ceiling, everything and anything but you or Delilah. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had to wonder how she got this job if she couldn&#039;t make eye contact with strangers. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The kuvasz anthro broke the silence by pushing the newbie into the room, closing the door behind them both. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon, meet Naomi, Naomi, this is Anon. She&#039;s going to be co-hosting your radioshow, so please show her the ropes.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get up, extending a hand to Naomi, which after a second she takes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Nice to meet you, don&#039;t worry about me, I&#039;m just a normal weirdo.&quot; You say with a laugh.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She doesn&#039;t even crack a smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe that wasn&#039;t as funny as you thought it was in your head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...Aaanyway,I&#039;ll leave you two to get aquainted. She&#039;ll be a team member from now on, so do be nice to her. Bye~&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And with that, Delilah left, leaving the two incredibly awkward people in the room together. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;So...&quot; you start, hesitantly, &quot;What kind of music have you been listening to lately.?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Simple, yet effective at breaking the ice. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Smooth Anon, keep it up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well, I usually listen to edm or pop, but lately I&#039;ve been really sweet on this small band called Last Dinosaurs. Something about their sound really gets me, ya know?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In reality you didn&#039;t because you had just met her but you nod in affirmation.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So what do you like?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Well, I&#039;m pretty tasteless, so I just enjnoy whatever&#039;s in the top 40.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At her balk of disgust, you quickly try to recover.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I-its an aquired taste. Trust me, give it a month. You&#039;ll either love it or have already quit.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She isn&#039;t buying it, giving you a real good unamused look. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were so putting her on the spot.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anyway, I&#039;ll do do my best, but I can&#039;t if I don&#039;t know how to work this...thingimajig.&quot; She says, gesturing to the sound board infront of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod, glad to get to something you knew more about.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After an extensive explaination, you pop on your headphones, pantamiming for Naomi to get her&#039;s on, so you could start the talk show.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hello, ladies and gents out there on the air waves, today is Friday, which means the weekend, and more importantly, Free Talk time. Lucky for us we have a new addition to the crew, hopefully not my replacement, Naomi! Say hello to the listeners.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The poor girl looks like a deer anthro in headlights.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;She&#039;s having a few techinal difficulties, while we get that worked out why don&#039;t we play one more song? Here&#039;s Spice Girl by Aminemal.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The break for &#039;techinal difficulties&#039; on, you turn to your co-host.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s practically shaking, and her eyes are prinpricks. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe putting her out there like that was a bit of a dick move. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Look, sorry about that. Trust me, I know that feeling, but it will subside if you just jump in, instead of working in slowly. Kinda like jumping into a pool instead of wading, so if you want just listen in and then jumo in when you hear something that piques your intrest, just go ahead.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The mouse-racoon nods stifly, obviously still nervous.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Sorry about that...there were a few cables crossed...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The rest of the broadcast went smoothly, with you glossing over local weather, sports and traffic, with a few callers coming in to tell you their opinion about this or that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The topic had gone from a new radio tower to late night snacks, when Naomi finally spoke up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...Shredded Cheese from the bag at three am.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;...What?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You know, when you wake up at three am and eat shredded cheese straight from the bag?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I...I&#039;ve never done that.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well you&#039;ve got to try it sometime, there&#039;s something about cheese at three am that&#039;s just excellent.&quot; she says excitedly. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Funny, a mouse getting excited about cheese?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh ha-ha, what do humans get excited about?&quot; she asked, sarcastically.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Steamed hams.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Nothing.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You were really good once you got going, I&#039;m actually surpsised you spoke as much as you did.&quot; You congragulate Naomi, the newbie having held an entire conversation with you during the rest of the free talk time. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Th-thanks it was nothing. It gets so easy once you forget people are listening.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;That&#039;s exactly what I mean. Sometimes, you just gotta jump in.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll probably freeze up again tommorow,&quot; she chuckled quietly. &quot;I just hope you&#039;ll be there to break me out of the ice again.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Oh I will be, its what I do. Besides you were fantastic! Probably one of the best rookies I&#039;ve gotten to work with in a long time.&quot; You say enthuseastically. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Naomi opened her mouth to say something, but stopped when she heard Delilah from down the hall. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;DARLINGS! I heard your first cast together, you sounded like best friends! Ooh I&#039;m so glad that you got along. Anon here is a bit picky when it comes to his on air personalities.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Am not...&quot; You huff.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Naomi giggles, her hair hiding one of her eyes from view in a cutely punk manner. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anyway,&quot; the Kuvasz continues. &quot;We have an opening in our charity drive this weekend, and I would be SO pleased if you filled in.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Without hesitation, you nod.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;And what about you Naomi?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;d be happy to join Anon for the charity drive.

        <textarea class="textarea">&quot;And that&#039;s why you check before you ask if a Kuvasz if they&#039;re just a chubby labrador. Anyway, that&#039;s the last you&#039;re gonna hear my horrid voice, at least for the next hour&quot; You laugh, &quot;Anyway, here&#039;s Rejie Snowleopard, with &quot;Egyptian Luvr.&quot; 
&gt;As you let the next song run, you lean back in your chair muting your mic and taking a swig from your water bottle. 
&gt;Today&#039;s casting had left you a bit dry throated, and you prayed any listeners couldn&#039;t tell. 
&gt;As you relaxed for the time being, voices could be heard approacing your door.
&gt;&quot;...alright dear, he&#039;s very nice, and won&#039;t put you on the spot too much, I hope&quot; Came the giggly voice of your, boss, Delilah.&quot; Her usually upbeat attitude was in full force today, she was likely showing around a new intern, probably some college studet wanting to get a check on their resume. 
&gt;&quot;W-well, ok. But I&#039;m not the best at speaking on air.&quot; Came a second, quieter voice, the new intern.
&gt;You put on your best smile as the door to yuor studio swings open, revealing the two entrants.
&gt;One, was a taller canine, like a fluffy labrador, the kuvasz anthro Delilah.
&gt;The other was a female, and quite peculiur. 
&gt;Despite the ovbiously mouse-like features she had a bushy racoon tail, which was tucked close to her legs in a show of trepidation.
&gt;Her blue eyes looked around at everything; the floor, the equipment, the ceiling, everything and anything but you or Delilah. 
&gt;You had to wonder how she got this job if she couldn&#039;t make eye contact with strangers. 
&gt;The kuvasz anthro broke the silence by pushing the newbie into the room, closing the door behind them both. 
&gt;&quot;Anon, meet Naomi, Naomi, this is Anon. She&#039;s going to be co-hosting your radioshow, so please show her the ropes.&quot;
&gt;You get up, extending a hand to Naomi, which after a second she takes.
&quot;Nice to meet you, don&#039;t worry about me, I&#039;m just a normal weirdo.&quot; You say with a laugh.
&gt;She doesn&#039;t even crack a smile.
&gt;Maybe that wasn&#039;t as funny as you thought it was in your head. 
&gt;&quot;...Aaanyway,I&#039;ll leave you two to get aquainted. She&#039;ll be a team member from now on, so do be nice to her. Bye~&quot;
&gt;And with that, Delilah left, leaving the two incredibly awkward people in the room together. 
&quot;So...&quot; you start, hesitantly, &quot;What kind of music have you been listening to lately.?&quot;
&gt;Simple, yet effective at breaking the ice. 
&gt;Smooth Anon, keep it up.
&gt;&quot;Well, I usually listen to edm or pop, but lately I&#039;ve been really sweet on this small band called Last Dinosaurs. Something about their sound really gets me, ya know?&quot;
&gt;In reality you didn&#039;t because you had just met her but you nod in affirmation.
&gt;&quot;So what do you like?&quot;
&quot;Well, I&#039;m pretty tasteless, so I just enjnoy whatever&#039;s in the top 40.&quot;
&gt;At her balk of disgust, you quickly try to recover.
&quot;I-its an aquired taste. Trust me, give it a month. You&#039;ll either love it or have already quit.&quot;
&gt;She isn&#039;t buying it, giving you a real good unamused look. 
&gt;You were so putting her on the spot.
&gt;&quot;Anyway, I&#039;ll do do my best, but I can&#039;t if I don&#039;t know how to work this...thingimajig.&quot; She says, gesturing to the sound board infront of you.
&gt;You nod, glad to get to something you knew more about.
&gt;After an extensive explaination, you pop on your headphones, pantamiming for Naomi to get her&#039;s on, so you could start the talk show.
&quot;Hello, ladies and gents out there on the air waves, today is Friday, which means the weekend, and more importantly, Free Talk time. Lucky for us we have a new addition to the crew, hopefully not my replacement, Naomi! Say hello to the listeners.&quot;
&gt;The poor girl looks like a deer anthro in headlights.
&quot;She&#039;s having a few techinal difficulties, while we get that worked out why don&#039;t we play one more song? Here&#039;s Spice Girl by Aminemal.&quot;
&gt;The break for &#039;techinal difficulties&#039; on, you turn to your co-host.
&gt;She&#039;s practically shaking, and her eyes are prinpricks. 
&gt;Maybe putting her out there like that was a bit of a dick move. 
&quot;Look, sorry about that. Trust me, I know that feeling, but it will subside if you just jump in, instead of working in slowly. Kinda like jumping into a pool instead of wading, so if you want just listen in and then jumo in when you hear something that piques your intrest, just go ahead.&quot;
&gt;The mouse-racoon nods stifly, obviously still nervous.
&quot;Sorry about that...there were a few cables crossed...&quot;
&gt;The rest of the broadcast went smoothly, with you glossing over local weather, sports and traffic, with a few callers coming in to tell you their opinion about this or that.
&gt;The topic had gone from a new radio tower to late night snacks, when Naomi finally spoke up.
&gt;&quot;...Shredded Cheese from the bag at three am.&quot;
&quot;...What?&quot;
&gt;&quot;You know, when you wake up at three am and eat shredded cheese straight from the bag?&quot;
&quot;I...I&#039;ve never done that.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well you&#039;ve got to try it sometime, there&#039;s something about cheese at three am that&#039;s just excellent.&quot; she says excitedly. 
&quot;Funny, a mouse getting excited about cheese?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh ha-ha, what do humans get excited about?&quot; she asked, sarcastically.
&quot;Steamed hams.&quot;
&gt;&quot;What?&quot;
&quot;Nothing.&quot;

...

&quot;You were really good once you got going, I&#039;m actually surpsised you spoke as much as you did.&quot; You congragulate Naomi, the newbie having held an entire conversation with you during the rest of the free talk time. 
&gt;&quot;Th-thanks it was nothing. It gets so easy once you forget people are listening.&quot;
&quot;That&#039;s exactly what I mean. Sometimes, you just gotta jump in.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll probably freeze up again tommorow,&quot; she chuckled quietly. &quot;I just hope you&#039;ll be there to break me out of the ice again.&quot;
&quot;Oh I will be, its what I do. Besides you were fantastic! Probably one of the best rookies I&#039;ve gotten to work with in a long time.&quot; You say enthuseastically. 
&gt;Naomi opened her mouth to say something, but stopped when she heard Delilah from down the hall. 
&gt;&quot;DARLINGS! I heard your first cast together, you sounded like best friends! Ooh I&#039;m so glad that you got along. Anon here is a bit picky when it comes to his on air personalities.&quot;
&quot;Am not...&quot; You huff.
&gt;Naomi giggles, her hair hiding one of her eyes from view in a cutely punk manner. 
&gt;&quot;Anyway,&quot; the Kuvasz continues. &quot;We have an opening in our charity drive this weekend, and I would be SO pleased if you filled in.&quot;
&gt;Without hesitation, you nod.
&gt;&quot;And what about you Naomi?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;d be happy to join Anon for the charity drive. When does it start?&quot;
&gt;&quot;It starts at noon this Sunday, so take Saturday off because you&#039;re gonna talk your mouths off at the charity! Ta ta~!&quot; 
&gt;With that, the Kuvasz turned on a heel, and nearly sprinted down the hallway to greet another employee. 
&gt;After watching you boss dissappear down the hall, you shrug on your backpack and turn to leave, but stopping as you felt a tug on your sleeve. 
&gt;It was Naomi, who appeared to be blushing fiercely under her fur. 
&gt;&quot;Um...would you like to go out for some calzones?&quot;
&gt;Who the fuck eats calzones in 2018?
&quot;Who the fuck eats calz- I mean, yea, sure.&quot; You catch yourself. 
&gt;&quot;What?&quot; 
&quot;Nothing, nothing&quot; You say, emberassment burning your face.
&gt;&quot;Ok, so meet me at 5th West and Main, there&#039;s an italian place there that&#039;s to DIE for.&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s a date then.&quot;
&gt;Naomi gives you an incredibly hard look, like she would give anything to punch your lights out.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s not a date.&quot;
&gt;Oh shit.
&gt;Was she really mad? Fuck.
&gt;Her face suddenly lightens, and she breaks into a howling laugh.
&gt;&quot;You should see the look on your face!&quot;


...

&gt;The dinner had been fantastic.
&gt;Not just because you liked italian food, but because your newly aquired friend Naomi was a marvel.
&gt;She had an incredibly good sense of humor, and spent the evening doing her best to make you laugh or laughing herself. 
&gt;Nothing got by her, joke wise, so you both had a fine time bantering back and forth.
&gt;At some points you were both laughing so hard it almost made a scene.
&gt;By the time you paid for the meal and left, it was almost 11:30.
&gt;Your sides were going to be sore in the morning after this.
&quot;Well Naomi, that was incredibly fun, but it&#039;s kinda late, and my place is across town so, I&#039;ll have to get going.&quot; You say, smiling.
&gt;&quot;Weeeeeell, my appartment is just a block away, so you could crash here for the night and go home in the morning,&quot; She says, smiling back.
&gt;You take her up on her offer and follow her down the street, making idle chit-chat as you do so.
&gt;Her appartment complex was small, tucked away on  a dead end street. 
&gt;Wordlessly, she opens the door, giving you a &#039;tada&#039; flourish with her arms as you enter her appartment. 
&gt;It was modest, but had a touch of punk.
&gt;A Portrait of her family hung on the wall, her, a rat anthro with dark sunglasses, her, and a racoon lady that you can only assume is her mother.
&quot;You&#039;re an only child?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yea, my parents saw me as perfection and decided not to have another one.&quot; She replied. &quot;Well, not my dad.&quot;
&quot;Your dad is blind?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah, yeah, 3 blind mice hahaha.&quot; Naomi says with a huff.
&quot;Sorry, didn&#039;t mean anything like that by it.&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s fine. I get cranky when I&#039;m sleepy. G&#039;night&quot;
&gt;With that, the mouse hybrid dissappeared into the bedroom, the door sealing behind her with a click.
&gt;You guess that means you get the couch.
