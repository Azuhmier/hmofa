            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your stomach growls just as you enter the house.  You desperately attempt to shush it, not wanting to make any unnecessary sound.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...but you&#039;re so HUNGRY.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You swallow a pitiful whimper and shake your head in an attempt to clear your thoughts.  It&#039;s time to focus.  All your hard work is about to finally pay off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s hard to keep from drooling as you imagine the wonderful meal awaiting you just a few rooms away...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a predatory grin, you lick your lips and move closer to your prey.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are a Phantasmagore, a creature more commonly called a Dream Eater.  Or, in particularly uninformed circles, a Baku.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ve never liked being compared to those fat, ugly tapirs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are a lean, mean, nightmare machine!  A regular apex predator of the mind!  A master of psychological warf-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;OW!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ow ow ow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why do humans have such short doorways?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You bite your forked tongue to keep from whining, and gently rub your head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Stupid human world.  Everything&#039;s too small.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You keep walking, this time making sure to crouch down a bit, and eventually reach your destination...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The human&#039;s bedroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you enter, you immediately notice a tiny souvenir dreamcatcher.  Pfft, how cute!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You snatch it up and scarf it down effortlessly.  It eases your hunger a little... but mainly makes your appetite flare up even more.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Snickering to yourself quietly, you creep closer to your mark... then stop when you see something moving in your peripheral vision.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You snap your head towards the movement... then curse yourself when you realize it&#039;s just your reflection.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh well.  At least you have a moment to touch up your fearsome appearance, in case he wakes up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grumble and fix your blackened wool.  It&#039;s far too neat to frighten a human; you need to look more wild and unkempt.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You examine your claws, then gently nibble one to sharpen it a bit.  Your pointed tail waves about idly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s funny.  Humans always say your kind look like wolves and sheep mixed.  You personally don&#039;t see it.  After all, you just have a canine snout, horns, and wool; nothing wolffish or sheepish about that!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your red eyes glow mischievously, all three of them resting just above a maw full of fangs.  You sharpen them every night!  ...even though you don&#039;t actually use them for dream eating.  No, they&#039;re for seasoning up dreams into your favorite food...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nightmares.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even thinking of the word has your mouth watering again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ve been stalking this human for weeks now, psyching him out.  You&#039;ve hidden in the darkness, letting off bonechilling howls and vicious snarls when appropriate.  You&#039;ve given chase to him in the woods.  You&#039;ve even given him some terrifying glances at your monstrous form...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hope this nightmare is a juicy one.  You&#039;ve been kinda neglecting yourself in hopes of seasoning this one to perfection.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Satisfied with your looks, you stalk forwards, taking a deep, tantalizing whiff of your target&#039;s nightm-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;WAIT.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;WHERE&#039;S THE FUCKING NIGHTMARE?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Okay, Somna, don&#039;t panic.  Don&#039;t p-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;SHIT YOU&#039;RE GONNA STARVE.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have doomed yourself, all for a stupid cooking experiment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hang your head in despair, and sniffle quietly...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...hang on.  What&#039;s that smell?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sniff the air again, and follow the scent to your prey.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Cautiously, you lean over his head and take a deep breath, your third eye narrowing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He&#039;s definitely dreaming, thank goodness, so you&#039;ll at least get to eat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Problem is... it&#039;s not a nightmare.  So all your work was for nothing.  Dammit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...what IS he dreaming about?  You can pick up a hint of your own presence in his mind... </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You gently press your head against his, peeking into his dreams...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...what the hell?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&lt;Anon&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Over the last few weeks, you&#039;ve felt like something&#039;s after you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At first it was just a feeling.  Then came the snarling and growling from the bushes by your house.  And the footsteps chasing you through the woods.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But the strangest thing?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That sound you heard in the woods.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;BAAAAHWOOOOO!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were so confused, you started looking for the source of the howl...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And caught a glimpse of a curvy monster woman.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Being a frequenter of furry sites, it didn&#039;t take long for your imagination to turn a stalker into a fantasy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tonight, however, marks the first time you&#039;ve truly had a lewd dream with her in it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your brain didn&#039;t even bother with a plot.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You just showed up in a dark clearing with that mysterious woman already waiting, a dangerous grin on her face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s been showing herself more and more lately, so you have a photographic memory of her appearance.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s much, MUCH taller than you; 8 feet easily.  Cloven hooves take the place of feet at the end of her long, lean legs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A tail reminiscent of Halloween style devils swings behind her, emerging just above a firm, toned ass.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Above her wide hips is a narrow waist and a stomach you somehow know is empty.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;From there, a sizable chest gives way to her face... a wolflike visage lined with fangs.  Three red eyes glow in the darkness, slit pupils eyeing you hungrily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pointed ears twitch alongside short horns.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Most bizarre, however, is the fact that she&#039;s covered in black wool.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re tempted to call her a wolf in sheep&#039;s clothing, but feel that may not be entirely true...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whatever the case, you shrug and get naked in your dream.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once your dream self is in the buff, the woman chuckles sinisterly before unhesitatingly dropping down to her knees.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a toothy snarl, she lunges towards you, fangs bared; your heart skips a beat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stops just shy of castrating you with her teeth...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And snickers before giving you a teasing lick with a forked, black tongue.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s enough to have you standing ramrod straight already, much to her apparent delight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The woman winks before unceremoniously clamping her jaws down on your length, beginning a masterful assault on you with her tongue.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her tail undulates wildly as she allows quiet, indecent  sucking sounds to escape her mouth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The warmth and suction on your dick is too much to handle.  You start bucking your hips in her direction, with her matching your pace and rocking back and forth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just as you feel yourself about to finish, she opens her mouth and backs off...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Only to bring you to a climax with one last lick.  You fire off a load, and she effortlessly catches it and swallows in one fluid movement.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gives you a smoldering stare with all three eyes as she slowly rises and turns around.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She bends forward, presenting her hindquarters, and uses her tail to point out her already-wet slit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As if you needed a guide.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Without further ado, you grab her ass and relentlessly plunge your length into her, eliciting a long, throaty moan.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks back with an expression of pure desire, and you are determined to satisfy her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Working up a rhythm, you begin pounding into her tight, white-hot insides, feeling her clamping down on you tighter and tighter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She slowly works herself up to panting and moaning rapidly, one hand steadying herself and the other gently tweaking her nipples.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her tongue dangles from her mouth as her eyes glaze over with pleasure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sweat begins to run down your face as you pick up the pace.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She starts to let out a howl of bliss, but bites her lip.  Determined to make her scream, you redouble your efforts, thrusting mercilessly into her depths.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She is entirely at your mercy now, having lost all sense of composure in favor of pure lust and ecstasy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She merely pants and whimpers as you bring her closer and closer to the edge.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s only when she begins shuddering in anticipation that you finally end it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a long, drawn out howl, she collapses in a heap, your seed dripping from her satisfied womanhood.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a sly grin, you give her rump one last squeeze as your dream comes to an end.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&lt;Somna&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...he... he&#039;s dreaming about having SEX with you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Humans are so fuckin&#039; weird.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh well.  It&#039;s a dream, and you&#039;re starving.  Might as well eat it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you take a taste of his fantasy, you gasp in shock.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It... it&#039;s better than any nightmare you&#039;ve ever eaten!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This human&#039;s dream of bringing you to ecstasy is the greatest delicacy you&#039;ve ever had the pleasure of tasting.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...you ravenously devour the entire thing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Normally, you never finish a dream.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tonight is different.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile down at the human and sigh happily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...if he cooked up such a delectable dream from your stalking...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What if he woke up next to you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You snicker and climb into his bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a yawn, you rub your now-full stomach, enjoying the feeling of having your hunger fully satisfied for the first time in decades.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You cuddle up against the human, making sure your face is the first thing he sees tomorrow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...you soon fall asleep yourself, letting your feast swirl around in your head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...damn, he&#039;s actually kinda hot...</div></li></ol>        </div>

            RAW Paste Data        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Your stomach growls just as you enter the house.  You desperately attempt to shush it, not wanting to make any unnecessary sound.
&gt;...but you&#039;re so HUNGRY.
&gt;You swallow a pitiful whimper and shake your head in an attempt to clear your thoughts.  It&#039;s time to focus.  All your hard work is about to finally pay off.
&gt;It&#039;s hard to keep from drooling as you imagine the wonderful meal awaiting you just a few rooms away...
&gt;With a predatory grin, you lick your lips and move closer to your prey.
&gt;You are a Phantasmagore, a creature more commonly called a Dream Eater.  Or, in particularly uninformed circles, a Baku.
&gt;You&#039;ve never liked being compared to those fat, ugly tapirs.
&gt;You are a lean, mean, nightmare machine!  A regular apex predator of the mind!  A master of psychological warf-
&gt;OW!
&gt;Ow ow ow.
&gt;Why do humans have such short doorways?
&gt;You bite your forked tongue to keep from whining, and gently rub your head.
&gt;Stupid human world.  Everything&#039;s too small.
&gt;You keep walking, this time making sure to crouch down a bit, and eventually reach your destination...
&gt;The human&#039;s bedroom.
&gt;As you enter, you immediately notice a tiny souvenir dreamcatcher.  Pfft, how cute!
&gt;You snatch it up and scarf it down effortlessly.  It eases your hunger a little... but mainly makes your appetite flare up even more.
&gt;Snickering to yourself quietly, you creep closer to your mark... then stop when you see something moving in your peripheral vision.

&gt;You snap your head towards the movement... then curse yourself when you realize it&#039;s just your reflection.
&gt;Oh well.  At least you have a moment to touch up your fearsome appearance, in case he wakes up.
&gt;You grumble and fix your blackened wool.  It&#039;s far too neat to frighten a human; you need to look more wild and unkempt.
&gt;You examine your claws, then gently nibble one to sharpen it a bit.  Your pointed tail waves about idly.
&gt;It&#039;s funny.  Humans always say your kind look like wolves and sheep mixed.  You personally don&#039;t see it.  After all, you just have a canine snout, horns, and wool; nothing wolffish or sheepish about that!
&gt;Your red eyes glow mischievously, all three of them resting just above a maw full of fangs.  You sharpen them every night!  ...even though you don&#039;t actually use them for dream eating.  No, they&#039;re for seasoning up dreams into your favorite food...
&gt;Nightmares.
&gt;Even thinking of the word has your mouth watering again.
&gt;You&#039;ve been stalking this human for weeks now, psyching him out.  You&#039;ve hidden in the darkness, letting off bonechilling howls and vicious snarls when appropriate.  You&#039;ve given chase to him in the woods.  You&#039;ve even given him some terrifying glances at your monstrous form...
&gt;You hope this nightmare is a juicy one.  You&#039;ve been kinda neglecting yourself in hopes of seasoning this one to perfection.
&gt;Satisfied with your looks, you stalk forwards, taking a deep, tantalizing whiff of your target&#039;s nightm-
&gt;Wait.
&gt;WAIT.
&gt;WHERE&#039;S THE FUCKING NIGHTMARE?

&gt;Okay, Somna, don&#039;t panic.  Don&#039;t p-
&gt;SHIT YOU&#039;RE GONNA STARVE.
&gt;You have doomed yourself, all for a stupid cooking experiment.
&gt;You hang your head in despair, and sniffle quietly...
&gt;...hang on.  What&#039;s that smell?
&gt;You sniff the air again, and follow the scent to your prey.
&gt;Cautiously, you lean over his head and take a deep breath, your third eye narrowing.
&gt;He&#039;s definitely dreaming, thank goodness, so you&#039;ll at least get to eat.
&gt;Problem is... it&#039;s not a nightmare.  So all your work was for nothing.  Dammit.
&gt;...what IS he dreaming about?  You can pick up a hint of your own presence in his mind... 
&gt;You gently press your head against his, peeking into his dreams...
&gt;...what the hell?

&lt;Anon&gt;

&gt;Over the last few weeks, you&#039;ve felt like something&#039;s after you.
&gt;At first it was just a feeling.  Then came the snarling and growling from the bushes by your house.  And the footsteps chasing you through the woods.
&gt;But the strangest thing?
&gt;That sound you heard in the woods.
&gt;&quot;BAAAAHWOOOOO!&quot;
&gt;You were so confused, you started looking for the source of the howl...
&gt;And caught a glimpse of a curvy monster woman.
&gt;Being a frequenter of furry sites, it didn&#039;t take long for your imagination to turn a stalker into a fantasy.
&gt;Tonight, however, marks the first time you&#039;ve truly had a lewd dream with her in it.
&gt;Your brain didn&#039;t even bother with a plot.  
&gt;You just showed up in a dark clearing with that mysterious woman already waiting, a dangerous grin on her face.
&gt;She&#039;s been showing herself more and more lately, so you have a photographic memory of her appearance.
&gt;She&#039;s much, MUCH taller than you; 8 feet easily.  Cloven hooves take the place of feet at the end of her long, lean legs.
&gt;A tail reminiscent of Halloween style devils swings behind her, emerging just above a firm, toned ass.
&gt;Above her wide hips is a narrow waist and a stomach you somehow know is empty.
&gt;From there, a sizable chest gives way to her face... a wolflike visage lined with fangs.  Three red eyes glow in the darkness, slit pupils eyeing you hungrily.
&gt;Pointed ears twitch alongside short horns.
&gt;Most bizarre, however, is the fact that she&#039;s covered in black wool.
&gt;You&#039;re tempted to call her a wolf in sheep&#039;s clothing, but feel that may not be entirely true...
&gt;Whatever the case, you shrug and get naked in your dream.

&gt;Once your dream self is in the buff, the woman chuckles sinisterly before unhesitatingly dropping down to her knees.
&gt;With a toothy snarl, she lunges towards you, fangs bared; your heart skips a beat.
&gt;She stops just shy of castrating you with her teeth...
&gt;And snickers before giving you a teasing lick with a forked, black tongue.
&gt;It&#039;s enough to have you standing ramrod straight already, much to her apparent delight.
&gt;The woman winks before unceremoniously clamping her jaws down on your length, beginning a masterful assault on you with her tongue.
&gt;Her tail undulates wildly as she allows quiet, indecent  sucking sounds to escape her mouth.
&gt;The warmth and suction on your dick is too much to handle.  You start bucking your hips in her direction, with her matching your pace and rocking back and forth.
&gt;Just as you feel yourself about to finish, she opens her mouth and backs off...
&gt;Only to bring you to a climax with one last lick.  You fire off a load, and she effortlessly catches it and swallows in one fluid movement.
&gt;She gives you a smoldering stare with all three eyes as she slowly rises and turns around.
&gt;She bends forward, presenting her hindquarters, and uses her tail to point out her already-wet slit.
&gt;As if you needed a guide.

&gt;Without further ado, you grab her ass and relentlessly plunge your length into her, eliciting a long, throaty moan.
&gt;She looks back with an expression of pure desire, and you are determined to satisfy her.
&gt;Working up a rhythm, you begin pounding into her tight, white-hot insides, feeling her clamping down on you tighter and tighter.
&gt;She slowly works herself up to panting and moaning rapidly, one hand steadying herself and the other gently tweaking her nipples.
&gt;Her tongue dangles from her mouth as her eyes glaze over with pleasure.
&gt;Sweat begins to run down your face as you pick up the pace.
&gt;She starts to let out a howl of bliss, but bites her lip.  Determined to make her scream, you redouble your efforts, thrusting mercilessly into her depths.
&gt;She is entirely at your mercy now, having lost all sense of composure in favor of pure lust and ecstasy.
&gt;She merely pants and whimpers as you bring her closer and closer to the edge.
&gt;It&#039;s only when she begins shuddering in anticipation that you finally end it.
&gt;With a long, drawn out howl, she collapses in a heap, your seed dripping from her satisfied womanhood.
&gt;With a sly grin, you give her rump one last squeeze as your dream comes to an end.

&lt;Somna&gt;

&gt;...he... he&#039;s dreaming about having SEX with you?
&gt;Humans are so fuckin&#039; weird.
&gt;Oh well.  It&#039;s a dream, and you&#039;re starving.  Might as well eat it.
&gt;As you take a taste of his fantasy, you gasp in shock.
&gt;It... it&#039;s better than any nightmare you&#039;ve ever eaten!
&gt;This human&#039;s dream of bringing you to ecstasy is the greatest delicacy you&#039;ve ever had the pleasure of tasting.
&gt;...you ravenously devour the entire thing.
&gt;Normally, you never finish a dream.
&gt;Tonight is different.
&gt;You smile down at the human and sigh happily.
&gt;...if he cooked up such a delectable dream from your stalking...
&gt;What if he woke up next to you?
&gt;You snicker and climb into his bed.
&gt;With a yawn, you rub your now-full stomach, enjoying the feeling of having your hunger fully satisfied for the first time in decades.
&gt;You cuddle up against the human, making sure your face is the first thing he sees tomorrow.
&gt;...you soon fall asleep yourself, letting your feast swirl around in your head.
&gt;...damn, he&#039;s actually kinda hot...</textarea>
