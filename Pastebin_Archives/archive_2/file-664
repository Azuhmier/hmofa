The sand colored creatures wear makeshift armor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One holds out what seems to be a pistol and fires two shots, while the other runs towards a target out of view with a crude axe</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The pistolier covers their teammate as they charge toward much louder gunshots</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;*CRACK* The pistolier takes a bullet to the neck and a cloud of blue-green liquid sprays out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The barbarian runs through a hail of fire to grab the pistol, and it squeezes two rounds at the unseen target</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear a muffled grunt and a &quot;Ni&#039;Tar!&quot; eminate from where the gunshots came from while barbarian cranes his neck to see if the other is moving</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You move your foot slightly, which causes a pile of rubble to topple over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The sound catches the attention of the barbarian, who raises the pistol as it slowly moves toward the ruin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You aim your pistol through the window corner and squeeze off a textbook mozambique drill</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Barbarian drops down dead, bleeding out the blue-green fluid seen before</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look out to see any other threats that might be there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The coast is clear, you move towards the bodies in the dirt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They&#039;re rather strange, the creatures are bipedal, but they have digitigrade legs </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A sand colored fur covered the body, thought these ones were rather patchy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They resembled a blend of human and desert fox</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shake your head in disgust at the thought</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Their patchwork outfits indicate they&#039;re not high on the hirearcy or have many resources</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You contemplate imprinting the one with the intact head, but a loud grunting grabs your attention</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You find your way to its source, pistol at the ready. A much more well equiped and fed creature lies fatally wounded, slumped against a boulder</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It wears more uniform armor (not that it did it much good) above a white, shining and honeycombed jumpsuit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A battle rifle lies beside it, probably what it was shooting it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The creature looks up at you, its eyes go wide but is on its last legs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re sure this one has the info you seek.

Armor, rifle, even the jumpsuit (luckily, he was your size)</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You radio to your parked ship</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Sunny, I&#039;ve got samples and imprinted one of the natives. Get the cruiser ready and deploy the disguse maker!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Okay!&quot; A cheery voice crackles in your ear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You knew none of that would be done when you got back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You glance back at the ruins you hid in, only to shrug and turn away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You trek back towards the cruiser for about 15 minutes to find machines strewn about, one of them even was the bioprinter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Honestly impressed she did more or less what you said, you plug in the bioprinter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It asks for a sample and you oblige with the samples from the guard</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sketch a disguise from pics and videos of the &#039;Padmayans&#039; as they call themselves</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The time of printing is about 2 hours, you take the time to copy the jumpsuit to make one for you and Sunny</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You call her from looking in the cargo area for Gods know what and inspect her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pops out her head and throws a wrench to the ground</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look her over, sand colored fur, small sandy mane, and her fox-like build makes her look like one of their cubs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Well, Fortuna conspires to aid us. You look like a padmayan child, so I&#039;m gonna give you a jumpsuit and call it at that.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ooohhh...&quot; Sunny glares at the jumpsuit printing on the metal plate &quot;I really like the shineyness&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Sunny, pack up the mess you&#039;ve made and we&#039;ll find a place to set up a F.O.B.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stands at attention with a salute, then rushes over to do exactly what you don&#039;t want to happen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s sweet, but you get the feeling the Vanguard board was fucking with you when they dumped her pod in your lap and said she was &#039;advanced&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She throws equipment in haphazardly, the crashing sounds become a background noise as you plan your next move</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Inara, the city closest to here seems a good place to get information about the current state of affairs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decide an aireal view would be the best move</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were packed up enough to leave, no time to waste</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Climbing into the cockpit, you motion Sunny over to get in. She scurries up the wing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All the preflight checks were irrelevant for your skill at piloting</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shortly roll into the air, kicking up dust along the way</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You peer out the window to search for any of the landmarks you&#039;ve seen in the guard&#039;s memories</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were comfortably high up to not be seen, the lidar and flir don&#039;t see anything</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s been a while, the sun&#039;s gone down and darkness engulfs the landscape</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You roll left to look down, to find a sea of soft lights amid the darkness</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You distinctly remember a large, monolithic tower near the center. Its light peers out like the Pharos</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Another issue was where to set up. Lidar scanned the area, the city was on the side of a much larger ruin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A charred skyscraper caught your attention. It was within the city walls, a large hole that the crusier could fit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Most of all, the FLIR didn&#039;t see any form of occupation. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Here, this is our F.O.B.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You gently fly into the wide hole on the ruin side, just below the top floor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The loud scraping noises did not detract from your perfect landing, the engines quit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Emerging from the cockpit, you slowly clear the lower levels, looking for a good place to set up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The second floor down from the new hangar looked to be good</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You open the cargo hatch, equipment falling all around to reveal the now finished bio printer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reach for the disguise and examine the face mask, the frame holds up the muzzle and should articulate the way these &#039;Padmayans&#039; would</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You strip out of your armor and try on the skinsuit, the biomesh sticks perfectly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then you place the face mask on, it sticks to everything perfectly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You put on the jumpsuit over it, you felt the nylon material across your fur. Once again, the biosuit works perfectly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking into a mirror, you check the articulation of the face, ears and tail. Angry; teeth out, ears back and tail raised</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Happy; ears perked up, black lipped smile and curled up tail</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few other tests of the articulation and this suit could fool even you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A sinister smile crept across your face, and you spoke in the Padmayan tongue</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;&lt;Face of the enemy&gt;&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You turn to call Sunny over to look at you, She didn&#039;t take to that very well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Where did you go? Where is he?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;m right here, this is my guise. And be quiet, do you want to wake the neighborhood?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Maybe.&quot; Sunny tilted her head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tapping your foot, you remember Sunny&#039;s jumpsuit draping over the side</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Try this on, you&#039;ll be going as my little sister. This is what the natives wear.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Okay!&quot; Sunny takes to it rather excitedly. You move to the other side of the cruiser to give her some privacy as she changes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You turn to the next issue, setting up camp. Moving the heavy prefab is gonna be a pain.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A large sheet of metal catches your attention, you could slide it down the stairs to the floor below</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Surprise!&quot; Sunny jumps out in her new jumpsuit, scaring the shit out of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Don&#039;t do that!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lean on the cruiser as you catch your breath</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Well, not that you&#039;re done. We&#039;re gonna set up camp for tonight.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grab the sheet metal and drag it to the cargo hatch. Sunny tips the prefab out of the hatch while you catch it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The damned thing weighs a tonne, you lower the crate onto the sheet, your back about to give out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Sunny, come on. We got to push this thing to the stairs, we&#039;ll slide it down and set it up there.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you push against the prefab crate. It&#039;s a demanding task despite the genetic and cybernetic augmented strength</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reach the stairs, and lay out the plan for the stairs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Alright, You push the thing over the stairs and I&#039;ll control its sliding on the other side.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You move to the stair side and put your hands on the crate, Sunny pushes the thing over the top stair</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It starts sliding, and you struggle to keep it from running you down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The crate starts sliding off the sheet metal, you try your best to keep it on, but it catches on a stair near the bottom</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The crate tips over and the full weight falls on your shoulders. With a quick breath, you let it rotate down and land on the floor. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Alright, we&#039;ll do that again and set up on the lower floor. Grab that sheet, and we&#039;ll roll it on top.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sunny tips the thing over onto the sheet metal, and the process repeats.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After another time of nearly nearly being crushed be the prefab, the two of you manage to set the prefab in position.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Now, for the grand opening...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull out the pin, and the crate pops open. Walls emerge and solidify, the braces lock up properly, everything looks good</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The loud thumping noises no longer concern you, the natives don&#039;t care or can&#039;t hear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you walk inside, you look to find the bare bones furniture set themselves up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Beds, collapsing library and the grid controller.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You inspect the grid controller, the prefab is working normally. Temperature and atmosphere normal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decide to not activate the fuel cell, it would just waste power</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Sunny, we&#039;ll call it a night and set up later tomorrow.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She agreed and climbed up the upper bunk</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You changed out the skinsuit and hang it in the life support bag, you put on your casual wear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The exhaustion of the day&#039;s events caught up with you, you flop onto the bottom bunk</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tomorrows plans causally pass your thoughts, take a stroll through town and find some form of information repository</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re soon out like a light</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The first thing you feel in the morning is something warm and furry crushing your face. A loud snoring emitted from the culprit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Sunny. Can you please get off my face?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The snoring continued, and so you pull you arms free to put the furry mass on the floor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;H-huh? W-wha...?&quot; Sunny looks around, dazed and confused. You simply put on your disguise and ready for the day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sunny had slept in her jumpsuit, and had started combing her sand colored mane with a wire combed plug</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn&#039;t have the will to stop it, so you just briefed her on today&#039;s plan</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;We&#039;re gonna head out into town and find out what we can about the area, just act like you belong and we&#039;ll be fine.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sunny was half paying attention, you just gave up on trying to maintain discipline</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Disguise ready and Sunny ready to go, you place a few LRAD pads along the stairwell to deter any intruders.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You check around the charred doorway to look for any witnesses, but you&#039;re clear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The sounds emanating from the side of other ruins gives you an idea of where the city is</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sunny skips along the way, as you make your way toward the city proper</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Merchants plying their wares and workshops pumping them out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Guards equipped in a similar manner to the one in the wastes patrol the streets</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You vigilantly scan for anything that would be helpful for your search.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A guard brushes past you and turns to face you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get a sense of scale of the adults, something you didn&#039;t see before as he dwarfs over you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&lt;&quot;What are you doing out here? Shouldn&#039;t you be in university about now?&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&lt;&quot;O-oh yeah, I just took a wrong turn and wandered here.&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&lt;&quot;Well, it&#039;s down the street, past the blacksmith, the big flowstone structure, can&#039;t miss it&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You thank the guard for the info, he mutters something as he walks off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn&#039;t do anything before you walked away, getting filled with bullets was not your plan</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The marketplace looks ramshackle, sand rats living in the shadows of their former glory</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear the pounding of metal from one of the shacks, that must mean you&#039;re close</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Past the smoke of the forge, you spot taller, diorite colored buildings. These must be the upper class area, no wonder the guard didn&#039;t like you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some Padmayans about your height walk into the building, this must be the university he spoke about.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Okay, just act like you belong</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wander into the place, and into the atrium. In the center, lays a scale model of a city in the center. That must be the former city these ruin once were</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few of the youths gave you strange looks as you passed by, you just walk along like you owned the place</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You made your way to some lecture room you had no business being in, a few others walk in after you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The furniture was strange, the seats were a sideways ring with a portion removed, the back part was the seat and the other held the desk board</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All of the room was the same color as the building, it was rather depressing really</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some of the youths turns in their seats towards yours, one of them asked</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&lt;&quot;So who are you? You don&#039;t look like your from here?&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&lt;&quot;Galecthay, I&#039;m from Anarii&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You fucked up and blurted out your real name. Nevermind saying you&#039;re from the city you&#039;ve never been around</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The others buy it, though the glances still make you ill at ease</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One girl gets your attention, her angry glaring does not bode well.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&lt;&quot;Okay, how does no one see the xeno in the room?!&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The others roll their eyes &lt;&quot;You&#039;ve been telling us of aliens and pre-war conspiracies for YEARS now. You don&#039;t have any proof of this Yyogg shit, what makes this kid different?&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The girl had distinctive jet black hair, she seemed better fed than the others in the marketplace, though all these kids did too</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She walked over in front of your desk and gestures to you &lt;&quot;Really? How about his mane color? No Padmayan has ever had in recorded history has has that mane color?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&lt;&quot;It&#039;s a benign mutation, besides I&#039;ve never seen anyone with a black mane before.&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&lt;&quot;Alright what about your shins being super long, it that a &#039;benign mutation&#039;?&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&lt;&quot;Yes, Go out in the wastes for a day, you&#039;ll see much weirder shit&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&lt;&quot;I&#039;ve been out in the wastes a lot, I&#039;ve never seen anything like you&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Luckily for you, the others don&#039;t buy it. Her tangent was interrupted by the instructor entering the room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sat down while the material was readied. The instructor spoke out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&lt;&quot;Well, welcome to the first year of instruction. You are very privileged to be here, the only university on Padmay.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The instructor continues &lt;&quot;Let&#039;s start with the history of Inara. This place started as a city called Anu-Ariea when it was a part of the nation Charr in the pre-war days...&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You furiously took notes down on a pad that was provided before, a recording was rolling for later transcription</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You still felt the black haired girl leering at you, but you were disregarding her for more information about the planet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&lt;&quot;...Because of Anu&#039;s R&amp;D role during the resource wars, a high capacity Stronghold was built underneath the city. And that&#039;s where our ancestors weathered the Great Fire...&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That got your attention, that &#039;Stronghold&#039; must hold the secrets to how this city held on to its technological abilities. Now to locate it and make an expedition down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The instructor scanned the room with a devious look on his face &lt;&quot;You...&quot;&gt; He looked out at you &lt;&quot;How would a global nuclear exchange destroy the biosphere to the extent the Great Fire did?&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&lt;&quot;Umm...Likely a cobalt salt bomb, were a thermonuclear weapon also transmute a cobalt shell to cobalt 60 and spreads it through the atmosphere onto a large area.&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He looks suprised &lt;&quot;Well, it&#039;s good to see someone do their research.&quot;&gt; He goes back to the lecture</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He looks suprised &lt;&quot;Well, it&#039;s good to see someone do their research.&quot;&gt; He goes back to the lecture</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A muffled cry of &lt;&quot;See!&quot;&gt; emanates from the back of the room, but was promptly ignored</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The instructor went on with his lesson, and you go on with your note taking.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But that &#039;Stronghold 57&#039; persisted. Maybe it would hold the secrets to their remaining technology and hopefully reveal some form of weakness for you to exploit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And perhaps, there may still be missiles ready to fire in their silos, a lovely treat of irony from their forebearers </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still, that one girl may be a problem. She seems more clever than most, best to eliminate her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your plotting ends when the class ended. The others walked out of the room and you followed suit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once outside, you heard a familiar voice call your name from the bottom of the stairs &lt;&quot;Galecthay!&quot;&gt; The black haired girl called out, as you turned to meet her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You size her up as she walked towards you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her jet black mane was worn in a much more human style down to her shoulders. She wore the white, honeycombed jumpsuit that ran from her neck to just above the knees and elbows that the others wore, and she filled it out very well...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You scrub that thought out. Yellow iris&#039;d eyes stare daggers at you as she approaches. No one believes her, play it cool</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&lt;&quot;Ah, It&#039;s you. I failed to catch your name ms.?&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&lt;&quot;Na&#039;Rasha, and let me say this. You may have the others fooled, but i understand your nature. And I&#039;m gonna bring it to light as I drag your body through the street.&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&lt;&quot;And I&#039;m gonna be king of all Ara, live in a big shiny house and drink non-radioactive water. Besides, I fail to see how you&#039;d accomplish that.&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Na&#039;Rasha displays a set of unlinked handcuffs in her right hand, tail swaying in agitation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&lt;&quot;Oohh, kinky. What are they?&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She opens them &lt;&quot;Oh, just some shock cuffs I developed. It can subdue anything with a nervous system.&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&lt;&quot;Have you proven that conclusion?&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&lt;&quot;Well, I do need to do some extensive testing...&quot;&gt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Na&#039;Rasha reaches out for your arm. A sweeping kick to the ankle gentle dissuades her before you take off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You bolt through the forum, taking jagged routes through and around shops to ditch her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A quick glance reveals Na&#039;Rasha barrelling towards you. Not too concerned until you see she&#039;s devil dashing! Now you&#039;re in deep shit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The momentum along with a conveniently place pole swung you around the left hand corner towards some pre-war rubble</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Na&#039;Rasha slid around the corner, but you were out of sight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She raised her face toward the air, catching your scent. Now she tracks you through the rubble</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She leaps onto a low, charred wall. Leaping off again once she spotted her prey</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reached the safety of the tower, silently leaping up the stairs. You pass the LRAD pads set up earlier, hopefully that will deter her enough</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&lt;&quot;I can smell you up the tower, xeno.&quot;&gt; You resisted the temptation to make a quip at her expense.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A minute later, you hear a loud cry of pain. The LRAD pads did their job</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a thump of her falling back, she shouts up &lt;&quot;Alright...I just gonna go and...Plan something else for a bit...&quot;&gt; Likely fighting through the brain jarring pain</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The sound of paw steps confirms she&#039;d left. You open, then shut the door of home base, throwing down your facemask, covered in sweat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;That went smoooothly&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sunny looks up at you from her local newspaper she was reading upside down. &quot;Tsk Tsk, where have you been, master?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You just rolled your eyes, changing into casual ware.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Come on Sunny, we&#039;re gonna finish unpacking and setting up base.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sunny got up and the two of you walked up to the cruiser. From there, you unloaded the prefabs and set them up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thankfully, they weren&#039;t very heavy. You then unpacked the equipment crates and set up the facilities.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And for your next great plot... The hunt for stronghold 57.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Episode 2</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few minutes past sunrise, Sunny walks through the greenhouse, watering can in hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stops to water the prickly pear in bloom, growing out the PVC pipes along the interior and humming an unintelligible tune</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lean back in a glorified lawnchair in front of your desk, reading through the terminal and browsing aerial photos</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;No...no...no... where could this thing be? 57 is the most important site in this Gods forsaken city and nothing can point to it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You groan in frustration as you rock out of your chair</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sunny taps on the tilapia tank, sending the school scattering. She turns to you as you&#039;re walking into the hot room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Maybe you should try walking into other people&#039;s houses and ask them over tea?&quot; Once again, her dialog don&#039;t mirror any close reality</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Though, it seems to be not a bad idea. Simply asking around might lead to this big fish</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;We&#039;re not breaking and entering anyone&#039;s house yet, but you might be right here. I&#039;ll just ask the hideous natives here around for this &#039;Stronghold&#039;&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sunny smiles as you rub her hair, you turn to look back to her at that moment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Why are you watering plants in a hydroponics rack?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;There&#039;s flowers, the flowers need water on them so they&#039;ll live.&quot; You shake your head at her misconception</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Nevermind, we&#039;ll head out here in about 25 minutes.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Carefully searching around the burnt out doorway of the tower, you cross into the city proper without witness</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The best place to start would be the forum, these merchants probably heard some rumors of lost installations and the like</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You navigate the crowd of merchants, caravans and denizens of Inara. You look around for whomever looks like they have reliable info</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A crier?...no. The butcher? no, you shutter at the &#039;food&#039; he peddles. The apothecary? You might stop by later, you need plant cuttings for later</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The arms dealer, he might know or have heard something. You ride through the cracks in the crowd and make your way there</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Along the way, a speck of black crosses the periphery of your vision. It disappears quickly, could it be? just getting paranoid?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In this job, there&#039;s no such thing as too paranoid</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You continue onto the wooden stall, where a rather large Padmayan stood. He was visibly bored, oddly little business for the shithole he lives in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You put on your best face and turned on the Vanguard charm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Mornin&#039; I was looking for a sidearm, good stopping power but doesn&#039;t print too much, my old revolver broke.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The man turned to you, a bit surprised but relieved to actually be doing something</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Sure, I got a few things like that. Don&#039;t you seem a little young though?&quot; You remember that the adults tower a good 200cm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;No such thing, especially these days.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;That a boy&quot; reverberated from the shop behind his stall, piercing the grinding. The shopkeep pulled a metal and wood semi-auto pistol</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You cradle the handgrip, and clear the chamber. &quot;So, how&#039;s it feel?&quot; you dry fire it then turn back to him</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Heavy but smooth. My old .30 cal would grind like no tomorrow, so this is nice.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You look like you&#039;ve seen some places, have you ever been to one of those strongholds?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The vendor looks back to you, confused but seemingly flattered &quot;Me? no. the closest I&#039;ve been to one is being near Stronghold 57.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Where was it? I&#039;ve been here for awhile and I&#039;ve never seen anything about it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It&#039;s past the council tower, hidden past some rubble. I saw some armed guards there, so probably not open for tours.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Another man pokes his head out of the shop door, removing his goggles. &quot;No way you&#039;re getting in there, my wife&#039;s cousin works in the council tower and according to him, the old reactor is still there and producing 3/4 of the city&#039;s power. Locked up tighter than a mutie&#039;s ass.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;City&#039;s main reactor? This is too perfect, you could waltz in there and cripple the only capacity for resistance in one swoop</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;That&#039;s real interesting, had no idea. What do I owe you for the piece?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;135 Ricters for the set.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You drop some rolls of coins you had &#039;acquired&#039; and he happily accepted the payment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wander towards the council tower, hoping something would come to you how to get in. A loud shouting got your attention</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Two adults were arguing, you could make out &quot;...Purifier...substation issues...get into the reactor...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One is dressed in a leather jumpsuit, covered in oil, the other looks like a scientist. The mechanic seems to be in high rank</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mechanic walks off toward some insula blocks, you tail him for this too perfect opportunity</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mechanic storms around a ruined building, you hopped into it&#039;s broken window. He&#039;s right there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He turns to look over his shoulder, giving you an opening.

You look at the control panel, a slot the size of a playing card sat next to a switch and below three lights</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try the badge, then turn the key. The door begins sliding open into a dark, musty interior</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A malevolent smile creeps across the muzzle on your face-mask</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The blaring of the open access alarms echo through the office, catching Na&#039;Rasha&#039;s attention</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She walked across Ravoi&#039;s desk, the head commerce organizer walks in with bottle in hand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ah good, that glorified mechanic finally got off his ass and does his job.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Didn&#039;t Edom storm off towards the apartments on the south side?&quot; She inquired</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;He probably made a round about way to his job.&quot; Ravoi took another sip</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;He looked smaller than normal, and the fact no one notified the guards.&quot; Na&#039;Rasha was getting a bit suspicious</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Granted, they&#039;re smarter than the average caravan thug, better make your money sink count.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;None of the proper procedures were followed, and doubt is piling up like dust rollers...&quot; The commerce organizer was getting annoyed at this</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Everything will be fine, just rest. Nothing bad will happen.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Just send a guard to keep an eye out, just follow the procedures and you&#039;ll cover your ass.&quot; Na&#039;Rasha was pulling on the political strings</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Na&#039;Rasha looked to him and saw the lack of thinking on his part. &quot;If you won&#039;t look into this, I will.&quot; She grimaced in annoyance</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Snowball&#039;s chance in M&#039;og.

How about the reputation of their &#039;domineering&#039; husks?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Y-you wouldn&#039;t dare, you bitch&quot; The councilor growled lowly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;The pics don&#039;t lie, if you don&#039;t grant access of speak of this conversation. They go all over the project slides.&quot; N&#039;Rasha grinned in a menacing way</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The councilor faltered. In a low growl, he handed her a key. &quot;There&#039;s a secret tunnel on the ground floor, by the stairs. it leads right in&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She took the key and rushed down the stairs. There layed a padlocked steel hatch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She opened the lock and slid down the hatch. There the flowstone lined corridor was dimly lit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;N&#039;Rasha ran through the dark hallway, the occasional rad-louse scurried away as she passed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There she came to the cylindrical chamber and the steel walkway and there she saw the alien down on the reactor level</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Laughing sadistically, you turn from the diagram to a pipe near the reactor floor.

            RAW Paste Data        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;You stride out from your ship, sands of the wasteland beneath your boots
&gt;Scanning the landscape, all you see is a depressing sea of dust
&gt;You detected artificial radio signals not far from here, you landed in hopes of encountering a native creature in a secluded area
&gt;You follow the signals toward the source. The sights along the way fit the theme of this dead world
&gt;Dust, dust and more dust. Occasionally broken by the odd dead plant or half buried steel girder
&gt;You wonder why the Senate gave you this star system, the only life sustaining planet nuked itself to oblivion
&gt;Though, this place was uncharted, and as the best Vanguard in his class, it was your job to discover this information
&gt;You took the time to read some info from the sensors in your armor
&gt;Atmosphere is 79% N2, 19% O2, 0.5% CO2 and 0.5% trace gasses, primarily 106^I and 60^Co
&gt;The air was breatable, and the radionuclotides confirm your suspition of a mass nuclear exchange
&gt;Honestly, that makes your job easier. You could probably conquer this place before a crusade fleet arrives
&gt;Up ahead, you spot a small ruin that juts out the landscape
&gt;You wander up towards it, you might gleam something from it, or just break the monotony

&gt;Along the way, suddenly a loud *CRACK* has you ducking down
&gt;*CRACK* *CRACK* *CRACK* three gunshots follow, you immediately run for the ruins
&gt;You slid to cover and pull out the pistol in its thigh holster
&gt;You peer out from a window, two immaciated creatures run from a boulder. The sand colored creatures wear makeshift armor
&gt;One holds out what seems to be a pistol and fires two shots, while the other runs towards a target out of view with a crude axe
&gt;The pistolier covers their teammate as they charge toward much louder gunshots
&gt;*CRACK* The pistolier takes a bullet to the neck and a cloud of blue-green liquid sprays out
&gt;The barbarian runs through a hail of fire to grab the pistol, and it squeezes two rounds at the unseen target
&gt;You hear a muffled grunt and a &quot;Ni&#039;Tar!&quot; eminate from where the gunshots came from while barbarian cranes his neck to see if the other is moving

&gt;You move your foot slightly, which causes a pile of rubble to topple over
&gt;The sound catches the attention of the barbarian, who raises the pistol as it slowly moves toward the ruin
&gt;You aim your pistol through the window corner and squeeze off a textbook mozambique drill
&gt;Barbarian drops down dead, bleeding out the blue-green fluid seen before
&gt;You look out to see any other threats that might be there.
&gt;The coast is clear, you move towards the bodies in the dirt
&gt;They&#039;re rather strange, the creatures are bipedal, but they have digitigrade legs 
&gt;A sand colored fur covered the body, thought these ones were rather patchy
&gt;They resembled a blend of human and desert fox
&gt;You shake your head in disgust at the thought
&gt;Their patchwork outfits indicate they&#039;re not high on the hirearcy or have many resources

&gt;You contemplate imprinting the one with the intact head, but a loud grunting grabs your attention
&gt;You find your way to its source, pistol at the ready. A much more well equiped and fed creature lies fatally wounded, slumped against a boulder
&gt;It wears more uniform armor (not that it did it much good) above a white, shining and honeycombed jumpsuit
&gt;A battle rifle lies beside it, probably what it was shooting it.
&gt;The creature looks up at you, its eyes go wide but is on its last legs
&gt;You&#039;re sure this one has the info you seek. You sit on the creature&#039;s chest and pull off your helmet
&gt;The creature meekly resists, but the blood loss stops any real force
&gt;Looking the enemy in the eye, you drive a spike into the brainstem
&gt;The creature trembles and foams at the mouth as the pack does its work
&gt;You&#039;re bombarded by memories of the guard as he shutters last, brain completely destroyed
&gt;He was a caravan guard who was ambushed by raiders on his way to Inara, a prosperous city nearby
&gt;You even see what he saw as you subdued and imprinted him

&gt;You take a skin and blood sample and put them in the containers
&gt;You strip him of his equipment. Armor, rifle, even the jumpsuit (luckily, he was your size)
&gt;You radio to your parked ship
&quot;Sunny, I&#039;ve got samples and imprinted one of the natives. Get the cruiser ready and deploy the disguse maker!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Okay!&quot; A cheery voice crackles in your ear
&gt;You knew none of that would be done when you got back
&gt;You glance back at the ruins you hid in, only to shrug and turn away
&gt;You trek back towards the cruiser for about 15 minutes to find machines strewn about, one of them even was the bioprinter
&gt;Honestly impressed she did more or less what you said, you plug in the bioprinter
&gt;It asks for a sample and you oblige with the samples from the guard
&gt;You sketch a disguise from pics and videos of the &#039;Padmayans&#039; as they call themselves
&gt;The time of printing is about 2 hours, you take the time to copy the jumpsuit to make one for you and Sunny
&gt;You call her from looking in the cargo area for Gods know what and inspect her
&gt;She pops out her head and throws a wrench to the ground
&gt;You look her over, sand colored fur, small sandy mane, and her fox-like build makes her look like one of their cubs
&quot;Well, Fortuna conspires to aid us. You look like a padmayan child, so I&#039;m gonna give you a jumpsuit and call it at that.&quot;

&gt;&quot;Ooohhh...&quot; Sunny glares at the jumpsuit printing on the metal plate &quot;I really like the shineyness&quot;
&quot;Sunny, pack up the mess you&#039;ve made and we&#039;ll find a place to set up a F.O.B.&quot;
&gt;She stands at attention with a salute, then rushes over to do exactly what you don&#039;t want to happen
&gt;She&#039;s sweet, but you get the feeling the Vanguard board was fucking with you when they dumped her pod in your lap and said she was &#039;advanced&#039;
&gt;She throws equipment in haphazardly, the crashing sounds become a background noise as you plan your next move
&gt;Inara, the city closest to here seems a good place to get information about the current state of affairs
&gt;You decide an aireal view would be the best move
&gt;You were packed up enough to leave, no time to waste
&gt;Climbing into the cockpit, you motion Sunny over to get in. She scurries up the wing
&gt;All the preflight checks were irrelevant for your skill at piloting
&gt;You shortly roll into the air, kicking up dust along the way
&gt;You peer out the window to search for any of the landmarks you&#039;ve seen in the guard&#039;s memories
&gt;You were comfortably high up to not be seen, the lidar and flir don&#039;t see anything
&gt;It&#039;s been a while, the sun&#039;s gone down and darkness engulfs the landscape
&gt;You roll left to look down, to find a sea of soft lights amid the darkness
&gt;You distinctly remember a large, monolithic tower near the center. Its light peers out like the Pharos
&gt;Another issue was where to set up. Lidar scanned the area, the city was on the side of a much larger ruin
&gt;A charred skyscraper caught your attention. It was within the city walls, a large hole that the crusier could fit
&gt;Most of all, the FLIR didn&#039;t see any form of occupation. 
&quot;Here, this is our F.O.B.&quot;
&gt;You gently fly into the wide hole on the ruin side, just below the top floor
&gt;The loud scraping noises did not detract from your perfect landing, the engines quit
&gt;Emerging from the cockpit, you slowly clear the lower levels, looking for a good place to set up

&gt;The second floor down from the new hangar looked to be good
&gt;You open the cargo hatch, equipment falling all around to reveal the now finished bio printer
&gt;You reach for the disguise and examine the face mask, the frame holds up the muzzle and should articulate the way these &#039;Padmayans&#039; would
&gt;You strip out of your armor and try on the skinsuit, the biomesh sticks perfectly
&gt;Then you place the face mask on, it sticks to everything perfectly
&gt;You put on the jumpsuit over it, you felt the nylon material across your fur. Once again, the biosuit works perfectly
&gt;Looking into a mirror, you check the articulation of the face, ears and tail. Angry; teeth out, ears back and tail raised
&gt;Happy; ears perked up, black lipped smile and curled up tail
&gt;A few other tests of the articulation and this suit could fool even you
&gt;A sinister smile crept across your face, and you spoke in the Padmayan tongue
&quot;&lt;Face of the enemy&gt;&quot;
&gt;You turn to call Sunny over to look at you, She didn&#039;t take to that very well
&gt;&quot;Where did you go? Where is he?&quot;
&quot;I&#039;m right here, this is my guise. And be quiet, do you want to wake the neighborhood?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Maybe.&quot; Sunny tilted her head
&gt;Tapping your foot, you remember Sunny&#039;s jumpsuit draping over the side
&quot;Try this on, you&#039;ll be going as my little sister. This is what the natives wear.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Okay!&quot; Sunny takes to it rather excitedly. You move to the other side of the cruiser to give her some privacy as she changes
&gt;You turn to the next issue, setting up camp. Moving the heavy prefab is gonna be a pain.
&gt;A large sheet of metal catches your attention, you could slide it down the stairs to the floor below
&gt;&quot;Surprise!&quot; Sunny jumps out in her new jumpsuit, scaring the shit out of you
&quot;Don&#039;t do that!&quot;
&gt;You lean on the cruiser as you catch your breath
&quot;Well, not that you&#039;re done. We&#039;re gonna set up camp for tonight.&quot;
&gt;You grab the sheet metal and drag it to the cargo hatch. Sunny tips the prefab out of the hatch while you catch it

&gt;The damned thing weighs a tonne, you lower the crate onto the sheet, your back about to give out
&quot;Sunny, come on. We got to push this thing to the stairs, we&#039;ll slide it down and set it up there.&quot;
&gt;The two of you push against the prefab crate. It&#039;s a demanding task despite the genetic and cybernetic augmented strength
&gt;You reach the stairs, and lay out the plan for the stairs.
&quot;Alright, You push the thing over the stairs and I&#039;ll control its sliding on the other side.&quot;
&gt;You move to the stair side and put your hands on the crate, Sunny pushes the thing over the top stair
&gt;It starts sliding, and you struggle to keep it from running you down.
&gt;The crate starts sliding off the sheet metal, you try your best to keep it on, but it catches on a stair near the bottom
&gt;The crate tips over and the full weight falls on your shoulders. With a quick breath, you let it rotate down and land on the floor. 
&quot;Alright, we&#039;ll do that again and set up on the lower floor. Grab that sheet, and we&#039;ll roll it on top.&quot;
&gt;Sunny tips the thing over onto the sheet metal, and the process repeats.
&gt;After another time of nearly nearly being crushed be the prefab, the two of you manage to set the prefab in position.
&quot;Now, for the grand opening...&quot;
&gt;You pull out the pin, and the crate pops open. Walls emerge and solidify, the braces lock up properly, everything looks good
&gt;The loud thumping noises no longer concern you, the natives don&#039;t care or can&#039;t hear
&gt;The two of you walk inside, you look to find the bare bones furniture set themselves up
&gt;Beds, collapsing library and the grid controller.
&gt;You inspect the grid controller, the prefab is working normally. Temperature and atmosphere normal.
&gt;You decide to not activate the fuel cell, it would just waste power
&quot;Sunny, we&#039;ll call it a night and set up later tomorrow.&quot;
&gt;She agreed and climbed up the upper bunk
&gt;You changed out the skinsuit and hang it in the life support bag, you put on your casual wear

&gt;The exhaustion of the day&#039;s events caught up with you, you flop onto the bottom bunk
&gt;Tomorrows plans causally pass your thoughts, take a stroll through town and find some form of information repository
&gt;You&#039;re soon out like a light
&gt;The first thing you feel in the morning is something warm and furry crushing your face. A loud snoring emitted from the culprit
&quot;Sunny. Can you please get off my face?&quot;
&gt;The snoring continued, and so you pull you arms free to put the furry mass on the floor
&gt;&quot;H-huh? W-wha...?&quot; Sunny looks around, dazed and confused. You simply put on your disguise and ready for the day
&gt;Sunny had slept in her jumpsuit, and had started combing her sand colored mane with a wire combed plug
&gt;You didn&#039;t have the will to stop it, so you just briefed her on today&#039;s plan
&quot;We&#039;re gonna head out into town and find out what we can about the area, just act like you belong and we&#039;ll be fine.&quot;
&gt;Sunny was half paying attention, you just gave up on trying to maintain discipline
&gt;Disguise ready and Sunny ready to go, you place a few LRAD pads along the stairwell to deter any intruders.
&gt;You check around the charred doorway to look for any witnesses, but you&#039;re clear
&gt;The sounds emanating from the side of other ruins gives you an idea of where the city is
&gt;Sunny skips along the way, as you make your way toward the city proper
&gt;Merchants plying their wares and workshops pumping them out
&gt;Guards equipped in a similar manner to the one in the wastes patrol the streets
&gt;You vigilantly scan for anything that would be helpful for your search.
&gt;A guard brushes past you and turns to face you.
&gt;You get a sense of scale of the adults, something you didn&#039;t see before as he dwarfs over you
&gt;&lt;&quot;What are you doing out here? Shouldn&#039;t you be in university about now?&quot;&gt;
&lt;&quot;O-oh yeah, I just took a wrong turn and wandered here.&quot;&gt;
&gt;&lt;&quot;Well, it&#039;s down the street, past the blacksmith, the big flowstone structure, can&#039;t miss it&quot;&gt;

&gt;You thank the guard for the info, he mutters something as he walks off
&gt;You didn&#039;t do anything before you walked away, getting filled with bullets was not your plan
&gt;The marketplace looks ramshackle, sand rats living in the shadows of their former glory
&gt;You hear the pounding of metal from one of the shacks, that must mean you&#039;re close
&gt;Past the smoke of the forge, you spot taller, diorite colored buildings. These must be the upper class area, no wonder the guard didn&#039;t like you
&gt;Some Padmayans about your height walk into the building, this must be the university he spoke about.
&gt;Okay, just act like you belong
&gt;You wander into the place, and into the atrium. In the center, lays a scale model of a city in the center. That must be the former city these ruin once were
&gt;A few of the youths gave you strange looks as you passed by, you just walk along like you owned the place
&gt;You made your way to some lecture room you had no business being in, a few others walk in after you.
&gt;The furniture was strange, the seats were a sideways ring with a portion removed, the back part was the seat and the other held the desk board
&gt;All of the room was the same color as the building, it was rather depressing really
&gt;Some of the youths turns in their seats towards yours, one of them asked
&gt;&lt;&quot;So who are you? You don&#039;t look like your from here?&quot;&gt;
&lt;&quot;Galecthay, I&#039;m from Anarii&quot;&gt;
&gt;You fucked up and blurted out your real name. Nevermind saying you&#039;re from the city you&#039;ve never been around
&gt;The others buy it, though the glances still make you ill at ease
&gt;One girl gets your attention, her angry glaring does not bode well.
&gt;&lt;&quot;Okay, how does no one see the xeno in the room?!&quot;&gt;
&gt;The others roll their eyes &lt;&quot;You&#039;ve been telling us of aliens and pre-war conspiracies for YEARS now. You don&#039;t have any proof of this Yyogg shit, what makes this kid different?&quot;&gt;
&gt;The girl had distinctive jet black hair, she seemed better fed than the others in the marketplace, though all these kids did too

&gt;She walked over in front of your desk and gestures to you &lt;&quot;Really? How about his mane color? No Padmayan has ever had in recorded history has has that mane color?&quot;
&lt;&quot;It&#039;s a benign mutation, besides I&#039;ve never seen anyone with a black mane before.&quot;&gt;
&gt;&lt;&quot;Alright what about your shins being super long, it that a &#039;benign mutation&#039;?&quot;&gt;
&lt;&quot;Yes, Go out in the wastes for a day, you&#039;ll see much weirder shit&quot;&gt;
&gt;&lt;&quot;I&#039;ve been out in the wastes a lot, I&#039;ve never seen anything like you&quot;&gt;
&gt;Luckily for you, the others don&#039;t buy it. Her tangent was interrupted by the instructor entering the room
&gt;She sat down while the material was readied. The instructor spoke out
&gt;&lt;&quot;Well, welcome to the first year of instruction. You are very privileged to be here, the only university on Padmay.&quot;
&gt;The instructor continues &lt;&quot;Let&#039;s start with the history of Inara. This place started as a city called Anu-Ariea when it was a part of the nation Charr in the pre-war days...&quot;&gt;
&gt;You furiously took notes down on a pad that was provided before, a recording was rolling for later transcription
&gt;You still felt the black haired girl leering at you, but you were disregarding her for more information about the planet
&gt;&lt;&quot;...Because of Anu&#039;s R&amp;D role during the resource wars, a high capacity Stronghold was built underneath the city. And that&#039;s where our ancestors weathered the Great Fire...&quot;&gt;
&gt;That got your attention, that &#039;Stronghold&#039; must hold the secrets to how this city held on to its technological abilities. Now to locate it and make an expedition down
&gt;The instructor scanned the room with a devious look on his face &lt;&quot;You...&quot;&gt; He looked out at you &lt;&quot;How would a global nuclear exchange destroy the biosphere to the extent the Great Fire did?&quot;&gt;
&lt;&quot;Umm...Likely a cobalt salt bomb, were a thermonuclear weapon also transmute a cobalt shell to cobalt 60 and spreads it through the atmosphere onto a large area.&quot;&gt;
&gt;He looks suprised &lt;&quot;Well, it&#039;s good to see someone do their research.&quot;&gt; He goes back to the lecture

&gt;He looks suprised &lt;&quot;Well, it&#039;s good to see someone do their research.&quot;&gt; He goes back to the lecture
&gt;A muffled cry of &lt;&quot;See!&quot;&gt; emanates from the back of the room, but was promptly ignored
&gt;The instructor went on with his lesson, and you go on with your note taking.
&gt;But that &#039;Stronghold 57&#039; persisted. Maybe it would hold the secrets to their remaining technology and hopefully reveal some form of weakness for you to exploit
&gt;And perhaps, there may still be missiles ready to fire in their silos, a lovely treat of irony from their forebearers 
&gt;Still, that one girl may be a problem. She seems more clever than most, best to eliminate her
&gt;Your plotting ends when the class ended. The others walked out of the room and you followed suit
&gt;Once outside, you heard a familiar voice call your name from the bottom of the stairs &lt;&quot;Galecthay!&quot;&gt; The black haired girl called out, as you turned to meet her
&gt;You size her up as she walked towards you
&gt;Her jet black mane was worn in a much more human style down to her shoulders. She wore the white, honeycombed jumpsuit that ran from her neck to just above the knees and elbows that the others wore, and she filled it out very well...
&gt;You scrub that thought out. Yellow iris&#039;d eyes stare daggers at you as she approaches. No one believes her, play it cool
&lt;&quot;Ah, It&#039;s you. I failed to catch your name ms.?&quot;&gt;
&gt;&lt;&quot;Na&#039;Rasha, and let me say this. You may have the others fooled, but i understand your nature. And I&#039;m gonna bring it to light as I drag your body through the street.&quot;&gt;
&lt;&quot;And I&#039;m gonna be king of all Ara, live in a big shiny house and drink non-radioactive water. Besides, I fail to see how you&#039;d accomplish that.&quot;&gt;
&gt;Na&#039;Rasha displays a set of unlinked handcuffs in her right hand, tail swaying in agitation
&lt;&quot;Oohh, kinky. What are they?&quot;&gt;
&gt;She opens them &lt;&quot;Oh, just some shock cuffs I developed. It can subdue anything with a nervous system.&quot;&gt;
&lt;&quot;Have you proven that conclusion?&quot;&gt;
&gt;&lt;&quot;Well, I do need to do some extensive testing...&quot;&gt;

&gt;Na&#039;Rasha reaches out for your arm. A sweeping kick to the ankle gentle dissuades her before you take off
&gt;You bolt through the forum, taking jagged routes through and around shops to ditch her
&gt;A quick glance reveals Na&#039;Rasha barrelling towards you. Not too concerned until you see she&#039;s devil dashing! Now you&#039;re in deep shit
&gt;The momentum along with a conveniently place pole swung you around the left hand corner towards some pre-war rubble
&gt;Na&#039;Rasha slid around the corner, but you were out of sight.
&gt;She raised her face toward the air, catching your scent. Now she tracks you through the rubble
&gt;She leaps onto a low, charred wall. Leaping off again once she spotted her prey
&gt;You reached the safety of the tower, silently leaping up the stairs. You pass the LRAD pads set up earlier, hopefully that will deter her enough
&gt;&lt;&quot;I can smell you up the tower, xeno.&quot;&gt; You resisted the temptation to make a quip at her expense.
&gt;A minute later, you hear a loud cry of pain. The LRAD pads did their job
&gt;After a thump of her falling back, she shouts up &lt;&quot;Alright...I just gonna go and...Plan something else for a bit...&quot;&gt; Likely fighting through the brain jarring pain
&gt;The sound of paw steps confirms she&#039;d left. You open, then shut the door of home base, throwing down your facemask, covered in sweat.
&quot;That went smoooothly&quot;
&gt;Sunny looks up at you from her local newspaper she was reading upside down. &quot;Tsk Tsk, where have you been, master?&quot;
&gt;You just rolled your eyes, changing into casual ware.
&quot;Come on Sunny, we&#039;re gonna finish unpacking and setting up base.&quot;
&gt;Sunny got up and the two of you walked up to the cruiser. From there, you unloaded the prefabs and set them up
&gt;Thankfully, they weren&#039;t very heavy. You then unpacked the equipment crates and set up the facilities.
&gt;And for your next great plot... The hunt for stronghold 57.

Episode 2
&gt;A few minutes past sunrise, Sunny walks through the greenhouse, watering can in hand
&gt;She stops to water the prickly pear in bloom, growing out the PVC pipes along the interior and humming an unintelligible tune
&gt;You lean back in a glorified lawnchair in front of your desk, reading through the terminal and browsing aerial photos
&quot;No...no...no... where could this thing be? 57 is the most important site in this Gods forsaken city and nothing can point to it.&quot;
&gt;You groan in frustration as you rock out of your chair
&gt;Sunny taps on the tilapia tank, sending the school scattering. She turns to you as you&#039;re walking into the hot room
&gt;&quot;Maybe you should try walking into other people&#039;s houses and ask them over tea?&quot; Once again, her dialog don&#039;t mirror any close reality
&gt;Though, it seems to be not a bad idea. Simply asking around might lead to this big fish
&quot;We&#039;re not breaking and entering anyone&#039;s house yet, but you might be right here. I&#039;ll just ask the hideous natives here around for this &#039;Stronghold&#039;&quot;
&gt;Sunny smiles as you rub her hair, you turn to look back to her at that moment
&quot;Why are you watering plants in a hydroponics rack?&quot;
&gt;&quot;There&#039;s flowers, the flowers need water on them so they&#039;ll live.&quot; You shake your head at her misconception
&quot;Nevermind, we&#039;ll head out here in about 25 minutes.&quot;

&gt;Carefully searching around the burnt out doorway of the tower, you cross into the city proper without witness
&gt;The best place to start would be the forum, these merchants probably heard some rumors of lost installations and the like
&gt;You navigate the crowd of merchants, caravans and denizens of Inara. You look around for whomever looks like they have reliable info
&gt;A crier?...no. The butcher? no, you shutter at the &#039;food&#039; he peddles. The apothecary? You might stop by later, you need plant cuttings for later
&gt;The arms dealer, he might know or have heard something. You ride through the cracks in the crowd and make your way there
&gt;Along the way, a speck of black crosses the periphery of your vision. It disappears quickly, could it be? just getting paranoid?
&gt;In this job, there&#039;s no such thing as too paranoid
&gt;You continue onto the wooden stall, where a rather large Padmayan stood. He was visibly bored, oddly little business for the shithole he lives in
&gt;You put on your best face and turned on the Vanguard charm
&quot;Mornin&#039; I was looking for a sidearm, good stopping power but doesn&#039;t print too much, my old revolver broke.&quot;
&gt;The man turned to you, a bit surprised but relieved to actually be doing something
&gt;&quot;Sure, I got a few things like that. Don&#039;t you seem a little young though?&quot; You remember that the adults tower a good 200cm
&quot;No such thing, especially these days.&quot;
&gt;&quot;That a boy&quot; reverberated from the shop behind his stall, piercing the grinding. The shopkeep pulled a metal and wood semi-auto pistol
&gt;You cradle the handgrip, and clear the chamber. &quot;So, how&#039;s it feel?&quot; you dry fire it then turn back to him
&quot;Heavy but smooth. My old .30 cal would grind like no tomorrow, so this is nice.&quot;
&quot;You look like you&#039;ve seen some places, have you ever been to one of those strongholds?&quot;
&gt;The vendor looks back to you, confused but seemingly flattered &quot;Me? no. the closest I&#039;ve been to one is being near Stronghold 57.&quot;
&quot;Where was it? I&#039;ve been here for awhile and I&#039;ve never seen anything about it.&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s past the council tower, hidden past some rubble. I saw some armed guards there, so probably not open for tours.&quot;

&gt;Another man pokes his head out of the shop door, removing his goggles. &quot;No way you&#039;re getting in there, my wife&#039;s cousin works in the council tower and according to him, the old reactor is still there and producing 3/4 of the city&#039;s power. Locked up tighter than a mutie&#039;s ass.&quot;
&gt;City&#039;s main reactor? This is too perfect, you could waltz in there and cripple the only capacity for resistance in one swoop
&quot;That&#039;s real interesting, had no idea. What do I owe you for the piece?&quot;
&gt;&quot;135 Ricters for the set.&quot;
&gt;You drop some rolls of coins you had &#039;acquired&#039; and he happily accepted the payment

&gt;You wander towards the council tower, hoping something would come to you how to get in. A loud shouting got your attention
&gt;Two adults were arguing, you could make out &quot;...Purifier...substation issues...get into the reactor...&quot;
&gt;One is dressed in a leather jumpsuit, covered in oil, the other looks like a scientist. The mechanic seems to be in high rank
&gt;Mechanic walks off toward some insula blocks, you tail him for this too perfect opportunity
&gt;Mechanic storms around a ruined building, you hopped into it&#039;s broken window. He&#039;s right there.
&gt;He turns to look over his shoulder, giving you an opening. You smack him with the empty pistol, it knocked him out cold
&gt;You search for anything useful. His jumpsuit and the piece de la resistance, an all access badge
&gt;You put on the suit, stuffing some cloth to bulk out the loose article
&gt;You strip him of everything, completing your disguise
&quot;Now, to find that reactor&quot;
&gt;The merchant&#039;s directions seemed to be accurate, you find a ruined building with a concrete door
&gt;Two guards stood on guard, battle rifles slung over their back. You raise your back, to try to make yourself more adult like
&gt;You show the badge, trying to fool the guards
&quot;Got some emergency maintenance that needs to be done on the substation. I&#039;m here to repair some grid issues&quot;
&gt;The guards look at each other in confusion, then one looks to you &quot;We didn&#039;t get word from the council about any repairs.&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s a small issue, the council wanted to keep it quiet so people don&#039;t start freaking out.&quot;
&gt;Roll for persuasion
&gt;They look at each other, then shrugged. &quot;All right, you&#039;re good.&quot; They stepped aside
&gt;Fortuna smiles upon you this day. You look at the control panel, a slot the size of a playing card sat next to a switch and below three lights
&gt;You try the badge, then turn the key. The door begins sliding open into a dark, musty interior
&gt;A malevolent smile creeps across the muzzle on your face-mask

&gt;The blaring of the open access alarms echo through the office, catching Na&#039;Rasha&#039;s attention
&gt;She walked across Ravoi&#039;s desk, the head commerce organizer walks in with bottle in hand.
&gt;&quot;Ah good, that glorified mechanic finally got off his ass and does his job.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Didn&#039;t Edom storm off towards the apartments on the south side?&quot; She inquired
&gt;&quot;He probably made a round about way to his job.&quot; Ravoi took another sip
&gt;&quot;He looked smaller than normal, and the fact no one notified the guards.&quot; Na&#039;Rasha was getting a bit suspicious
&gt;&quot;Granted, they&#039;re smarter than the average caravan thug, better make your money sink count.&quot;
&gt;&quot;None of the proper procedures were followed, and doubt is piling up like dust rollers...&quot; The commerce organizer was getting annoyed at this
&gt;&quot;Everything will be fine, just rest. Nothing bad will happen.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Just send a guard to keep an eye out, just follow the procedures and you&#039;ll cover your ass.&quot; Na&#039;Rasha was pulling on the political strings
&gt;Na&#039;Rasha looked to him and saw the lack of thinking on his part. &quot;If you won&#039;t look into this, I will.&quot; She grimaced in annoyance
&gt;&quot;Snowball&#039;s chance in M&#039;og. You&#039;re just a spoiled cub of a mediocre scientist.&quot; 
&gt;N&#039;Rasha wanted to claw his eyes out, but she needed something from him. Her insurance policy came to mind
&gt;&quot;So, how would the council feel about your trips to Eva? ones on the city budget? How about the reputation of their &#039;domineering&#039; husks?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Y-you wouldn&#039;t dare, you bitch&quot; The councilor growled lowly
&gt;&quot;The pics don&#039;t lie, if you don&#039;t grant access of speak of this conversation. They go all over the project slides.&quot; N&#039;Rasha grinned in a menacing way
&gt;The councilor faltered. In a low growl, he handed her a key. &quot;There&#039;s a secret tunnel on the ground floor, by the stairs. it leads right in&quot;
&gt;She took the key and rushed down the stairs. There layed a padlocked steel hatch
&gt;She opened the lock and slid down the hatch. There the flowstone lined corridor was dimly lit
&gt;N&#039;Rasha ran through the dark hallway, the occasional rad-louse scurried away as she passed
&gt;There she came to the cylindrical chamber and the steel walkway and there she saw the alien down on the reactor level

&gt;Laughing sadistically, you turn from the diagram to a pipe near the reactor floor. You use the wrench to close the safety tank valve
&gt;There&#039;s no safety here. The reactor was fairly advanced, molten salt breeder with plenty of life in it
&gt;Knocking out the power and flooding the area in molten, radioactive salts is a beautiful stroke
&gt;If only the place wasn&#039;t a dark concrete cave
&gt;As you ready to spear the containment vessel and core, you here a hauntingly familiar voice cry out &quot;Galecthay!&quot;
&gt;Looking up, you find the black haired pest. She won&#039;t ruin this moment
&quot;You&#039;re starting to get on my nerves&quot;
&gt;&quot;they&#039;re gonna be real stimulated once I&#039;m do with you&quot; N&#039;Rasha shouted down the chamber
&gt;She slit down the rails and landed on the floor
&quot;Let&#039;s dance&quot;
&gt;You braced for an attack, she slashed her claws on the right side of your face
&gt;Green blood dripped down the wounds, the copper taste came of your blooded finger
&gt;A sweeping kick failed to drop her, she anticipated this old trick
&gt;You punch her in the abdomen, and she recoils, then she strikes with a pipe grabbed from the shelf
&gt;during the bloody melee, the both of you knock over several bottles of chemicals
&gt;You charge with the piece of rebar that would pierce the core, hoping to impale her
&gt;N&#039;Rasha dodges and you impale a reactor pipe, fog enshrouds the floor as you kept fighting
&gt;The both of you kept at it. As the fog grew, a burning in your eyes and lungs grew and grew
&gt;You slowed down, and your foe began to shake.
&gt;The burning grew to coughing, and you bolted up the stairs
&gt;N&#039;Rasha followed suit, the both of you coughing furiously
&gt;The burning crescendo&#039;d at the Stronghold entrance, you struggled to open the door
&gt;&quot;W-What was that!?&quot; N&#039;Rasha cried through the coughing. You remembered symptoms of certain weapons as you gagged
&quot;C-Chlorine g-gas!&quot; 
&gt;At the surface, the both of you fell to the ground. Coughing and gagging for several minutes
&gt;N&#039;Rasha leaned on you for support. Finally, the burning subsided
&quot;T-truce?&quot;
&quot;D-Deal&quot; She coughed out, no one was ready to fight at this stage
&gt;You turned to find shouting and burning in the market district, the guards trying to keep order
&gt;Apparently, the power went out while you were down there
