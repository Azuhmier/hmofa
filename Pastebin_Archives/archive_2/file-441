massive and imposing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s showing off in the ring with poses to show her muscles and curves before letting out the loudest howl you ever heard and many of the dog/wolf audience joined in with her and some humans even tried to howl too</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;guess she&#039;s got a lot of fans</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her opponent walks into the ring next </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s a jaguar in very aztec looking get up, but still mostly naked</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;all sorts of colorful feathers hang off strings or bands</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;looks like she wants to one up the wolf since she calls a human guy in the red area up to the ring</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;he nervously gets in the ring and holy shit does it show how big these woman are </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she pulls a bucket from out of the ring and has the guy dip his hands in it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;when he pulls them out they&#039;re red and wet with paint </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she turns and bends slightly forward with her ass pointing at the guy </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;telling him to do something </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;he hesitates for a bit before he places his hands on her big ass firmly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the crowd cheers at this and after some time she moves away and she faces him again </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;from this angle you can see two bright red human hand prints on her ass</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she then grabs his crotch forcing him on his tip toes before she whispers something in his ear and licks the side of his face </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she makes a line on his forehead withe the red paint before letting him go back to his seat </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;that &quot;are you singe&quot; question you got at the door is starting to make more sense now and you think how you&#039;ll be returning to this place again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;wonder if they have any membership thing?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the announcer comes on telling the 2 to get to their corners </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;looks like the first round is starting </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can feel a rather large change in the atmosphere of the crowd and ring </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;everything goes quiet before a bell rings and the 2 charge each other </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;and your entire view of this place changes when they start tearing into each other </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;fangs and claws flash and sink into each other </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;they&#039;re not holding back and blood is being drawn </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;nothing life threatening since both are still going at just as viciously</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you also notice there&#039;s no ref at all and some, what you assume are, medics down by a back stage entrance</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the fight goes on for little longer before both are panting </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the jaguar gets an upper hand and gets the wolf in a choke hold </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the wolf eventually goes limp a bit before the jaguar drops her and the wolf starts taking deep coughing breaths </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the crowd erupts into cheers while the medics wordlessly get into the ring cheeking on the wolf</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she needed a bit of help standing up, but limps out of the ring and back stage on her own </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the jaguar meanwhile hops out of the ring and walks towards the human guy she marked earlier and picks him up and tosses him over her shoulder </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;blood still dripping from some cuts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she walks by and you get a full scale on how much bigger she is</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you also see the guy&#039;s face is a mixture of fear and excitement </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the red hand prints also still clearly there on her ass and her walk has much sway to her hips</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she carries him to a different backstage entrance and you don&#039;t see either of them after that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;jesus, what have you gotten yourself into this time </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you don&#039;t know if you&#039;re more terrified or excited for the next match </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the next matches go the same way</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;2 big anthro woman come up, some showboating is done, maybe they pick a guy before the match, they have a bloody fight until one can&#039;t fight anymore, the winner claims her prize, and there&#039;s another empty seat in the red area</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;then it gets to the final match and you&#039;re slightly exhausted from all the tension and excitement of tonight </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;and holy shit did they save up for the finale </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;2 fucking titans of woman walk into the ring </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a Kodiak bear and grizzly bear woman are the last match </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the grizzly is wearing some sort of lewd lumberjack get up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;a plaid shirt tied in that bikini fashion to hold her massive tits and jean shorts cut so small they&#039;re thongs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the Kodiak looks more like a prehistoric monster</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;naked with bands made of bone on her limbs and wearing a necklace with various skulls on it, including human skulls</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;and ashen white streaks over various parts of her monstrous frame </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;then she looks over and locks eyes with you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her gaze makes you freeze and forget to breath</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;then your heart skips a beat when she makes a come hither gesture </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;on shaky feet you walk to the ring before you&#039;re pulled into the air at such speed and height you get momentary vertigo</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re dangling in the air at head height to her and she looks you over with hungry eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you must be hanging 9-10 feet in the air</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you also get an up close scale on just how colossal she is </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;all you get for a warning is a lewd smile and her eyelids lowering before she kisses you with fervor </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;given the size difference she covers most of your face </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she lowers you out of the ring and places her necklace of skulls on your shoulders and you realize they&#039;re to scale </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you also realize they are thankfully fake plastic skulls </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the necklace makes it a bit awkward, but you manage to get back to your seat and she never took her eyes off you until the announcement to get ready to fight </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;when the bell rings both bears roar at each other first </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it feels like every bone in your body is vibrating from that </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;then they crash into each other and start swiping</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;god, you swear you can feel the impact of each massive hit from here </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;no wonder they didn&#039;t have either bear fight any other species, but their own with how much force each hit they throw </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you clutch the skull necklace while watching every moment </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it&#039;s like you have a front row seat to a godzila fight </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;there&#039;s actually very little blood with how thick each&#039;s hide is </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the Kodiak gets a good grip on the grizzly and tosses her a few feet away before landing on her and throwing hits madly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she gets one last punch in before the grizzly is out cold </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she stands and lets out a victorious roar with the crowd cheering for the grand finale </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;everyone, but you that is</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re deathly quiet with the realization of what comes next </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she jumps out of the ring and her landing impact shaking you slightly </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s in front of you and slowly reaching for you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;next thing you know you&#039;re cradled in one of her arms pressed against her massive chest and surrounded by warm soft fur </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s only looking at you as she walks </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;and the only word she rumbles out </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Mine.&quot;</div></li></ol>        </div>

&gt;she&#039;s a jaguar in very aztec looking get up, but still mostly naked
&gt;all sorts of colorful feathers hang off strings or bands
&gt;looks like she wants to one up the wolf since she calls a human guy in the red area up to the ring

&gt;he nervously gets in the ring and holy shit does it show how big these woman are 
&gt;she pulls a bucket from out of the ring and has the guy dip his hands in it
&gt;when he pulls them out they&#039;re red and wet with paint 
&gt;she turns and bends slightly forward with her ass pointing at the guy 
&gt;telling him to do something 
&gt;he hesitates for a bit before he places his hands on her big ass firmly
&gt;the crowd cheers at this and after some time she moves away and she faces him again 
&gt;from this angle you can see two bright red human hand prints on her ass
&gt;she then grabs his crotch forcing him on his tip toes before she whispers something in his ear and licks the side of his face 
&gt;she makes a line on his forehead withe the red paint before letting him go back to his seat 
&gt;that &quot;are you singe&quot; question you got at the door is starting to make more sense now and you think how you&#039;ll be returning to this place again
&gt;wonder if they have any membership thing?
&gt;the announcer comes on telling the 2 to get to their corners 
&gt;looks like the first round is starting 
&gt;you can feel a rather large change in the atmosphere of the crowd and ring 
&gt;everything goes quiet before a bell rings and the 2 charge each other 
&gt;and your entire view of this place changes when they start tearing into each other 
&gt;fangs and claws flash and sink into each other 
&gt;they&#039;re not holding back and blood is being drawn 
&gt;nothing life threatening since both are still going at just as viciously
&gt;you also notice there&#039;s no ref at all and some, what you assume are, medics down by a back stage entrance
&gt;the fight goes on for little longer before both are panting 
&gt;the jaguar gets an upper hand and gets the wolf in a choke hold 
&gt;the wolf eventually goes limp a bit before the jaguar drops her and the wolf starts taking deep coughing breaths 
&gt;the crowd erupts into cheers while the medics wordlessly get into the ring cheeking on the wolf

&gt;she needed a bit of help standing up, but limps out of the ring and back stage on her own 
&gt;the jaguar meanwhile hops out of the ring and walks towards the human guy she marked earlier and picks him up and tosses him over her shoulder 
&gt;blood still dripping from some cuts
&gt;she walks by and you get a full scale on how much bigger she is
&gt;you also see the guy&#039;s face is a mixture of fear and excitement 
&gt;the red hand prints also still clearly there on her ass and her walk has much sway to her hips
&gt;she carries him to a different backstage entrance and you don&#039;t see either of them after that
&gt;jesus, what have you gotten yourself into this time 
&gt;you don&#039;t know if you&#039;re more terrified or excited for the next match 
&gt;the next matches go the same way
&gt;2 big anthro woman come up, some showboating is done, maybe they pick a guy before the match, they have a bloody fight until one can&#039;t fight anymore, the winner claims her prize, and there&#039;s another empty seat in the red area
&gt;then it gets to the final match and you&#039;re slightly exhausted from all the tension and excitement of tonight 
&gt;and holy shit did they save up for the finale 
&gt;2 fucking titans of woman walk into the ring 
&gt;a Kodiak bear and grizzly bear woman are the last match 
&gt;the grizzly is wearing some sort of lewd lumberjack get up
&gt;a plaid shirt tied in that bikini fashion to hold her massive tits and jean shorts cut so small they&#039;re thongs
&gt;the Kodiak looks more like a prehistoric monster
&gt;naked with bands made of bone on her limbs and wearing a necklace with various skulls on it, including human skulls
&gt;and ashen white streaks over various parts of her monstrous frame 
&gt;then she looks over and locks eyes with you
&gt;her gaze makes you freeze and forget to breath
&gt;then your heart skips a beat when she makes a come hither gesture 
&gt;on shaky feet you walk to the ring before you&#039;re pulled into the air at such speed and height you get momentary vertigo

&gt;you&#039;re dangling in the air at head height to her and she looks you over with hungry eyes
&gt;you must be hanging 9-10 feet in the air
&gt;you also get an up close scale on just how colossal she is 
&gt;all you get for a warning is a lewd smile and her eyelids lowering before she kisses you with fervor 
&gt;given the size difference she covers most of your face 
&gt;she lowers you out of the ring and places her necklace of skulls on your shoulders and you realize they&#039;re to scale 
&gt;you also realize they are thankfully fake plastic skulls 
&gt;the necklace makes it a bit awkward, but you manage to get back to your seat and she never took her eyes off you until the announcement to get ready to fight 
&gt;when the bell rings both bears roar at each other first 
&gt;it feels like every bone in your body is vibrating from that 
&gt;then they crash into each other and start swiping
&gt;god, you swear you can feel the impact of each massive hit from here 
&gt;no wonder they didn&#039;t have either bear fight any other species, but their own with how much force each hit they throw 
&gt;you clutch the skull necklace while watching every moment 
&gt;it&#039;s like you have a front row seat to a godzila fight 
&gt;there&#039;s actually very little blood with how thick each&#039;s hide is 
&gt;the Kodiak gets a good grip on the grizzly and tosses her a few feet away before landing on her and throwing hits madly
&gt;she gets one last punch in before the grizzly is out cold 
&gt;she stands and lets out a victorious roar with the crowd cheering for the grand finale 
&gt;everyone, but you that is
&gt;you&#039;re deathly quiet with the realization of what comes next 
&gt;she jumps out of the ring and her landing impact shaking you slightly 
&gt;she&#039;s in front of you and slowly reaching for you
&gt;next thing you know you&#039;re cradled in one of her arms pressed against her massive chest and surrounded by warm soft fur 
&gt;she&#039;s only looking at you as she walks 
&gt;and the only word she rumbles out 
&gt;&quot;Mine.&quot;</textarea>
