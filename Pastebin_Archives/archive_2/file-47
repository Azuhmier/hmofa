I didn’t hear you come home!&quot; Dalia happily chirps, dropping the spoon then wrapping her arms around your neck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gives you a quick kiss and smiles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m making dinner tonight! You usually do so I wanna give you a break&quot; she says happily as she breaks away from you to tend to a boiling pot.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uh huh... What are you making love?&quot; you ask tepidly, peering over her shoulder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Soft shell crab Udon! My coworker, Ginger the momonga anthro, gave me a recipe and I just HAD to try it&quot; she responds, stirring a pot of what you assume is broth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You peer around the kitchen and see various food stuffs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eggs, green onions, those little things with the swirls that one would see in ramen bowls.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What were those called again? Narutomaki?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whatever.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you don’t see any cook book or see her checking her phone on how to make this meal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Dalia darling, where&#039;s the recipe?&quot; you ask as you begin poking around the kitchen, noting a few bottles knocked over (Probably from her tail).</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Dalia’s ears perk and her tail poofs a bit as one of the crabs in the pan pop as she looks around the room questioningly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Its uhhhhh... Over there!&quot; she responds cheerfully, pointing with her spoon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look to where the utensil is pointing and see a piece of paper half submerged in a puddle of soy sauce.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Gingerly you pick up the paper and give her your best &quot;really?&quot; face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She just smiles, showing her long fangs and goes back to cooking.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sighing, you pick up the sauce soaked paper, looking at the barely legible handwriting.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The whole piece of paper is stained dark brown, but still probably salvageable.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grab a handful of paper towels and lay them flat on a clear part of the counter, then place the recipe on them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Gently you fold a few paper towels over the recipe and then press down, feeling the soy sauce soak into the paper towels and in-between your fingers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a few moments, you lift your hand slowly from the recipe, checking to make sure it’s still intact.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Success!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The paper has most of the brown liquid drained from it, but is still a bit soggy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That isn’t important though because the recipe is still legible.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as you scan the directions, you hear your wife moving around busily, hopefully following the directions.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;YA!&quot; you hear from Dalia as you read the instruction &quot;Put the udon noodles into boiling water&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;YEET!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;An almost explosion of hot water cascades around the kitchen as Dalia slam dunks a package of noodles into a pot of hot water.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For fucks sake, you told her slang is NOT to be used in cooking, and you don&#039;t even know where she learned that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Plus you&#039;re sure she doesn&#039;t even know what that means.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh, and smile at Dalia; who is happily tending to the noodles in the pot.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The water on the floor to her is just a normal occurrence at this point.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Alright then, how can I help&quot; you ask, trying hard not to deflate Dalia&#039;s happiness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Dalia&#039;s ears twitch and her tail poofs slightly as she looks around the mess what was once your kitchen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uhhhh...Watch the crabs! They are soft shelled!&quot; she chirps hesitantly, pointing at the pan of small crabs with her spoon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod and get a pot holder, then stand by the pan.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;From the sound of it, the crabs have been thoroughly cooked.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lift the lid off the pan and look in to check the progress.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Luckily (Unluckily for them), no crabs have survived and are now fried in sesame oil.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It honestly smells delicious, and you&#039;re quick to remove the fried crustacean from the heat in fear of overcooking them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Dalia is stirring the noodles merrily, still chirping along to the beat of a song on the radio you don&#039;t know.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You watch her calmly, her tail wiggling side to side with the music, her cheerful chirping.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In that moment you know for sure that despite her...interesting cooking attempts; you love her through and through.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;How could you not fall in love with this woman?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sure she makes mistakes, but she is only human...Err...an Anthro.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whatever.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She does her best to make you happy and that’s what matters.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You monitor her as she prepares the rest of the meal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Although you do stealthily check under the sink to see if the fire extinguisher you bought is there. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She doesn&#039;t consult the recipe at all, and occasionally you have to remind her of the steps for what ingredient goes in when, but all in all she makes the meal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Although she said she was cooking to give you a &quot;break&quot;, this was more stressful than just cooking yourself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Again, you do appreciate her trying, but it was like trying to a toddler from touching the stove over and over.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You assist her in chopping the soft shell crab legs; and directing them into the broth of noodles, fishcakes and noodles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her smile is what makes all this worth it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As she (and you) put the finishing touches on the meal; she has a huge happy and proud smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She made something new for you both, and even IF you had to watch over her; it was another good bonding experience.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Bon app-a-tit!&quot; she says merrily as she presents you with a bowl of delicious smelling udon, complete with the soft shell crab legs and fish cakes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take the bowl and don’t bother correcting her wording as you take the bowl to the kitchen table, then wait for her to join you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She fills a bowl for herself and sits next to you, beaming at you as you try the meal she made.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A quick sip of the broth tells you she made another masterpiece; albeit with SOME mistakes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Good?&quot; she asks apprehensively.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You spoon a mouthful of broth and noodles into your maw for an answer, then nod with a few crab legs sticking out from between your lips.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Dalia giggles at this display, then digs in herself; occasionally letting out a happy chirp.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Luckily this meal turned out good, but there are still all the other times things went horribly wrong.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But those don&#039;t matter as you loudly slurp up a long udon noodle and stare at Dalia while you do.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gives a happy chirp and swats you with her paw playfully.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Table manners!&quot; She says through a mouthful of food, which makes her giggle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You swallow your food and give her a loving smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Love you Dalia, thanks for the meal&quot; you say, wholeheartedly meaning it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gives you a smile that could light up a dark night, one that confirms why you married her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Love you too! You get dishes still though!&quot; she chirps, pointing into the kitchen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your heart sinks as you think back to the messy kitchen...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is why you normally cook.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Fine, but you&#039;re mine later&quot; you respond, reaching under the table and squeezing her thigh.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She jumps slightly, then lets out a long seductive purr.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Deal&quot;</div></li></ol>        </div>

            RAW Paste Data        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Houses lazily pass by as you carefully drive through your neighborhood.
&gt;Little kids and cubs run around on the sidewalks, on the front yards or your neighbors who are standing outside watching them.
&gt;You wave to a few of the friendlier neighbors and then pull into your driveway.
&gt;Clicking the remote on your garage door, you&#039;re a bit surprised to see a car already parked in there.
&gt;Dalia must have gotten off work early.
&gt;And she took your usual spot.
&gt;She is a lawyer with the BHA and if she has no cases she sometimes gets off.
&gt;You smile as you get out of your car and walk through the garage, closing the door as you enter your house.
&gt;A cheerful tune fills the air and you hear happy chirping going along with the rhythm.
&gt;She must be in a good mood to be chirping so much.
&gt;However as you walk through the hallway, one thing stops you dead in your tracks.
&gt;The smoke detectors battery has been removed
&gt;That can only mean one thing...
&gt;She decided to try cooking.
&gt;Again.
&gt;You rush to the kitchen and find Dalia, a slender Serval Anthro wearing jeans, a white shirt and an apron, happily slapping small crabs with a large wooden spoon.
&gt;It looks like she tried to fry a dozen small live crabs in a frying pan, only to have them crawl out of the pan.
&gt;So she is slapping them back in with the wooden spoon, chirping happily all the while.
&gt;You stare dumbfounded for a moment before moving quickly to grab a lid and place it over the pan right as Dalia slaps the last crab back into it.
&gt;Dalia is actually a great cook, the only problem is she&#039;s a little....derpy in the kitchen.
&gt;One time she tried to make fondue with a chocolate bar, but just set the chocolate in the pan.
&gt;It just burned and stuck to the bottom of the pan, and you had to get rid of the pan all together.
&gt;Another time she tried to make a pizza, but left it on the cutting board when she put it in the oven.
&gt;That one was fun to clean up.
&gt;&quot;Honey! I didn’t hear you come home!&quot; Dalia happily chirps, dropping the spoon then wrapping her arms around your neck.
&gt;She gives you a quick kiss and smiles.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m making dinner tonight! You usually do so I wanna give you a break&quot; she says happily as she breaks away from you to tend to a boiling pot.
&gt;&quot;Uh huh... What are you making love?&quot; you ask tepidly, peering over her shoulder.
&gt;&quot;Soft shell crab Udon! My coworker, Ginger the momonga anthro, gave me a recipe and I just HAD to try it&quot; she responds, stirring a pot of what you assume is broth.
&gt;You peer around the kitchen and see various food stuffs.
&gt;Eggs, green onions, those little things with the swirls that one would see in ramen bowls.
&gt;What were those called again? Narutomaki?
&gt;Whatever.
&gt;But you don’t see any cook book or see her checking her phone on how to make this meal.
&gt;&quot;Dalia darling, where&#039;s the recipe?&quot; you ask as you begin poking around the kitchen, noting a few bottles knocked over (Probably from her tail).
&gt;Dalia’s ears perk and her tail poofs a bit as one of the crabs in the pan pop as she looks around the room questioningly.
&gt;&quot;Its uhhhhh... Over there!&quot; she responds cheerfully, pointing with her spoon.
&gt;You look to where the utensil is pointing and see a piece of paper half submerged in a puddle of soy sauce.
&gt;Gingerly you pick up the paper and give her your best &quot;really?&quot; face.
&gt;She just smiles, showing her long fangs and goes back to cooking.
&gt;Sighing, you pick up the sauce soaked paper, looking at the barely legible handwriting.
&gt;The whole piece of paper is stained dark brown, but still probably salvageable.
&gt;Maybe.
&gt;You grab a handful of paper towels and lay them flat on a clear part of the counter, then place the recipe on them.
&gt;Gently you fold a few paper towels over the recipe and then press down, feeling the soy sauce soak into the paper towels and in-between your fingers.
&gt;After a few moments, you lift your hand slowly from the recipe, checking to make sure it’s still intact.
&gt;Success!
&gt;The paper has most of the brown liquid drained from it, but is still a bit soggy.
&gt;That isn’t important though because the recipe is still legible.
&gt;as you scan the directions, you hear your wife moving around busily, hopefully following the directions.
&gt;&quot;YA!&quot; you hear from Dalia as you read the instruction &quot;Put the udon noodles into boiling water&quot;
&gt;&quot;YEET!&quot;
&gt;An almost explosion of hot water cascades around the kitchen as Dalia slam dunks a package of noodles into a pot of hot water.
&gt;For fucks sake, you told her slang is NOT to be used in cooking, and you don&#039;t even know where she learned that.
&gt;Plus you&#039;re sure she doesn&#039;t even know what that means.
&gt;You sigh, and smile at Dalia; who is happily tending to the noodles in the pot.
&gt;The water on the floor to her is just a normal occurrence at this point.
&gt;&quot;Alright then, how can I help&quot; you ask, trying hard not to deflate Dalia&#039;s happiness.
&gt;Dalia&#039;s ears twitch and her tail poofs slightly as she looks around the mess what was once your kitchen.
&gt;&quot;Uhhhh...Watch the crabs! They are soft shelled!&quot; she chirps hesitantly, pointing at the pan of small crabs with her spoon.
&gt;You nod and get a pot holder, then stand by the pan.
&gt;From the sound of it, the crabs have been thoroughly cooked.
&gt;You lift the lid off the pan and look in to check the progress.
&gt;Luckily (Unluckily for them), no crabs have survived and are now fried in sesame oil.
&gt;It honestly smells delicious, and you&#039;re quick to remove the fried crustacean from the heat in fear of overcooking them.
&gt;Dalia is stirring the noodles merrily, still chirping along to the beat of a song on the radio you don&#039;t know.
&gt;You watch her calmly, her tail wiggling side to side with the music, her cheerful chirping.
&gt;In that moment you know for sure that despite her...interesting cooking attempts; you love her through and through.
&gt;How could you not fall in love with this woman?
&gt;Sure she makes mistakes, but she is only human...Err...an Anthro.
&gt;Whatever.
&gt;She does her best to make you happy and that’s what matters.
&gt;You monitor her as she prepares the rest of the meal.
&gt;Although you do stealthily check under the sink to see if the fire extinguisher you bought is there. 
&gt;She doesn&#039;t consult the recipe at all, and occasionally you have to remind her of the steps for what ingredient goes in when, but all in all she makes the meal.
&gt;Although she said she was cooking to give you a &quot;break&quot;, this was more stressful than just cooking yourself.
&gt;Again, you do appreciate her trying, but it was like trying to a toddler from touching the stove over and over.
&gt;You assist her in chopping the soft shell crab legs; and directing them into the broth of noodles, fishcakes and noodles.
&gt;Her smile is what makes all this worth it.
&gt;As she (and you) put the finishing touches on the meal; she has a huge happy and proud smile.
&gt;She made something new for you both, and even IF you had to watch over her; it was another good bonding experience.
&gt;&quot;Bon app-a-tit!&quot; she says merrily as she presents you with a bowl of delicious smelling udon, complete with the soft shell crab legs and fish cakes.
&gt;You take the bowl and don’t bother correcting her wording as you take the bowl to the kitchen table, then wait for her to join you.
&gt;She fills a bowl for herself and sits next to you, beaming at you as you try the meal she made.
&gt;A quick sip of the broth tells you she made another masterpiece; albeit with SOME mistakes.
&gt;&quot;Good?&quot; she asks apprehensively.
&gt;You spoon a mouthful of broth and noodles into your maw for an answer, then nod with a few crab legs sticking out from between your lips.
&gt;Dalia giggles at this display, then digs in herself; occasionally letting out a happy chirp.
&gt;Luckily this meal turned out good, but there are still all the other times things went horribly wrong.
&gt;But those don&#039;t matter as you loudly slurp up a long udon noodle and stare at Dalia while you do.
&gt;She gives a happy chirp and swats you with her paw playfully.
&gt;&quot;Table manners!&quot; She says through a mouthful of food, which makes her giggle.
&gt;You swallow your food and give her a loving smile.
&gt;&quot;Love you Dalia, thanks for the meal&quot; you say, wholeheartedly meaning it.
&gt;She gives you a smile that could light up a dark night, one that confirms why you married her.
&gt;&quot;Love you too! You get dishes still though!&quot; she chirps, pointing into the kitchen.
&gt;Your heart sinks as you think back to the messy kitchen...
&gt;This is why you normally cook.
&gt;&quot;Fine, but you&#039;re mine later&quot; you respond, reaching under the table and squeezing her thigh.
&gt;She jumps slightly, then lets out a long seductive purr.
