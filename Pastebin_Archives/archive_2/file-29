If you can identify them all (excluding the one who has yet to have her own story), then thank you immensely for reading my material!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s still following you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A young woman has been stalking you for the last several blocks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s actually pretty stunning, but such a beauty has to have some kind of ulterior motive for tailing YOU of all people</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe she’s trying to proposition you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, that’s being hopeful</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s more likely to be scoping you out for a mugger</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re so absorbed in your runaway thoughts you don’t even realize you’re heading into an alley</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A dead end</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you turn around she’s right on you, grinning wickedly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With every step she takes, it looks like a part of her drips off her body </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her smile melts, literally</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As does the rest of her body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What was once a beautiful woman is now...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, a dog woman</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A beautiful dog woman</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A two-legged, black-furred canine with all the accessories you’d expect from a devil: horns, fangs, wings, a spaded tail...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All nearly bursting out of the skimpiest outfit you can hardly see through her fur</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A beautiful, succubus dog woman</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A hellhound</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You’re looking a little lonely, big guy,” she coos, running a thick claw under your chin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s going to take your soul, isn’t she?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The hellhound actually just giggles at your fear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Oh no, I don’t do that anymore. I don’t take souls, I take commissions. My NEW employer does things a little differently.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pulls a business card out of her ballooning cleavage</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;[Medafet’s Matchmaking]</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s an address on the card, and it’s someplace not far off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Just give me a call when you find some happiness.

Slammed the oaf into the ground and made a nice little outline of his body in the ground!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”W0w, that s0unds like a g00d Father’s Day, V0lfa,” the russet wolfess says in a somewhat robotic tone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She has a vicious looking chrome arm with literal blades for fingers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Doesn’t make it easy for her to pick up her glass, which makes a screeching noise with every attempt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The one named Volfa throws back a few shots, and her mouth starts smoking</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Hey, you ever arm wrestle with that thing?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Just 0nce. I w0n.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The dark wolfess drops her elbow onto the table</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Alright, you and me! Hell, I’ll even take HER on at the same time!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One of the two gray wolves—heavily scarred and heavily armored—scoffs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Hmph. Arrogant pup. Fine, I will take your challenge and show you some humility.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”That’a girl!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Volfa has a wolfess in each paw and nods to the fourth one</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The other gray is half inside what looks like a mascot costume, like she just got off the clock from her job</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Thanks, but I’ll watch,” she says. “I don’t think there’s much room left, unless you want me to arm wrestle your toes beneath the table. Then I’d be the real ‘underdog’!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She elbows the scarred wolfess, who doesn’t look amused</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Get it? ‘Under-dog’! Not to be confused with ‘Updog’.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Wh0’s Upd0g?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Dammit, R0uga, you ruined the joke...”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The wolfess table commences their three-way test of strength as you examine the rest of the bar</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While the dogs have a few tables to themselves, the bar counter is packed with felines</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s a jaguar in tribal clothes batting a shot glass side to side, like it were a small rodent or a ball of yarn</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Behind the counter is a lioness dressed up in a medieval wench’s outfit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Welcome to the finest tavern in ye olde lands…or whatever,” she says dully to the other cats. “What are you having?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The first one to order is a tiger who’s trying hard to adjust her ill-fitting swimsuit as she looks at the menu</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This place doesn’t seem to have a very strict dress code</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Just water, please,” the tigress says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The lioness sighs and turns to another large cat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You think it’s just a second lion, dressed in tribal garb like the jaguar, but this one has enormous protruding fangs like a saber tooth tiger</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What also protrudes from her is a massive pregnant belly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Water will do,” she grunts, rubbing the top of her gravid swell. “Best to drink the clean rains so long as the brood is still growing.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The lioness turns to yet another patron with a groan</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Please don’t say ‘water’.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The last feline’s even stranger than the saber tooth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She LOOKS like another lioness, but has scaly patches on her body and a black, snake-like tail</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A…sphinx?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No, a manticore</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’ll have something mixed,” she says with a toothy grin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You should do a body shot!” the tigress says, almost popping out of her swimsuit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Are you offering?” the lioness bartender asks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Hmmm, I’ll do the funnel instead!” the manticore says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The saber tooth, despite her fecundity, hefts the manticore onto the bar counter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The lioness props the manticore’s mouth open with a funnel and grabs several bottles in preparation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re mildly invested in the show, but then again there’s still more to see around the place</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Along the wall is a line of flashing arcade machines, with a kangaroo girl tapping the buttons frantically</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can faintly see a rather familiar blue vixen fighting with a staff on the screen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The game freezes for a moment and the kangaroo squeals in panic</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Surprising you very little, another canine…ish creature with a vibrant yellow mane walks over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; She casually punches the machine with her staticky paw</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The arcade cabinet pops with electricity and the game resumes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Thanks, Juitz,” the kangaroo says without taking her eyes off the screen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I got your back, ‘roo,” the spark dog says. “Can I play next?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Uh…yeah, sure. Just…let me…finish this one….”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The dog leans against one of the cabinets to wait, and the whole line of them glitch to show “JTZ” for every spot on the “High Scores” list</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Uh, maybe you could be Player 2?” the kangaroo offers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Right. I’ll go get the coins.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”W-wait, Juitz, you can just do that…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Too late, the spark dog’s already off to bother the bartender for game tokens</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hidden in the corner at a smaller table are even more dogs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In fact, she doesn’t seem to notice you at all</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The other one joining her, clearly a German shepherd, only pretends like she’s listening to the grumbling</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It doesn’t seem like she’s ignoring the conversation out of boredom, though</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Rather, her paws are too busy “exploring” regions underneath the table</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s fidgeting discreetly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You imagine she’s trying to do something lewd and not get caught, yet deliberately doing it for the thrill of that very risk</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It makes

they acted as though you weren’t even physically here</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Don’t feel bad,” she responds. “I’m sure they would enjoy your company, but they have eyes for only one human of their own already.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So it was pointless to come here, then</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;…Unless…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look into her prismatic eyes, and she gives you a friendly smile</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”This is my inn.

        <textarea class="textarea">Ladies&#039; Night [Various; Crossover, Meta, Secret Green, Comfy]: A casual gathering of all the lovely ladies from my pastes in one very self-indulgent bit of wankery. If you can identify them all (excluding the one who has yet to have her own story), then thank you immensely for reading my material!

&gt;She’s still following you
&gt;A young woman has been stalking you for the last several blocks
&gt;She’s actually pretty stunning, but such a beauty has to have some kind of ulterior motive for tailing YOU of all people
&gt;Maybe she’s trying to proposition you?
&gt;Well, that’s being hopeful
&gt;She’s more likely to be scoping you out for a mugger
&gt;You’re so absorbed in your runaway thoughts you don’t even realize you’re heading into an alley
&gt;A dead end
&gt;When you turn around she’s right on you, grinning wickedly
&gt;With every step she takes, it looks like a part of her drips off her body 
&gt;Her smile melts, literally
&gt;As does the rest of her body
&gt;What was once a beautiful woman is now...
&gt;Well, a dog woman
&gt;A beautiful dog woman
&gt;A two-legged, black-furred canine with all the accessories you’d expect from a devil: horns, fangs, wings, a spaded tail...
&gt;All nearly bursting out of the skimpiest outfit you can hardly see through her fur
&gt;A beautiful, succubus dog woman
&gt;A hellhound
&gt;”You’re looking a little lonely, big guy,” she coos, running a thick claw under your chin
&gt;She’s going to take your soul, isn’t she?
&gt;The hellhound actually just giggles at your fear
&gt;”Oh no, I don’t do that anymore. I don’t take souls, I take commissions. My NEW employer does things a little differently.”
&gt;She pulls a business card out of her ballooning cleavage
&gt;[Medafet’s Matchmaking]
&gt;There’s an address on the card, and it’s someplace not far off
&gt;”Just give me a call when you find some happiness. I’d REALLY like to hear your feedback. Toodles!”
&gt;And the hellhound is gone in a puff of smoke
&gt;...What just happened?

&gt;You head to the address on the card come nighttime
&gt;It’s a trap if you’ve ever seen one
&gt;There’s no office or business building you’d expect from some kind of formal “service” being offered
&gt;It’s just a dive bar
&gt;One without signage or even windows
&gt;Of course such an observation is superficial compared to the bouncer at the door
&gt;It’s another anthropomorphic animal woman
&gt;This one’s a wild, punkish looking hyena
&gt;Or at least she LOOKS like a hyena, except maybe a little more…monstrous
&gt;Leaning on the butt of a really big fucking gun
&gt;Not a bad bouncer to have for your bar
&gt;”Go on in, love!” she laughs as you approach. “It’s Ladies’ Night, and I’m sure you’ll find someone to hold you tight if you ask REEEAL polite like!”
&gt;She continues cackling at her own joke as she steps aside for you to enter
&gt;Welp, here goes nothing...
&gt;When you head inside, you’re awestruck
&gt;Not by the bar itself, though; it’s pretty unremarkable
&gt;All the patrons are animal people, and all female from what you can tell
&gt;There’s a number of different species, though quite a lot of canines
&gt;Closest to you is what you’d call the “wolfess table”
&gt;Two gray ones, a russet one, and one darker than all the others
&gt;The darkest wolfess, dressed like some kind of heavy metal fan, is in the middle of a story
&gt;”So I climbed his back, tied the ears on two of his heads to each other, and put the third in a headlock! Slammed the oaf into the ground and made a nice little outline of his body in the ground!”
&gt;”W0w, that s0unds like a g00d Father’s Day, V0lfa,” the russet wolfess says in a somewhat robotic tone
&gt;She has a vicious looking chrome arm with literal blades for fingers
&gt;Doesn’t make it easy for her to pick up her glass, which makes a screeching noise with every attempt
&gt;The one named Volfa throws back a few shots, and her mouth starts smoking
&gt;”Hey, you ever arm wrestle with that thing?”
&gt;”Just 0nce. I w0n.”
&gt;The dark wolfess drops her elbow onto the table
&gt;”Alright, you and me! Hell, I’ll even take HER on at the same time!”
&gt;One of the two gray wolves—heavily scarred and heavily armored—scoffs
&gt;”Hmph. Arrogant pup. Fine, I will take your challenge and show you some humility.”
&gt;”That’a girl!”
&gt;Volfa has a wolfess in each paw and nods to the fourth one
&gt;The other gray is half inside what looks like a mascot costume, like she just got off the clock from her job
&gt;”Thanks, but I’ll watch,” she says. “I don’t think there’s much room left, unless you want me to arm wrestle your toes beneath the table. Then I’d be the real ‘underdog’!”
&gt;She elbows the scarred wolfess, who doesn’t look amused
&gt;”Get it? ‘Under-dog’! Not to be confused with ‘Updog’.”
&gt;”Wh0’s Upd0g?”
&gt;”Dammit, R0uga, you ruined the joke...”
&gt;The wolfess table commences their three-way test of strength as you examine the rest of the bar
&gt;While the dogs have a few tables to themselves, the bar counter is packed with felines
&gt;There’s a jaguar in tribal clothes batting a shot glass side to side, like it were a small rodent or a ball of yarn
&gt;Behind the counter is a lioness dressed up in a medieval wench’s outfit
&gt;”Welcome to the finest tavern in ye olde lands…or whatever,” she says dully to the other cats. “What are you having?”
&gt;The first one to order is a tiger who’s trying hard to adjust her ill-fitting swimsuit as she looks at the menu
&gt;This place doesn’t seem to have a very strict dress code
&gt;”Just water, please,” the tigress says
&gt;The lioness sighs and turns to another large cat
&gt;You think it’s just a second lion, dressed in tribal garb like the jaguar, but this one has enormous protruding fangs like a saber tooth tiger
&gt;What also protrudes from her is a massive pregnant belly
&gt;”Water will do,” she grunts, rubbing the top of her gravid swell. “Best to drink the clean rains so long as the brood is still growing.”
&gt;The lioness turns to yet another patron with a groan
&gt;”Please don’t say ‘water’.”
&gt;The last feline’s even stranger than the saber tooth
&gt;She LOOKS like another lioness, but has scaly patches on her body and a black, snake-like tail
&gt;A…sphinx?
&gt;No, a manticore
&gt;”I’ll have something mixed,” she says with a toothy grin
&gt;”You should do a body shot!” the tigress says, almost popping out of her swimsuit
&gt;”Are you offering?” the lioness bartender asks
&gt;”Hmmm, I’ll do the funnel instead!” the manticore says
&gt;The saber tooth, despite her fecundity, hefts the manticore onto the bar counter
&gt;The lioness props the manticore’s mouth open with a funnel and grabs several bottles in preparation
&gt;You’re mildly invested in the show, but then again there’s still more to see around the place
&gt;Along the wall is a line of flashing arcade machines, with a kangaroo girl tapping the buttons frantically
&gt;You can faintly see a rather familiar blue vixen fighting with a staff on the screen
&gt;The game freezes for a moment and the kangaroo squeals in panic
&gt;Surprising you very little, another canine…ish creature with a vibrant yellow mane walks over
&gt; She casually punches the machine with her staticky paw
&gt;The arcade cabinet pops with electricity and the game resumes
&gt;”Thanks, Juitz,” the kangaroo says without taking her eyes off the screen
&gt;”I got your back, ‘roo,” the spark dog says. “Can I play next?”
&gt;”Uh…yeah, sure. Just…let me…finish this one….”
&gt;The dog leans against one of the cabinets to wait, and the whole line of them glitch to show “JTZ” for every spot on the “High Scores” list
&gt;”Uh, maybe you could be Player 2?” the kangaroo offers
&gt;”Right. I’ll go get the coins.”
&gt;”W-wait, Juitz, you can just do that…”
&gt;Too late, the spark dog’s already off to bother the bartender for game tokens
&gt;Hidden in the corner at a smaller table are even more dogs
&gt;A nondescript one just sulks and mumbles to herself about everything going on in the bar
&gt;Luckily you’re spared from her judgmental gaze
&gt;In fact, she doesn’t seem to notice you at all
&gt;The other one joining her, clearly a German shepherd, only pretends like she’s listening to the grumbling
&gt;It doesn’t seem like she’s ignoring the conversation out of boredom, though
&gt;Rather, her paws are too busy “exploring” regions underneath the table
&gt;She’s fidgeting discreetly
&gt;You imagine she’s trying to do something lewd and not get caught, yet deliberately doing it for the thrill of that very risk
&gt;It makes you think of your own love life
&gt;Or lack thereof
&gt;You just sort of wandered into this place, following the mysterious lead of something completely unbelievable to you
&gt;All of these anthro ladies with different personalities and histories
&gt;They’re all here for a reason
&gt;Though it’s probably just to have a good time
&gt;And yet, they all seem…”taken”
&gt;Like there’s already someone in their lives you can’t compete with
&gt;Is there someone in this place just for YOU, like the hellhound hinted at?
&gt;Well, there’s still the stairs leading to the floor above…

&gt;The raucous activity from the bar below peters out to quietness upstairs
&gt;There are several rooms along a narrow hallway, each used for a different reason
&gt;The first one appears to be just a simple lounge
&gt;A white wolfess—�very similar looking to the “Volfa” downstairs—�is enthralled with a nature documentary about wolves on a small TV
&gt;You guess she’s not so interested in the wolves themselves as she is the rugged animal handler playing with them
&gt;There’s a washroom not far off, with the door slightly ajar
&gt;Most of the ladies here look like they could rip your neck from under your head with just a swipe, but you can’t resist taking a peek
&gt;There’s a lighter gray wolfess dressing herself in hunting apparel while someone else is in the bathtub singing
&gt;”Hilde, we’re going to be late for the party,” the hunter wolfess says. “Hurry up or I’m coming in there and finishing the job for you!”
&gt;“~Just a moment!~” the one in the tub sings
&gt;Although the plastic screen hides the bather, the pointed ears of the silhouette make you think she’s probably a jackal or something
&gt;The hunter wolfess seems to have an epiphany right at the same time.
&gt;”Jackal…Hilde…hey, Hilde, what’s that ‘power’ you keep going on about?”
&gt;You back away from the door, just in case they’re ready to come out at a moment’s notice
&gt;You’re starting to run out of rooms to check
&gt;There’s a large bedroom with several more anthro girls in it
&gt;One enormous Kodiak bear is taking up the entire bed
&gt;She looks like she’s out cold, and that almost nothing is going to wake her for a while
&gt;There’s a snow leopard snoozing on top of the ursine like she were a mattress
&gt;She tosses and turns to get comfortable, proving the bear is way too catatonic to be bothered by it
&gt;A teal and gold kingfisher is sleeping upright in the corner under a hut—or a nest—of curtains
&gt;Finally, there’s a hyena (a real one this time) cocooned in a pile of blankets in the corner
&gt;She’s shivering slightly, as though her overabundance of blankets still isn’t enough to keep her warm
&gt;You leave the napping girls and head to the final room
&gt;If this one doesn’t have an anthro girl waiting for you, then it’ll all be for nothing
&gt;You step through the threshold with eyes half shut in anticipation
&gt;When you’re completely inside, you see what you expected the most:
&gt;It’s empty
&gt;You don’t know what you were hoping for, but there isn’t even a single being in here beside you, anthro or otherwise
&gt;Still, there’s a pretty nice bed
&gt;If nothing else, maybe you can crash here for the night while you figure out what to do with yourself
&gt;As you flop on your back, your head back up in surprise
&gt;Closing the door is what you think must be another wolfess, but she’s so large and full of fluff she has to have some bear in her
&gt;Honestly, you don’t know what kind of animal to think of her as
&gt;Except maybe “comforting”
&gt;Silvery fur and deep blue eyes
&gt;Powerful limbs, but an alluring softness
&gt;All packaged in a simple dress and apron
&gt;You sit upright, only to have the anthro woman gently push you back down
&gt;”You seem surprised,” she muses with a soothing voice
&gt;Yeah, a little bit
&gt;You weren’t expecting anyone to notice you
&gt;You can’t think of a single moment in this bar where you felt like you belonged
&gt;Almost nobody made eye contact with you (except the hellhound and the bouncer) and they acted as though you weren’t even physically here
&gt;”Don’t feel bad,” she responds. “I’m sure they would enjoy your company, but they have eyes for only one human of their own already.”
&gt;So it was pointless to come here, then
&gt;…Unless…
&gt;You look into her prismatic eyes, and she gives you a friendly smile
&gt;”This is my inn. I give everyone a chance to be happy and relax, human and anthro alike. I can’t say I’m the one you’re looking for in your quest for companionship, but I CAN give you a moment of comfort before you go looking again.”
&gt;The innkeeper sets her apron aside and eases herself onto the bed with you
&gt;You’re pulled up against her, nestled into her large body
&gt;”When you’re ready to leave, you may. Until then, be at peace.”
&gt;She wraps one arm under you, and curls the other over you
&gt;You can immediately feel the warmth of her body
&gt;The warmth of her plush coat
&gt;The warmth of her caring sweetness
&gt;She completely envelops you in fur and tenderness
&gt;One large paw holds you tight while the other rubs slow circles on your chest
&gt;”You will be loved,” she assures you
&gt;Her voice reverberates through the contact between your bodies, loosening any tension and relaxing your very muscles
&gt;Her breathing is slow; her fluffy form presses up against you with even more softness as she inhales deeply
&gt;When she exhales it’s a gradual, gentle hum in your ear
&gt;”You will find your happiness.”
&gt;You can feel the heat of her breath flow over any part of you not already blanketed in her fur
&gt;Her mantra instills good feelings in you
&gt;And any time your mind dares stray toward cloudy thoughts, she squeezes the negativity out of you
&gt;You wonder how long she’ll let you stay here
&gt;You’re answered with another firm hug
&gt;”Don’t feel pressured to leave,” she whispers. “You’ll know when the time is right, but you’ll also know when you need to…just…rest…”
&gt;She hefts you off the mattress just enough so she can rock you in her arms
&gt;Repeating herself after every breath and every rock
&gt;”You will be loved.”
&gt;”You will find your happiness.”
&gt;Now you’re up on her stomach
&gt;Her neck is your pillow
&gt;Her arms are your blankets
&gt;You rise and fall in time with her breathing, like a gentle wave
&gt;And much like the rise and fall of the sun, she rolls over and places you down on the opposite side
&gt;She resumes her delicate words
&gt;”Loved.”
&gt;”Happiness.”
&gt;Brushing a paw against your face and leaning her head on top of yours
&gt;Your mind stays awake so you can enjoy the rest of the experience, but your body has already gone to sleep
&gt;”You will find someone who can take care of you like this,” she promises. “Keep your heart open. Someone out there wants to feel just as safe in it.”
&gt;It’s been ages since you’ve been able to hear any of the commotion downstairs, and now you can hardly even make out the words the innkeeper says to you
&gt;But even though the words are intelligible, the messages are clear
&gt;She doesn’t know you personally, but you get the feeling she knows what you’re going through
&gt;She relieves you from your momentary stressors, but she doesn’t quite coddle you from reality
&gt;Encouragements, praises, compliments
&gt;Everything she says to you rings true
&gt;But she’s not doing this to flatter you
&gt;She’s doing this to remind you what you should look for in yourself
&gt;”You are perfect just as you are…” you can hear her say as your eyelids grow heavy
&gt;Something in you knows that when you wake up, this place will be gone
&gt;But it’s because you’ll be ready to leave
&gt;Because it’s for the best
&gt;Because…
&gt;You are perfect
&gt;”Don’t ever change.”</textarea>
