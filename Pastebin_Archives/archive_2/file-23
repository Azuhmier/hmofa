most wear casual clothes stretched over their bestial frames and leather scraps roped together for some kind of armor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The males would probably be a good head taller than you if they weren’t so hunched over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wonder if it’s because of their skeletal shape or because they are always submissive to the females</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh yeah, most of the stories about the gnolls involve the noticeably larger and more aggressive hyena women, who tend to be the dominate ones</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That, and rumors about what they’re packing “down below”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You see a few females gather around the gate as you approach, pushing the smaller males out of the way</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They’re almost all carrying some type of firearm, from shotguns to rifles, all battered and in states of disrepair</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Most have their manes done up in very punkish ways, some dyed in pastel colors and knotted with bones</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then the biggest gnoll of the pack steps forward as the sea of hyenas parts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She has a scraggly mane, a toothy snarly, and her muzzle is painted chalk white in rib-like stripes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She wears a flak jacket that barely contains a hefty pair of breasts and none of the muscles on her arms, and a pair of dusty slacks with numerous holes for her fur to poke out of</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her hair is spiked up a bit, but droops to the sides from its length, running along her neck and even hanging down her back like a horse tail</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her right arm is cleanly shaven to show off a heavily inked tattoo</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can’t make out what it’s supposed to be, but part of it looks like tally marks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A lot of tally marks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh, and resting on her shoulders behind her neck is a massive gun as black as her spots and practically as long as she is tall</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Talk about a BFG…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Big Fucking Gnoll</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s intimidating to say the least, but part of you can’t help by be impressed by her force of presence</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Should we let him in, Ngarlu?” one of the males asks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The large hyena woman pivots and smacks him with the butt of her gun</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Well, dipstick, we’re not gonna to get him when he’s out there, are we?” she says, her voice both raspy and vampish</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The gate slides open and you gingerly present the envelope</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She snatches it from you and rips it open with her teeth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The other gnolls wait eagerly around her as her narrowed eyes scan the inside letter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For a moment you wonder if it’s all just a show; are gnolls even literate?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But she seems perfectly capable of reading, as her mouth pulls back into a devilish grin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She lets out an infectious laugh, spurring the others to join in even without context</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But they know to stop when she does, and it’s totally quiet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”’Anon’, is it?” she says in an unsettlingly sweet voice</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod slowly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Sorry, love, but someone back home must really hate you. Well enough to make you their patsy, anyway,” she says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Patsy?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You see, we make a deal with your little town.” She plants her gun into the dirt and leans into it, waving the paper between her claws</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s right in your face with those pearly teeth, those flared nostrils…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;…those beautiful sienna eyes…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Ev’ry few weeks we get a nice crate of guns and goods from them. They give us the boomsticks, and we ‘promise’ not to fire their way.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few of the females chuckle, with their guns in some pretty raunchy positions</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”We even leave some game out there for them to hunt.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She crumples up the letter and tosses it over her shoulder</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One of the males grabs it in his mouth and swallows it instantly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”But it looks like they’re tryin’ to bribe us in another way, by sendin’ some poor whelp for collateral.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The rest of the pack creeps in, leaving you no place to escape</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One of them snatches your backpack and flings it into a cluster of smaller gnolls, who descend on it like it’s prey</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You ain’t worth the same as those guns, and I think we might have to pay them a little a visit soon…” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In one quick motion she swings the gun around you, pulling it against you </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you against her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”But in the meantime, love, you can be damn sure we’re gonna’ get as much use out of you as we can.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In the center of the compound is what seems like a workshop</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Inside is full of random pieces of technology and equipment on tables all scavenged by the gnolls</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Busted radios, dismantled guns, boxes of scrap metal</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And a few blinded windows too high to climb out of</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ngarlu pushes you inside, making you trip against the debris on the floor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You humans have some nice shit, but everythin’ we bring back ain’t workin’ so well. Fix it for us.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It definitely wasn’t a request</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are left alone with the piles of junk as she locks you in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You aren’t the engineer they probably think you are, but as you begin tinkering with the stuff you see that it’s actually not too hard to fix</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Most of it is just a frayed wire here or some loose screws there</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even the weapons seem easy enough to put back together</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They didn’t leave you ammo, though</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wonder if all this stuff was just mishandled when they brought it back with them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It feels good to get so many things working again, but you remember after a while that you’re still technically a prisoner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe you could take the box of scraps and make a battle suit, or…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The door swings open and one of the grunts drops a plate of mystery meat and browning fruit on the floor for you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It definitely looks like the gnoll took a taste or two on the way over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You eat your meal and get back to the task</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a few more hours, Ngarlu returns to inspect your completed work</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Not too bad, runt. I guess you deserve a break after all y-“</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stops, sniffing the air for a moment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you stare at each other for what feels like forever</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She flicks the end of her snout with her thumb</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Get over here, and I’ll show you where you’re gonna to be sleepin’”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You follow her to the barracks, neither of you saying a word until you arrive at what seems like a storage closet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Inside are a small cot and a table</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”This will be your home, now,” she sneers. “Make sure you keep the door closed. Gotta make sure the men don’t break you too soon.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re left alone in complete darkness</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The next two days follow the same pattern: wake up, get sent to the workshop, take a short break for food, return to your tiny room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Each step has someone either guarding you or guiding you around</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If it’s not Ngarlu herself, it’s usually another female leading a few grunts as well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They don’t miss a chance to shove you into walls or rip holes in your shirt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;On the fourth day in the workshop, you realize just how much you reek from sweat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ngarlu seems to notice as well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Alright, we don’t need you stinkin’ up the place. You’re gonna to have to get cleaned up.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She takes you to part of the compound with indoor, tiled showers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looks like the place doesn’t get much cleaning, since the drains are clogged with clumps of fur</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Alright, clothes off,” she says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She doesn’t have her gun with her this time, but you’re not fighting her hand-to-hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s embarrassing to strip in front of her, for sure</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But her being non-human almost takes the edge off a bit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still, you remove your underwear much slower than the rest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you’re fully exposed, Ngarlu gives you a catcall</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”No sense coverin’ up, runt. You got nothin’ I won’t see eventually anyway.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You turn the water on and step under the streams</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You keep facing the wall as you lather up, using a lonely bar of soap that’s practically growing mushrooms on it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually you have to twist and bend to get your whole body clean</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You steal a glance at Ngarlu, who looks almost mesmerized by your junk</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You turn away and scrub your hair, and that’s when you hear the pattering and clicking of her paws on the tiles approaching you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Get in there deep, runt,” she says as she digs her nails into your scalp. “You’re not bringin’ any bugs into my barracks.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You let her do her thing, not wanting to piss her off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Admittedly, the “massage” feels amazing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That is, until she grabs a clump of your hair and pulls you back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stumble right into her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And then you’re pushed away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Watch it!” she barks. “You’re gettin’ my clothes wet!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The whole thing befuddles you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;SHE pulled your into HER, didn’t she?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Great, now it’s all damp,” she says in what sounds like a practiced tone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you can say anything, she grabs the bottom of her flak jacket and pulls it over her head with one fluid jerk, taking her bra off along with it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her weighty breasts bounce free, large in size and lightly furred compared to the rest of her body, each one capped with a dark nipple visible even among the hair</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Completely unabashed in her partial nudity</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She doesn’t give you any time to ogle, and spins you back around to face the wall</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your hair is once again combed with her claws, but only from one hand (paw?) this time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The other is wrapped around your waist, dancing a little too close to your groin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pulls you into her body, clearly not caring about the wetness anymore</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can feel her breasts against your spine, followed by those soft nipples</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s no mistaking how erect they are as they brush against your shoulder blades</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re afraid to move back against her, but she’s gripped too tightly on you to escape</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you relax and learn to enjoy it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A little too much</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s working through your pits, and then moves to the hair in the south</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She skims against your growing arousal with her hand and recoils</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Alright, shower’s over.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shuts off the water and tosses you a ragged towel</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You go to retrieve your clothes, but she intercepts them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”These are ruined,” she says, like you’re a dog who peed on them. “Wait here.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are left to dry off as she leaves with your things</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You think you can hear sniffing right after she leaves your sight</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In a few minutes she returns with a new outfit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ill-fitting shirt, ripped pants, and some kind of animal-hide vest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once again you’re led back to the barracks, but you walk right by your closet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stops you at a different room, this one a little bigger than the other and not so dangerously close to the ones occupied by the grunts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”G’night,” she says after shutting you in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The next week follows a stranger pattern</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You toil in the workshop</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re “forced” to take a shower with Ngarlu, who now wears shorts but still no top</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And then you’re led to a completely different bedroom in the evening</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;First it’s a little farther into the barracks, but soon you’re on higher floors</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now you’re on the “alphas’” floor, with all the gnoll women who glare at you from their doors</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ngarlu even drops in to check on your progress in the workshop every hour or so, dropping off more junk for you to sift through</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t ask where she gets it, though</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What she doesn’t give you is a way to cool down as you work up a sweat each day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In fact, the shades on the workshop windows have been torn off completely, cooking you when the sun gets a direct shot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The sweat is profuse now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And the heat becomes unbearable</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And your temper gets shorter with every electronic you struggle to fix</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When Ngarlu checks up on you late in the day she picks up the bulky television you had been devoting much of your time to</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can vizualize the machine’s fate of being dropped to the ground, undoing a few days’ worth of effort instantly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Without thinking, you lose your cool</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shout at her to put the television down, your voice reverberating in the workshop</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And she complies</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not very gently, mind you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The screen cracks and the components jostle around inside as she slams it on the table</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At first you’re ready to hear a demon roar at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But when that doesn’t come, you almost think she might CRY from your outburst</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The expression on her muzzled face is deadpan for an eternity</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Finally, those thin black lips part carefully</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You…” she breathes, sending a chill up your back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ngarlu closes the distance, her outstretched arm clearing everything on the table</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re not going to dare yell at her for the damage on all that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her hot breath washes over you as she looms over your dripping body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You are PERFECT,” she says in exasperation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pardon?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In an instant you’re hoisted up and dropped onto the now-vacant table, flanked by her muscular arms</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Do you realize how long I’ve been waitin’ to hear a male raise their tone to me? To CHALLENGE me?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can only smile nervously</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She digs her snout into your clothes and then draws in deeply, puffing out her chest into your face as she proceeds to arch her back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The gnoll exhales slowly and looks down to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You flinch as her mouth opens, but it’s only her tongue you see</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A fairly large tongue, comparatively speaking</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She laps up your salty, dripping flesh ravenously</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The fear rekindles a bit for a moment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She wouldn’t EAT you, right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But when she stops there’s a sultry look to her eyes that you would never expect from such a bestial creature</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Humans have been this girl’s secret desire for years,” she says. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s a little funny how such a powerhouse of fur, muscle, and primal heritage could talk about herself like she had a teenage crush</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Your smooth skin, your scent, your way of workin’ those tools…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The subtlety with that one struck you like a rhino to the gut</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pulls her legs onto the table one at a time, now crouched over you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The integrity of the table becomes your biggest fear now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I want you to fight back a bit,” she warns you. “I don’t mean to hurt you, but as long as ONE of us is enjoying this I ain’t stoppin’.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her legs splay out on top of your own as she resumes coating you with her tongue</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your arms are pinned to the table, the flow of blood getting constricted</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At least it has other places to go to</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel the adrenaline coursing through you, and, heading her words, you push back against her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At first your retaliation is weak, but you soon let loose as if wrestling with a bratty sibling</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You know deep down you’d never overpower her, even if you put all your energy into it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She squeezes your legs together with her thighs, redoubling her puppy kisses on your face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now your erection is even trying to fend her off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But the biggest mistake the gnoll makes is letting Anon get a chance to catch his breath</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When she pauses her licking for some air you make the counterattack</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your tongue plunges into her muzzle, trying to grapple with her own</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her eyes light up for a second before closing dreamily</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She obviously likes you taking initiative, so you push your luck a bit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you wrench your arms free they dive into her jacket, ripping it open before you slip right in under her bra</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try your damnedest to hold those whole breasts as your palms glide over her nipples</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now she’s moaning into you, easing back on the strength she’s exerting on you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That is, until you try to flip her over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As if sensing your intentions, her vigor floods back and pins you down once more</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Love, you wouldn&#039;t make a lady lie on some filthy ol’ table, would you?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She slides down off the table and pulls you with her by the collar</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”If you’re tryin’ to get dirty, I have a much better place for us.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ngarlu leads you out the workshop and towards the barracks, with your neck in a teasing chokehold</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ascend higher than you’ve ever been so far in the barracks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Up to the top-most level</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”OUT, ALL OF YOU!” she roars</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Several gnolls loitering in the hall dash back down the stairs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few even run from their own rooms to vacate the floor entirely</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”They know when a girl’s gotta have her private time,” she says, beaming</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She leads you to the last room on the floor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The largest room in the barracks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;HER room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s covered from floor to ceiling in animal pelts, weaponry both prized and retired, wood masks, and even a few paintings of the savannah</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh, and your old clothes are peeking out of a dresser drawer, still stained with old sweat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Lived-in” comes to mind, but so does “cozy”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pulls you over to the bed, perhaps the comfiest you’ve ever seen before</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Now then, what was it you were tryin’ to do, again?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tackle her to the bed and resume being tangled up in her body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Clothes are torn off along the way without you even realizing it, and you can feel her plush fur brush against your naked skin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It feels even softer than the sheets</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You kiss some more, and then you’re nipping at her neck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her claws dig into your skin, but don’t break the surface</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If her tail could escape the smothering, it would probably be wagging furiously</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ngarlu is completely vulnerable when you crawl back to the end of the bed and pry those meaty thighs apart, exposing the femininity she guards so dearly day after day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, at least now you know those rumors about gnoll women were bullshit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still, her nether lips are far more pronounced and swollen than you’ve ever fantasized about human women</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So what technique works on a hyena?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You do what you can to pleasure her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Burring your nose into the crevice, lapping up her juices, digging into the folds with your fingers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her thighs lock around your head as you nibble on the flesh softly, but she no longer has the strength to deter you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She begins to whimper, her arms bending back and gripping the backboard tight enough that you’re positive you hear it cracking</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t have much time down below before she pulls you closer by the armpits with her feet, curling you into a full embrace</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”D-don’t go and do somethin’ I’m gonna to have to pay you back for later,” she huffs into your ear. “I’m not gonna do down first…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, you beat her to it anyway</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”…So that means we’re gonna have to do this together.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She props you up on her stomach, leaning forward and coaxing your growth to full length with a few licks and a couple of deep-muzzle sucks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s just enough to lubricate you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She definitely doesn’t want to waste much time on oral</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh well, maybe later</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She doesn’t take lead, as you anticipated, but lets you slide back to her ready entrance</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And so you drive into her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The heat is incredible, and she holds you up with her arms as you begin to buck forward</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s keeping you away at full wingspan, so when you try to fondle her breasts you end up tugging at the teats whenever you draw back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her hands then wrap around you and aid your thrusts, pulling you forward with each grunt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s not easy to be the top when such a massive creature is essentially using you like a life-size sex toy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The rhythm picks up gradually, and you wonder if the walls are going to be enough to stifle your noises</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You kind of hope they aren’t</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The pace picks up, and you’re matting her fur down with your sweat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She bellows and whines, building up the imminent finale</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You climax in perfect unison, though Ngarlu’s cries drown yours out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She begins to laugh triumphantly as you flop onto her chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s still just as infectious, and you join in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you lie together for some time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You gaze at the framed savannahs, and you can faintly hear the wildlife within them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And sniffing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Anon,” she sighs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re soon switching positions, with her mounted over you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The setting sun through the window is a halo around her wild beauty</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”When we’re done, you’re gonna need a shower”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Months pass, and the compound is now your home</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The gnolls’ “visit” to the human town never comes, as you’re eventually seen as a fair exchange</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You continue to be their tinkerer, fixing their equipment and even making new commodities like the humans have</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The transition into the pack has a rocky beginning</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The gnolls who once sized you up to be their next plaything gaze on in confusion to see their leader followed by a human so closely</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The women were even a little envious, but Ngarlu made sure everyone knew who you belonged to</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was a turbulent time for a while, as everyone seemed to want you to go back to your hometown</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The males because they felt you’d steal away all their women</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And the females because they hoped you could bring back some human men for them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually, though, a change happened with the male gnolls</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They began being more assertive, challenging the dominance of the females</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Of course, they never got too far </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The ladies were always on top, but they loved that the male gnolls were growing more of a backbone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hunched ones, but backbones nonetheless</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Which means you had Ngarlu all to yourself with no fear of becoming the pack’s chew toy or breeding slave</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And speaking of breeding…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s a cooler, breezy morning out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The kind that keeps you in bed for a little longer than usual, nestled up against the back of your furred lover</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stroke her hair as she stirs awake</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Morning, Anon,” she says, turning toward you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her gorgeous face comes first, still feral in shape and decoration but breathtaking in passion</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then her breasts flop over to rest between you two, stacked heavy and engorged with those perky thick black nipples looking out at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Finally, the gravid swell of her belly arcs over, cradled by her arm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s absolutely immense, even in spite of her overall size</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even the gnoll midwives are shocked</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s apparently got a little more growing to do in the coming weeks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You rub your hands over her stomach, the fur stretched taught to where you can see a little of the skin underneath</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nobody has the nerve to question her choice in mates, with her holding you close to her swollen middle everywhere you go</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When Ngarlu’s waddling around the compound, she’s just as commanding and intimidating as ever to the lesser gnolls</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Only now when she bullies them, it’s usually by threatening to crush them with her bulk</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or “shove them up inside to see the cubs”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But when she’s alone with you, she’s an entirely different hyena</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She strokes her pregnant belly without pause, sometimes leaning over it and laughing in unrepressed rapture</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;More than once she laughs to the point of tears dripping onto her stomach</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She confides in you her happiness; never did she think she’d be gifted with someone like you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That she’d end up taking the best of the worst among the submissive males</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;On one hand, she would have been much more impressed by the budding confidence of the gnoll men</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But on the other hand, it’s all thanks to you that they’ve become what they are in the first place</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s all thanks to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Anon”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You break away from your thoughts, now lost in the gnoll’s unbroken love for you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You’re gonna have to get back to workin’ on those cribs today,” she says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You place a palm on her belly, trying to feel for movement</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ngarlu only laughs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Not quite,” she says. “I just want you to get dirty so we can hit the showers.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you rub your thumb over her naval with one hand you bring the other to her muzzle</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your lips connect for a good morning morning kiss</div></li></ol>        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">BFG [Gnoll; Light Domination and Submission, Lewd]: When Anon is held hostage by a pack of gnolls, he finds that the leader may have her eyes on him for more than one reason.

&gt;You are anon, loveless loner and interim courier
&gt;Recently stationed somewhere in Afrikenyubabwe for a sabbatical or something
&gt;You were sent from a small town with a sealed envelope and a backpack across the savannah plains to a compound
&gt;A compound now controlled by gnolls
&gt;It used to be some kind of outpost or reservation back in the day, the hyena people keeping their distance at first
&gt;They’re scavengers by nature, taking clothes, food, and even weapons from people who wander too far onto the plains
&gt;Mostly dumb tourists
&gt;Then the marauding gnolls learned to use guns, and all the humans in the compound were kicked out
&gt;You’ve heard many rumors about the gnolls, but they keep to themselves most of the time and you’ve never seen one up close before
&gt;Today’s the day you’ll get the chance, after you were sent out for “negotiations” with the gnolls
&gt;Strangely enough, you weren’t given much briefing on what the negotiations are supposed to be or what to do when you get there
&gt;And you were told to take as many of your belongings as you can carry
&gt;”It might take a while,” is all they said before shooing you out of town
&gt;You weren’t even given a ride over
&gt;Guess it’s so you don’t spook them or something
&gt;So now you’re walking half the day until you see the fenced in compound, right after taking the last swig of your canteen
&gt;The first gnolls you spot are males perched up in the watchtowers flanking the front gate
&gt;They are stout, burly creatures with some pretty mismatched clothing; most wear casual clothes stretched over their bestial frames and leather scraps roped together for some kind of armor
&gt;The males would probably be a good head taller than you if they weren’t so hunched over
&gt;You wonder if it’s because of their skeletal shape or because they are always submissive to the females
&gt;Oh yeah, most of the stories about the gnolls involve the noticeably larger and more aggressive hyena women, who tend to be the dominate ones
&gt;That, and rumors about what they’re packing “down below”
&gt;You see a few females gather around the gate as you approach, pushing the smaller males out of the way
&gt;They’re almost all carrying some type of firearm, from shotguns to rifles, all battered and in states of disrepair
&gt;Most have their manes done up in very punkish ways, some dyed in pastel colors and knotted with bones
&gt;Then the biggest gnoll of the pack steps forward as the sea of hyenas parts
&gt;She has a scraggly mane, a toothy snarly, and her muzzle is painted chalk white in rib-like stripes
&gt;She wears a flak jacket that barely contains a hefty pair of breasts and none of the muscles on her arms, and a pair of dusty slacks with numerous holes for her fur to poke out of
&gt;Her hair is spiked up a bit, but droops to the sides from its length, running along her neck and even hanging down her back like a horse tail
&gt;Her right arm is cleanly shaven to show off a heavily inked tattoo
&gt;You can’t make out what it’s supposed to be, but part of it looks like tally marks
&gt;A lot of tally marks
&gt;Oh, and resting on her shoulders behind her neck is a massive gun as black as her spots and practically as long as she is tall
&gt;Talk about a BFG…
&gt;Big Fucking Gnoll
&gt;She’s intimidating to say the least, but part of you can’t help by be impressed by her force of presence
&gt;”Should we let him in, Ngarlu?” one of the males asks
&gt;The large hyena woman pivots and smacks him with the butt of her gun
&gt;”Well, dipstick, we’re not gonna to get him when he’s out there, are we?” she says, her voice both raspy and vampish
&gt;The gate slides open and you gingerly present the envelope
&gt;She snatches it from you and rips it open with her teeth
&gt;The other gnolls wait eagerly around her as her narrowed eyes scan the inside letter
&gt;For a moment you wonder if it’s all just a show; are gnolls even literate?
&gt;But she seems perfectly capable of reading, as her mouth pulls back into a devilish grin
&gt;She lets out an infectious laugh, spurring the others to join in even without context
&gt;But they know to stop when she does, and it’s totally quiet
&gt;”’Anon’, is it?” she says in an unsettlingly sweet voice
&gt;You nod slowly
&gt;”Sorry, love, but someone back home must really hate you. Well enough to make you their patsy, anyway,” she says
&gt;Patsy?
&gt;”You see, we make a deal with your little town.” She plants her gun into the dirt and leans into it, waving the paper between her claws
&gt;She’s right in your face with those pearly teeth, those flared nostrils…
&gt;…those beautiful sienna eyes…
&gt;”Ev’ry few weeks we get a nice crate of guns and goods from them. They give us the boomsticks, and we ‘promise’ not to fire their way.”
&gt;A few of the females chuckle, with their guns in some pretty raunchy positions
&gt;”We even leave some game out there for them to hunt.”
&gt;She crumples up the letter and tosses it over her shoulder
&gt;One of the males grabs it in his mouth and swallows it instantly
&gt;”But it looks like they’re tryin’ to bribe us in another way, by sendin’ some poor whelp for collateral.”
&gt;The rest of the pack creeps in, leaving you no place to escape
&gt;One of them snatches your backpack and flings it into a cluster of smaller gnolls, who descend on it like it’s prey
&gt;”You ain’t worth the same as those guns, and I think we might have to pay them a little a visit soon…” 
&gt;In one quick motion she swings the gun around you, pulling it against you 
&gt;And you against her
&gt;”But in the meantime, love, you can be damn sure we’re gonna’ get as much use out of you as we can.”

&gt;In the center of the compound is what seems like a workshop
&gt;Inside is full of random pieces of technology and equipment on tables all scavenged by the gnolls
&gt;Busted radios, dismantled guns, boxes of scrap metal
&gt;And a few blinded windows too high to climb out of
&gt;Ngarlu pushes you inside, making you trip against the debris on the floor
&gt;”You humans have some nice shit, but everythin’ we bring back ain’t workin’ so well. Fix it for us.”
&gt;It definitely wasn’t a request
&gt;You are left alone with the piles of junk as she locks you in
&gt;You aren’t the engineer they probably think you are, but as you begin tinkering with the stuff you see that it’s actually not too hard to fix
&gt;Most of it is just a frayed wire here or some loose screws there
&gt;Even the weapons seem easy enough to put back together
&gt;They didn’t leave you ammo, though
&gt;You wonder if all this stuff was just mishandled when they brought it back with them
&gt;It feels good to get so many things working again, but you remember after a while that you’re still technically a prisoner
&gt;Maybe you could take the box of scraps and make a battle suit, or…
&gt;The door swings open and one of the grunts drops a plate of mystery meat and browning fruit on the floor for you
&gt;It definitely looks like the gnoll took a taste or two on the way over
&gt;You eat your meal and get back to the task
&gt;After a few more hours, Ngarlu returns to inspect your completed work
&gt;”Not too bad, runt. I guess you deserve a break after all y-“
&gt;She stops, sniffing the air for a moment
&gt;The two of you stare at each other for what feels like forever
&gt;She flicks the end of her snout with her thumb
&gt;”Get over here, and I’ll show you where you’re gonna to be sleepin’”
&gt;You follow her to the barracks, neither of you saying a word until you arrive at what seems like a storage closet
&gt;Inside are a small cot and a table
&gt;”This will be your home, now,” she sneers. “Make sure you keep the door closed. Gotta make sure the men don’t break you too soon.”
&gt;You’re left alone in complete darkness

&gt;The next two days follow the same pattern: wake up, get sent to the workshop, take a short break for food, return to your tiny room
&gt;Each step has someone either guarding you or guiding you around
&gt;If it’s not Ngarlu herself, it’s usually another female leading a few grunts as well
&gt;They don’t miss a chance to shove you into walls or rip holes in your shirt
&gt;On the fourth day in the workshop, you realize just how much you reek from sweat
&gt;Ngarlu seems to notice as well
&gt;”Alright, we don’t need you stinkin’ up the place. You’re gonna to have to get cleaned up.”
&gt;She takes you to part of the compound with indoor, tiled showers
&gt;Looks like the place doesn’t get much cleaning, since the drains are clogged with clumps of fur
&gt;”Alright, clothes off,” she says
&gt;She doesn’t have her gun with her this time, but you’re not fighting her hand-to-hand
&gt;It’s embarrassing to strip in front of her, for sure
&gt;But her being non-human almost takes the edge off a bit
&gt;Still, you remove your underwear much slower than the rest
&gt;When you’re fully exposed, Ngarlu gives you a catcall
&gt;”No sense coverin’ up, runt. You got nothin’ I won’t see eventually anyway.”
&gt;You turn the water on and step under the streams
&gt;You keep facing the wall as you lather up, using a lonely bar of soap that’s practically growing mushrooms on it
&gt;Eventually you have to twist and bend to get your whole body clean
&gt;You steal a glance at Ngarlu, who looks almost mesmerized by your junk
&gt;You turn away and scrub your hair, and that’s when you hear the pattering and clicking of her paws on the tiles approaching you
&gt;”Get in there deep, runt,” she says as she digs her nails into your scalp. “You’re not bringin’ any bugs into my barracks.”
&gt;You let her do her thing, not wanting to piss her off
&gt;Admittedly, the “massage” feels amazing
&gt;That is, until she grabs a clump of your hair and pulls you back
&gt;You stumble right into her
&gt;And then you’re pushed away
&gt;”Watch it!” she barks. “You’re gettin’ my clothes wet!”
&gt;The whole thing befuddles you
&gt;SHE pulled your into HER, didn’t she?
&gt;”Great, now it’s all damp,” she says in what sounds like a practiced tone
&gt;Before you can say anything, she grabs the bottom of her flak jacket and pulls it over her head with one fluid jerk, taking her bra off along with it
&gt;Her weighty breasts bounce free, large in size and lightly furred compared to the rest of her body, each one capped with a dark nipple visible even among the hair
&gt;Completely unabashed in her partial nudity
&gt;She doesn’t give you any time to ogle, and spins you back around to face the wall
&gt;Your hair is once again combed with her claws, but only from one hand (paw?) this time
&gt;The other is wrapped around your waist, dancing a little too close to your groin
&gt;She pulls you into her body, clearly not caring about the wetness anymore
&gt;You can feel her breasts against your spine, followed by those soft nipples
&gt;There’s no mistaking how erect they are as they brush against your shoulder blades
&gt;You’re afraid to move back against her, but she’s gripped too tightly on you to escape
&gt;But you relax and learn to enjoy it
&gt;A little too much
&gt;She’s working through your pits, and then moves to the hair in the south
&gt;She skims against your growing arousal with her hand and recoils
&gt;”Alright, shower’s over.”
&gt;She shuts off the water and tosses you a ragged towel
&gt;You go to retrieve your clothes, but she intercepts them
&gt;”These are ruined,” she says, like you’re a dog who peed on them. “Wait here.”
&gt;You are left to dry off as she leaves with your things
&gt;You think you can hear sniffing right after she leaves your sight
&gt;In a few minutes she returns with a new outfit
&gt;Ill-fitting shirt, ripped pants, and some kind of animal-hide vest
&gt;Once again you’re led back to the barracks, but you walk right by your closet
&gt;She stops you at a different room, this one a little bigger than the other and not so dangerously close to the ones occupied by the grunts
&gt;”G’night,” she says after shutting you in

&gt;The next week follows a stranger pattern
&gt;You toil in the workshop
&gt;You’re “forced” to take a shower with Ngarlu, who now wears shorts but still no top
&gt;And then you’re led to a completely different bedroom in the evening
&gt;First it’s a little farther into the barracks, but soon you’re on higher floors
&gt;Now you’re on the “alphas’” floor, with all the gnoll women who glare at you from their doors
&gt;Ngarlu even drops in to check on your progress in the workshop every hour or so, dropping off more junk for you to sift through
&gt;You don’t ask where she gets it, though
&gt;What she doesn’t give you is a way to cool down as you work up a sweat each day
&gt;In fact, the shades on the workshop windows have been torn off completely, cooking you when the sun gets a direct shot
&gt;The sweat is profuse now
&gt;And the heat becomes unbearable
&gt;And your temper gets shorter with every electronic you struggle to fix
&gt;When Ngarlu checks up on you late in the day she picks up the bulky television you had been devoting much of your time to
&gt;You can vizualize the machine’s fate of being dropped to the ground, undoing a few days’ worth of effort instantly
&gt;Without thinking, you lose your cool
&gt;You shout at her to put the television down, your voice reverberating in the workshop
&gt;And she complies
&gt;Not very gently, mind you
&gt;The screen cracks and the components jostle around inside as she slams it on the table
&gt;At first you’re ready to hear a demon roar at you
&gt;But when that doesn’t come, you almost think she might CRY from your outburst
&gt;The expression on her muzzled face is deadpan for an eternity
&gt;Finally, those thin black lips part carefully
&gt;”You…” she breathes, sending a chill up your back
&gt;Ngarlu closes the distance, her outstretched arm clearing everything on the table
&gt;You’re not going to dare yell at her for the damage on all that
&gt;Her hot breath washes over you as she looms over your dripping body
&gt;”You are PERFECT,” she says in exasperation
&gt;Pardon?
&gt;In an instant you’re hoisted up and dropped onto the now-vacant table, flanked by her muscular arms
&gt;”Do you realize how long I’ve been waitin’ to hear a male raise their tone to me? To CHALLENGE me?”
&gt;You can only smile nervously
&gt;She digs her snout into your clothes and then draws in deeply, puffing out her chest into your face as she proceeds to arch her back
&gt;The gnoll exhales slowly and looks down to you
&gt;You flinch as her mouth opens, but it’s only her tongue you see
&gt;A fairly large tongue, comparatively speaking
&gt;She laps up your salty, dripping flesh ravenously
&gt;The fear rekindles a bit for a moment
&gt;She wouldn’t EAT you, right?
&gt;Right?
&gt;But when she stops there’s a sultry look to her eyes that you would never expect from such a bestial creature
&gt;”Humans have been this girl’s secret desire for years,” she says. 
&gt;It’s a little funny how such a powerhouse of fur, muscle, and primal heritage could talk about herself like she had a teenage crush
&gt;”Your smooth skin, your scent, your way of workin’ those tools…”
&gt;The subtlety with that one struck you like a rhino to the gut
&gt;She pulls her legs onto the table one at a time, now crouched over you
&gt;The integrity of the table becomes your biggest fear now
&gt;”I want you to fight back a bit,” she warns you. “I don’t mean to hurt you, but as long as ONE of us is enjoying this I ain’t stoppin’.”
&gt;Her legs splay out on top of your own as she resumes coating you with her tongue
&gt;Your arms are pinned to the table, the flow of blood getting constricted
&gt;At least it has other places to go to
&gt;You feel the adrenaline coursing through you, and, heading her words, you push back against her
&gt;At first your retaliation is weak, but you soon let loose as if wrestling with a bratty sibling
&gt;You know deep down you’d never overpower her, even if you put all your energy into it
&gt;She squeezes your legs together with her thighs, redoubling her puppy kisses on your face
&gt;Now your erection is even trying to fend her off
&gt;But the biggest mistake the gnoll makes is letting Anon get a chance to catch his breath
&gt;When she pauses her licking for some air you make the counterattack
&gt;Your tongue plunges into her muzzle, trying to grapple with her own
&gt;Her eyes light up for a second before closing dreamily
&gt;She obviously likes you taking initiative, so you push your luck a bit
&gt;When you wrench your arms free they dive into her jacket, ripping it open before you slip right in under her bra
&gt;You try your damnedest to hold those whole breasts as your palms glide over her nipples
&gt;Now she’s moaning into you, easing back on the strength she’s exerting on you
&gt;That is, until you try to flip her over
&gt;As if sensing your intentions, her vigor floods back and pins you down once more
&gt;”Love, you wouldn&#039;t make a lady lie on some filthy ol’ table, would you?”
&gt;She slides down off the table and pulls you with her by the collar
&gt;”If you’re tryin’ to get dirty, I have a much better place for us.”
&gt;Ngarlu leads you out the workshop and towards the barracks, with your neck in a teasing chokehold
&gt;You ascend higher than you’ve ever been so far in the barracks
&gt;Up to the top-most level
&gt;”OUT, ALL OF YOU!” she roars
&gt;Several gnolls loitering in the hall dash back down the stairs
&gt;A few even run from their own rooms to vacate the floor entirely
&gt;”They know when a girl’s gotta have her private time,” she says, beaming
&gt;She leads you to the last room on the floor
&gt;The largest room in the barracks
&gt;HER room
&gt;It’s covered from floor to ceiling in animal pelts, weaponry both prized and retired, wood masks, and even a few paintings of the savannah
&gt;Oh, and your old clothes are peeking out of a dresser drawer, still stained with old sweat
&gt;”Lived-in” comes to mind, but so does “cozy”
&gt;She pulls you over to the bed, perhaps the comfiest you’ve ever seen before
&gt;”Now then, what was it you were tryin’ to do, again?”
&gt;You tackle her to the bed and resume being tangled up in her body
&gt;Clothes are torn off along the way without you even realizing it, and you can feel her plush fur brush against your naked skin
&gt;It feels even softer than the sheets
&gt;You kiss some more, and then you’re nipping at her neck
&gt;Her claws dig into your skin, but don’t break the surface
&gt;If her tail could escape the smothering, it would probably be wagging furiously
&gt;Ngarlu is completely vulnerable when you crawl back to the end of the bed and pry those meaty thighs apart, exposing the femininity she guards so dearly day after day
&gt;Well, at least now you know those rumors about gnoll women were bullshit
&gt;Still, her nether lips are far more pronounced and swollen than you’ve ever fantasized about human women
&gt;So what technique works on a hyena?
&gt;You do what you can to pleasure her
&gt;Burring your nose into the crevice, lapping up her juices, digging into the folds with your fingers
&gt;Her thighs lock around your head as you nibble on the flesh softly, but she no longer has the strength to deter you
&gt;She begins to whimper, her arms bending back and gripping the backboard tight enough that you’re positive you hear it cracking
&gt;You don’t have much time down below before she pulls you closer by the armpits with her feet, curling you into a full embrace
&gt;”D-don’t go and do somethin’ I’m gonna to have to pay you back for later,” she huffs into your ear. “I’m not gonna do down first…”
&gt;Well, you beat her to it anyway
&gt;”…So that means we’re gonna have to do this together.”
&gt;She props you up on her stomach, leaning forward and coaxing your growth to full length with a few licks and a couple of deep-muzzle sucks
&gt;It’s just enough to lubricate you
&gt;She definitely doesn’t want to waste much time on oral
&gt;Oh well, maybe later
&gt;She doesn’t take lead, as you anticipated, but lets you slide back to her ready entrance
&gt;And so you drive into her
&gt;The heat is incredible, and she holds you up with her arms as you begin to buck forward
&gt;She’s keeping you away at full wingspan, so when you try to fondle her breasts you end up tugging at the teats whenever you draw back
&gt;Her hands then wrap around you and aid your thrusts, pulling you forward with each grunt
&gt;It’s not easy to be the top when such a massive creature is essentially using you like a life-size sex toy
&gt;The rhythm picks up gradually, and you wonder if the walls are going to be enough to stifle your noises
&gt;You kind of hope they aren’t
&gt;The pace picks up, and you’re matting her fur down with your sweat
&gt;She bellows and whines, building up the imminent finale
&gt;You climax in perfect unison, though Ngarlu’s cries drown yours out
&gt;She begins to laugh triumphantly as you flop onto her chest
&gt;It’s still just as infectious, and you join in
&gt;The two of you lie together for some time
&gt;You gaze at the framed savannahs, and you can faintly hear the wildlife within them
&gt;And sniffing
&gt;”Anon,” she sighs
&gt;You’re soon switching positions, with her mounted over you
&gt;The setting sun through the window is a halo around her wild beauty
&gt;”When we’re done, you’re gonna need a shower”

&gt;Months pass, and the compound is now your home
&gt;The gnolls’ “visit” to the human town never comes, as you’re eventually seen as a fair exchange
&gt;You continue to be their tinkerer, fixing their equipment and even making new commodities like the humans have
&gt;The transition into the pack has a rocky beginning
&gt;The gnolls who once sized you up to be their next plaything gaze on in confusion to see their leader followed by a human so closely
&gt;The women were even a little envious, but Ngarlu made sure everyone knew who you belonged to
&gt;It was a turbulent time for a while, as everyone seemed to want you to go back to your hometown
&gt;The males because they felt you’d steal away all their women
&gt;And the females because they hoped you could bring back some human men for them
&gt;Eventually, though, a change happened with the male gnolls
&gt;They began being more assertive, challenging the dominance of the females
&gt;Of course, they never got too far 
&gt;The ladies were always on top, but they loved that the male gnolls were growing more of a backbone
&gt;Hunched ones, but backbones nonetheless
&gt;Which means you had Ngarlu all to yourself with no fear of becoming the pack’s chew toy or breeding slave
&gt;And speaking of breeding…
&gt;It’s a cooler, breezy morning out
&gt;The kind that keeps you in bed for a little longer than usual, nestled up against the back of your furred lover
&gt;You stroke her hair as she stirs awake
&gt;”Morning, Anon,” she says, turning toward you
&gt;Her gorgeous face comes first, still feral in shape and decoration but breathtaking in passion
&gt;Then her breasts flop over to rest between you two, stacked heavy and engorged with those perky thick black nipples looking out at you
&gt;Finally, the gravid swell of her belly arcs over, cradled by her arm
&gt;It’s absolutely immense, even in spite of her overall size
&gt;Even the gnoll midwives are shocked
&gt;She’s apparently got a little more growing to do in the coming weeks
&gt;You rub your hands over her stomach, the fur stretched taught to where you can see a little of the skin underneath
&gt;Nobody has the nerve to question her choice in mates, with her holding you close to her swollen middle everywhere you go
&gt;When Ngarlu’s waddling around the compound, she’s just as commanding and intimidating as ever to the lesser gnolls
&gt;Only now when she bullies them, it’s usually by threatening to crush them with her bulk
&gt;Or “shove them up inside to see the cubs”
&gt;But when she’s alone with you, she’s an entirely different hyena
&gt;She strokes her pregnant belly without pause, sometimes leaning over it and laughing in unrepressed rapture
&gt;More than once she laughs to the point of tears dripping onto her stomach
&gt;She confides in you her happiness; never did she think she’d be gifted with someone like you
&gt;That she’d end up taking the best of the worst among the submissive males
&gt;On one hand, she would have been much more impressed by the budding confidence of the gnoll men
&gt;But on the other hand, it’s all thanks to you that they’ve become what they are in the first place
&gt;It’s all thanks to you
&gt;”Anon”
&gt;You break away from your thoughts, now lost in the gnoll’s unbroken love for you
&gt;”You’re gonna have to get back to workin’ on those cribs today,” she says
&gt;You place a palm on her belly, trying to feel for movement
&gt;Ngarlu only laughs
&gt;”Not quite,” she says. “I just want you to get dirty so we can hit the showers.”
&gt;As you rub your thumb over her naval with one hand you bring the other to her muzzle
&gt;Your lips connect for a good morning morning kiss</textarea>
