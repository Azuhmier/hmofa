        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Be Anon
&gt;Walking down the cool October suburbs at night.
&gt;Going to some house party this raccoon was hosting
&gt;You can see the house from across the street, it&#039;s pretty much the only house on the block with the lights on.
&gt;You check your watch, it&#039;s nearly three in the morning.
&gt;Cross the street and reach the steps, you go ahead and try the front knob and surprisingly it&#039;s unlocked. Nice.
&gt;You enter and the sound of some kind of powerhouse music floods your ears.
&gt;It&#039;s not your favorite but it&#039;s something.
&gt;Nobody really seemed to notice you enter over the blaring speakers. But that doesn&#039;t seem to matter judging how nearly everyone is blackout drunk already at this point.
&gt;You think you see the raccoon lying down near the couch over in the living room.
&gt;Probably stuck on some Spotify playlist.
&gt;Wandering around for a couple of minutes you see that a few anthros are over in the kitchen and chatting.
&gt;Casually you approach and quickly locate the countertop that&#039;s just covered in hard alcohol
&gt;You mix some Dr.Pepper and vodka to start out with and decide to chat up the anthros in the kitchen.
&gt;People called you weird for doing that but it tasted fucking good.
&gt;You spot yourself a nice tiger babe on the fringes of the small group.
&gt;Casually you approach and find that you can&#039;t get a word in edgewise for shit.
&gt;You can barely follow the conversation too. It&#039;s a mix of rapidly changing topics and a drunken slur.
&gt;You ditch that prospect and find yourself the living room, where the speakers had been set up.
&gt;Surveying the crowd you take a good swig of your &quot;abomination&quot;.
&gt;You&#039;re almost out already. That was fast.
&gt;Before heading back into the kitchen to get another full cup of your special blend. You take note of a tall dark haired wolf that was stumbling around, plopping onto a couch to have a breather.
&gt;You snag your drink and head over to the couch, a pretty heavy buzz is already starting to kick in.
&gt;&quot;You having a fun time?&quot; You ask her, seeking a seat on the couch that she is hogging.
&gt;&quot;Uh, yeah. I&#039;m having a pretty good time I&#039;d say.&quot; She answers. 
&gt;At this point she has shifted herself to better face you, making room for you to sit as well. 
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s good, so ah. Cold night outside.&quot; You say, doing what little you can to make small talk.
&gt;&quot;I hadn&#039;t really noticed. It&#039;s actually kind of hot right now if you ask me.&quot; She responds, followed by a &quot;I guess you&#039;d notice since you aren&#039;t exactly covered in fur.&quot;.
&gt;&quot;To be fair actually I&#039;m kind of hot too right now.&quot; You say, noticing how stuffy the room is starting to feel.
&gt;At least a minute of silence passes.
&gt;You can&#039;t tell but you think she might be sweating. It&#039;s always hard to tell really but you aren&#039;t a scientist.
&gt;&quot;I think I&#039;m going to go hang out somewhere cooler.&quot; You say, shifting yourself up from the couch. 
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll be around if you want to chat again.&quot; You say as you leave from the couch and move into the small group of anthros.
&gt;Dead end there.
&gt;Again you&#039;re almost out. You don&#039;t remember drinking that fast. 
&gt;You pour yourself another mix and head into the bathroom, you have to relieve yourself after all those drinks of course.
&gt;Closing and locking the door behind you for maximum privacy.
&gt;You finish, but before you pull up your britches you hear a peculiar noise coming from behind the shower curtain.
&gt;Carefully, you open the shower curtain to reveal.
&gt;A cute anthro rabbit completely naked in the tub. Her fingers buried within her pussy.
&gt;It takes you a moment to realize what&#039;s happening but within seconds she sees you, leaps from the tub and is on top of you.
&gt;This is fine actually.
&gt;She&#039;s sliding herself along your length. Lubricating your cock with her dripping wet snatch.
&gt;You&#039;re already rock hard and ready to go, with one thrust your penis is inside of her. She moans out in pleasure, nearly losing her balance doing so.
&gt;She is very tight, every inch of her insides squeeze and cover your dick. With each thrust into her she lets out a small grunt as she takes you in.
&gt;It doesn&#039;t take long for her to begin pumping you instead, her hips lifting from yours and up to your head, then pushing back down again. Grabbing her plump hips to help her move about your cock.
&gt;Soon she tires of this and you gently flip her over onto her backside, your dick pushing in and out of her cramped walls. All she can do is continue to moan each time you push yourself into her. Reaching for something to support her as she gets rocked back and forth.
&gt;Her juices cover both you and her fur as you keep pushing into her. Her moans are getting louder but aren&#039;t exactly louder than the Spotify premium advert going on two rooms away.

With one final push you feel ecstasy and your cock twitching deep within her. You stay in this position for a few seconds before pulling out.
&gt;A tiny amount of cum dribbles out of her, she grabs a towel and crumples it up into a makeshift pillow as she curls into a fuzzy ball.
&gt;You smile at the rabbit and scribble down your phone number on it, slipping it into her pants pocket.
&gt;You then find yourself a nice cozy place to lie down and ride the rest of the night out.
