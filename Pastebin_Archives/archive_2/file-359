an intense storm from the vast waters, a curiosity arrived.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A tribe had secured a pale man, from an unknown region, and who spoke an unfamiliar tongue.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He was taller than the native humans, broader in the shoulders too, and his eyes a startling green.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;According to the tribe, he&#039;d been found upon the beach wearing strange garments.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And, according to testimony, when asked of his origins, he pointed across the sea from where the sun arose.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They, of course, did not know if this was true, or if he was a virgin, but the tribe felt it warranted attentions of a higher authority</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The High Priestess, upon learning this, made a note to reward the tribe of humans for their diligence.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Pale One was brought to the great city of Centecochitl, where the High Priestess and the grand temple of Xiomara were.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While he was indeed noticeably larger than a native human, his face was quite youthful in appearance.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He seemed rather alarmed at the appearance of the Lizard-women, and would do his best to back away when approached.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was understandable for one o be intimidated by those superior to themselves, as Nature intended.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Most definitely if a human had never met one of the lizard-kin before, and arguably one of the most important females.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a gesture, the High Priestess ordered the Pale One to be stripped of his garments so he could be examined properly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He did struggle and protest, but it was his fault for hiding so much of his body under leathers and fabrics.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even his FEET had been covered for some insanity, even the soft-skinned tribesmen went barefoot.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was quite shocking to see even paler skin upon such a body, hidden away from the scorching sun.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Male fussed, and his face turned alarmingly red from embarrassment, a rather strange reaction.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What kind of backwards civilization of humans taught themselves to be ashamed of their bodies, the very work of the creator?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And what a body this one had, the pale flesh showcasing his well defined musculature from a life of hard labor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Much to the delight of the High Priestess, Xiomara had blessed this male quite generously.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh, the High priestess would most certainly reward the tribe of the Aztecs most generously for this tribute.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Pale one was given a loincloth, before being sent along to be prepared for the Fertility Ceremony.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He was given drink and food, so as to boost his production and endurance.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then, a few giggling servants washed him, enjoying his attempts to resist them, truly humans needed to learn hygiene was important.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sacred oils and perfumes were massaged into his skin, but no tribal markings were applied, for his people were unknown.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Finally, he was served with a elixir of frothing chocolate and fermented fruit, to ease any reservations he might have.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As the sun began to set, the Ceremony began, and music began to flow freely from pipes and drums.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A night of debauchery was to descend upon Centecochitl, and hopefully Xiomara would bless the wombs of females to bear young.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The High Priestess was already atop the temple with several members of the priesthood, all females.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Adorned with talismans and perfumed, the began dancing and reciting prayers to the Goddess of Fertility.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even as she hefted an incense burner to the heavens, the High Priestess could see the Pale One at the base.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A pair of Temple guards, female warriors tried and tested in fierce battles, were bringing him up the steps.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There was however, a concerning note, as the male was fighting with unusual vigor against their grip.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They were having to all but drag him up the steps of the temple, all 69 of them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was as though he was deathly afraid of whatever lay at the top, a ridiculous notion!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then again, the Pale One did hail from across the vast seas, this was possible disorienting and frightening to the lost male.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still, his strength might have tested that of a lizard-woman in such a state, but the Temple Guard held him with ease.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When he was atop the temple, the Pale One looked around wildly, his breath coming in rapid gasps.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The moment he spotted the alter, he began trying to break free with renewed vigor, a foolish notion.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even if he were to miraculously break free of the Temple Guards, more than a score of the priesthood would be upon him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The lizard-women, even their lowest, were faster and stronger than the human males, and could subdue them, as Nature intended.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With care, the Pale one was bound to the Alter, the stone smooth as a river rock, and in such manner not to cause harm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Temple guards left him there, drinking his body in with their eyes and licking their lips.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Many of the females gazed upon the Pale One with wonder, though more than a few were skeptical.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The High Priestess ignored them, her hands dipping into a bowl of sacred lubricant, coating her palms and fingers in it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She approached the Pale One, and began to rub his manhood and scrotum carefully, enticing him to harness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While his face bore an expression of immense bewilderment, the blush told the High Priestess that he was indeed a virgin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She straddled his hips with ease, trapping his throbbing member between their bellies, and gauging his expression.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once she learned his language, she&#039;d ask what silly thing had frightened him so.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And as the sun disappeared and darkness fell, she rose up and engulfed him in a single, smooth, motion to the hilt.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;his breath seemed to leave him, but oddly, he didn&#039;t moan like many of the tribesmen before him had.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Rather, he grit his teeth, and avoided looking at her altogether. Did he think he could resist pleasure itself?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The High Priestess smiled, he would submit and give her his essence, as all males would, and as nature intended.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She began to ride the Pale one at a sedate pace, fast enough to cause a smacking sound, but not hard enough to bruise.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All the while she gazed down at the male, waiting for when he finally stopped being stubborn and submitted.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Across the city, musicians played and dancers moved, and lovers embraced in carnal pleasure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While the other priestesses had kept their distance at first, a few came forward to look at the Pale One.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Soon, the sound of music and flesh, along with the scents of perfumes and musk, overcame their reservations.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They began to lick, nip, suckle, and kiss at his pale skin, savoring this rare and blessed find.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some sought to stimulate themselves against his body, while others whispered sweet words of encouragement into his ears.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Throughout it all, the Pale one resisted as best he could, to not give into what they offered.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But it would be in vain, the female was superior to the male, as nature intended.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Pale One would give the High Priestess his essence, as the Goddesses had intended.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Finally, as she began to approach her climax, the Pale One stopped fighting, and let loose an adorable moan of pleasure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He began to reciprocate, face burning with embarrassment, as the other priestesses crooned at him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then, his limits finally reached and resistance broken, the Pale One climaxed , the male nearly screaming from the pleasure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Moments later, the High Priestess reached hers, her folds ruthlessly milking ever drop from him as she sighed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For a few seconds, they stared at each other, before the High Priestess removed herself from him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;His expression of wonderment turned to alarm as he gazed upon his erection, it only having gotten bigger.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He muttered something in numb horror, even as the next member of the priesthood mounted him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In the end, the Pale One had managed to satisfy five more female before passing out, truly remarkable.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After the sordid fluids had been washed from him, the High Priestess order the Guards to take him to her quarters.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When the Ceremony had come to a close, she descended the temple to bathe briefly, before heading to her residence in the temple district.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Upon entering, she found the Pale one lying upon stacked sheets of cotton bedding, stirring slightly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He tried to get up, But the High Priestess pulled him back onto the bed, his back against her belly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a moment or two of struggling, he gave up, exhausted from his earlier ordeal, and too comfortable to try.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Humming gently, the High Priestess smiled at her prize, a gift from Xiomara, and stroked his hair.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She would see to it the Pale one was educated, teach him the culture of the Lizard-kin, their history.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He would learn to read and write, to do math and learn the patterns of the heavens, and how to care for her home in her absence.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And she would learn much from him as well, a most importantly, where his tribe was.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Lizard-kin would build ships to cross the unending sea, and armies of Lizard women would go to the land of the pale ones.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The lizard-kin would subjugate the pale human&#039;s tribe, as they had done with the tribe near them, as nature intended.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And the Lizard women would dominate the males of the Pale tribe, females would always dominate males, as nature intended.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But for now, she would comfort her glorious little gift, and sing sweet songs till both were sound asleep.</div></li></ol>        </div>

&gt;The High Priestess, upon learning this, made a note to reward the tribe of humans for their diligence.
&gt;The Pale One was brought to the great city of Centecochitl, where the High Priestess and the grand temple of Xiomara were.
&gt;While he was indeed noticeably larger than a native human, his face was quite youthful in appearance.
&gt;He seemed rather alarmed at the appearance of the Lizard-women, and would do his best to back away when approached.
&gt;It was understandable for one o be intimidated by those superior to themselves, as Nature intended.
&gt;Most definitely if a human had never met one of the lizard-kin before, and arguably one of the most important females.
&gt;With a gesture, the High Priestess ordered the Pale One to be stripped of his garments so he could be examined properly.
&gt;He did struggle and protest, but it was his fault for hiding so much of his body under leathers and fabrics.
&gt;Even his FEET had been covered for some insanity, even the soft-skinned tribesmen went barefoot.
&gt;It was quite shocking to see even paler skin upon such a body, hidden away from the scorching sun.
&gt;The Male fussed, and his face turned alarmingly red from embarrassment, a rather strange reaction.
&gt;What kind of backwards civilization of humans taught themselves to be ashamed of their bodies, the very work of the creator?
&gt;And what a body this one had, the pale flesh showcasing his well defined musculature from a life of hard labor.
&gt;Much to the delight of the High Priestess, Xiomara had blessed this male quite generously.
&gt;Oh, the High priestess would most certainly reward the tribe of the Aztecs most generously for this tribute.
&gt;The Pale one was given a loincloth, before being sent along to be prepared for the Fertility Ceremony.
&gt;He was given drink and food, so as to boost his production and endurance.
&gt;Then, a few giggling servants washed him, enjoying his attempts to resist them, truly humans needed to learn hygiene was important.
&gt;Sacred oils and perfumes were massaged into his skin, but no tribal markings were applied, for his people were unknown.
&gt;Finally, he was served with a elixir of frothing chocolate and fermented fruit, to ease any reservations he might have.
&gt;As the sun began to set, the Ceremony began, and music began to flow freely from pipes and drums.
&gt;A night of debauchery was to descend upon Centecochitl, and hopefully Xiomara would bless the wombs of females to bear young.
&gt;The High Priestess was already atop the temple with several members of the priesthood, all females.
&gt;Adorned with talismans and perfumed, the began dancing and reciting prayers to the Goddess of Fertility.
&gt;Even as she hefted an incense burner to the heavens, the High Priestess could see the Pale One at the base.
&gt;A pair of Temple guards, female warriors tried and tested in fierce battles, were bringing him up the steps.
&gt;There was however, a concerning note, as the male was fighting with unusual vigor against their grip.
&gt;They were having to all but drag him up the steps of the temple, all 69 of them.
&gt;It was as though he was deathly afraid of whatever lay at the top, a ridiculous notion!
&gt;Then again, the Pale One did hail from across the vast seas, this was possible disorienting and frightening to the lost male.
&gt;Still, his strength might have tested that of a lizard-woman in such a state, but the Temple Guard held him with ease.
&gt;When he was atop the temple, the Pale One looked around wildly, his breath coming in rapid gasps.
&gt;The moment he spotted the alter, he began trying to break free with renewed vigor, a foolish notion.
&gt;Even if he were to miraculously break free of the Temple Guards, more than a score of the priesthood would be upon him.
&gt;The lizard-women, even their lowest, were faster and stronger than the human males, and could subdue them, as Nature intended.
&gt;With care, the Pale one was bound to the Alter, the stone smooth as a river rock, and in such manner not to cause harm.
&gt;The Temple guards left him there, drinking his body in with their eyes and licking their lips.
&gt;Many of the females gazed upon the Pale One with wonder, though more than a few were skeptical.
&gt;The High Priestess ignored them, her hands dipping into a bowl of sacred lubricant, coating her palms and fingers in it.
&gt;She approached the Pale One, and began to rub his manhood and scrotum carefully, enticing him to harness.
&gt;While his face bore an expression of immense bewilderment, the blush told the High Priestess that he was indeed a virgin.
&gt;She straddled his hips with ease, trapping his throbbing member between their bellies, and gauging his expression.
&gt;Once she learned his language, she&#039;d ask what silly thing had frightened him so.
&gt;And as the sun disappeared and darkness fell, she rose up and engulfed him in a single, smooth, motion to the hilt.
&gt;his breath seemed to leave him, but oddly, he didn&#039;t moan like many of the tribesmen before him had.
&gt;Rather, he grit his teeth, and avoided looking at her altogether. Did he think he could resist pleasure itself?
&gt;The High Priestess smiled, he would submit and give her his essence, as all males would, and as nature intended.
&gt;She began to ride the Pale one at a sedate pace, fast enough to cause a smacking sound, but not hard enough to bruise.
&gt;All the while she gazed down at the male, waiting for when he finally stopped being stubborn and submitted.
&gt;Across the city, musicians played and dancers moved, and lovers embraced in carnal pleasure.
&gt;While the other priestesses had kept their distance at first, a few came forward to look at the Pale One.
&gt;Soon, the sound of music and flesh, along with the scents of perfumes and musk, overcame their reservations.
&gt;They began to lick, nip, suckle, and kiss at his pale skin, savoring this rare and blessed find.
&gt;Some sought to stimulate themselves against his body, while others whispered sweet words of encouragement into his ears.
&gt;Throughout it all, the Pale one resisted as best he could, to not give into what they offered.
&gt;But it would be in vain, the female was superior to the male, as nature intended.
&gt;The Pale One would give the High Priestess his essence, as the Goddesses had intended.
&gt;Finally, as she began to approach her climax, the Pale One stopped fighting, and let loose an adorable moan of pleasure.
&gt;He began to reciprocate, face burning with embarrassment, as the other priestesses crooned at him.
&gt;Then, his limits finally reached and resistance broken, the Pale One climaxed , the male nearly screaming from the pleasure.
&gt;Moments later, the High Priestess reached hers, her folds ruthlessly milking ever drop from him as she sighed.
&gt;For a few seconds, they stared at each other, before the High Priestess removed herself from him.
&gt;His expression of wonderment turned to alarm as he gazed upon his erection, it only having gotten bigger.
&gt;He muttered something in numb horror, even as the next member of the priesthood mounted him.

&gt;In the end, the Pale One had managed to satisfy five more female before passing out, truly remarkable.
&gt;After the sordid fluids had been washed from him, the High Priestess order the Guards to take him to her quarters.
&gt;When the Ceremony had come to a close, she descended the temple to bathe briefly, before heading to her residence in the temple district.
&gt;Upon entering, she found the Pale one lying upon stacked sheets of cotton bedding, stirring slightly.
&gt;He tried to get up, But the High Priestess pulled him back onto the bed, his back against her belly.
&gt;After a moment or two of struggling, he gave up, exhausted from his earlier ordeal, and too comfortable to try.
&gt;Humming gently, the High Priestess smiled at her prize, a gift from Xiomara, and stroked his hair.
&gt;She would see to it the Pale one was educated, teach him the culture of the Lizard-kin, their history.
&gt;He would learn to read and write, to do math and learn the patterns of the heavens, and how to care for her home in her absence.
&gt;And she would learn much from him as well, a most importantly, where his tribe was.
&gt;The Lizard-kin would build ships to cross the unending sea, and armies of Lizard women would go to the land of the pale ones.
&gt;The lizard-kin would subjugate the pale human&#039;s tribe, as they had done with the tribe near them, as nature intended.
&gt;And the Lizard women would dominate the males of the Pale tribe, females would always dominate males, as nature intended.
&gt;But for now, she would comfort her glorious little gift, and sing sweet songs till both were sound asleep.</textarea>
