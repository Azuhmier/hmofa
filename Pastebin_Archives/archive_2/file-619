some cabinets, or in a crawlspace filled with webs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well at least there weren’t any bug anthros</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Into the

class="de1">&gt;You try to open the door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh right, the hinge was reversed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull open the door, only to find piles of boxes blocking your path</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Did it try to barricade itself?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anyway, you checked around to see if you could spot it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Did it vanish?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Do they have the power to disappear?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No, if it did, then it probably would’ve used it while it was eating</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While you’re thinking about possible places of where it could be hiding, you hear something growl, and heavy panting</div></li><li class="li1"><div

could play opossum?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No, that wouldn’t work, they’ve probably already seen that trick given the environment</div></li><li class="li1"><div

open the lid you’re gonna be as spontaneous as possible</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Also, you should probably ditch this hoodie since you don’t wash it anyway</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Given the situation and considering the fact that you were dealing with what looked like a dog means your time is lessened by smell alone </div></li><li

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well here you are</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Right in front of the crate that it’s hiding in </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To be honest, you’re quite nervous</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mostly because it might try to kill you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well if curiosity killed the cat, then not being curious is gonna kill you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you lift the lid, though, you hear some mumbling</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sounds masculine</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well damn, that just throws you off even further, considering the amount of degeneracy you already partake in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You start to lift the lid</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When he hears you move the lid you hear him quietly say

tension</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just to have it destroyed by a two-letter word</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As soon as you have found the words to react

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Fuck
&gt;You totaled your bike
&gt;Yeah, you died too, but buyer’s remorse is a strong feel
&gt;Oh right, might as well remember yourself before you vanish completely (right?)
&gt;Your name is Anon
&gt;Just Anon
&gt;Your parents were weird
&gt;You were just your average junior
&gt;With slightly bad grades to boot
&gt;You never really had a quirk, except for maybe the fact that your ball sweat smelled sweet
&gt;You were a jack-of-all-trades, some attributes slightly better than others
&gt;You could do anything if given both the base-explanation and some time
&gt;You were almost average, on every point
&gt;Wait
&gt;What the fuck is that?
&gt;Before you, in a large crowd, were what looked like humans
&gt;Except they were animals
&gt;Oh aight, you were just dreaming 
&gt;You knew you should have never looked at those threads
&gt;You ram your head upon a wall, hoping the shock would wake you up
“OWSHITFUCKAHGODDAMMITYOUFUCKINGBITCHASSWALL”
&gt;Alpha as fuck
&gt;Well shit
&gt;You’re not in Kansas anymore (not like you ever were)
&gt;At least you still have your clothes; a blue hoodie, black basketball shorts, white t-shirt, white socks, and blue Vans
&gt;Oh you yelled that out, huh?
&gt;Oh
&gt;All them have their heads turned to you, they look like they’ve seen a ghost 
&gt;Is that a phone?
&gt;Oh well, might as well try to use your average-charisma to calm them
“Shit my bad, guys, you all can go back to what you were doing.”
&gt;None of them are showing signs of stopping
&gt;Well, as Shakespeare once said
&gt;CHEESE IT
&gt;Luckily your parkour skill was above average, so you found a simple jump, fence-to-ceiling
&gt;S Rank jump
&gt;Oh that’s right you were running
&gt;After about five minutes, you find a nice rural area
&gt;Score
&gt;After checking a few houses, you found one that was open
&gt;Mega score
&gt;It had a dusty basement
&gt;ULTRA SCORE BABY
&gt;Quickly, you move into the basement, where you will hide out for a few days
&gt;Oh nice, they had a fair number of books down here
&gt;That should keep you busy
&gt;One that caught your eye was called “Dawn of the Furless”
&gt;According to this book, humans are the equivalent of 
&gt;Anthros? Is that what they were called?
&gt;Eh, the only thing you could really remember from that thread was something about Dr.Pepper™
*click*
&gt;Ah, the homeowners are here
&gt;Well, the time to hide has come
&gt;But for how long?
&gt;Your stomach growls a little
&gt;Shit, not very long
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;Be Denise
&gt;Well this day turned interesting
&gt;Not only did you get a Titan X, you actually saw something that made you want to rush home and ‘re-read’ your favorite book
&gt;You saw a human
&gt;It looked pretty cute, too
&gt;It was about 5’11
&gt;It was looked pretty lean, although you couldn’t tell because it was wearing… something
&gt;What surprised you the most, however
&gt;Was the fact that it cleared a fence, directly onto a roof
&gt;Well now your mom was driving you home, since you wanted to go shopping with her
&gt;When you got over to the door to unlock it, it was already unlocked
&gt;Huh, guess you must have forgotten
&gt;You tell your mom that you were gonna head up to your room for a little while
&gt;After you finish installing your new GPU, you head down to the basement to get your book
&gt;But first, a ham sandwich would be nice
&gt;You are at the final step when you see it
&gt;It set itself a plate and all
&gt;The sight of it makes your heart skip a beat
&gt;Which in turn, almost makes you fall off a step
“SHIT”
&gt;Well, okay, you shouldn’t have yelled that out
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;Be Anon
&gt;Fuck
&gt;It saw you
&gt;Basement time?
&gt;Basement time.
&gt;You ran as quickly as you could back to the basement
&gt;Man, you were enjoying that wholesome hotpocket, too
&gt;Before you closed and barricaded the door, you heard it yell
&gt;”WAIT”
&gt;’Huh, it’s female?’ you thought to yourself
&gt;’Doesn’t matter! You need to find a place to hide you dumbfuck!’
&gt;Well, let’s see
&gt;You can either hide in a crate, behind some cabinets, or in a crawlspace filled with webs
&gt;Well at least there weren’t any bug anthros
&gt;Into the crate you go
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;Be Denise
“WAIT” you shouted
&gt;But before you could catch up with it, it slammed the door shut
&gt;Damn this thing was fast
&gt;Then again, they were described as beings of unknown potential
&gt;You try to open the door
&gt;Oh right, the hinge was reversed
&gt;You pull open the door, only to find piles of boxes blocking your path
&gt;Did it try to barricade itself?
&gt;Anyway, you checked around to see if you could spot it
&gt;Did it vanish?
&gt;Do they have the power to disappear?
&gt;No, if it did, then it probably would’ve used it while it was eating
&gt;While you’re thinking about possible places of where it could be hiding, you hear something growl, and heavy panting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;Be Anon
&gt;Fuck, stomach, calm down
&gt;Jesus
&gt;That small sprint took a lot out of you
&gt;Well, now that you know you’re caught, you might as well assess different ways of getting out of this one
&gt;Maybe you could play opossum?
&gt;No, that wouldn’t work, they’ve probably already seen that trick given the environment
&gt;Maybe you could talk your way out?
&gt;Then again, you’re basically a dragon in a village right now, albeit very scared and tiny
&gt;The book did seem to make your species look menacing
&gt;No, they more than likely would have seen your display given how many people were there
&gt;Well, it seems your only option is to wing it
&gt;As soon as they open the lid you’re gonna be as spontaneous as possible
&gt;Also, you should probably ditch this hoodie since you don’t wash it anyway
&gt;Given the situation and considering the fact that you were dealing with what looked like a dog means your time is lessened by smell alone 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;Be Denise
&gt;Well here you are
&gt;Right in front of the crate that it’s hiding in 
&gt;To be honest, you’re quite nervous
&gt;Mostly because it might try to kill you
&gt;Well if curiosity killed the cat, then not being curious is gonna kill you
&gt;Before you lift the lid, though, you hear some mumbling
&gt;Sounds masculine
&gt;Well damn, that just throws you off even further, considering the amount of degeneracy you already partake in
&gt;You start to lift the lid
&gt;When he hears you move the lid you hear him quietly say “huh?’
&gt;You’re on the offensive now
&gt;The lid is completely off 
&gt;You see him in all his glory
&gt;Kinda underwhelming to be honest
&gt;But before you can even stammer anything out 
&gt;”Yo”
&gt;Wait what
&gt;All of this tension
&gt;Just to have it destroyed by a two-letter word
&gt;As soon as you have found the words to react with, he just continues on
&gt;”Look I’m really sorry that I took your food but I was really hungry okay? I was just trying to feed myself so that I could try to find a safe haven tomorrow, please don’t maul me or anything.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;Be Anon
&gt;Well, that seems to have worked for now
&gt;The tension seemed to dissipate, leaving only you and this dog
“So uh-“
&gt;”You could have just stayed there, you know? I mean, you weren’t bothering anyone. Besides, you looked pretty cu- I-I MEAN you looked pretty hungry…”
&gt;Me?
&gt;Cute?
&gt;Must be an animal thing
&gt;That threw you off guard
“So uh, is it okay if I stay here for a little while? This place seems pretty nice, and considering how you haven’t killed me yet means this place is safe, hopefully.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;Be Denise
&gt;He wants to stay?
&gt;Here?
&gt;Just the thought of it alone makes you wonder about your life in the future
&gt;This happening has completely changed your outlook, somehow
“Sure, I guess.”
&gt;”Awesome! Thank you!”
“But”
&gt;”But?”
“You’re gonna have to do your best to hide, mostly because I don’t want the feds to take away my freedom. Got that?”
&gt;”I can hide pretty well, so yeah alright.”
&gt;Hide pretty well huh?
&gt;You try your best to hide your smug
&gt;It fails though, as you can see that he looks a little uncomfortable
”Remember, the only time you can move around the house is when my mom isn’t around.”
&gt;”Ok”
“Also, I will be gone from seven AM to four PM, except for two days. You understand what AM and PM means right?”
&gt;”Yes, different times. I’m not that oblivious.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;Be Anon
&gt;All right, now your head is cooled down
&gt;You can finally think straight, so on and so forth
&gt;And since you will be staying here for a while, you may as well get to know the society
&gt;Starting with her
“What’s your name? If you don’t mind me asking.”
&gt;Ah ok
“Denise? That’s pretty creative, and not common at all”
&gt;A frown grows upon her face
“Anyway, my name’s Anon.”
&gt;”What kind of name is Anon?”
“The kind you give to planned failures. Also, you mentioned you were going to be out for nine hours. What kind of job do you have?”
&gt;She says that she doesn’t have a job
“You sure? That timeframe sounds like a job to me, and I don’t even know if this place has a school system, so tha-“
&gt;”There is a school system here, albeit not very good, it’s still free education. Yes, I go to school, is that so hard to believe?”
“Yeah it is hard to believe when you’re out at 1:00PM on a Friday.”
&gt;She was taken back a bit
&gt;Did you fuck up already?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;Be Denise
&gt;Damn this guy was assertive
&gt;He literally had a counter argument for everything, even rhetorical questions
&gt;Why did this fact intrigue you?
&gt;You were going to have to wrap this up anyhow, seeing that it was 7:00PM
&gt;You ask Anon if he wants to come up to your room with you
&gt;He was staggered by that question
&gt;He said yes, though
&gt;When you got up to your room and opened the door, you heard a gasp come from him
&gt;He seemed impressed, even though your room was plain; a bed, a desk, a pc, and a night stand
&gt;You get a few blankets and a pillow and set them up on the floor to make a makeshift bed
&gt;He looks pleased by this
&gt;”Better than an old couch” he says
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;Be groggy Anon
&gt;Even though it’s 11:00
&gt;Whatever, it’s Saturday, so you could care less
&gt;Before you lie back down, you remembered everything that happened yesterday
&gt;It all came back to you in a flash
&gt;That day moved pretty fast, huh?
&gt;Oh god, the pain
&gt;Your head is splitting, you can feel it throbbing
&gt;Why is it like this?
&gt;Oh right
&gt;As you give yourself an adrenaline boost, you quickly get up
&gt;You see your dog friend is on her computer
&gt;Is she wearing your jacket? Or is that hers? Because it’s quite cold in here.
&gt;She’s having trouble with drivers? Really?
&gt;Oh that’s right, she uses a razer mamba
&gt;She hears you get up and looks at you
&gt;She quickly tries her best to take off the jacket without you noticing
&gt;So it WAS yours
&gt;”G-Good morning Anon! Why didn’t you tell me you were awake?”
&gt;Is this the same person you met yesterday?
&gt;Sure doesn’t seem like it
“Look at me, I just woke up. Do you really think I could have told you?”
&gt;”S-Sorry I asked, are you feeling okay? You look like you’re hurting.”
&gt;Definitely not the same person
“You can only feel so great when it feels like you had your head kicked by a hydraulic press.”
&gt;”Do you want some water or something? I don’t know much about humans-
&gt;Obviously
&gt;”But I want to try to help in any way I can.”
“I’m down for some water. It’s been almost a day since I drank anything.”
&gt;”All the water we use comes from the tap. Is that okay with you?”
“Sure. Anything is fine, really.”
&gt;As she went out and closed the door, you waited for her to go down the stairs
&gt;Time to snoop
&gt;You immediately walk over to her PC
&gt;She’s playing some kind of game.
&gt;Visual novel
&gt;As you minimize the window, you see she has a worrying number of tabs on her browser
&gt;Just thinking about how much RAM that’s shredding makes you physically cringe
&gt;Something catches your eye as you’re closing tabs
&gt;It seems to be this worlds’ version of that anonymous image sharing board you go on
&gt;You see she was on some threads about… humans?
&gt;So she’s one of those people, eh?
&gt;Doesn’t matter much, she didn’t seem to be interested in you in that kind of way
&gt;Finally, you look at what she was having trouble on
&gt;Does that say Titan X drivers?
&gt;Did she actually install a beast of a gpu in this?
&gt;You heard footsteps on the stairs 
&gt;You set everything back where it was (even the tabs)
&gt;As she opens the door you sit on her bed, waiting patiently for that cup of water
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;Be Denise
&gt;When you headed down the stairs, you noticed your mom was on the couch in the living room reading her copy of “Dawn of the Furless”
&gt;You grabbed a cup from the cupboard and started to fill the cup with water
&gt;One thing you didn’t expect, though, was for your mom to start talking to you
&gt;”So who’s your friend, Denise?”
“O-Oh, just a friend from school, he got here e-earlier than expected.”
&gt;”Are you sure? I’m just curious because he doesn’t smell like any of your friends. Heck, he doesn’t even smell like any of the people around here.”
“W-Well you see, t-that’s because he’s a new student, a-and he lives closer to downtown.”
&gt;”Okay, that’s all I wanted to know, honey. You can get back to your little playdate.”
“I-It’s not l-like that! I-I just invited him over so I c-could teach him t-the ropes!”
&gt;”Sure, whatever you say, honey!” She finished, a fake smile stained on her face
&gt;Gotta get this water back up to Anon
&gt;Who knows what will happen if you don’t?
&gt;Here you are, in your room now
&gt;Anon is sitting on your bed, rubbing his head
“Here you go, Anon!”
&gt;”Thanks, Denise.”
&gt;He finishes his cup in one round
&gt;How big was that cup? 16fl.oz?
&gt;”Hey Denise, I’ve been wanting to know this since yesterday, but I felt like it might have been too much for you already.”
“Sure! You can ask me anything!”
&gt;”Even though it’s only been nearly a day, how come you’ve been so nice to me- even to go as far as take care of me?”
“W-Well, you’re a human! Who k-knows what would happen if you were to be severely hurt? Besides, the last time we had one here, things didn’t exactly go well…”
“N-Not like you need to worry though! Because right now, you’re safe here!”
&gt;You tried your best to convey your feelings discreetly, hoping he would get the memo
&gt;You don’t know why you couldn’t say it directly, maybe you were worried about rejection?
&gt;”One more question, Denise.”
”Y-Yes?”
&gt;Did it click? Did he read you correctly?
&gt;”What type of canine are you? I-If you don’t mind my asking, that is.”
“Huh? Oh, I’m a Chinook, believe it or not.”
&gt;Crap, it didn’t work this time
&gt;At least you have all the time in the world to let him know, though, right?
&gt;”Huh, that explains the temperature in here.” He says, with a soft sigh</textarea>
