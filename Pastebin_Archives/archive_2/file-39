        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Blaring music jolts you awake as the heavy bass of some &quot;song&quot; drops.
&gt;Quickly you get up and rush to your open window and slam it shut, cursing yourself for leaving it open again.
&gt;You had hoped that the loud rain from the electrical storm would keep up and let you get a decent nights sleep.
&gt;it had sounded so peaceful...
&gt;the ceiling above you rumbles as the Bass drops again.
&gt;Ugh your new neighbors...ever since they moved in they&#039;ve been playing that weird cheeki breeki music with the heavy bass.
&gt;it was bad enough you were in a shitty part of the city, but you also had no where else to move.
&gt;No one wants to deal with an implant less bounty hunter, too much of a risk.
&gt;Luckily (or unluckily in this case) you found this one &quot;apartment&quot; that was run by an AI, so it didnt care if you didnt have an implant, but similarly, it didnt care about your complaints of loud music.
&gt;you grumble to yourself as you shuffle to your &quot;kitchen&quot; and hit a few buttons on your food synth for something resembling food.
&gt;it shudders a few times until you hit it on the side; then it chokes out something looking like ham, cheese, and eggs.
&gt;you take the meal and are about to begin looking through bounties when your Holophone rings and displays a small Hologram of Gabriel.
&gt;&quot;Whats up?&quot; you ask before you shovel in a mouthful of food.
&gt;&quot;geez dude you just wake up? you look like you lost a fight with a street sweeper&quot; Gabriel says with an amused smile, looking you over.
&gt;Gabriel&#039;s face always reminded you of a piece of steel made to look like a man, all sharp angles and grey eyes; today his dark brown hair is slicked back and down past his ears.
&gt;&quot;Bite me, those fucking cheeki breekis have made sleeping hard&quot; you say between mouthfuls of food.
&gt;Gabriel&#039;s smile goes away and is replaced by one of annoyance.
&gt;&quot;you tried talking to them about it?&quot; he asks as he slides his metal left arm into place.
&gt;you nod as you finish scarfing down your food.
&gt;&quot;Yea man, they yelled at me in russian or something then turned it up louder&quot; you respond as you begin getting ready for the day.
&gt;&quot;i havent found us a mark yet&quot; you call out to him as you pull your shirt and gun belt on.
&gt;this is how it goes, you find a good bounty; then Gabriel and you track them down, with Gabriel providing transportation.
&gt;Hard to drive around the city without the right implants to make a car go, let alone start up.
&gt;&quot;All good, i got a good one lined up&quot; is Gabriel&#039;s almost giddy response.
&gt;Which immediately tells you somethings up.
&gt;&quot;Whoa whoa NO! whats going on&quot; you demand, grabbing your holophone and looking Gabriels hologram and his surroundings over.
&gt;&quot;Nothing! Why you gotta be so paranoid Null?&quot; he asks, giving an over exaggerated shrug.
&gt;He&#039;s in his speeder, nothing out of the ordinary in it.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s my Job to be paranoid, and i have been since you tried to sicc Fox&#039;s cousin on me&quot; you quip, loading your handgun and sliding into your holster.
&gt;&quot;You focus TOO much on your job and She was in HEAT dude!&quot; Gabriel responds as though that should be a good excuse.
&gt;&quot;She tried to Knife me!&quot; you shoot back.
&gt;&quot;SHE. WAS. IN. HEAT.&quot; he responds louder and slower.
&gt;You sigh and pinch the bridge of your nose, trying to push back what you knew would be a headache later.
&gt;&quot;Whatever, whats the mark? anything special?&quot; you sigh in exasperation.
&gt;&quot;nothing special, I&#039;ll be there in 5&quot; he responds before his hologram winks out leaving you alone in your one room apartment.
&gt;well nothing special means you don&#039;t have to grab any extra firepower but you did notice he didn&#039;t answer who the mark was.
&gt;you do a final pat down to make sure you have all the gear that you would usually carry.
&gt;Your handcannon rose, a powerful shock knife, extra non lethal shots, electromag cuffs and your Holophone.
&gt;the final touch is your Leather Jacket.
&gt;Satisfied that you have everything you head outside and frown as you hear your neighbors music blast louder.
&gt;yea guys everyone wants to hear your shitty music...
&gt;you step out of the building and under an awning to wait for Gabriel.
&gt;The street is a mass of plants and garbage with water constantly flowing through the gutters.
&gt;The rain in the city never stops so people gave up trying to stop the plants from growing.
&gt;Humans and anthro bustle by, some with umbrellas, so with augments to keep the rain off them and some just getting wet.
&gt;Speeders zoom by ignoring pedestrians for the most part, they hover after all so they don&#039;t kick water up like the vehicles of old.
&gt;you admire a few of the people walking by, looking at their augments.
&gt;how do they choose?
&gt;that guy has eyes that can see through walls.
&gt;that ladies hair can connect into multiple computers to download whatever info she needs...
&gt;that lion ha-
&gt;&quot;YO NULL, QUIT DAYDREAMING&quot; comes a loud familiar voice.
&gt;You&#039;re pulled from your thoughts by Gabriel&#039;s yelling and him waving you over to his speeder.
&gt;you shrug at him as you walk to his speeder.
&gt;his speeders passenger door opens and you climb in, finding a few things on your seat.
&gt;&quot;What this?&quot; you ask as you hold up whats obviously a thermos and food container.
&gt;&quot;Leftover Korean barbeque and Black tea, the tea leaves were fresh from Fox&#039;s Garden&quot; he replies as he speeds off into the rain.
&gt;&quot;Nice&quot; 
&gt;Fox always makes the best food and her little garden has all sorts of great stuff.
&gt;As you open the thermos a warm mist steams up, smelling of tea and Honey.
&gt;A Sip warms your insides as your jacket drips water into the speeder.
&gt;you take a hearty swig, savoring the ambrosia before snapping back to reality.
&gt;&quot;Where are we going? You didnt answer me before&quot; you ask before drinking more of the hot tea.
&gt;&quot;We&#039;re heading to Gary&#039;s House of cards, gonna catch this guy&quot; He responds, hitting a few buttons on his phone.
&gt;&quot;That shitty casino under the megaway?&quot; you ask as your phone beeps and a hologram of a horse that looks overly sparkly appears.
&gt;&quot;yea,Thats the one&quot; Gabriel answers nonchalantly 
&gt;You frown.
&gt;&quot;we&#039;re going after a unicorn wannabe?&quot; you ask incredulously, looking at Gabriel in disbelief &quot;the bounty isnt even that big&quot;
&gt;&quot;someone will owe us a favor&quot; Gabriel responds with a simple shrug.
&gt;Oh...
&gt;In your line of work, someone owing you a favor was something worth its weight in gold.
&gt;You silently nod and down the last of your tea, then stare out the window organizing your thoughts.
&gt;Gary&#039;s house of cards is a shitty casino but that doesnt mean this wannabe unicorn wont have friends or something with him.
&gt;best bet is to slip in the back door and...
&gt;you blink hard for a moment and shake your head.
&gt;for a moment the rain had...
&gt;you shake your head again and delve back into your thoughts.
&gt;go in the back and try to find the implant scanner, see where the mark went and...
&gt;again you blink hard.
&gt;the rain on the window..looked like you were below  the surface of water; ripples forming perfect circles above you.
&gt;you literally slap yourself lightly andgroan, trying to focus your head.
&gt;What the fuck.
&gt;the ripples take different colors of neon, mixing where they collide and erupting in exlosions of color,
&gt;&quot;you Ok null?&quot; Gabriel asks, amusment in his voice.
&gt;&quot;y-yea just things are a little odd&quot; you respond then look at him
&gt;Gabriel&#039;s arms have switched and he has a third eye in the center of his forehead; he smiles a MUCH too wide smile with cheshercat like teeth
&gt;&quot;Ooooooh its Kicked in already&quot; he says with that far to wide smile
&gt;you blink hard and focus, making some of the colors disappear.
&gt;&quot;WHAT has kicked in?!&quot; you shout, causing Gabriel to laugh.
&gt;&quot;I mighta dosed you, but just a drop&quot; he says with a big laugh.
&gt;you blink for a moment then look at the thermos.
&gt;&quot;You fucking put LSD in my TEA?!&quot; you yell, letting your anger focus things.
&gt;OK this works, stay mad and you can get through this.
&gt;&quot;yea man you&#039;re always focused on work, relax, enjoy the trip&quot; Gabriel insists, checking his Holophones GPS
&gt;&quot;We have a JOB to do today!&quot; you retort as the Speeder glove box smiles at you.
&gt;&quot;relax its a joke of a mark, just chill Null&quot; he says with a smile.
&gt;you groan and close your eyes. 
&gt;Focus.
&gt;Breathe.
&gt;Don&#039;t let it affect you.
&gt;You open your eyes and feel like you&#039;ve entered cartoon land from &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;
&gt;Fuck you swear you see Jessica rabbit waving to you from the street.
&gt;&quot;we&#039;re here, stay... well just follow me&quot; Gabriel muses, pulling behind Gary&#039;s house of cards.
&gt;You open your eyes and try to will the colors and shapes invading your vision out of existence.
&gt;This of course doesn&#039;t work.
&gt;you groan and pull your handcannon out of its holster</textarea>
