&gt;Be Anon
&gt;It&#039;s been five days since that damn Coyote and her &quot;followers&quot; came into town.
&gt;Currently, the small town in New Mexico that you lived in seemed to be under siege by an enormous group of dogs, foxes, wolves, coyotes, jackals, dingos, and other canine species. 
&gt;Now usually, that would be bad on its own, but like a shitty cake, there were layers to this hell.
&gt;For one, you wouldn&#039;t be hurt if you just walked around in the street, but if you got in a car or tried to leave, you would be mauled by a group of pissed off canines. Not a pretty sight.
&gt;Two, there seemed to be a defined leader, a Coyote who wore a leather jacket, sunglasses, and a crucifix necklace. Oh, and she could also fucking talk. She gave three or four sermons every day down at the small church near the center of town.
&gt;And three, the water system no longer worked. From what little information you&#039;ve heard, somehow, all the water in the reservoir had vanished into thin air on the morning of the third day. It didn&#039;t help that it was an almost constant 95 degrees outside.
&gt;Yep, things did not look good for the rest of the town.
&gt;Lucky for you though, you had come prepared. Due to your intense /k/ fueled paranoia, you had amassed a sizable stock of food and water. You didn&#039;t even need to leave your home, and you had no intentions of doing so.
&gt;You hadn&#039;t left your home since the third day, the day that the town lost all of its water.
&gt;That morning you had decided to see one of those sermons that the Coyote was always giving. Just to see what it was all about.
&gt;She had said some strange stuff... Something about how Humans as a species had forgotten about her, but now she was back to see her &quot;flock&quot;. Spooky.
&gt;The freaky shit only happened after the sermon was over.
&gt;When she was done speaking, the Coyote had offered to barter for some water.
&gt;Of course, due to the panic that the loss of water had caused, there were several people who went up to the podium to try and trade.
&gt;The first person to go up, a middle-aged man you had recognized as then local mailman, had offered the Coyote some cash.
&gt;In an instant, he had somehow been turned into a dog.
&gt;After the screaming died down, the Coyote explained herself, a relaxed smile on her face.
&gt;&quot;Well, it&#039;s not my fault he couldn&#039;t understand instructions... I said -barter-, not -purchase-. I don&#039;t really have much use for your modern currency. As far as I&#039;m concerned, it has the same value as ordinary paper.&quot;
&gt;She kept smiling as the former mailman mindlessly walked out of the church in his new body.
&gt;&quot;Now... Any more offers?&quot;
&gt;The next person to go up, a woman you didn&#039;t recognize, offered her some jewelry, a pair of Amber earrings.
&gt;The Coyote had seemed to accept the item, her tail lazily wagging behind her.
&gt;&quot;Ooh! Very nice... Yes, this will do fine. Here. Some water&quot;
&gt;Her source of water seemed... Unsanitary, to say the least. To be precise, the Coyote had produced a glass jug, and then proceeded to vomit out water until it was filled.
&gt;The Coyote had resumed smiling as she dried her mouth.
&gt;&quot;Yes, I know what you&#039;re thinking... But don&#039;t worry! It&#039;s perfectly clean. I promise.&quot;
&gt;Yeah, no fucking thank you. That was about when you had left the church and headed back home.
&gt;That was four days ago. Since then, things had gotten A LOT worse... Currently, everyone in town had either been turned into a canine, was dying of dehydration, or had become the Coyote&#039;s bitch.
&gt;Yeah, it was like you said before... Things were not looking good.

&gt;Currently, you were sitting at your old PC, frustrated.
&gt;Of course, the internet (and cell reception) had been out since the day the Coyote had shown up. It was too bad. /x/ would be shitting themselves right now if you could only post some proof of this.
&gt;You sighed, turning off the computer as you moved over to the window.
&gt;You crank up the window-mounted fan, trying to cool down your house a bit.
&gt;Of course, all it does is just blow around more warm air. You&#039;re really starting to wish you would&#039;ve bought a proper AC unit...
&gt;While you&#039;re at the window, you look out, your eyes scanning the street.
&gt;Yep. There&#039;s still several hundred canines blocking the road.
&gt;When they had first arrived in town, they had seemed to &quot;corral&quot; everybody near the center of town before forming a huge ring around everyone.
&gt;Lucky for you, your home was still within the boundaries they had set, and so you were able to remain with your stockpile. You&#039;re pretty sure it&#039;s the only reason you&#039;re still alive and not walking on four legs right now.

&gt;You&#039;re woken up the next morning by a strange pressure on your chest, and something moist rubbing up against your face...
