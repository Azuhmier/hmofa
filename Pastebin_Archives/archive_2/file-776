by an unknown author

&gt;It was about six months ago that they had been discovered
&gt;An entire tribe of what could only be described as anthropomorphic animals
&gt;tall beautiful women of various &quot;species&quot; with soft fur and muzzles but human form
&gt;They lived in a small village deep in the heart of an African jungle, that&#039;s how they had avoided contact with humans for so long
&gt;As a young anthropologist I was as curious as anyone else in the field, and luckily I had been selected as the first representative of the collective schools to be allowed to make contact and study them up close
------
&gt;The trek through the jungle was exhausting and painful, it was no wonder it had taken so long for anyone to find this tribe
&gt;Finally, after cutting through miles and miles of jungle, I found the first signs of life. A lone figure carrying a large ceramic jug that must have been filled with water
&gt;She was shorter than I expected, with fur that was differing shades of peach and tan - from the look of her a lioness
&gt;As she turned to the noise and saw me her eyes widened with shock, and before I could call out she had dropped the jug and bolted away on all fours 
&gt;figuring that was the way I needed to go I gave chase, eventually reaching a moderate clearing filled with huts made from leaves and earth
&gt;The lioness was communicating frantically with two other women, one mostly brown with a peach belly and hair that almost seemed to come to a spike, and the other with the long ears and muscular legs of a rabbit
&gt;As I think on how to make contact a twig breaks beneath my feet, alerting them to my presence
&gt;before I can turn to run they&#039;re on me...but rather than the painful bites and scratches I had assumed were awaiting me I felt them wildly sniffing all over my body
&gt;They exchanged a few words in a tongue I didn&#039;t understand before lifting me up and taking me into the village
&gt;It was then that I noticed something strange about the village, and realized why I might be something these villagers would want to keep and protect rather than do away with
&gt;There were no men.
------
&gt;The next few days were a blur of fermented fruit wine, intense sex, and, surprisingly, cuddling
&gt;one girl in particular seemed to have taken a liking to me more than the others, staying near my hut at all times and nuzzling me whenever possible (I believe to reestablish her scent)
&gt;The shortest girl in the tribe, she was a strange sight even in comparison to the rest of the girls.
&gt;Unlike the tans and browns and greys of the others, her fur was a deep red, and her long dark hair had been crudely fashioned into pigtails
&gt;I called her Rose
&gt;her snout was more rounded and upturned than the others, and I had a difficult time attempting to determine which animal species she resembled
&gt;but all the same she was gorgeous, and the time we spent in wordless embrace was the best of my life
&gt;Of course, cozying up with the only male in the area is likely to make some jealous, and the lioness who had been my first contact seemed the most eager to challenge what she must&#039;ve seen as my Rose hogging me to herself
&gt;The Lioness and Rose argued for only a moment before Rose shouted something to the others, and suddenly the Lioness was being carried away by two of the largest members of the tribe
&gt;It was then I realized something any anthropologist should have days ago - Rose was the queen.
&gt;Did...did that make me the king?
------
&gt;It seemed as though the earlier confrontation had settled something for the Queen
&gt;I was taken to a different hut, which I assume must have been hers by its size and relative quality
&gt;That night we laid together in bed staring into each other&#039;s eyes, neither understanding the other&#039;s language but both knowing what the look meant
&gt;This was love
&gt;It was time now not to mate, not to fuck, but to make love, to consummate a real relationship
&gt;she softly blew into my ear as I began to massage her perfect plump ass
&gt;as I moved up, stroking the small of her back, she moved down, kissing me gently before swirling her tongue around my left nipple
&gt;I bring my swelling member up to her perfect tiny lips, ready to plunge into Rose&#039;s delicate rose
&gt;&quot;WHERE IS DE QUINN&quot;
&gt;What? English? Here?
&gt;&quot;WE MUST FIND DE QUINN&quot;
&gt;Suddenly, a crowd of tiny ugly red creatures flood into the bedchamber
&gt;&quot;MY QUINN!&quot; &quot;WE HAVE FOUND DE QUINN&quot; they shouted, almost incomprehensible
&gt;&quot;DIS MAN IS NOT DE WAY&quot; &quot;SPIT ON HIM!&quot;
&gt;As I scramble to my feet I am instantly felled by a rain of projectile spit
&gt;&quot;PTOO PTOO PTOO&quot;
&gt;The spit is hard and sharp like knives against my skin
&gt;&quot;YOU MUST HAVE EBOLA&quot; I hear one shout as I hear Rose protesting
&gt;I see the horde swarming over her naked body
