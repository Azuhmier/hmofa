I was actually writing a story about that, but I kind of dropped it for a few reasons. I now use the story as a sort of scrapyard that I pull ideas from to apply in some form to the other things that I&#039;m ̶w̶o̶r̶k̶i̶n̶g̶ procrastinating on. Basically how it went was:&quot;
 
Character names:
Human - Jeffory Hayes
GP&#039;s ex - Andrew Baker (The furboi who appears in most ghost pupper images)
Ghost pupper - Alice Foster
 
&gt;Start off with Jeffory hanging out with Andrew
&gt;He mentions that he used to be in a relationship with Alice, explains that they parted ways a few months ago
&gt;This greatly interests Jeffory
&gt;They talk about her a bit more, the furboi giving Jeffory pro tips about her, as well as where she lives
&gt;Goes directly to her place as soon as Andrew heads out
&gt;Oh shit, she&#039;s real
&gt;He talks to her for a bit, spends the night on the couch, heads to work the next day (never got to the part where I mentioned his job, but I recall intending to have him work in a warehouse), and researches her murder on the internet when he gets back to his apartment
&gt;He finds pic related (https://s1.desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1555/80/1555803997221.png)
&gt;He just stares at the picture for a while, observing the terrified and confused look on her face
&gt;He was already immensely interested in Alice, but this is where his crusade to find a way to save her begins
 
&gt;Buys a shitload of books on magic and time travel, trying just about everything that has a chance of working
&gt;Creates a study/laboratory in her kitchen, spending just about every afternoon in there working on ways to save her
&gt;Takes breaks, either to go to the spot where she was murdered and practice takedowns and infiltration tactics for when he actually has to save her, or hanging out with/interviewing Alice
&gt;Eventually, as the weeks drag on, her neutrality towards Jeffory fades as she realizes that he&#039;s not going to stop wasting his life on this wild goose chase any time soon
&gt;She starts trying to convince him to give up and accept what happened, with her assertiveness gradually increasing as he continues to ignore her
&gt;Eventually gets to the point where she strikes at him, gets him out of the house, and tells him that she&#039;ll have to kill Jeffory if he comes back again
&gt;He just comes back with a jug of holy water
&gt;Has a jug that he keeps secured on the kitchen counter, pretty much keeping her presence out of the room entirely
&gt;A dropper that he uses to apply holy water to his gas mask (to protect himself) and along the sides of a storm lantern (so that its radius of light acts as a sort of reality anchor)
&gt;During this period, he develops a symbol - two rings connected by an arc which runs through just a small portion of one of the rings, and then through the entirety of the second ring
&gt;This represents him only being around for only a short period of Ghost Alice&#039;s existence, but going to another world he saves her, and they can spend their lives together happily ever after
&gt;He makes a wooden carving of this symbol and applies it to the shoulders of his jacket and the nose of his gas mask
&gt;One of his nicknames in the story was going to be &quot;the cultist&quot;
&gt;This carries on until he eventually finds a method of creating a time portal that actually works
 
&gt;Cue scene of the stoic cultist silently marching through the rotting house as the hallways drip with blood, twisting and shrieking at him; rotting limbs reaching out, only to be cast away by the illumination of his lantern.
&gt;Marches up the stairs while Alice futilely tries to stop him at the top of the stairs before being repelled by the lantern
&gt;He sets up in the bathroom next to where she died
&gt;Does the portal thing
&gt;Gets his knife
&gt;Hops in and stabs the (furboi) murderer in the throat
&gt;He&#039;s done it
&gt;In spite of all the spirit&#039;s resistance, all the odds in the world being against him, he managed to go back in time and save her, and there she was right in front of him
&gt;Scared and confused, but alive
&gt;He rescues her and explains the situation (conveniently leaving some parts of the story out)
&gt;Convinces her that they should bury the corpse in the woods, as the police would otherwise find out that he&#039;s a time traveler and almost certainly lock him up in a laboratory for the next 30 years
&gt;Because he won&#039;t own his apartment until several decades from now, and he doesn&#039;t have a job, she agrees to let him stay
&gt;He goes to bed (either with her or on the couch, I hadn&#039;t made my mind up on that part), and later wakes up in the middle of the night
(For this part, I&#039;ll actually post the scene itself, as it&#039;s one of the few parts of the story that I actually finished.)
https://pastebin.com/R13qcGfJ
 
&gt;In summary, Alice comes back in her monster form in the middle of the night, and without his gas mask or lantern to protect him, she ceases his vital functions in a rather unpleasant way
&gt;He later wakes up as a ghost
&gt;Goes downstairs to find her waiting there
&gt;Jeffory is a bit miffed that she just fucking murdered him in his sleep
&gt;She apologizes but reminds him that she warned him that this would happen if he came back, and he came back anyway
&gt;He didn&#039;t actually go back in time; ghost Alice just bamboozled him with her ghost powers
&gt;Tricking him with a very elaborate and well-planned illusion was the only way that she could get his defenses down, and the only way that she could put an end to this madness
&gt;Jeffory greatly dislikes this fact
&gt;Eventually, however, Jeffory starts to accept being a ghost and accepts her being a ghost now that he can better relate to her
&gt;Their relations quickly being to heal now that his obsession is out of the way
&gt;Over time, they become a /hmofa/ ghost couple, silently walking through the forest together at night, watching movies and Youtube videos together via the neighbor&#039;s internet, ghost sex, etc. etc.
&gt;Even though he&#039;s accepted the situation, Jeffory tries desperately to keep a sense of normalcy whenever guests are around, never appearing in any form other than his &quot;alive&quot; form and trying not to use any supernatural abilities when around the living
&gt;And so they un-lived together, happily ever after, like a couple of adorable, rotting cadavers.
