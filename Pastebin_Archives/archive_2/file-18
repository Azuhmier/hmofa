twists and bends to make sure you cover EVERYTHING</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like any famous superhero duo, the two of you began your careers with a mutual sense of professionalism</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And like many of said duos, a certain level of romance budded between you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still, you know when to rein it in and when to enjoy her company</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sometimes you join her in the buff, and sometimes you keep your shorts on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The latter is often worse, as Hilde will snap your waistband repeatedly until you give in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s almost not even for the sexual aspect with her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She just likes sharing the moment with you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Soaping her up gets easier as the cascades wash over you, and soon you don’t have to reach up so far to clean her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She even joins in on rubbing the suds off her body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her increasingly shapely, soft body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Don’t use too much of that fragrant stuff,” Hilde says with much more eloquence.

class="de1">&gt;You didn’t wash out her mischievousness though, and you’re in a tug of war with the towel</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still an extremely one-sided contest, but as you let go she wraps herself up in it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You use her tangled state to grab the hair dryer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s not really drying herself so much as trying to run it along her curves seductively, making the scene even more arousing while the air blows her fur around</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The jackal is back to her “regular” size, wrapping the towel around her ears and swaying out of the bathroom with nothing else</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;By this time the two of you are getting pretty hungry</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If you have the foresight to pop in a meal before starting the whole process (and Hilde’s shenanigans don’t make you miss the timer) you’ll try to whip something up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But most of the time, it’s just good ol’ takeout</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Meals can still be a stressful time for you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If you don’t get all of the beast out of her, her ravenous appetite might make her a sloppy eater and ruin all the day’s work</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And sometimes the delivery boy is actually a villain’s henchman, and she’s instantly back to her wild mode</div></li><li class="li1"><div

formidable force</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lie on the bed absolutely spent</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have just enough energy to turn your head and

of you are always “on call”, and you never know when the call to justice will have to interrupt an intimate moment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That’s why you make the most out of every minute of peace together</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She curls up against your body, resting her head on your chest and folding her legs over yours</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In this position, you seem like the bigger one</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You did a great job today, as usual,” she purrs, nuzzling her flawless

&gt;Anon and Hilde
&gt;Inseparable crime-fighting tag team
&gt;You’re the strategist, the rational thinker, and the diplomat
&gt;Not saying your better half isn’t smart or crafty, but she’s more than qualified to be the “brawn” of the duo
&gt;In your downtime and pre-conflict investigation, Hilde’s a spunky, sarcastic jackal
&gt;When fighting is inevitable (and she’ll always assume it is), the near-invulnerable juggernaut of a roid monster comes out
&gt;She’s already a fairly tall and brawny anthro when relaxed, but ”Amazonian” doesn’t even begin to describe her alter ego
&gt;And yet, you’re the only one who tempers the beast within her, and she does all she can to make sure no harm ever comes to you
&gt;While you rarely return from a mission with more than a few scratches, Hilde is a walking trophy display for her conquests

&gt;You try to catch her, but you’re also wary of engaging her
&gt;If her playful swipes don’t keep you at bay, her pelt full of sharp junk and toxic refuse usually does
&gt;Eventually she exposes her underbelly (likely to taunt you) and you tackle her
&gt;You could never overpower her yourself, but she doubles over and pulls you into her chest
&gt;The two of you topple over, and Hilde splays her limbs and flops her tongue out
&gt;Playing dead, defeated by Anon
&gt;You try to drag the massive jackal by her foot, but make little progress
&gt;She has to discreetly push herself along the floor to help you out
&gt;If she hasn’t been rolling around in something radioactive, you can usually skip the preliminary soak

&gt;Now comes her favorite part
&gt;Her expandable harness has enough slack to unbuckle, and where was once a stretched torso of muscle now holds two much more defined, weighty breasts
&gt;You lather shampoo all over her naked form, and she twists and bends to make sure you cover EVERYTHING
&gt;Like any famous superhero duo, the two of you began your careers with a mutual sense of professionalism
&gt;And like many of said duos, a certain level of romance budded between you
&gt;Still, you know when to rein it in and when to enjoy her company
&gt;Sometimes you join her in the buff, and sometimes you keep your shorts on
&gt;The latter is often worse, as Hilde will snap your waistband repeatedly until you give in
&gt;It’s almost not even for the sexual aspect with her
&gt;She just likes sharing the moment with you
&gt;Soaping her up gets easier as the cascades wash over you, and soon you don’t have to reach up so far to clean her
&gt;She even joins in on rubbing the suds off her body
&gt;Her increasingly shapely, soft body
&gt;”Don’t use too much of that fragrant stuff,” Hilde says with much more eloquence. “I want you to still smell my natural scent.”
&gt;Her dampness is utterly adorable when you finally shut the water off
&gt;You didn’t wash out her mischievousness though, and you’re in a tug of war with the towel
&gt;Still an extremely one-sided contest, but as you let go she wraps herself up in it
&gt;You use her tangled state to grab the hair dryer
&gt;She’s not really drying herself so much as trying to run it along her curves seductively, making the scene even more arousing while the air blows her fur around
&gt;The jackal is back to her “regular” size, wrapping the towel around her ears and swaying out of the bathroom with nothing else
&gt;By this time the two of you are getting pretty hungry
&gt;If you have the foresight to pop in a meal before starting the whole process (and Hilde’s shenanigans don’t make you miss the timer) you’ll try to whip something up
&gt;But most of the time, it’s just good ol’ takeout
&gt;Meals can still be a stressful time for you
&gt;If you don’t get all of the beast out of her, her ravenous appetite might make her a sloppy eater and ruin all the day’s work
&gt;And sometimes the delivery boy is actually a villain’s henchman, and she’s instantly back to her wild mode
&gt;Tonight she’s as classy as a naked jackal can be, slurping up noodles with her eyes only on you

&gt;It’s the end of the day, and you’re wiped out
&gt;Fighting evil is one thing, and on top of it you have to wrestle with an even more formidable force
&gt;You lie on the bed absolutely spent
&gt;You have just enough energy to turn your head and see Hilde leading against the doorway
&gt;The jackal saunters over to you and slips under the covers
&gt;The two of you are always “on call”, and you never know when the call to justice will have to interrupt an intimate moment
&gt;That’s why you make the most out of every minute of peace together
&gt;She curls up against your body, resting her head on your chest and folding her legs over yours
&gt;In this position, you seem like the bigger one
&gt;”You did a great job today, as usual,” she purrs, nuzzling her flawless coat against you
&gt;Hilde will often poke fun at your combat prowess compared to her own, but she never jokes about your ability to make her feel perfect
&gt;It isn’t just the grooming that does it, either
&gt;No matter how many threats she protects you from, you are always the hero to her
&gt;And it makes you all the more motivated to protect the safety she knows you can always give her</textarea>
