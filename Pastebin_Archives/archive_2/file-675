        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Raine wakes up one morning 
&gt;Brain function at 3%
&gt;Get&#039;s coffee from table and heads out
&gt;Still early morning 
&gt;Only person she came across was that one basitin Karen always hung out with
&gt;She seemed flustered about something
&gt;Ankles probably weren&#039;t covered
&gt;Raine made her way sleepily to Red&#039;s room
&gt;He said they&#039;d go to a theater performance in Edinmire
&gt;And that she should come get him
&gt;Or he&#039;d come get her... one of the two
&gt;Was it in the morning or late in the evening?
&gt;Didn&#039;t really matter, they&#039;d make it either way
&gt;Upon reaching his door she knocked softly, making sure to not wake anyone else up in the process
&gt;She heard something stir inside: &quot;Mmmhhullo?&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s me... are you not out of bed yet?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Come in.&quot;
&gt;Upon entering she noticed the human had buried his face in pillows
&gt;She walked over and placed her barely touched coffee on the bedside table
&gt;She rubbed his shoulder to try and get him to wake up a bit
&gt;&quot;Didn&#039;t you say you were going to take me to the theater today?&quot;
&gt;He started to spin around
&gt;&quot;Raine, that&#039;s at six PM, not six aaaaiiieee-whoa.&quot;
&gt;His eyes started shifting all over her body until finally resting on her panties
&gt;Raine looked down and saw she never got changed out of the lingerie 
&gt;She&#039;d tested it out the night before, it was supposed to be for after the theater
&gt;&quot;H-heheh, looks like that&#039;s not the only thing I mixed up&quot;
&gt;&quot;Damn, you look... hot&quot;
&gt;She started rubbing her hair, &quot;Thanks, it was supposed to be a surprise for... afterwards.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I mean now is fine!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Snrk, you can wait mister.&quot;
&gt;He had finally leaned up and wrapped his hands just above her hips
&gt;He gave them a small squeeze &quot;How about a little teaser? We don&#039;t even have to get undressed.&quot;
&gt;Raine felt her keidran side coming out a bit more
&gt;It was what made her dress this way in the first place
&gt;&quot;I spoil you too much, you know that?&quot;
&gt;He stuck his tongue out a little as he eyed a growing wet spot on her panties &quot;Probably.&quot;
&gt;The human had helped her onto his bed, she was still a little nervous whenever they fooled around
&gt;She was pulled on top of him, the wet spot smearing her arousal all over his chest
&gt;It wasn&#039;t until he pulled her hips towards his head now resting on a pillow did she understand what he wanted to do
&gt;So she lifted her tail up and leaned down to find that his underwear was poorly hiding his thick manhood
&gt;She practically jumped when she felt his tongue press into the fabric separating her pussy from his loving mouth
&gt;It felt like she was being teased but still being pleasured as the tongue lapped at her covered folds
&gt;She took to licking at his member through his heart printed boxers
&gt;She could feel him pulse at her large canine tongue with each stroke
&gt;He kept running his fingers under her panties&#039; waistband 
&gt;It was driving her crazy
&gt;She wanted to feel more of his tongue
&gt;She wanted to taste more of him
&gt;After placing a couple kisses on his concealed tip she unbuttoned the slit in his underwear
&gt;And brought his head through it and in between her canines
&gt;She knew it was his favorite place in her extended mouth, even if he refused to admit it
&gt;He decided to return her treatment 
&gt;Using his own teeth, he pulled the panties aside and returned his treatment of her now soaked sex
&gt;He gave his unrelenting focus onto her now puffy wolf pussy
&gt;Thanks to the teasing through clothes, both of them were getting close 
&gt;Red felt his climax quickly building 
&gt;But he knew how to speed her up just like she&#039;d done to him
&gt;He brought his hands from her waistband and lifted them up to her raised tail
&gt;His dexterous hands gently worked the spinal extension
&gt;She spasmed and happily moaned at the amazing feeling
&gt;And right before she came
&gt;He quickly wrapped his hands around her hips and pulled them close 
&gt;So he could stick his tongue as deep insider of her as he could
&gt;That&#039;s all she could take
&gt;She rode her orgasm as she suddenly found thick ropes of cum now shooting into her mouth and right onto her tongue
&gt;She swallowed and sucked a little more, making sure to not waist the salty treat
&gt;Their afterglow hit them hard as they began to come down from their high
&gt;Raine flopped his now flaccid manhood back into his underpants and slipped her panties back into place 
&gt;She took her place next to the now dopey human, she was exhausted 
&gt;&quot;Enjoy your teaser?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah, though, I really don&#039;t want to get out of bed now.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Heh, well, so long as we don&#039;t sleep past six right?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Wait, is it even Friday?
&gt;...
&gt;It&#039;s Thursday isn&#039;t it?&quot;
&gt;&quot;... I am off the ball today.&quot;
&gt;&quot;It ain&#039;t all bad&quot; he said while pulling her close
