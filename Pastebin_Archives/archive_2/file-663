&quot;-And what&#039;s unique about the Camel&#039;s biology is that the actually conserve water by using the humps on their back
&gt;&quot;But. When reproducing they tend to be cumbersome. *Blah blah blah*
&gt;You just had enough about biology shit
&gt;All you need to know about biology is that of how it creates hangovers in the morning
&gt;And by this comment you&#039;re Anon
&gt;A college student, specifically planning on making a revolution that will shook the foundation of education
&gt;Just kidding, that&#039;s just a thought and you may never achieve it because you are autistic about being a Nigger-buster (Police)
&gt;&quot;Psst, Anon&quot;
&gt;You looked behind and see your friend, al melwah
&gt;She&#039;s been your friend for 4 months now in this school and the two of you stick like &#039;Ellis and Keith&#039; from L4D2â„¢
&gt;in short the two of you are friends before you two even talked
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m having a hard time on this&quot;
&gt;She shows you a anatomy diagram of a human
&gt;Of course: Biology
&gt;Welp it&#039;s your cue now
&quot;Sure, I&#039;ll help just give me a minute&quot;
&gt;You packed up you backpack, and your wristwatch vibrated and the bell cued in harmony with it
&gt;ColdAndCalculated.wav
&quot;C&#039;mon this way&quot;
&gt;You refer al melwah towards the unused room in the middle of the school back
&gt;The place has always been a desert
&gt;By that you mean outside of the school
&gt;Ever since the small lake got drained by thirsty corporations, what&#039;s left of it became owned by liberals that wanted to make use of empty lands
&gt;for many reasons it succeeded and now your here, helping a Camel to study.
&gt;You can&#039;t but think of erotic thoughts as the heat creeped in your collared shirts

...

&gt;Be Anon, cleaning nuggets off your computer
&gt;Your face when, you fantasize about you Camel friend for no particular reason at all
&gt;Or is natural?
&gt;Nahh, beastiality is basically taking advantage on animals
&gt;To you and your parents to say a least
&gt;You turned on the only working speaker on your computer and let american jazz take you smoothly
&gt;Yeahh, that&#039;s the smooth
&gt;Your parents are lucky that they bought you an old american computer that was smuggled in this here country
&gt;The first time you held this computer, you read out loud the brand &#039;Macintosh&#039; on the label
&gt;You don&#039;t know what that means but still, a computer is a computer
&gt;Although it doesn&#039;t explain why it&#039;s fully named &#039;Apple Macintosh&#039; on the label.
&gt;Blinking your eyes, you are amazed of how music can be a aspiration in life
&gt;You rested your back on the scribbled wall and looked at the &#039;clean&#039; floor
&gt;There were stains and other bodily fluids on the edge of the room-floor, but the dust were at least thoroughly cleaned out
&gt;A clean house, a working computer and properly dressed you meant one thing-
&gt;*Knock x2* &quot;Anon! You in here?&quot;
&gt;Is that you have guest to please
&gt;Darting towards the door you turned to knob and opened the door
&gt;A sound of clip-clops resonated the room, as the obvious cause was on your Anthro Camel friends hump
&gt;She was carrying a ladder
&gt;But not just any ladder, it was an expensive, sturdy: Step ladder
&gt;Truly a simple thing
&gt;&quot; Good evening Anon, I brought the ladder as requested-&quot; she un-leaned back and carefully dropped the step ladder, making a sound thud as her milk glands bounce abo-
&gt;&quot;Anon&quot;
&gt;You flinched after you blinked in rapid succesion
&gt;A warm blush covered your cheeks as you tried to out an apology
&gt;But what will you say?
&gt;&#039;Sorry for staring at your boobs&#039;
&gt;&#039;Haha, I was just lidding aly, no need to get nervy he he&#039;
&gt;Damn, the last part made you sound like a creep
&gt;Suddenly a pressure on your hand snapped you out of your apology brainstorm
&gt;she cupped your shoulder with her familiar distinct hand
&gt;Then shake your shoulder and said

&gt;&quot;Anon, can you help me with this&quot;
&gt;you slowly opened your eyes and see melwah, slowly ascending at the step ladder while pointing at the ribbon
&gt;&quot;Come now Anon, you say that you&#039;ll cooperate when we tie your room together&quot;
&gt;realization hits you
&gt;of course
&gt;you tell her that why didn&#039;t she remind you of it
&gt;&quot;Because you&#039;re forgetful Anon, since you keep typing on your, er, Computer whatsis called. you always visit the site when there is a chance.
&gt;she referring to your hobby of browsing /BRED/
&gt;she never saw you watch the webms in that thread, you were new to that infamous board and you were in a single man mission to ruin their interspecies degeneracy
&gt;or at least you &quot;tried&quot; because everytime you comment that offends them, they will always retaliate with hateful words such as, &quot;fuck you&quot; as an example
&gt;though internet is slow cause: old PC, you still can manage
&gt;back to IRL
&gt;you carried the ribbon and walked toward the heavy camel anthro
&gt;the artificial light bulb is flickering, indicating that outside was dangerous because of either sandstorms or the sun lasers
&gt;your room was not-so-average afte all, with only a single window and a spacious floor, you could not mistaken this as a shed because this was a shed by the rich people who once lived on this former lake.
&gt;come to think of it, that&#039;s maybe the reason why the tribal Camels started to settle in the modern world because they were desperate for water
.

&gt;&quot;Anon, give me the red ribbon please&quot;
&gt;you nod and hand her the red ribbon
&gt;your still Anon, and right now you were trying your hardest to stare at the wall
&gt;particularly since undergarments in this region is so underrated because of the heat in this desert
&gt;as a result you find yourself ogling at al&#039;s supple ass, firm yet very sens-
&gt;you quickly look at a wall of your &#039;home&#039;
&gt;instead you should focus on the past so you can distract yourself from the present

&gt;a long time ago, when you were the abandoned by your original family.
&gt;most likely after the civil conflict
&gt;you were adopted in the spot by a very conservative family, one that strictly forbids you from marrying a anthro
&gt;the mother as it turns out was very infertile due to some biological result, the father is the same too with his sperm missing tails or something.
&gt;they gave you shelter(this shed), they gave you luxury (your ancient computer), and most importantly they gave you food( mostly crackers and carbohydrates) and water (though it is a new pump from outside, the water is still contaminated with underground dirt)
&gt;and they are against Anthros because of an unexplained disappearance of your uncle
&gt;&quot;W-woah&quot;
&gt;the ladder rattled and you instinctively held it still
&gt;it stopped but not before looking up
&gt;al melwah was staring at you, her eyes focused on your eyes as your eye &#039;incidentally&#039; focused at her exposed camel vagina
&gt;it looked a black-pinkish and moist, fantasies ran wild as-
&gt;&quot;Ahm, Anon&quot;
&gt;your attention was snapped back to al
&gt;she just stood there with an unreadable expression on her face and her tail swished for a sec before again
&gt;&quot;uhm, Let&#039;s continue shall we&quot;
&gt;she goes back to rearrange the ribbons on your room
&gt;you pitched in to see what she is doing
&gt;she was currently doing the same thing over and over again: fiddling with the ribbon
&gt;is she doing this on purpose?
&gt;...
&gt;nah, she&#039;ll  maybe say that she&#039;s done soon
&gt;for now you flee the scene as you kept staring at her while she swayed left and right with her boobs being with the notion coincidentally
&gt;You kept yourself cool when you put enough distance with her, at least it&#039;s finally almost finished
&gt;But you can&#039;t figure out what the familiar feeling that you are having in the back of your mind
&gt;Hold on a minute, Oh no; the assingment

&gt;Be Anon, the helpful eccentric
&gt;Staring at the distance while someone carrying you
&gt;And right now you&#039;re considering why you didn&#039;t ask your parents why they didn&#039;t bought you a blindfold instead of a coin container that resembles a pig, and jotted with colorful charcters, not those anthro ones mind you
&gt;It was shaped like a pre-anthrofied pig
&gt;At least you&#039;ll save enough money for a rope perhaps?
&gt;Or maybe it&#039;s a old vintage in the past, possibly
&gt;While you gazed at the wasteland looking ass desert a paw shook your legs
&gt;&quot;Anon! Why do you keep staring at the distance?&quot;
&gt;Spinning your head to face al, she smirked at the position the two of you were
&gt;Currently you were riding her, in her back &quot;hump&quot; of course
&gt;She said it was alright she said, you wont fall she said
&gt;But she was right and now you were wishing that you did
&gt;&quot;Heh, enjoying this Anon?&quot;
&gt;No of course you aren&#039;t, because you were actively groping her large breasts of a busts
&gt;You replied that you are not, and saying why she thinks that this is a good idea
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s because the area we&#039;re travelling to is far and your human body is not made to sweat almost non-stop at the plain sun&quot;
&gt;Now you remember why yo-
&gt;&quot;Ahh-&quot;
&gt;That was al!

&gt;Your now falling
&gt;Unexpectedly of course
&gt;It happened so fast that you could see blurs while weightlessness gave your body a tome of pain
&gt;You can feel yourself spinning and at the same time trying your best not to barf your contents inside your stomach
&gt;al wasn&#039;t faring any better too
&gt;Her camel body can only do much when falling down
&gt;You can see glimpses of her flaying her limbs trying to hold on to something
&gt;When the world stopped doing random motions, you clenched your hand into a fist and felt something soft and fatty
&gt;You blinked rapidly and looked up to see al blushing up a storm because...
&gt;&quot;Ekk! A-ANON WHATAREYO-&quot;
&gt;You in instinct jump off her(not literally), and apologized profusely that it makes Asian bows a better one
&gt;&quot;I, I forgive you Anon&quot;
&gt;You sighed in relief
&gt;She strides towards and leaned next to your ear
&gt;&quot;But I wouldn&#039;t mind if you do it againâ™¥&quot;
&gt;Your breathing hitched as her hot breathe sensation it strangely erotic without a reason
&gt;Naturally you blushed and blush Hard
&gt;And finally, you get up and turn to her and said
&quot;I-uhhh, do you have water?&quot;
&gt;Smooth, real smooth; forgetting what was about to be said I clicked my tongue discretely and stormed on
&quot;I think, we need to have a drink&quot;</textarea>
