Long time, yes, since we see you last.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shudder a little at the sight and smell of her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The rat anthro war wfie is covered in non-standard equipment, with a bone staff, tooth necklace, and jawbones of various species worked in all over her very revealing uniform.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She almost looked goofy with barely-covered tits that size, since she came up to about your bellybutton.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you can definitely see that she&#039;s soaking his neck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Honestly you&#039;re not surprised someone like him was issued a rat. He never had the best hygeine, and his nose had something wrong with it that he couldn&#039;t really smell much at all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That, or it was his excuse he used for his smell, and the smell of his war-wife.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sincerely hope you&#039;re not issued a rat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They creep you the fuck out, they smell weird all of the time, they only do urban ops, and their school of magic was...very unique.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Incog reaches out for a handshake, which you return.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Incog, it&#039;s been a while man. How&#039;ve you been doing?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Great! We&#039;re about to head out again, something going down in Detroit. Me and Sep are just here for a resupply.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; Sepsis hops up and down from her seat on his shoulders, &quot;Sepsis need more reagents, War-Husband need ammo, yes. Sepsis cannot make everything from city-places and husband-places.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Incog releases your hand and chuckles, tapping one of her thick thighs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yeah, but that doesn&#039;t mean she doesn&#039;t try.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You resolve to use one of the wet wipes in your pack before you shake someone else&#039;s hand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;How long, how long, war-husband? Wait long? Time enough?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Incog looks up to her and his hand squeezes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Probably, but you know the rules, sweetie. So Anon, have you been issued a war-wife yet?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;No, I just got here. Still waiting on the woman to come back.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ooh, a surprise then. I&#039;d love to see who they pair you with. Got any favorites in mind?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You think on it for a moment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One of the reasons you had chosen this profession in the first place, four years ago when you were still young and dumb, was to get a war-wife.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yeah, yeah, some people thought you were quite the loser for getting this job just for that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Weren&#039;t cool enough, or just too nerdy, to get yourself a regular anthro girlfiend?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Gotta have the state play matchmaker?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The thought of a beautiful and dangerous athro woman bound to you kept you determined throughout all your studies at the academy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The all-nighters.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The stressfull tests.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The mage trials and the wounds you received.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The grueling combat training.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Out-performing those other fucking casuals in your class who didn&#039;t have the same determination you had.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After all, this would be your only shot.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Those jabs and jeers you got from your family and friends?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They were true. You were--had been a fucking nerd when you entered.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But it would all be worth it for a war-wife.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Equines were tall and beautiful, and you had originally thought they were your favorite, but when you had seen the PT requirements to be matched with one, you knew you&#039;d never pass.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The speed and distance requirements were just too much.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Huskies were big and comfy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You weren&#039;t the right specialization for Greyhounds, since they were all close-quarters combat operators.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lizards were lithe and exotic, but they meant you&#039;d spend the rest of your career in a desert somewhere.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Although you had heard good things about gators.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Spiders only accepted battlemages from their own schools.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bovine operators were almost exclusively in the healing schools.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bobcats, Ocelots, and Mountain Lions were highly sought-after by members of the American territory of the Omni-Nationalists since they were native. Maybe you&#039;d get one of them?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Foxes and wolves were the all-around operators, but they were pretty common.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not to say that you wouldn&#039;t mind, but you didn&#039;t work your ass off for a war-wife they handed out like candy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Probably something fluffy, or a lizard. I&#039;m not really that picky.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Good, good. Not everyone gets their first choice, so it&#039;s best to keep an open mind.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sepsis squeezed his neck from her high seat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Sepsis was war-husbands first choice, yes! Very special to Sepsis, perfect match! Sepsis hope you get good war-wife too!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Th-thanks, Sepsis. Me too.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yes, was very very special, Sepsis remember like yesterday. Sepsis came to building with operators...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had heard this story before, but it was happy stories like this one that had kept you going through your studies.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It actually helped you relax.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So engrossed you were that you hadn&#039;t noticed the woman from the desk returning.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Staff Sergeant Anonymous!

There&#039;s gotta be a dozen pink vials in there, so just keep crushing them in your hand until she&#039;s satisfied! Don&#039;t mix them up with the orange! Four: Hydrate again. Five: If it lasts for more than four hours, find a shrine and thank the Wild Gods of the Fae!

one side could go all the way through your torso. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Damn, she must be even stronger than you thought.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She leaned forward and set you on her bed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Get those clothes off.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;R-right.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod and comply, eagerly unbuttoning your uniform top. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sets your staff against the wall next to her hammer before doing the same, and the fabric of her shirt struggles around her bust, revealing the biggest bra you&#039;ve ever seen. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s baby-blue with little darker-blue dots across it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Say what you want about soulless bureaucrats, but they delivered on every one of the requests you put on your questionnaire. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Strong. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Kind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hot. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You honestly didn&#039;t know how she looked to other anthros, but she definitely gets you going. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;ve yet to see how well they matched up with the personality questions, but she doesn&#039;t seem mean or anything. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her panties come off on her way to the light switch and she throws them on top of the pile of your own clothes on the floor. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She hesitates for a second when she sees just how hard you at at the sight of her, then the light goes out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The only thing you can see glimmers of is the light from her ring flickering about when she moves her hands. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The next thing you can feel is her pressing down on the bed on either side of you, her giant furry knees sinking in around your legs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Luckily her bed handles the weight enough that you&#039;re not smothered beneath her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One of her huge furry hands--paws, rests on you chest, and the other next to your head on the mattress. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She lets loose a long sigh, relaxing on top of you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re trying your hardest not to hyperventilate. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The fuzzy paw trails her claws down your body while she waddles up on her knees, and you feel yourself rub against something warm and wet. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A moment later and you enter her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;None of the rumors you had heard about scale and the impossibility of the task had been true.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It definitely didn&#039;t feel loose, and she seemed to be enjoying it too. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She releases a half-growl, half-sigh, totally drowning out your own sharp inhale. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tense your legs as hard as you can, trying your best to remember all of the tips and tricks passed on to you by the non-virgin students on how not to be a two-pump chump. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her knees and hips start moving, pumping you in and out of her slowly. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s heaven. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All of the effort has been worth it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All for this moment. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try your damnedest to keep four years worth of semen from making a glopping noise as it flows. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You need to make a good impression here. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The smell of sweat, pine, and sex fill the room, and you think you&#039;re doing pretty well. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your hands swim through her thick fur and find her massive chest in the dark and discover that she&#039;s still wearing her bra. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She guides them back to her hips and leans forward, pressing your body against hers. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her wet nose stops next to your ear, moving up and down with the rest of her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The wet tongue against your cheek and lustful sigh right into your ear send you over the edge. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tap her legs just like you practiced in your head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She immediately understands and clenches her thighs around you, letting her weight lock the two of you together. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One of her giant arms wraps around you and you find your face pressed against her chest. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Huh...it doesn&#039;t really make any kind of sound at all. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your novels must have lied to you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Also the straps on the bra kinda hurt against your chin. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It ends just as suddenly as it began. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A second or two after you finish, she drops you back onto the bed and stands up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At least you think she does, all you can really see is the fading glow of the ring on her finger. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You should get dressed so we can head to the training grounds.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; you nod, still coming down from the high of your very first time. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your head is still swimming, so it&#039;s hard to roll off the bed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When she flicks the light back on she&#039;s already wearing her pants, and the bra that never came off. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t know what was supposed to happen in the real world after your first time, but it seems she has more experience or knowledge in this than you do. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You only have your silly stories about human men with anthro women that you found either in the old libraries or traded on the intranets. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A strong warrior like her must be all about business. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No time for cuddling like you wanted. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not that you&#039;d admit such a thing. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You bunch up your clothes and head to the shower. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Skip the shower. I don&#039;t want my scent to wash off you today.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, your clothes are all wrinkly and you smell like bear and sex. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But it was your wedding day today, and everyone will notice a new mage on the grounds. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yeah. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yeah, you&#039;ll wear it like a badge. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The walk to the training grounds is similar to the one leading to her quarters. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This time you get to walk next to her though. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Men that pass by give you a knowing smirk and a high-five. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anthros do the same for Viera, but the way she smiles and hesitates each time makes you think she&#039;s nervous. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel a big hand slap against your ass when an equine passes by, gripping it for a second and giggling. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You let out what is definitely a masculine sound of surprise. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s not the first time someone&#039;s done that to you, but it&#039;s definitely the first time it&#039;s been outside the locker room at the academy, and a woman at that. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The loud scraping and scuffling of hooves on a smooth floor accompany the white furry tree trunk swinging over your head. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Do you smell that?&quot; Viera asks the horse head pressed against her chest from the crook in her arm. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She flexes it slightly and the equine woman scrabbles at the bear&#039;s forearm when her nose is pushed up and against her sweaty fur. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yes, I smell it,&quot; the horse chokes out. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;This is my scent.

Chapter 1

&gt;You heft your staff, feeling it&#039;s weight.
&gt;And the weight of the job ahead of you.
&gt;Today you graduated from being just an apprentice to a Battlemage.
&gt;The equipment in your hand was just issued to you, one of two things you received upon graduation.
&gt;You fold out the steel-coated arcanium-cored staff, locking it in place as you walk down the hall.
&gt;All the crystals line up.
&gt;At the end is a wicked-looking twisted red crystal covered in a gold and steel lattice, covering it in straight gold lines in sharp right angles.
&gt;Four smaller ones with metal end-caps point out at forty-five degree angles away from the base, like a flower.
&gt;You reach the door to the small room where you will receive your second issuance.
&gt;You walk up to the small table in the middle of what used to be an armory.
&gt;Doors are on every side of the room, each with different signs and symbols on them.
&gt;The room was mostly empty this early in the morning, but you had shown up early.
&gt;Standard practice when you wanted to be the best.
&gt;A small woman in front of a spread of papers upon it gives you a bored look.
&gt;&quot;Name?&quot;
&quot;Staff Sergeant Anonymous.&quot;
&gt;She checks off a box on the paper.
&gt;&quot;Specialty?&quot;
&quot;Battlemage, Fire School.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You here right after graduation?&quot;
&quot;Yes, I was instructed to get my &#039;war wife&#039; issued.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Wait here.&quot;
&gt;She gets up and takes your paper with her into one of the rooms, leaving you to sit in one of the chairs along the wall.
&gt;The door you entered through opens again and several people walk through.
&gt;One of them is a very tall equine anthro.
&gt;Legs for days, bruh.
&gt;Her palomino coat and white shock of hair poke out here and there between her heavy equipment.
&gt;She&#039;s got a huge rack on her, too.
&gt;Probably where she locks her heavy weapons on the move.
&gt;Her tits aren&#039;t that large, actually.
&gt;She spoke with a man at a counter near one of the other doors before posting up against the wall in a relaxed pose.
&gt;You smell something familiar before you see someone familiar.
&gt;&quot;Hey, if it isn&#039;t Anon!&quot;
&gt;Yup, it&#039;s your buddy Incognito.
&gt;He had been the only one who had encouraged you before you joined.
&gt;He was a few years older than you, but not only had he owned up to joining specifically for a war-wife, he had beaten up or shouted down anyone who had wanted to talk shit.
&gt;He&#039;s actually an operator, one of the few humans that had been able to pass the tests.
&gt;He also had what they called &quot;aptitude,&quot; i.e.: he was willing to get issued a very specific type of war wife.
&gt;Who is sitting on his shoulders.
&gt;&quot;Yes, friend Anon! Long time, yes, since we see you last.&quot;
&gt;You shudder a little at the sight and smell of her.
&gt;The rat anthro war wfie is covered in non-standard equipment, with a bone staff, tooth necklace, and jawbones of various species worked in all over her very revealing uniform.
&gt;She almost looked goofy with barely-covered tits that size, since she came up to about your bellybutton.
&gt;And you can definitely see that she&#039;s soaking his neck.
&gt;Honestly you&#039;re not surprised someone like him was issued a rat. He never had the best hygeine, and his nose had something wrong with it that he couldn&#039;t really smell much at all.
&gt;That, or it was his excuse he used for his smell, and the smell of his war-wife.
&gt;You sincerely hope you&#039;re not issued a rat.
&gt;They creep you the fuck out, they smell weird all of the time, they only do urban ops, and their school of magic was...very unique.
&gt;Incog reaches out for a handshake, which you return.
&quot;Incog, it&#039;s been a while man. How&#039;ve you been doing?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Great! We&#039;re about to head out again, something going down in Detroit. Me and Sep are just here for a resupply.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; Sepsis hops up and down from her seat on his shoulders, &quot;Sepsis need more reagents, War-Husband need ammo, yes. Sepsis cannot make everything from city-places and husband-places.&quot;
&gt;Incog releases your hand and chuckles, tapping one of her thick thighs.
&gt;&quot;Yeah, but that doesn&#039;t mean she doesn&#039;t try.&quot;
&gt;You resolve to use one of the wet wipes in your pack before you shake someone else&#039;s hand.
&gt;&quot;How long, how long, war-husband? Wait long? Time enough?&quot;
&gt;Incog looks up to her and his hand squeezes.
&gt;&quot;Probably, but you know the rules, sweetie. So Anon, have you been issued a war-wife yet?&quot;
&quot;No, I just got here. Still waiting on the woman to come back.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ooh, a surprise then. I&#039;d love to see who they pair you with. Got any favorites in mind?&quot;
&gt;You think on it for a moment.
&gt;One of the reasons you had chosen this profession in the first place, four years ago when you were still young and dumb, was to get a war-wife.
&gt;Yeah, yeah, some people thought you were quite the loser for getting this job just for that.
&gt;Weren&#039;t cool enough, or just too nerdy, to get yourself a regular anthro girlfiend?
&gt;Gotta have the state play matchmaker?
&gt;The thought of a beautiful and dangerous athro woman bound to you kept you determined throughout all your studies at the academy.
&gt;The all-nighters.
&gt;The stressfull tests.
&gt;The mage trials and the wounds you received.
&gt;The grueling combat training.
&gt;Out-performing those other fucking casuals in your class who didn&#039;t have the same determination you had.
&gt;After all, this would be your only shot.
&gt;Those jabs and jeers you got from your family and friends?
&gt;They were true. You were--had been a fucking nerd when you entered.
&gt;But it would all be worth it for a war-wife.
&gt;Equines were tall and beautiful, and you had originally thought they were your favorite, but when you had seen the PT requirements to be matched with one, you knew you&#039;d never pass.
&gt;The speed and distance requirements were just too much.
&gt;Huskies were big and comfy.
&gt;You weren&#039;t the right specialization for Greyhounds, since they were all close-quarters combat operators.
&gt;Lizards were lithe and exotic, but they meant you&#039;d spend the rest of your career in a desert somewhere.
&gt;Although you had heard good things about gators.
&gt;Spiders only accepted battlemages from their own schools.
&gt;Bovine operators were almost exclusively in the healing schools.
&gt;Bobcats, Ocelots, and Mountain Lions were highly sought-after by members of the American territory of the Omni-Nationalists since they were native. Maybe you&#039;d get one of them?
&gt;Foxes and wolves were the all-around operators, but they were pretty common.
&gt;Not to say that you wouldn&#039;t mind, but you didn&#039;t work your ass off for a war-wife they handed out like candy.
&quot;Probably something fluffy, or a lizard. I&#039;m not really that picky.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Good, good. Not everyone gets their first choice, so it&#039;s best to keep an open mind.&quot;
&gt;Sepsis squeezed his neck from her high seat.
&gt;&quot;Sepsis was war-husbands first choice, yes! Very special to Sepsis, perfect match! Sepsis hope you get good war-wife too!&quot;
&quot;Th-thanks, Sepsis. Me too.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes, was very very special, Sepsis remember like yesterday. Sepsis came to building with operators...&quot;
&gt;You had heard this story before, but it was happy stories like this one that had kept you going through your studies.
&gt;It actually helped you relax.
&gt;So engrossed you were that you hadn&#039;t noticed the woman from the desk returning.
&gt;&quot;Staff Sergeant Anonymous! Front and center!&quot;
&gt;You jumped a little and turned to the woman, scrambling to the front of her desk.
&gt;A different woman than the one that had met you at the beginning.
&gt;This one seemed much happier.
&gt;She had a big goofy smile on her face, holding her clipboard close to her chest as she made introductions.
&gt;&quot;Staff Sergeant Anonymous, meet your new War Wife: Staff Sergeant Viera. Staff Sergeant Viera, meet your new War Husband: Staff Sergeant Anonymous. Congratulations you two! I think you&#039;ll be perfect for each other!&quot;
&gt;Next to her stood next to a new anthro.
&gt;You looked her up and down.
&gt;But mostly up.
&gt;Standing next to her was the largest polar bear you had ever seen.
&gt;Stark white fur with a black nose, large blue eyes, and full black lips.
&gt;She was built like a bear, too.
&gt;Wide legs and thighs, arms like tree trunks, and breasts each the side of your own head.
&gt;She must have stood a good seven and a half feet tall.
&gt;Her uniform was fit to burst around her limbs and chest.
&gt;You looked back up at her face and gulped.
&gt;You stared at her for a moment, speechless.
&gt;This was it.
&gt;That was her.
&gt;Your new war-wife.
&gt;Everything had lead up to this.
&gt;Four years of toil and trouble.
&gt;She raised an eyebrow as you stared a little too long.
&gt;Stop staring at her!
&gt;Just say something, anything!
&gt;This is it!
&gt;A loud whistle and a slap on your back saved you from ruining the moment any further.
&gt;&quot;Wew lad, check out the...everything on her!&quot;
&gt;Incog stepped up next to you and put an arm around your shoulder, bringing you less than comfortably close to the smelly sex demon on his shoulders, and shook you a bit.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m his friend Incognito, nice to meet ya. Don&#039;t let his shy demeanor get you down, Viera, he&#039;s just spent the last four years becoming the Alpha Nerd of the school. And you know what they say about wizards, the nerdier the better! Not much time for women, mind you.&quot;
&gt;She nodded quickly at that.
&gt;&quot;I see, I see. Good to finally meet you, Anonymous.&quot;
&gt;It was a deep one, but her voice was definitely feminine.
&gt;Even if she wasn&#039;t smiling, she was still so pretty with those ice-blue eyes.
&gt;You didn&#039;t really know what to say.
&gt;You extend your hand.
&quot;I-I...Ah, nice to meet--&quot;
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t shake her hand, you idiot! That&#039;s no way to meet your new war wife!&quot; Incog shouted in your ear and slapped your back again, this time pushing you forward.
&gt;Her huge, strong arms reached forward and picked you up, hugging you against her impressive bust. 
&gt;Even through her uniform you could feel how soft she was.
&gt;Although that could just be the fact that your face was mashed into her chest.
&gt;The hard buttons along the middle hurt your face, so you moved your face from heaven and looked up at her.
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re mine now, little human,&quot; she whispered down to you, &quot;let&#039;s see if you&#039;re worth it.&quot;
&gt;She had a hint of a smile, so you probably didn&#039;t ruin it forever.
&quot;R-right.&quot;
&gt;Probably.

Chapter 2

&gt;&quot;So...&quot; the bubbly woman next to you breaks up your moment with your new wife, &quot;Did you two want a full ceremony? Most people do, but it&#039;s not necessary.&quot;
&gt;Viera sets you down on shaky legs and shakes her head.
&gt;&quot;No, that honor is only given to my people at the end of their service, not before.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oof, that&#039;s rough Anon,&quot; Incog mutters behind you.
&gt;&quot;Ah,&quot; the woman nods her head again, &quot;I do remember that. Barracks marriage it is, then. Have you chosen witnesses?&quot;
&gt;Oh.
&gt;Your mind had been filled with fantasies about your new wife...
&gt;You&#039;d forgotten about that.
&gt;You both needed a witness for the marriage to be official.
&gt;One human and one Fae, by the laws of the Fae Accord.
&gt;You had the perfect choice picked out, so long as Viera wouldn&#039;t mind.
&gt;You&#039;re really glad your best friend is here.
&quot;Hey Incog, would you and Sepsis do the honors?
&gt;Incog saves you again with another slap on the back.
&gt;&quot;You know it, Anon! Me and Sepsis here will be your guys&#039; witnesses. Whaddya say, girl?&quot;
&gt;Incog taps her thigh again, and a surprised rat grabs his hair and pulls it up to look her in the face.
&gt;&quot;Wiley, trickery! You have supplies, you come here for best friend&#039;s wedding, true intent, yes?&quot;
&gt;He seems unphased, smiling up at her.
&gt;&quot;Got it in one, my little witch. I couldn&#039;t miss him getting a war-wife! Ain&#039;t I just a sweetie?&quot;
&gt;She squirms again, squeezing his tree trunk of a neck between her thighs before hugging his head.
&gt;&quot;Yes, yes! Sweetest war-husband rat could want, will be good broodfather, yes!&quot;
&gt;Viera noticably wrinkles her nose.
&quot;Incognito will be mine, ma&#039;am.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Excellent! And you, Viera?&quot;
&gt;This might be a hard sell, since most of the other anthro races despised the rat-folk.
&gt;They smelled, practiced weird and (some thought) disgusting magic, and didn&#039;t act like &quot;proper anthros&quot; should.
&gt;Few people saw them as anything more than vermin, except for Incog.
&gt;But if she was good enough for him, she was good enough for you.
&gt;Viera frowns and picks up the rat with one hand, bringing her up face-to-face.
&gt;You notice several strings of...fluids trailing from Incog&#039;s neck, and you can now smell what Viera was wrinkling her nose at.
&gt;As Sepsis babbles quickly at Viera, you lean over to whisper to your best bro.
&quot;Dude, thanks a ton.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t mention it, Anon, I wouldn&#039;t miss this for the world!&quot;
&gt;You motion your head to his neck.
&quot;How do you deal with that, though? Is that normal?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh she&#039;s just excitable. You get used to it. It&#039;s actually comforting for me at this point.&quot;
&quot;...Right. I&#039;m sorry I missed yours, Incog, but I couldn&#039;t get out of the academy. The headmistress would have literally killed me had I been caught.&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s alright man, I&#039;ve heard the stories. Wouldn&#039;t want you to risk your blood turning to lava to see my ceremony. Just promise to visit me and my girl when get out, yeah?&quot;
&quot;Definitely.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I agree, ma&#039;am,&quot; Viera announces. 
&gt;As soon as Sepsis is down next to her on the floor, she unfolds her staff into a tall, spindly thing. At the end is a thin circlet of spikes and strips of linen covered in green runes hanging from it, surrounding a rock of green that floats in the center emitting a green light.
&gt;The woman positions the four of you in front of the table, Incog behind you and Sepsis behind Viera.
&gt;Each of them are given a steel ring, inscribed with tiny glowing runes both inside and out.
&gt;She takes a deep breath and looks at you with a determined, offical face.
&gt;Well here it is, Anon, the big moment.
&gt;Did it just get quieter in here?
&gt;You think you can hear your heart beating in your ears.
&gt;&quot;Do you, Staff Sergeant Anonymous, swear to serve, with honor and distinction, and for no less than fifteen years, the American Republic?&quot;
&quot;I do.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Do you swear to uphold the edicts of the Fae Accord, to offer yourself as Tribute to the Representative of the Tribes of the Frozen North, Viera Denbreaker?&quot;
&quot;I swear.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Do you swear to follow her home, wherever that may be, after being honorably discharged from service, to sire her children, and live as a good mate should?&quot;
&quot;I swear.&quot;
&gt;Do you swear to remain faithful to your War-Wife, forsaking all others, for the rest of your natural life, until death takes you?&quot;
&quot;I swear.&quot;
&gt;She nods and turns up to Viera, who&#039;s been towering in silence this entire time.
&gt;&quot;Do you, Staff Sergeant Viera, swear to serve, with honor and distinction, and for no less than fifteen years, the American Republic?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I swear.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Do you swear to uphold the edicts of the Fae Accord, to accept this human male, Anonymous Aggot, as Tribute for the Representative of the Tribes of the Frozen North, Denbreaker Clan?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I swear.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Do you swear to take him home, wherever that may be, after being honorably discharged from service, to bear him children, and live as a good mate should?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I swear.&quot;
&gt;Do you swear to remain faithful to your War-Husband, forsaking all others, for the rest of your natural life, until death takes you?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I swear.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Present the rings.&quot;
&gt;Both Incog and Sepsis step forward, offering each of you the ring they carried.
&gt;You shakily take yours in your hand.
&gt;Viera presents her hand first, and you grip one of her huge digts in your free hand.
&gt;The ring slides on easy.
&gt;As soon as it hits the base, the runes shine a bright red.
&gt;Her soft, fluffy hand engulfs your own, and she almost has trouble fitting the tiny ring on your relatively tiny finger.
&gt;It glows a bright red for a moment as well.
&gt;A moment later, they switch to green, and tighten to fit snug around you both.
&gt;The woman is almost jumping in glee.
&gt;You swear you can see stars in her teary eyes.
&gt;&quot;By the power invested in me by the American Republic and the Fae Accord, I now pronounce you Man and Fae, Tribute offered and bound, husband and wife!&quot; she shouts.
&gt;Viera&#039;s smile is definitely predatory now.
&gt;She reaches down and picks you up with a hand underneath each arm, tilting her head slightly.
&gt;You purse your lips just in time to meet hers.
&gt;You close your eyes as she presses your body against her massive bust.
&gt;That&#039;s what they always did in the storybooks and movies, right?
&gt;She smells faintly of a campfire and evergreen trees.
&gt;The full, warm, black lips are soft against yours, but soon spread across your mouth.
&gt;Her largetongue forces its way inside for a moment
&gt;She tastes like berries and something salty.
&gt;You can feel her canines pressing through your lips.
&gt;You intially felt a little overwhelmed.
&gt;But this is nice....
&gt;No, this is perfect.
&gt;Her big fuzzy arms holding you close to her chest as she gives you the best (first, but who cares?) kiss of your life.
&gt;It&#039;s only when she pulls away do you hear the clapping and cheers of the others in the room.
&gt;&quot;Wew lad, wew lad! WEEEEW LADDY!&quot; Incog shouts next to you.
&gt;Sepsis is squeaking up a storm and sending little cantrips of green into the air.
&gt;You can&#039;t seem to look away from Veira&#039;s big blue eyes though.
&gt;Her grin got somehow more intense, and you feel the primal reaction your ancestors bred into you rising up, telling you that you should be scared, that you should flee.
&gt;She simply hefts you up and over her shoulder, bowing to the rest of the room&#039;s occupants.
&gt;When she stands back up you can feel her huge shoulder pressing into your gut.
&gt;&quot;We&#039;ll be in my bunk.&quot;
&gt;She walks to the door with you over her shoulder.
&gt;Incog grabs your staff and tucks it into one of her belt loops, then shakes your hand as Viera walks.
&gt;&quot;Congratulations, buddy, you did just fine!&quot;
&quot;Th-ha-hanks!&quot; you reply. 
&gt;Viera&#039;s stride forces out a little too much air with each step.
&gt;Sepsis scrambles up the side of him, returning to her perch on his shoulders.
&gt;Her ratty (heh) and heavy jacket, one of the only articles of actual clothing she bothered to wear, is zipped open by the time she reaches it.
&gt;&quot;Sweet, yes! Yes! So sweet! Sweeter than sloshbasin after weekend!&quot; she almost moans, rubbing her open chest against Incog&#039;s short-cut hair.
&gt;&quot;You honor Sepsis with witness for wedding! Never before has rat been witness, first of her swarm! First, yes! Bring him close, husband, close!&quot;
&gt;Incog hurries up a little and pulls your hand up to her.
&gt;She stops rubbing him long enough to pull out a long pin out of somewhere in her jacket, a glowing green rock on the back end of it.
&gt;She quickly stabs it into the back of your hand, and in an instant you see your own blood swirl up the metal, the gem turning a deep red from drinking deep.
&quot;Fuck! What was that for?&quot;
&gt;You just as quickly pull away your hand, inspecting the back of it.
&gt;Did she really just injure you before you were gonna finally lose your magecard?
&gt;V-card, you mean. Your v-card.
&gt;&quot;Honored friend of Underswarm, yes! Sepsis mark you, yes, make you friend to all Underswarm! Draw blood in deep dark, we find, help!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry about it, Anon, it&#039;s a blessing, not a curse,&quot; Incog offers, &quot;It got me out of plenty of situations before.&quot;
&quot;Is..this really...the time?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Better take it while she&#039;s offering, it&#039;s no small thing Anon.&quot;
&gt;You notice you hand hasn&#039;t actually started to bleed.
&gt;You sigh.
&gt;The things you do for your bro.
&quot;F-fine, thank you Sepsis. I&#039;ll keep that in mind!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Here, you take, yes, take all!&quot;
&gt;She reaches into the opposite side of her jacket and produces a small linen bag (where did she even find linen?) stitched together and lightly clinking.
&gt;You grip it in one of your free hands, careful not to drop it.
&gt;&quot;Need, yes, need! Bears take forever, in bunk quite long! Remember, pink for mating, orange for panic, understand?&quot;
&gt;Oh shit.
&gt;Did she just give you a bag with panic vials in it?
&gt;You grip the end as tight as you can, right before Viera swings you as she turns a corner.
&gt;Wouldn&#039;t want to melt this section of the base from a fumble.
&gt;Those were expensive as hell, and mages valued them almost as much as their staff.
&gt;Rats could make their own, though.
&gt;Their methods were very &quot;unconventional,&quot; but they worked.
&gt;You suppressed a shudder at the thought.
&gt;Which you seemed to be doing a lot around Sepsis.
&gt;Who was now openly rubbing and squeezing one of her breasts with one hand and hooking the fingers of another into Incog&#039;s mouth.
&gt;Viera pays the two of them no mind, clearing the way through the halls with her very size.
&gt;Various anthros swivel to press their backs against the walls, offering a high-five or a fist-bump to the bear as she passes.
&gt;They give you the finger-guns, a wink and smile, or both.
&gt;&quot;Pink gives mating power!&quot; Sepsis&#039; voice lowers and growls out a few of her words, &quot;Ssstaminaa~ Sepsis gets so ~wet~ thinking about it!&quot;
&gt;You give her the best &quot;wait, what?&quot; you can manage from the shoulder of your war-wife.
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t freak out, Anon, it won&#039;t counter the anthrovax, you&#039;re in the clear,&quot; Incog says before letting go of your hand. 
&gt;The little fingers in his mouth don&#039;t even slow him down as he speaks...
&gt;Just how normal was this for him?
&gt;He continues regardless. &quot;And just a few tips before death by snu-snu. One: hydrate, hydrate, hydrate! Grab a couple bottles of water and keep them on-hand! Two: lift with your legs, not your back. Three: It isn&#039;t over until the, er...big lady sings! There&#039;s gotta be a dozen pink vials in there, so just keep crushing them in your hand until she&#039;s satisfied! Don&#039;t mix them up with the orange! Four: Hydrate again. Five: If it lasts for more than four hours, find a shrine and thank the Wild Gods of the Fae! Five--&quot;
&gt;Viera whirls around and you see the door to her bunk room.
&gt;Your head comes within inches of the wall.
&gt;&quot;If you&#039;ll excuse us, we have business to attend to.&quot;
&gt;She sounds annoyed, you think.
&gt;Incog chuckles behind you.
&gt;&quot;Well look at the time, so do we!&quot;
&gt;His voice fades as he presumably runs off.
&gt;&quot;Have fun you two, don&#039;t do anything I wouldn&#039;t do~!&quot;

Chapter 3

&gt;The door of her room sounds especially heavy. 
&gt;From your vantage point on her shoulder, you can scan the whole place when she turns around. 
&gt;It&#039;s rather spartan, with little in the way of personal effects. 
&gt;Just her massive bed, a footlocker at the end of it, and various bits of gear either on the large table or set against walls. 
&gt;Her combat armor hangs from a rack across from her bed, and next to it sits an intricately-carved massive warhammer. 
&gt;The rod has to be as thick as your arm, and you&#039;re pretty sure the spike on one side could go all the way through your torso. 
&gt;Damn, she must be even stronger than you thought.
&gt;She leaned forward and set you on her bed. 
&gt;&quot;Get those clothes off.&quot;
&quot;R-right.&quot;
&gt;You nod and comply, eagerly unbuttoning your uniform top. 
&gt;She sets your staff against the wall next to her hammer before doing the same, and the fabric of her shirt struggles around her bust, revealing the biggest bra you&#039;ve ever seen. 
&gt;It&#039;s baby-blue with little darker-blue dots across it. 
&gt;Say what you want about soulless bureaucrats, but they delivered on every one of the requests you put on your questionnaire. 
&gt;Strong. 
&gt;Kind.
&gt;Hot. 
&gt;You honestly didn&#039;t know how she looked to other anthros, but she definitely gets you going. 
&gt;you&#039;ve yet to see how well they matched up with the personality questions, but she doesn&#039;t seem mean or anything. 
&gt;Her panties come off on her way to the light switch and she throws them on top of the pile of your own clothes on the floor. 
&gt;She hesitates for a second when she sees just how hard you at at the sight of her, then the light goes out.
&gt;The only thing you can see glimmers of is the light from her ring flickering about when she moves her hands. 
&gt;The next thing you can feel is her pressing down on the bed on either side of you, her giant furry knees sinking in around your legs.
&gt;Luckily her bed handles the weight enough that you&#039;re not smothered beneath her. 
&gt;One of her huge furry hands--paws, rests on you chest, and the other next to your head on the mattress. 
&gt;She lets loose a long sigh, relaxing on top of you. 
&gt;You&#039;re trying your hardest not to hyperventilate. 
&gt;The fuzzy paw trails her claws down your body while she waddles up on her knees, and you feel yourself rub against something warm and wet. 
&gt;A moment later and you enter her. 
&gt;None of the rumors you had heard about scale and the impossibility of the task had been true.
&gt;It definitely didn&#039;t feel loose, and she seemed to be enjoying it too. 
&gt;She releases a half-growl, half-sigh, totally drowning out your own sharp inhale. 
&gt;You tense your legs as hard as you can, trying your best to remember all of the tips and tricks passed on to you by the non-virgin students on how not to be a two-pump chump. 
&gt;Her knees and hips start moving, pumping you in and out of her slowly. 
&gt;It&#039;s heaven. 
&gt;All of the effort has been worth it. 
&gt;All for this moment. 
&gt;You try your damnedest to keep four years worth of semen from making a glopping noise as it flows. 
&gt;You need to make a good impression here. 
&gt;The smell of sweat, pine, and sex fill the room, and you think you&#039;re doing pretty well. 
&gt;Your hands swim through her thick fur and find her massive chest in the dark and discover that she&#039;s still wearing her bra. 
&gt;She guides them back to her hips and leans forward, pressing your body against hers. 
&gt;Her wet nose stops next to your ear, moving up and down with the rest of her. 
&gt;The wet tongue against your cheek and lustful sigh right into your ear send you over the edge. 
&gt;You tap her legs just like you practiced in your head. 
&gt;She immediately understands and clenches her thighs around you, letting her weight lock the two of you together. 
&gt;One of her giant arms wraps around you and you find your face pressed against her chest. 
&gt;Huh...it doesn&#039;t really make any kind of sound at all. 
&gt;Your novels must have lied to you. 
&gt;Also the straps on the bra kinda hurt against your chin. 
&gt;It ends just as suddenly as it began. 

&gt;A second or two after you finish, she drops you back onto the bed and stands up. 
&gt;At least you think she does, all you can really see is the fading glow of the ring on her finger. 
&gt;&quot;You should get dressed so we can head to the training grounds.&quot;
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; you nod, still coming down from the high of your very first time. 
&gt;Your head is still swimming, so it&#039;s hard to roll off the bed. 
&gt;When she flicks the light back on she&#039;s already wearing her pants, and the bra that never came off. 
&gt;You don&#039;t know what was supposed to happen in the real world after your first time, but it seems she has more experience or knowledge in this than you do. 
&gt;You only have your silly stories about human men with anthro women that you found either in the old libraries or traded on the intranets. 
&gt;A strong warrior like her must be all about business. 
&gt;No time for cuddling like you wanted. 
&gt;Not that you&#039;d admit such a thing. 
&gt;You bunch up your clothes and head to the shower. 
&gt;&quot;Skip the shower. I don&#039;t want my scent to wash off you today.&quot;
&gt;Well, your clothes are all wrinkly and you smell like bear and sex. 
&gt;But it was your wedding day today, and everyone will notice a new mage on the grounds. 
&gt;Yeah. 
&gt;Yeah, you&#039;ll wear it like a badge. 

&gt;The walk to the training grounds is similar to the one leading to her quarters. 
&gt;This time you get to walk next to her though. 
&gt;Men that pass by give you a knowing smirk and a high-five. 
&gt;Anthros do the same for Viera, but the way she smiles and hesitates each time makes you think she&#039;s nervous. 
&gt;You feel a big hand slap against your ass when an equine passes by, gripping it for a second and giggling. 
&gt;You let out what is definitely a masculine sound of surprise. 
&gt;It&#039;s not the first time someone&#039;s done that to you, but it&#039;s definitely the first time it&#039;s been outside the locker room at the academy, and a woman at that. 
&gt;The loud scraping and scuffling of hooves on a smooth floor accompany the white furry tree trunk swinging over your head. 
&gt;&quot;Do you smell that?&quot; Viera asks the horse head pressed against her chest from the crook in her arm. 
&gt;She flexes it slightly and the equine woman scrabbles at the bear&#039;s forearm when her nose is pushed up and against her sweaty fur. 
&gt;&quot;Yes, I smell it,&quot; the horse chokes out. 
&gt;&quot;This is my scent. This marks what is mine. Understand?&quot;
&gt;&quot;P-p-perfectly.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Good.&quot;
&gt;Viera releases her, pushing her with one hand by the chest back to standing up. 
&gt;She narrows her eyes at the equine as she scampers off, then grabs you by the shoulder and presses you against her side. 
&quot;You didn&#039;t have to freak out, Viera,&quot; you say with your cheek pressed on her uniform, &quot;I&#039;m not going to cheat on you.&quot;
&gt;&quot;The act was necessary, to set an example not to tempt the mates of the Denbreaker Clan.&quot;
&quot;Do you...do you not trust me?&quot;
&gt;&quot;We will see, War-Husband, we will see. A quick grope is hardly a test of character.&quot;
&gt;She looks down at you with a raised eyebrow and tightens her grip. 
&gt;&quot;But I do not distrust you, I owe you that much for taking the vow.&quot;
You smile to yourself and let her lead you through the facility. 
&quot;Good enough.&quot;
