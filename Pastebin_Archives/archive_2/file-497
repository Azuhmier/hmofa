            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">							The HEAT (The Purge /hmofa/ Parody)</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including rape, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">There it was. The moment you had been dreading for the last month. A single sentence, heralding the beginning of the purge. A radical movement, enacted as a method to provide honest, law-abiding citizens with an outlet for their baser urges, the Purge had been lauded as the catalyst for the economic recovery of the United States. As the claxon wail ebbed and flowed, you gripped your axe closer to your body, and stared at the door. If your past experiences had been anything to go on, the next 12 hours would be tense and harrowing, but not necessarily life threatening. As long as you could avoid any unnecessary confrontation, avoid any interaction with anyone at all, really, you could get through the night unmolested. At least, in theory. That was how things had worked back in your hometown. You had gathered together with neighborhood families, humans and anthros alike, and made a little bunker to wait out the nights in the past. But things had changed. You’d grown up, and looking for new opportunities, you’d come to the city as an office clerk. This was your first purge after moving, and the newfound isolation did little to comfort you. So, you had taken a few extra steps. For one, there was no way you were going to wait out the night in your dingy little apartment. You weren’t keen on staying in a building when an extra set of keys could just fall into the wrong hands. The landlady was sweet dog, literally, but had a nasty habit of leaving her office unlocked. Meaning that your entire apartment complex was basically a deathtrap. Not that it would have been the best place to hole up otherwise. The walls were paper thin, and in the dead of the night, you were certain that some purgers would hear your heart hammering against your ribcage. So, a few weeks ago, you’d taken some supplies, and began searching for a hideout. Back home, you’d have brought company with you, but here…well, it wasn’t the same. Maybe it was your upbringing, but you didn’t quite connect with the city folk too well. You liked your co-workers well enough, but nothing really seemed to click. Everyone in the office seemed to belong to some group or another, and in the short time you’d been there, you hadn’t yet found your place. Or maybe it was just a new hire hazing thing. After all, you’d seen your boss shoot you a strange look out of the corner of her eye every so often, and you could swear you had heard the shorthair in the next cubicle purring once. You didn’t even know they could do that. The ways of the city were still strange to you, and when it came down to it, you didn’t really trust them enough to band together. Which is how you came to rest in your new hideout. Okay, hideout was a bit too strong of a word. It was basically the top floor of a shipping warehouse. In the manager’s office. Sure, it wasn’t some underground bunker, but was a US postal storage center really going to attract some reveling purgers? Sometimes it paid to be bland. And baby, this post office was blander than a manila envelope. Of course, you hadn’t quite expected it to get this dark. The managers office lacked a window, and you didn’t dare turn on a light. So, you set up shop in a corner, surrounded by darkness, and as many bottles of water you felt you could carry. And cans of red bull. Because you are going to live, god damn it. You wouldn’t dare brew coffee, but you needed a stimulant, and the only anti-sleeping pill you had found was prescription only. So you held your only weapon, your axe, close, and downed your first redbull, as the din of the purge slowly began to make itself known.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Who knew time could move so slowly? The small watch you had with you claimed that only an hour had passed, but you could have sworn that you’d been staring at the door for almost a day. The dread and silence were clearly starting to take their toll. The darkness around you was suffocating, and if the weight of the day hadn’t turned your body to lead, you would have run from the room in restlessness. As it was, all you could do was sit there and think. Think about your soul-crushing situation. Think about how you kind of liked doing clerical work, even if you didn’t imagine doing it the rest of your life. Think about how you had effectively trapped yourself in a room with no escape route should you be discovered.  Maybe you should have thought about that earlier, you dipshit. Wiping the sleep from your eyes, and the sweat from your brow, you grope in the darkness, eventually reaching your stockpile of water bottles. Raising it to your lips, you hear something that cuts through the dark like a needle through water. Behind the faint thrum of anarchy that  beats against the bleary walls, behind the revelry that assuredly permeates the outside world a single sound races across your spine, and makes your heart jump into your mouth. A feminine voice, calling your name.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Anon?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">__________________________________________________</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Every muscle in your body freezes, and you strain your ears against the silence. You’re certain you heard your name, and, unique as it was, you know that the caller was looking for you. Crawling to the door, you press your ear against the gap between the frame and hinge, sweating beading on your brow. And then, you hear it again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Anon?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">That was definitely your name. Your mind races, and you desperately try to come up with a plan of action. You can’t quite recognize the voice, but sticking around to find out doesn’t sit well with you. Especially not tonight, of all nights. Creeping through the shadows, you crack open the door, and hazard a peek into the hallway. Still blanketed in dark, and still devoid of any life. Slipping through the doorway, you skulk down the hall, trying your best to determine the best way through the building. Doing your best to control your breathing, you try and assess the situation. Your pursuer didn’t know where you were, or they wouldn’t be calling your name. You knew they were within earshot, so they were close. You’d wager they were probably already in the building. Reaching the end of the hall, you crouch down and peek around the corner before you. The empty hall almost taunts you, and the temptation to bolt down the corridor is near overwhelming. Leaning against the wall for support, you shudder as you feel a bead of sweat glide down the small of your back. All at once you’re aware that you’re once dry clothing has been mottled with sweat. Your hands are clammy, and every hair on your neck seems to dance. Choking down a breath, you swing your head around looking for anything to save. You can feel the tears behind your eyes, and as you raise your head to blink them away, a thought hits you. There was a fire escape just a short distance away. If you could reach it, you could avoid having to escape through the first floor, and hopefully avoid your assailant altogether. Sure, the alarms going off would be a dead giveaway, but each floor had multiple fire exits. There was no way a single person could possibly check every exit. And after all, you had only heard a single voice. What were the odds that there multiple people chasing you, specifically? They had to be low, right? Clenching your teeth, you hustle towards the fire exit. It was just a few corridors down, close enough to give you hope, but just far enough to terrify you. Every stray noise sent your heart racing. The rustling of paper on bulletin boards set your hair on end. The scuffing of your sneakers on the floor made your skin crawl. And the sound of a can opening nearly made you cry.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">For what feels like hours, you don’t move. You don’t dare to move. You’re too afraid to even close your eyes. At this time of night, in this empty building, the refreshing sound of a cold soft drink sounded more like a church bell. You can’t even tell where it came from, the sound was so intense. You’re trembling now. You can barely hold your axe with one hand. Choking back a sob, you turn your head, Hoping against hope that you had just gone crazy. Relief floods through your body, as the hallway behind you is as empty as it was moments ago. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And then she steps around the corner.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">For a moment, you can appreciate her figure. Lithe and elegant, with a grace that seemed ethereal, the Lynx steps forward. Soft gray fur, speckled with darker shades, frames her head and neck. It disappears down into dark green hoodie and a pair of jeans that hug and accentuate her curvy figure. Sprouting from just above her pert buttocks, her plush, short tail follows the sway of her hips. She’s got a figure to die for, the irony of which is not lost on you. Your eyes meet hers at the same time, and the red bull she’s nursing (Your red bull, a small part of you protests) disappears behind her. Your coworker, Tawna, a fellow bean counter, has found her prey. Her face lights up with a smile, and her eyes fill with a rare mania as all of a sudden she’s dashing toward you. Her outstretched paws and burning smile express more than any word could say. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">‘I’ve found you’</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her eyes are entirely on yours, though, and the latent caveman in you realizes that. Part of you regrets the action you’re about to perform, but another part is too afraid to do anything else. You bring your hands forward, and the look of inflamed passion in her eyes is replaced by one of sudden horror as she recognizes your axe. She brings her hands to block her face, but now it’s too late. With more than a twinge of regret, you pull the trigger. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Literally.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1"> The misty payload streams forth from the can of body spray. The bane of high school locker rooms everywhere, you’re well aware of the discomfort the deodorant brings to the blunt human nose. You can only imagine the effects on the sensitive organ of the hunter before you. Unfortunately, she doesn’t have to imagine. Twisting your body, the lynx sails past you skidding to a stop some feet away. Writhing on the floor, she beats at her nose and eyes, mewling and moaning. The effects of Dark Temptation are indeed potent, but you know that the hunter will soon recover. Catching your breath, you turn tail and charge down the hallway. There are multiple fire exits on this floor, and you’re determined to put some distance between the two of you before you pull the alarm. You’re focusing on navigating the dark corridor, so you’re shocked when a soft, warm body torpedoes your own from behind. You both clatter to the ground, a tangled mess of fur, cloth and limbs. You try to raise your axe, but a surprisingly strong leg smacks it out of your hand, and it clatters down the hall, out of reach. You struggle as hard as you can, but the furry fighter soon has you pinned. With your back against the floor, and your arms above your head, you look up to the newcomer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">And find your bunny boss’s face grinning back at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Hi Anon. Fancy meeting you here.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She’s panting hard, but whether it’s from exertion or something else entirely, you’re not sure. She’s smaller than you, but straddling your chest, and you can’t get the leverage to throw her off. With her arms holding yours down, you can see her breasts, twin orbs of fluff and fat, the tips of which barely rub against your chest. You’ve got a front row seat to the perfect art piece that is her cleavage, and you realize that she’s forgone the use of her bra. A button up shirt with the top 4 buttons undone is all that hid her tits. And if Tawna’s attitude was any indication, they wouldn’t be hidden for long.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">________________________________________________</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Down the hall, Tawna’s moans have crawled to a halt, and you hear her fumbling her way towards your prone form. Jana, the bunny pinning you to the ground, spares her a glance, then once again turns her gaze towards you. A diplomatic smile is plastered on her face, one that seemed to cry out that, yes, there was a perfectly good reason for why she was straddling you. But her eyes, darting back and forth from your face to your chest, and then further south, could not hide her intentions. Catching your gaze, she smirks, and brings her twitching nose against your neck. Despite your struggling, the deceptively powerful bunny holds you steady as her nose traces your neck, from jaw to collar, and inhales. She moans as your scent fills her lungs, and you feel every shiver that runs down her spine.  She takes another, longer breath, and pulls her head back, her laviscious grin meeting your own trembling grimace. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Damn Anon. You really know how to get a girl’s motor going.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You’re about to squeak out a protest, and to late do you realize your folly. No sooner do you open your mouth than, with speed borne of either experience or opportunity, Jana’s open mouth meets yours. The rabbit’s tongue slides into your mouth, and wastes no time in it’s frantic assault. You groan, and try to gasp out a word of dissent, but your boss’s tongue meets yours at every juncture. She’s never been one to half-ass a job in the office, and she clearly brings her work home with her. In seconds, the pleasant taste of rosemary and basil fills your mouth, as the fervent dance slows to its conclusion, your own tongue now covered in foreign fluids. The rabbit lets out a moan of satisfaction, and the soft, velvety appendage relents, no longer painting your mouth with it’s taste. Rather, Jana seems content to keep your lips locked together, as her tongue returns to her own mouth, the broad tip lingering for a moment on your own before vanishing altogether. Jana holds the kiss for moment longer before letting you breathe again. Her head rises, and she again groans in clear pleasure. You can feel your face flushing, your mind still processing the savage exploration of your innocent orifice, and you squirm in embarrassment, and some measure of pride, as she grins down at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I’ve wanted to do that from the moment you walked into the office. Do you know how many times I’ve come imagining this moment?” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her face has started to flush, and her breath becomes labored. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Do you know how much I want this? How much I want you? Your perfect eyes, and your perfect chest, and your perfect, raw scent? You drive half the office crazy whenever you enter the room. Your perfect nose is too blunt. But mine isn’t. You’re like a walking, smiling, aphrodisiac. Oh gods, I want you bad.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her grip tightens on your hands, and her body starts to move. She’s not moving off your body, though, and she’s still rambling on above. She only has eyes for you, but her lower body has started grinding against yours. You sneak a glance at her legs, wrapped in a pantsuit, and you see them tense against your waist. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“And if it was just the scent, I could put up with it. I could just smile, and nod, and ride my bedpost into the ground at home. But no, you just had to be the full package, didn’t you? No one expected you to last this long, you know? Your resume was so bland, I genuinely thought you’d quit after a week or two. Marketing in the big city? This industry eats naïve boys like you, and spits out a jaded wretch. You were supposed to be token hire, something to parade around for HR, someone to tell the suits that we could play ball. But now look at you!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Something like pride has entered her voice, and you look back up to see a genuine smile in her eyes, the bestial lust hidden, though not entirely absent. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You know your shit, you can give a damn good presentation.

Seeing the sexy underdog become the sexy working man?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You meet her glowing praise with a look of confusion.

Tawna pads over to  your head, reaching down. She’s as silent as a whisper, both in movement and in voice, though the latter may be due to your efforts. Looking towards the rabbit atop you, as if for confirmation, Tawna begins to undress. The jeans slide down her grey legs, and your eyes can’t help but trace the path back up. Her strong legs, pillars of velvet muscle, flex and unwind as she steps out of the small pile of discarded clothing. She’s elected to keep her hoodie on though. Taking her cue from Jana, Tawna kneels by your head, facing you, then pins your arms between her thighs and calves. The velvet sensation of her fur, combined with the soft sensation of her thighs again makes your blood run, and you’re all too aware of how the curve of her perfect behind fills and molds around the palms of your hands. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Chuckling, Jana dismounts you, and moves down along our body.

She stares at the erect member, while a heated smile crosses her face. Above you, you hear Tawna give a slight gasp, and shift her weight. You can’t see her expression from this angle, but her unmoving head lets you know that she is just as transfixed by your exposed flesh as Jana is, if not more so. Jana Shakes her head, overcoming her stupor, and brings her head down to your crotch. You brace your body in anticipation, but rather than take you into her mouth, she instead slides her face along your shaft, her warm fuzzy cheek stimulating you every inch of the way down, until she rests her face against your shaft and balls. You can feel every hitch of her breath as she breathes in as potent of a scent you could provide, and your erection grows harder in response as she nuzzles her face against it. Jana is a short statured woman, as most rabbits you’ve met are, but her relative size is made apparent as you realize that your dick lays easily lies on her face, obscuring part of her adorable visage, while your own head lays atop hers. You feel a cool, wet sensation, as she slips her perfect tongue out of her mouth, and runs it along the bas of your shaft. Your legs tense, and you let out a groan as the velvet appendage traces its way to the middle of you, when Jana pulls it back, and leaves a light kiss. You take a deep breath, as she repositions herself so that her outstretched arms are braced on your legs, and her soft mouth is held just above your cock. It jumps in time with your pulse, as you feel her hot breath bathe it in sensation, a percussion of joy striking in time with her panting. Her mouth is close now, and just as you’re about to cry out, her lips split, and welcome your tip into her velvet cavern. Your head soon follows, and one of your most sensitive areas is flooded by myriad sensations, the warm fluids that heighten your sense of touch, the soft walls that caress your head, the firm muscles that coaxes more of you through the opening. They’re sensations you’re not prepared for, and the frustration and fear you’ve experienced throughout the night melts away, replaced with shivering delight spreading from your stomach. You can’t contain the shuddering gasp that falls from your mouth. Her hands tighten on your thighs as her eyes meet yours. True to her word, infdifference is the furthest thing from her face. Between the prevalent lust and obvious pleasure, there’s also something that distinctly looks like mix adoration and gratitude. The moment passes, though, and soon she only has eyes for your uncovered length. Narrowing her eyes, her head slowly descends, her throat tightening around your dick, until you feel a pulsing cone of flesh halt your progress. You’ve reached the back of her throat, with a few inches of flesh left protruding from Jana’s mouth. Her chest is heaving now, and you realize that she must be having trouble breathing. Given the difference in size, forcing most of you into her mouth has limited her air supply. Still, the feeling of her mouth washing your cock is driving you to the edge of your stamina, and you speak up. You’re about to suggest she get some air when she retracts her head from your crotch, until only your head is still in her mouth. It’s still a mouthful for her, but it seems like she can catch her breath. You relax, and try to calm yourself down as best you can, when she acts without warning. Slamming her head forward, you choke on your own gasps as you feel your sensitive flesh collide with her pulsing walls. Here eyes are screwed up in concentration, and it looks like she’s managed to push her mouth further down than last time. Her throat lurches and heaves in response to it’s forcible violation, but she’s managing to suppress the most of it. What she doesn’t suppress worms its way around your flesh, amplifying her mouth’s already potent ministrations. Jana’s twisting her face against the pillar of flesh, smearing the few tears leaking from her eyes onto your skin, desperately trying to go lower. When it becomes clear that she can not, she instead rears back. You choke out a strangled warning about your limits, but when her tearstained eyes meet with yours, you see in them unimaginable arousal, and pride. You’re suddenly made aware of Tawna behind you, her hands dancing above her crotch. Jana has brought an audience with her. Much like in her work, she won’t rest until her subordinates are convinced of her competence. Wrapping her arms around your thighs, she lurches forward again, spearing her throat with your dick. The fleshy barrier in her throat relents at your battering ram-in-miniature, and you gasp as Jana’s mouth slides past her previous position, and her nose mashes against your skin. Your dick slides past the obstruction into a smooth velvet orifice that caresses and massages it as it comes to a rest. The sensations it leaves on your spit-stained flesh are too much, and you let loose a choking cry as you empty yourself down the bunny’s throat. The flesh walls shake and shiver as you fire, encouraging your cock to shoot more and more. Your hands clench around the firm thigh-flesh of your other captor, your legs tense, and your hips buck into the rabbit’s stuffed throat as some instinctual part of you tries desperately to seed your bosses red face. Panic flits across her face, and she tries to disentangle herself from your crotch. But her body betrays her. Her throat jumps and caresses your flesh, enough to coax out another shot of virility. Your legs tense once again, but this time, the bottoms of your feet find purchase on the tiled floor. When you buck your hips this time, you do so with the power of the building behind them, driving your hips off of the floor, and your dick once again down the unsuspecting rabbit’s throat. The fleshy cavern, already forced open before, envelopes your flesh once again, and you cry out as your seed is flung down the rabbit’s throat. Your hips fall back down, allowing a flailing Jana to pull the intruding organ from the depths of her throat. She falls back, falling on to her ass, as her chest heaves, bouncing her fluffy tits back and forth. She lets loose a few hacking coughs, as the red drains from her face. Above you, you feel Tawna tense up, and loose a few groaning mewls herself, her hands slowing to a crawl just out of sight. For a few moments, there’s just the sound of labored breathing, and a measured dripping sound as Jana recovers from her self induced throat-fucking. Tawna leans back, resting on her back and releasing your hands from their furred prison. Evidently, the girls are confident that you’re unwilling to leave after this display of passion, and you’re too tired to challenge that. Jana struggles to her feet and stalks toward you, the gentle smile on her face at odds with her tense movements. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Now then, let’s move on.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The words leave her mouth with a light slur. Maybe her throat needs a little bit longer to recover, you suggest. But her smile only broadens, and one hand moves to her smart pantsuit. The other moves up and tugs at her cheek.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Don’t worry about this hole. I’ve got two more we can use.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Tawna stiffens at this remark, and you’re about to comment on that when another voice cuts through the shadows behind you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Well, that hardly seems fair now, does it?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Spinning around you strain your eyes in the direction of the familiar voice. There’s a slight electrical hum, and suddenly the hallway is bathed in searing light as the light switch is thrown. As your eyes adjust to the new environment, you see the speaker at the end of the hallway. A large orange tiger, a head taller than Tawna, leans against the panel with the light switch. A pair of cute fluffed ears sat neatly on an otherwise gorgeous face. Every stripe seems to accentuate her best feature, whether it be her piercing yellow eyes, or striking pointed face. The curve of her neck flowed into her upper body like a river, with compact shoulders curving towards her waist and then to her hips. Her body was feminine in all the right places, with plush hips and full, nude breasts. But anyone could tell, just from watching her body move, she felt like liquid metal. Her muscles and sinews flowed as she approached you, elegant in her step, but sure in her approach, and in seconds she stood before you, a self assured smirk chiseled onto her features.</div></li></ol>        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">							The HEAT (The Purge /hmofa/ Parody)
&quot;Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including rape, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.&quot;
There it was. The moment you had been dreading for the last month. A single sentence, heralding the beginning of the purge. A radical movement, enacted as a method to provide honest, law-abiding citizens with an outlet for their baser urges, the Purge had been lauded as the catalyst for the economic recovery of the United States. As the claxon wail ebbed and flowed, you gripped your axe closer to your body, and stared at the door. If your past experiences had been anything to go on, the next 12 hours would be tense and harrowing, but not necessarily life threatening. As long as you could avoid any unnecessary confrontation, avoid any interaction with anyone at all, really, you could get through the night unmolested. At least, in theory. That was how things had worked back in your hometown. You had gathered together with neighborhood families, humans and anthros alike, and made a little bunker to wait out the nights in the past. But things had changed. You’d grown up, and looking for new opportunities, you’d come to the city as an office clerk. This was your first purge after moving, and the newfound isolation did little to comfort you. So, you had taken a few extra steps. For one, there was no way you were going to wait out the night in your dingy little apartment. You weren’t keen on staying in a building when an extra set of keys could just fall into the wrong hands. The landlady was sweet dog, literally, but had a nasty habit of leaving her office unlocked. Meaning that your entire apartment complex was basically a deathtrap. Not that it would have been the best place to hole up otherwise. The walls were paper thin, and in the dead of the night, you were certain that some purgers would hear your heart hammering against your ribcage. So, a few weeks ago, you’d taken some supplies, and began searching for a hideout. Back home, you’d have brought company with you, but here…well, it wasn’t the same. Maybe it was your upbringing, but you didn’t quite connect with the city folk too well. You liked your co-workers well enough, but nothing really seemed to click. Everyone in the office seemed to belong to some group or another, and in the short time you’d been there, you hadn’t yet found your place. Or maybe it was just a new hire hazing thing. After all, you’d seen your boss shoot you a strange look out of the corner of her eye every so often, and you could swear you had heard the shorthair in the next cubicle purring once. You didn’t even know they could do that. The ways of the city were still strange to you, and when it came down to it, you didn’t really trust them enough to band together. Which is how you came to rest in your new hideout. Okay, hideout was a bit too strong of a word. It was basically the top floor of a shipping warehouse. In the manager’s office. Sure, it wasn’t some underground bunker, but was a US postal storage center really going to attract some reveling purgers? Sometimes it paid to be bland. And baby, this post office was blander than a manila envelope. Of course, you hadn’t quite expected it to get this dark. The managers office lacked a window, and you didn’t dare turn on a light. So, you set up shop in a corner, surrounded by darkness, and as many bottles of water you felt you could carry. And cans of red bull. Because you are going to live, god damn it. You wouldn’t dare brew coffee, but you needed a stimulant, and the only anti-sleeping pill you had found was prescription only. So you held your only weapon, your axe, close, and downed your first redbull, as the din of the purge slowly began to make itself known.
…
Who knew time could move so slowly? The small watch you had with you claimed that only an hour had passed, but you could have sworn that you’d been staring at the door for almost a day. The dread and silence were clearly starting to take their toll. The darkness around you was suffocating, and if the weight of the day hadn’t turned your body to lead, you would have run from the room in restlessness. As it was, all you could do was sit there and think. Think about your soul-crushing situation. Think about how you kind of liked doing clerical work, even if you didn’t imagine doing it the rest of your life. Think about how you had effectively trapped yourself in a room with no escape route should you be discovered.  Maybe you should have thought about that earlier, you dipshit. Wiping the sleep from your eyes, and the sweat from your brow, you grope in the darkness, eventually reaching your stockpile of water bottles. Raising it to your lips, you hear something that cuts through the dark like a needle through water. Behind the faint thrum of anarchy that  beats against the bleary walls, behind the revelry that assuredly permeates the outside world a single sound races across your spine, and makes your heart jump into your mouth. A feminine voice, calling your name.

“Anon?”
__________________________________________________
Every muscle in your body freezes, and you strain your ears against the silence. You’re certain you heard your name, and, unique as it was, you know that the caller was looking for you. Crawling to the door, you press your ear against the gap between the frame and hinge, sweating beading on your brow. And then, you hear it again.

“Anon?”

That was definitely your name. Your mind races, and you desperately try to come up with a plan of action. You can’t quite recognize the voice, but sticking around to find out doesn’t sit well with you. Especially not tonight, of all nights. Creeping through the shadows, you crack open the door, and hazard a peek into the hallway. Still blanketed in dark, and still devoid of any life. Slipping through the doorway, you skulk down the hall, trying your best to determine the best way through the building. Doing your best to control your breathing, you try and assess the situation. Your pursuer didn’t know where you were, or they wouldn’t be calling your name. You knew they were within earshot, so they were close. You’d wager they were probably already in the building. Reaching the end of the hall, you crouch down and peek around the corner before you. The empty hall almost taunts you, and the temptation to bolt down the corridor is near overwhelming. Leaning against the wall for support, you shudder as you feel a bead of sweat glide down the small of your back. All at once you’re aware that you’re once dry clothing has been mottled with sweat. Your hands are clammy, and every hair on your neck seems to dance. Choking down a breath, you swing your head around looking for anything to save. You can feel the tears behind your eyes, and as you raise your head to blink them away, a thought hits you. There was a fire escape just a short distance away. If you could reach it, you could avoid having to escape through the first floor, and hopefully avoid your assailant altogether. Sure, the alarms going off would be a dead giveaway, but each floor had multiple fire exits. There was no way a single person could possibly check every exit. And after all, you had only heard a single voice. What were the odds that there multiple people chasing you, specifically? They had to be low, right? Clenching your teeth, you hustle towards the fire exit. It was just a few corridors down, close enough to give you hope, but just far enough to terrify you. Every stray noise sent your heart racing. The rustling of paper on bulletin boards set your hair on end. The scuffing of your sneakers on the floor made your skin crawl. And the sound of a can opening nearly made you cry.
…
For what feels like hours, you don’t move. You don’t dare to move. You’re too afraid to even close your eyes. At this time of night, in this empty building, the refreshing sound of a cold soft drink sounded more like a church bell. You can’t even tell where it came from, the sound was so intense. You’re trembling now. You can barely hold your axe with one hand. Choking back a sob, you turn your head, Hoping against hope that you had just gone crazy. Relief floods through your body, as the hallway behind you is as empty as it was moments ago. 
And then she steps around the corner.
For a moment, you can appreciate her figure. Lithe and elegant, with a grace that seemed ethereal, the Lynx steps forward. Soft gray fur, speckled with darker shades, frames her head and neck. It disappears down into dark green hoodie and a pair of jeans that hug and accentuate her curvy figure. Sprouting from just above her pert buttocks, her plush, short tail follows the sway of her hips. She’s got a figure to die for, the irony of which is not lost on you. Your eyes meet hers at the same time, and the red bull she’s nursing (Your red bull, a small part of you protests) disappears behind her. Your coworker, Tawna, a fellow bean counter, has found her prey. Her face lights up with a smile, and her eyes fill with a rare mania as all of a sudden she’s dashing toward you. Her outstretched paws and burning smile express more than any word could say. 
‘I’ve found you’
Her eyes are entirely on yours, though, and the latent caveman in you realizes that. Part of you regrets the action you’re about to perform, but another part is too afraid to do anything else. You bring your hands forward, and the look of inflamed passion in her eyes is replaced by one of sudden horror as she recognizes your axe. She brings her hands to block her face, but now it’s too late. With more than a twinge of regret, you pull the trigger. 

Literally.

 The misty payload streams forth from the can of body spray. The bane of high school locker rooms everywhere, you’re well aware of the discomfort the deodorant brings to the blunt human nose. You can only imagine the effects on the sensitive organ of the hunter before you. Unfortunately, she doesn’t have to imagine. Twisting your body, the lynx sails past you skidding to a stop some feet away. Writhing on the floor, she beats at her nose and eyes, mewling and moaning. The effects of Dark Temptation are indeed potent, but you know that the hunter will soon recover. Catching your breath, you turn tail and charge down the hallway. There are multiple fire exits on this floor, and you’re determined to put some distance between the two of you before you pull the alarm. You’re focusing on navigating the dark corridor, so you’re shocked when a soft, warm body torpedoes your own from behind. You both clatter to the ground, a tangled mess of fur, cloth and limbs. You try to raise your axe, but a surprisingly strong leg smacks it out of your hand, and it clatters down the hall, out of reach. You struggle as hard as you can, but the furry fighter soon has you pinned. With your back against the floor, and your arms above your head, you look up to the newcomer.

And find your bunny boss’s face grinning back at you.

“Hi Anon. Fancy meeting you here.”

She’s panting hard, but whether it’s from exertion or something else entirely, you’re not sure. She’s smaller than you, but straddling your chest, and you can’t get the leverage to throw her off. With her arms holding yours down, you can see her breasts, twin orbs of fluff and fat, the tips of which barely rub against your chest. You’ve got a front row seat to the perfect art piece that is her cleavage, and you realize that she’s forgone the use of her bra. A button up shirt with the top 4 buttons undone is all that hid her tits. And if Tawna’s attitude was any indication, they wouldn’t be hidden for long.
________________________________________________

Down the hall, Tawna’s moans have crawled to a halt, and you hear her fumbling her way towards your prone form. Jana, the bunny pinning you to the ground, spares her a glance, then once again turns her gaze towards you. A diplomatic smile is plastered on her face, one that seemed to cry out that, yes, there was a perfectly good reason for why she was straddling you. But her eyes, darting back and forth from your face to your chest, and then further south, could not hide her intentions. Catching your gaze, she smirks, and brings her twitching nose against your neck. Despite your struggling, the deceptively powerful bunny holds you steady as her nose traces your neck, from jaw to collar, and inhales. She moans as your scent fills her lungs, and you feel every shiver that runs down her spine.  She takes another, longer breath, and pulls her head back, her laviscious grin meeting your own trembling grimace. 

“Damn Anon. You really know how to get a girl’s motor going.” 

You’re about to squeak out a protest, and to late do you realize your folly. No sooner do you open your mouth than, with speed borne of either experience or opportunity, Jana’s open mouth meets yours. The rabbit’s tongue slides into your mouth, and wastes no time in it’s frantic assault. You groan, and try to gasp out a word of dissent, but your boss’s tongue meets yours at every juncture. She’s never been one to half-ass a job in the office, and she clearly brings her work home with her. In seconds, the pleasant taste of rosemary and basil fills your mouth, as the fervent dance slows to its conclusion, your own tongue now covered in foreign fluids. The rabbit lets out a moan of satisfaction, and the soft, velvety appendage relents, no longer painting your mouth with it’s taste. Rather, Jana seems content to keep your lips locked together, as her tongue returns to her own mouth, the broad tip lingering for a moment on your own before vanishing altogether. Jana holds the kiss for moment longer before letting you breathe again. Her head rises, and she again groans in clear pleasure. You can feel your face flushing, your mind still processing the savage exploration of your innocent orifice, and you squirm in embarrassment, and some measure of pride, as she grins down at you.

“I’ve wanted to do that from the moment you walked into the office. Do you know how many times I’ve come imagining this moment?” 

Her face has started to flush, and her breath becomes labored. 

“Do you know how much I want this? How much I want you? Your perfect eyes, and your perfect chest, and your perfect, raw scent? You drive half the office crazy whenever you enter the room. Your perfect nose is too blunt. But mine isn’t. You’re like a walking, smiling, aphrodisiac. Oh gods, I want you bad.”

Her grip tightens on your hands, and her body starts to move. She’s not moving off your body, though, and she’s still rambling on above. She only has eyes for you, but her lower body has started grinding against yours. You sneak a glance at her legs, wrapped in a pantsuit, and you see them tense against your waist. 

“And if it was just the scent, I could put up with it. I could just smile, and nod, and ride my bedpost into the ground at home. But no, you just had to be the full package, didn’t you? No one expected you to last this long, you know? Your resume was so bland, I genuinely thought you’d quit after a week or two. Marketing in the big city? This industry eats naïve boys like you, and spits out a jaded wretch. You were supposed to be token hire, something to parade around for HR, someone to tell the suits that we could play ball. But now look at you!”

Something like pride has entered her voice, and you look back up to see a genuine smile in her eyes, the bestial lust hidden, though not entirely absent. 

“You know your shit, you can give a damn good presentation. You’ve saved your coworkers careers more times than I can count, and you’ve helped me look damn good. You haven’t just grown, Anon. You’ve flourished. Do you know how fucking hot that is? Seeing the sexy underdog become the sexy working man?”

You meet her glowing praise with a look of confusion. You could’ve sworn that she was, at best, indifferent towards you. But she only snickers in response.

“A man is still a man, no matter the species, eh, Tawna?”

You see a sharp silhouette loom behind the bunny, then nod. Tawna pads over to  your head, reaching down. She’s as silent as a whisper, both in movement and in voice, though the latter may be due to your efforts. Looking towards the rabbit atop you, as if for confirmation, Tawna begins to undress. The jeans slide down her grey legs, and your eyes can’t help but trace the path back up. Her strong legs, pillars of velvet muscle, flex and unwind as she steps out of the small pile of discarded clothing. She’s elected to keep her hoodie on though. Taking her cue from Jana, Tawna kneels by your head, facing you, then pins your arms between her thighs and calves. The velvet sensation of her fur, combined with the soft sensation of her thighs again makes your blood run, and you’re all too aware of how the curve of her perfect behind fills and molds around the palms of your hands. 

Chuckling, Jana dismounts you, and moves down along our body. With the slight weight gone from your midsection, you’re confronted with an uncomfortable fact. You’ve been tenting your pants Ever since your boss mounted you. Jana shoots you a grin, and starts to undo your pants.

“What part of this looks like indifference to you?”
___________________________________________
Jana’s crouched over your dick now, and as she pulls her hands away, your cock springs out from its cloth constraints, standing proud in the cool night air. She stares at the erect member, while a heated smile crosses her face. Above you, you hear Tawna give a slight gasp, and shift her weight. You can’t see her expression from this angle, but her unmoving head lets you know that she is just as transfixed by your exposed flesh as Jana is, if not more so. Jana Shakes her head, overcoming her stupor, and brings her head down to your crotch. You brace your body in anticipation, but rather than take you into her mouth, she instead slides her face along your shaft, her warm fuzzy cheek stimulating you every inch of the way down, until she rests her face against your shaft and balls. You can feel every hitch of her breath as she breathes in as potent of a scent you could provide, and your erection grows harder in response as she nuzzles her face against it.

It jumps in time with your pulse, as you feel her hot breath bathe it in sensation, a percussion of joy striking in time with her panting. Her mouth is close now, and just as you’re about to cry out, her lips split, and welcome your tip into her velvet cavern. Your head soon follows, and one of your most sensitive areas is flooded by myriad sensations, the warm fluids that heighten your sense of touch, the soft walls that caress your head, the firm muscles that coaxes more of you through the opening.

Narrowing her eyes, her head slowly descends, her throat tightening around your dick, until you feel a pulsing cone of flesh halt your progress. You’ve reached the back of her throat, with a few inches of flesh left protruding from Jana’s mouth. Her chest is heaving now, and you realize that she must be having trouble breathing. Given the difference in size, forcing most of you into her mouth has limited her air supply. Still, the feeling of her mouth washing your cock is driving you to the edge of your stamina, and you speak up. You’re about to suggest she get some air when she retracts her head from your crotch, until only your head is still in her mouth. It’s still a mouthful for her, but it seems like she can catch her breath. You relax, and try to calm yourself down as best you can, when she acts without warning. Slamming her head forward, you choke on your own gasps as you feel your sensitive flesh collide with her pulsing walls. Here eyes are screwed up in concentration, and it looks like she’s managed to push her mouth further down than last time. Her throat lurches and heaves in response to it’s forcible violation, but she’s managing to suppress the most of it. What she doesn’t suppress worms its way around your flesh, amplifying her mouth’s already potent ministrations. Jana’s twisting her face against the pillar of flesh, smearing the few tears leaking from her eyes onto your skin, desperately trying to go lower. When it becomes clear that she can not, she instead rears back. You choke out a strangled warning about your limits, but when her tearstained eyes meet with yours, you see in them unimaginable arousal, and pride. You’re suddenly made aware of Tawna behind you, her hands dancing above her crotch. Jana has brought an audience with her. Much like in her work, she won’t rest until her subordinates are convinced of her competence. Wrapping her arms around your thighs, she lurches forward again, spearing her throat with your dick. The fleshy barrier in her throat relents at your battering ram-in-miniature, and you gasp as Jana’s mouth slides past her previous position, and her nose mashes against your skin. Your dick slides past the obstruction into a smooth velvet orifice that caresses and massages it as it comes to a rest. The sensations it leaves on your spit-stained flesh are too much, and you let loose a choking cry as you empty yourself down the bunny’s throat. The flesh walls shake and shiver as you fire, encouraging your cock to shoot more and more. Your hands clench around the firm thigh-flesh of your other captor, your legs tense, and your hips buck into the rabbit’s stuffed throat as some instinctual part of you tries desperately to seed your bosses red face. Panic flits across her face, and she tries to disentangle herself from your crotch. But her body betrays her. Her throat jumps and caresses your flesh, enough to coax out another shot of virility. Your legs tense once again, but this time, the bottoms of your feet find purchase on the tiled floor. When you buck your hips this time, you do so with the power of the building behind them, driving your hips off of the floor, and your dick once again down the unsuspecting rabbit’s throat. The fleshy cavern, already forced open before, envelopes your flesh once again, and you cry out as your seed is flung down the rabbit’s throat. Your hips fall back down, allowing a flailing Jana to pull the intruding organ from the depths of her throat. She falls back, falling on to her ass, as her chest heaves, bouncing her fluffy tits back and forth. She lets loose a few hacking coughs, as the red drains from her face. Above you, you feel Tawna tense up, and loose a few groaning mewls herself, her hands slowing to a crawl just out of sight. For a few moments, there’s just the sound of labored breathing, and a measured dripping sound as Jana recovers from her self induced throat-fucking. Tawna leans back, resting on her back and releasing your hands from their furred prison. Evidently, the girls are confident that you’re unwilling to leave after this display of passion, and you’re too tired to challenge that. Jana struggles to her feet and stalks toward you, the gentle smile on her face at odds with her tense movements. 

“Now then, let’s move on.”
 
The words leave her mouth with a light slur. Maybe her throat needs a little bit longer to recover, you suggest. But her smile only broadens, and one hand moves to her smart pantsuit. The other moves up and tugs at her cheek.

“Don’t worry about this hole. I’ve got two more we can use.” 

Tawna stiffens at this remark, and you’re about to comment on that when another voice cuts through the shadows behind you.

“Well, that hardly seems fair now, does it?”

Spinning around you strain your eyes in the direction of the familiar voice. There’s a slight electrical hum, and suddenly the hallway is bathed in searing light as the light switch is thrown. As your eyes adjust to the new environment, you see the speaker at the end of the hallway. A large orange tiger, a head taller than Tawna, leans against the panel with the light switch. A pair of cute fluffed ears sat neatly on an otherwise gorgeous face. Every stripe seems to accentuate her best feature, whether it be her piercing yellow eyes, or striking pointed face. The curve of her neck flowed into her upper body like a river, with compact shoulders curving towards her waist and then to her hips. Her body was feminine in all the right places, with plush hips and full, nude breasts. But anyone could tell, just from watching her body move, she felt like liquid metal. Her muscles and sinews flowed as she approached you, elegant in her step, but sure in her approach, and in seconds she stood before you, a self assured smirk chiseled onto her features.</textarea>
