            RAW Paste Data        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;“One of the interesting parts of the world would have to be the Anthrophs,” Anon wrote in his journal as he recollected the events of the day.
&gt;“Creatures of human intelligence, and animal features, stand like a man, converse like a man, act like a man, equally human and yet so uniquely alien.”
&gt;Anon was a Medic with Ulster Constabulary, he was on patrol when he met his first Anthroph in person.
&gt;“Met” being a subjective term as he kind of had to throw her to the ground…
&gt;Because of a bomb that rebels had set off a bomb up the street.
&gt;Anon had been admiring the alien sight, then saw the explosion and took her to the ground to cover her incase of fragments
&gt;“Are you ok?” Anon asks her,
&gt;She was surprised and had half cocked her leg to kick at him after he began to get off her.
&gt;“Woah, I’m a medic” Anon shouts at her, “Relax”
&gt;She straightens out and begins to sit up, “I’m only hurting cause you threw me to the cobbles,” She says rubbing her side. 
&gt;She tries to get up
&gt;Anon notices her wool starting to stain above her face.
&gt;“Hey you sure you aren’t hurt?” He asks reaching into his med-bag
&gt;“I am feeling a little light headed” She says reaching up and feeling her head, she feels the blood.
&gt;“Oh fuck,” She looks at Anon her face flushed, “Help me.”
&gt;Anon wrapped the bandage around her head
&gt;“I’m taking you to the hospital” Anon says while he finishes wrapping the bandage around her head, he had to cover her eyes with the cloth.
&gt;Anon stood her up, “Sarge taking one to the hospital.”
&gt;Anon and the sheep began walking, with Anon checking corners with his sidearm in one hand and arm wrapped around the sheep.
&gt;“What’s your name, sheep?” Anon asks as he passes a storefront looking in.
&gt;“My name is Eva, what is your..?” She says faintly
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m Anon,&quot; He says as he walks her into the hospital
&gt;&quot;ONE SHRAPNEL!&quot; Anon yells
&gt;You&#039;ll be ok.&quot; Anon sets her on a gurney
&gt;&quot;Do I need to go find someone?” Anon asks her as a nurse comes over to further address her.
&gt;No, I don’t have any family.” Eva again says faintly
&gt;Anon could tell that she was starting to fade
&gt;“She passing out get me a room” The nurse yells.
&gt;Anon grabs the gurney as someone yells out room 3.
&gt;“Who are you?” the nurse asks as she is still focused on Eva
&gt;&quot;Anon, Medic with the Constabulary, at your service”
&gt;“You do this dressing right?”
&gt;“Yes,”
&gt;Anon navigates the gurney into the room,
&gt;“Good work stopped the bleeding, but I think there’s still so shrapnel embedded in her head.” 
&gt;“What do I need to do?”
&gt;“Get me the shears from the storage room beside the nurses station, this isn’t my first sheep I’ve sheared.”
&gt;Anon laughs in his head, while he grabs the shears, other causalities are coming in now, many are in much worse shape than the sheep you rescued.
&gt;“Got ‘em” Anon says as he hands the nurse the shears.
&gt;Nurse got to work  shearing the area around the wound, which is now stained red.
&gt;Anon had a clean rag and was trying to take the wool off the barely conscious Eva.
&gt;“Alright I’ve got everything around where the wound is, grab me the tranquilizer from the cabinet behind you.”
&gt;Anon obliges
&gt;The nurse injects the tranquilizer and anon notices as Eva slips into sleep.
&gt;Anon and the nurse work on removing the shrapnel from Eva’s head, it was a small piece of steel that had sliced a gash and stuck itself into her forehead
&gt;“There we go, get me the stitches” 
&gt;Anon obliges, as he starts to hand the needle to the nurse, a doctor pokes his head in the room, “I need you out here we got more causalities” the nurse looks at anon.
&gt;“You got this?” 
&gt;Anon nods
&gt;The nurse headed into the hallway that was filling with the wounded.
&gt;Anon starts at one end of the nearly inch and half long gash
&gt;Anon was halfway done as Eva awoke again
&gt;“Oh thank god it’s you.” She says weakly
&gt;“One second I’m still not finished yet.”
&gt;Anon finished the stitching
&gt;“Ok your good Eva,”
&gt;“I feel good,” She says in her drowsy state
&gt;“Do you need anything?”
&gt;“some water please, my head is still panging”
&gt;Anon grabs a cup from the bathroom and fills it half-way for her.
&gt;“Anything else?” Anon asks as he gives it to her.
&gt;“I can’t feel my arms, what did you give me?”
&gt;“A bit of tranquilizer, its temporary”
&gt;“So I guess I could use you to help me get a drink of water then.”
&gt;Anon obliges and helps her drink
&gt;“Why are you looking at me like a deer in the headlights?” she asks, coming out from under the effect of the drugs
&gt;“I’ve never seen one of your kind, in real life before.” Anon says sheepishly
&gt;“That’s a first for me. So what’s your name?” Eva asks
&gt;“I’m Anon.” He shakes her limp hand
&gt;“Oh I felt that, hey my arms are coming back”
&gt;Anon felt something…weird with that shake…something in his brain was firing off like crazy…
&gt;Was it affection? Love? Lust?
&gt;Anon couldn’t tell but before he could think about it longer, a nurse came in.
&gt;”we need this room, Anon how’s…her?”
&gt;”Eva is fine, I think I could take her home, so that you don’t need to worry about her.”
&gt;”Ok, but I’ll need you to sign a release sheet.” Anon nods and lifts Eva up.
&gt;Eva stands uneasy, and stumbled into Anon’s arms.
&gt;”Hehe…Sorry lad, I don’t got my legs under me yet.” She says, her accent had returned.
&gt;”Can I take you home Eva?” Anon asks.
&gt;”I don’t know if it’s the tranquilizers or that you just saved my life, but hell yeah, you can take me home.”
&gt;Anon and Eva head to the nurses station and get her signed out.
&gt;Anon with Eva on his arm, they walk there way out to the edge of town, passing the blast site, and Anon’s sergeant, whom anon waves off and the sergeant acknowledges.
&gt;They reach her quaint cottage, a single story three room.
&gt;Eva tries to rummage for her keys but her fine motors weren’t back yet.
&gt;”Let me help you” Anon says while reaching into her bag.
&gt;Their hands touch…(THIS IS THE UNHOLYEST PERVERSION)
&gt;”Oh.” Eva gasps
&gt;”There we are” Anon has the keys in his hand and a blush on his face.
&gt;Anon unlocks the door and walks her inside.
&gt;A small kitchenette sits on the far wall, with a living room on the near wall corner with a fireplace dividing the two sections, two doors on the other end of the wall, one which is open and anon notices that it looks like a storage closet, which means that the other must be her bedroom.
&gt;”Where do you want me to set you down at?” 
&gt;”Here on the sofa is fine, thanks anon.” She plants a kiss on his cheek. Anon sets her down so she is lounging on the sofa.
&gt;”Do you want something to eat?” 
&gt;”Please,” She says while pointing shakily at the fridge.
&gt;Anon opens the fridge to find a platter of vegetables, which he grabs.
&gt;Eva’s hands were still having trouble contracting and gripping onto things, “um this is gonna be weird but, will you feed me?”
&gt;Anon nods
&gt;While feeding someone is an normal act in the medical service, to Anon. It was intimate, the sheep he just saved was now asking him to feed her, who knew what else would be in store for this night.
&gt;Anon held a carrot in front of her mouth.
&gt;”Open up here comes the train,” Anon says in a motherly voice
&gt;”WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING MATE” His conscious brain screams.
&gt;Eva stifles a little laugh then opens her mouth for the carrot, she made sure to gives his fingers a lick as he put the first carrot in her mouth.
&gt;Anon proceeds to feed her a portion of the platter before she says she full. (But not full enough)
&gt;”Thank you” She says 
&gt;The sun had begun to set
&gt;Eva had one more request for Anon before she would let him leave, if he wanted.
&gt;Anon, could you start a fire for me, it does tend to get cold during the night, not much insulation in this cottage.”
&gt;Anon obliged and silently hoped she’d ask for more than just the fire.
&gt;Anon set the wood onto the steel frame of the fireplace, and had pulled the lighter out of his uniform, “you have any lighter fluid,”
&gt;Eva pushed herself up and stumbled across the house to the kitchen sink and tried to reach under and grab the bottle
&gt;Anon had already met her at the sink and grabbed the bottle and her, “You got to be more careful, I think they gave you a stronger dose than they meant to.” Anon’s brain started working, “maybe I should stay the night?”
&gt;Eva was so ecstatic but she wasn’t just going to roll over for him…Not just yet. “Where would I put you to bed at? I aint got a spare cot in the room.”
&gt;Anon looked around, “How bout the couch then, surely you’ve got a spare pillow?”
&gt;Eva had a wicked grin across her face, “No..no surely there somewhere else that you could sleep, not dirtying up my couch with your sweaty and dirty uniform.
&gt;Anon took a moment and looked at his uni, it was dirty from the blast site, with some singe marks from the during cinders and he noticed a bit of Eva’s blood on both cuffs of his uniform.
&gt;Eva grabs his hand, her fun of toying with him had evaporated, but not entirely.
&gt;She leads him to her bedroom staggering a bit, “How about here?” she implied.
&gt;The bed was not a single cot but a queen-sized bed.
&gt;Anon think he knew what was going to happen next.
&gt;She fell to the bed limp as she could be.
&gt;”Anon help me!” she says in a playful manner, “I can’t feel my arms, your gonna have to help me change into my nightwear, you don’t mind helping a damsel in distress, wouldn’t you?”
&gt;Anon was ready for this play. “Of course or I wouldn’t be in her majesty’s service eh?” Anon starts with her shirt, unbuttoning one button after another.
&gt;Her A cup breast were free of there cloth prisons.
&gt;Anon had rested his head on them as his hands worked down to both his and her pants.
&gt;”What’s that did you hear that motorboat” Anon farcely asks then proceed to motorboat her breasts as both their pants fell to a pile on the floor.
&gt;the only thing that was stopping Anon from his full reward was a copper colored gate, which he already had the key.
&gt;Anon tore the panties apart with teeth noticing the moisture, it seemed that his aquatic play up north had made it rain down south.
&gt;Anon could of came right there, but he had to make it home before his body struck-out.
&gt;He rose to level his gun into the waiting cave of Eva.
&gt;”Yes” Eva nodded
&gt;Anon took no time to wait or think, he just drove the dog home.
&gt;After several pumps, Eva and Anon both came.
&gt;Anon feel to her side, “Amazing.” They both say.

Thank you Irish-Sheep anon for getting me started with a helpful stress relief and creative outlet.</textarea>
