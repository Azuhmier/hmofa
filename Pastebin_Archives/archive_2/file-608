Romy&#039;s on watch now, so she told me to escort you to see the Captain.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like Romy, Charlie is completely nude except for a holstered weapon at her side, and a few other tools suspended from her belt.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Unlike Romy, she leaves her pistol holstered as she opens the bars and gestures for you to come out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;By now you know the way to the Captain&#039;s cabin, so you and Charlie arrive in short order.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Charlie motions for you to wait, then knocks respectfully on the cabin door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come,&quot; a voice calls from within.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Charlie opens the door and ushers you inside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ah. Thank you for not making me wait too long, Anonymous. That will be all, Charlie.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Mum,&quot; Charlie says and withdraws, closing the door behind her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Captain tells you to have a seat, gesturing to a thinly padded couch against one wall next to the desk.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s still more comfortable than your cell.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So, what&#039;s this deal?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Straight to business then.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Well Captain, as I said, I can&#039;t open the security casket because I don&#039;t have the codes. But I can unclamp it from the cargo deck so you can move it off my ship onto yours.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Captain Will leans forward, steepling her fingers in front of her muzzle as though thinking.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I can&#039;t say I&#039;m thrilled about the prospect of putting a bomb aboard my ship. Why would I do that?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Because you&#039;re going to dump my ship over the side.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her eyebrows arch in surprise.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What for?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Because if your contact on Jaophus IV is who I think it is, I don&#039;t trust him and neither should you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We&#039;ve done business with him before. Why should I trust you more than him?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That confirms some more of your suspicions.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Fair question.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You consider your words carefully.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You said it yourself, Captain. You don&#039;t know who he is. I do, and believe me, he&#039;s planning to screw you over.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Captain Will sits back in her chair, regarding you thoughtfully.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her coat falls open, and you concentrate your attention on her face to avoid any distracting thoughts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So I&#039;d be stuck with a bomb, and no way to disarm it or get at the contents?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Not necessarily. I can get the shipping manifest from my ship&#039;s computer.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;That will tell us exactly where on Mytus VI the shipment was going. The receiving entity would have the keys and codes.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hmm. And I suppose they&#039;ll just give them to me?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Not willingly. But maybe I can help you avoid a nasty fight to get them.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Captain&#039;s expression is calculating, appraising.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can&#039;t tell if she&#039;s making up her mind whether to trust you or deciding whether the security casket&#039;s contents would be worth the risk.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Why dump your ship over the side then?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;So they have something to find. If I&#039;m right, their reaction will be worth it. We just have to wait and see what it is.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;If you&#039;re right.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod, acknowledging the qualifier.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I concede, it&#039;s risky. But a wise member of my people once observed that the risks and costs of action are preferable to the long-term risks of comfortable inaction.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Captain Will nods. &quot;John F. Kennedy.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s your turn to be surprised, that this alien woman knows the source of that quote.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s clearly a lot smarter or more educated than she lets on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Captain leans forward once more, her gaze boring into your eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So tell me Anonymous. Are you certain that the rewards of your proposal will outweigh the risks?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I am very confident that they will.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Captain keeps her eyes fixed on you a moment longer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;In that case, I believe we have a deal.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Captain Will rises from her chair and opens a small cabinet, from which she takes a bottle filled with amber liquid and two glasses.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;On my ship, we seal deals with a drink,&quot; she says, as she uncorks the bottle and pours some of the liquid into each glass.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Should I interpret that to mean that you trust me?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Guardedly, but yes,&quot; the Captain says, handing you a glass.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The liquid inside has a smoky odor to it, and plays tricks on your eyes, seeming to change color under the lights in the cabin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So Anonymous, what shall we drink to?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You think a moment, then extend your glass towards her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;To trust.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Captain nods approvingly, a genuine smile creasing her lips.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;To trust.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She clinks her glass against yours and bolts the contents.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">/It can&#039;t be that strong, if someone half my size can chug it./</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you bolt yours.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That turns out to be a mistake, because the stuff in the glass has a punch like a freight train.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In the midst of your ensuing coughing fit, you hear surprised laughter coming from the Captain.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;First time, Anonymous?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s certainly not your first time, but you&#039;ve never drunk anything like that before.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The stuff is making your eyes water.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You finally get your breathing enough under control to half croak a query.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;What the hell was that stuff?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Lorellian Bourbon. I gather it&#039;s rare where you come from.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s not only rare, but illegal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Never mind the trademark infringement, the base intoxicant is nearly ten times stronger than alcohol.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel dizzy, but lucky to have survived.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you suspect that you&#039;re not going to enjoy the after-effects, even as a pleasant warmth begins to seep throughout your body.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At least your headache has vanished for the time-being.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Captain Will takes your glass from you, and puts both glasses and the bottle away.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come with me, Anonymous. There&#039;s someone you should meet.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Okay, sure.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your voice sounds somehow strange to your ears as you follow her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Strange enough to make you giggle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You manage to avoid the door frame, but continue walking across the narrow passageway until you bump into the far wall.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Strange, you could&#039;ve sworn the passage was wider than that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">/People are strange, when you&#039;re a stranger.../</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Captain takes you by the arm and steers you along the passage to another cabin door a short distance away.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;This cabin belongs to my First Officer, Jenna.

Why&#039;s that?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoe reaches up and grabs the hem of her top and pulls it up, unashamedly flashing you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Because I&#039;m the ship&#039;s engineer, and I work on everything. And I got tired of burning my tits on hot manifolds.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoe&#039;s unabashed display actually causes you to blush slightly, but on closer inspection you can see that she has a couple of nasty scars.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Ah... Duly noted.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All the displays have gone to sleep to conserve power, but they quickly come back to life when you tap a key on the data entry panel.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You then key in your ident code, 724651, and hit enter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Further displays come to life, displaying new information on the vessel&#039;s status and systems.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Welcome, Anonymous.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoe starts slightly at the sound of the computer&#039;s voice synthesizer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Relax, it&#039;s just the computer.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It talks? Keen gear!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Alright, shush. Computer, display shipping manifest for current load.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Working.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One of the displays changes to show an official-looking document, although it intrigues you now that some of the blocks on the form are left blank.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Computer, give me a hard copy.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Printing copy.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A slot opens up and quickly spits out a standard sheet of paper with the manifest printed on it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Excuse me.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reach past Zoe to grab the printout.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;The computer understands what you say to it as well?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yes, but keep quiet. Two people talking at once tends to confuse it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh. Sorry.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You turn back to the console.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Computer, release cargo clamps for off-loading, 724651.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Command authenticated.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just one last thing to do.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you hesitate.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once you do this, there is no turning back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take a deep breath and let it out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Computer, dereliction protocol, 724651.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Command authenticated. Good-bye.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The displays in the cockpit dissolve into a random jumble of meaningless data before going blank.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Dereliction protocol? What&#039;s that?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;It&#039;s a security protocol when the ship is considered unserviceable, due to mishap or capture. Basically it wipes all the core memory, except for the flight log recorder, which is on a separate core.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Aw, what&#039;d you have to do that for?&quot; Zoe whines.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I could have salvaged that computer and put it to work on our ship.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;It&#039;s a very limited computer, and for security reasons it&#039;s very hard to get at.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I enjoy a challenge.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stand up, folding the manifest, which you tuck into a pocket on your tunic.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Never mind. Let&#039;s get that security container off the ship.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Sure! I&#039;ll get Jo to help.&quot; Zoe runs out to the courier ship&#039;s cargo ramp and calls for Jo.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You head back to the cargo hold and over to the squat, blocky black shape of the MK4 Secure Transport Container.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just then the biggest ferret you&#039;ve ever seen walks into the hold, and looks around curiously.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You must be Jo.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jo looks at the sound of your voice, but turns away shyly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Jo, we need to take this thing off and secure it in our hold,&quot; Zoe tells the bosun.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh, sure. Let me get a pallet jack.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;No need for that.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reach down and unplug the power umbilical from the side of the container.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What? This thing must weigh at least half a ton!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Three-quarters, actually, but because of that...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You open the control panel and activate the container&#039;s repulsor field.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A blue glow develops beneath the container and it levitates slightly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;We can move it now, slowly. It doesn&#039;t exactly track straight, and it can be a handful.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Neat,&quot; Zoe says admiringly, while Jo just looks at you and blushes slightly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You find her shyness kinda amusing, considering that Jo is as tall as you are and has a few scars, giving her a gruff appearance.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;C&#039;mon Jo, you take that end and I&#039;ll take this. Be careful on the ramp.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;O-okay.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Between the two of you, you manhandle (Tika-handle?) the heavy container down to the Serpent&#039;s cargo deck, where Jo expertly stows it and gripes it down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Jo is our bosun, she handles all the deck gear and small vessels,&quot; Zoe tells you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Thanks for the introduction.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can&#039;t tell if they take your sarcasm for what it is, but the moment ends abruptly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Attention on deck!&quot; Jo calls loudly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You turn off the repulsor field and look to see the Captain coming towards you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Knock it off already, this isn&#039;t the Navy. So Anonymous, you done fooling around with your ship?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yes. Here&#039;s the container.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;And I can rig power to keep it charged,&quot; Zoe says, coming down your cargo ramp.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You see that she has the power umbilical for the container with her, which she has cut off of your ship.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Good,&quot; Captain Will says, eyeing the container. &quot;We&#039;re almost at the rendezvous point. Did you get the shipping manifest?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You unfold the manifest and show it to her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yes. The receiving entity is Vindada &amp; D&#039;raang Shipyard, Tolan City, Mytus VI. The landing coordinates are here.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Good.&quot; The Captain inspects the manifest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There are a few things on the manifest that don&#039;t look right to you though.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No value is listed for the insurance block.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Another block that should show the name of the cargo&#039;s owner is also blank.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The cargo description is &quot;Data Processing Equipment&quot;, which is certainly not the sort of cargo you would expect in a MK4.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Jo, prepare Anonymous&#039; ship for jettison. Anonymous, you&#039;ll come with me to the bridge.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jo snaps to attention, evidently a veteran.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Aye-aye, Captain.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anonymous, what power does the container take?&quot; Zoe asks you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Um, 36 volts, direct current.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Easy,&quot; Zoe says with a grin, and goes to get the parts she needs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;======&lt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After following Captain Will through a few unfamiliar passages, you arrive in the ship&#039;s bridge.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s about what you&#039;d expect: a number of different consoles, manned by Tika who are intently focused on the information presented by their displays.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking around at the displays and equipment, you are surprised to find that they connect with some memories from your military days.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Is this a X&#039;tixian ship?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yes. You know about the X&#039;tixians?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Faced them in combat a few times. Giant cockroaches with really bad attitudes.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; Romy pipes up from her position at the ship&#039;s weapons console, &quot;Crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Romy&#039;s description makes you feel slightly ill, but draws a wry smile from the Captain.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;The Serpent&#039;s Adventure is a converted X&#039;tixian Raider. Most of the equipment is well-suited to her current employment, though I wish their computer technology was more advanced. But we make do.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Captain turns to the navigation table, which is occupied by a youngish-looking, skinny Tika with a brown coat, wearing glasses and a colorful vest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We&#039;ve reached the rendezvous point Captain.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Very well Fifi. After we jettison the courier vessel, take us into the asteroids.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;The asteroids? Um, sure. I can do that.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Funny, she doesn&#039;t sound so sure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We need to be able to watch the rendezvous discreetly.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yes Ma&#039;am,&quot; Fifi responds, pulling up a star chart with the asteroid field on her display.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Fifi is a stellar mathematician. She has to be, the navigation computer was damaged when we captured the ship.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Thank you, Ma&#039;am.&quot; Fifi looks up and gives you both a shy smile as she crunches numbers with a pencil and paper.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A comm panel beeps and the Captain presses a switch on it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Bridge, Captain.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Bridge, Cargo. We&#039;re ready to dump the courier vessel.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Very well. Get it done.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yes Captain.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are reduced to an observer, occasionally moving out of the way as one of the Tika squeezes past you in the densely packed control space.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As soon as your ship is clear of the hold, Fifi quickly maneuvers The Serpent&#039;s Adventure into the asteroid field, turning it so that they can watch the rendezvous.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;All stations, this is the Captain, power down all active sensors and secure external communications. I don&#039;t want them knowing we&#039;re here.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What about weapons?&quot; Romy asks.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Optical targeting only. Turn the trackers off.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Romy looks less than pleased with her orders, but complies.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Now what?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Now... we wait, and see if you&#039;re right.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hate waiting.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;And if I&#039;m not right?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well,&quot; the Captain says, &quot;the original plan was to space you, make the delivery and collect our fee. That&#039;s still an option.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In the face of the Captain&#039;s matter-of-fact statement, the hunch you had now seems absurdly flimsy, though you had felt certain about it last night.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Time to rendezvous?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Seven minutes, Captain.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;======&lt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Seven minutes drag by with the weight of years.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then eleven more minutes do the same.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re starting to feel increasingly unsure of yourself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Romy is giving you a significantly hostile glance from her position at the ship&#039;s weapons control console.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Are they always this late?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;They&#039;re usually pretty prompt, in fact.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You swallow nervously.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Captain, energy field detected, ships coming out of warp.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ships?&quot; The Captain says, with particular emphasis on the plurality, her eyebrows rising.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One moment there was nothing there except the faint speck of your courier ship.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In the next moment, two warships suddenly appear, quickly decelerating as they approach the rendezvous point.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Is that what they usually send to meet you?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;No,&quot; the Captain says quietly, &quot;it certainly isn&#039;t.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Captain turns to Romy at the weapons console.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Can you make out any markings?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You already know what they are. You recognize the shape of the vessels.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; Romy replies, her voice tinged with venom, &quot;they&#039;re Espos.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Two Security Police Cruisers, in fact.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Quite a reception committee.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two massive warships slowly approach your courier ship, and you see a small shuttle make its way from one of them to your ship.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I think they&#039;re going to be pretty pissed when they find it empty.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I think you&#039;re right, Anonymous,&quot; the Captain says.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She turns to the Navigation table.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Fifi, maneuvering thrusters only, take us down to the surface of one of the large asteroids. No landing sensors.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fifi gulps nervously.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yes Ma&#039;am.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Tika at the helm gets up and moves out of the way as Fifi takes direct control of maneuvering the ship towards a largish, irregularly-shaped asteroid.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You keep your eyes fixed on the warships as the shuttle docks with your ship.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Captain, sensor sweeps, they&#039;re looking around.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Easy, the debris field should conceal us. Fifi?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;One minute to contact, Captain.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Quick as you can, please.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The bridge falls silent, but you can practically hear how tense everyone is.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We can take &#039;em,&quot; Romy growls.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Too risky, and I would prefer not to tip our hand just yet,&quot; the Captain admonishes her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Those are the new cruisers. They&#039;re heavily armed and armored. If the Security Police are involved, this might go higher than I think.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You REALLY want to know what&#039;s in that security container now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Impact imminent,&quot; Fifi calls out, &quot;BRACE!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Serpent&#039;s Adventure touches down on the asteroid with a gentle bump.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Shut down all non-essential systems. Minimal power signature.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yes Captain.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The lighting on the bridge goes dark, as do some of the displays.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You watch as the shuttle detaches from your ship and accelerates back towards its mothership.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Romy is still watching you, the expression on her face unreadable.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Captain! Fire control trackers!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;On us?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;No Ma&#039;am!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your attention is riveted on the warships, and so you are very nearly blinded by the bright light that erupts from that direction.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Security Police warships have obliterated your courier vessel.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yeah, they&#039;re pissed all right,&quot; Romy observes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Temper, temper,&quot; the Captain observes wryly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Captain, long-range sensor sweeps. They&#039;re scanning the area.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Very well. We keep quiet, they shouldn&#039;t find us.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Several more tense minutes pass until the Security Police warships get tired of looking, or at least hanging around.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Captain, hyperspace insertion energy field detected.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And in the next moment, both Cruisers are gone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You realize that you&#039;ve been holding your breath and let it out in a long sigh.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well well, Anonymous. It seems you were right about this so far. We&#039;ll make a pirate out of you yet.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re not sure whether that&#039;s a compliment or an insult.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some of the tension on the bridge begins to dissipate, as the watch standers express their relief to one another.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;So what&#039;s next?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We&#039;ll lie doggo here for a little while longer, just to be sure. In the meantime... Fifi?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yes Ma&#039;am?&quot; the younger Tika pipes up from the helm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Plot us a hyperspace jump to the Mytus System.

&gt;You make your plans while you wait.
&gt;You don&#039;t have to wait long, because apparently Andy works pretty fast.
&gt;A slightly taller, brown and black Tika you remember as the spokeswoman for the audience you had earlier appears at the bars.
&gt;&quot;Hi human, I&#039;m Charlie. Romy&#039;s on watch now, so she told me to escort you to see the Captain.&quot;
&gt;Like Romy, Charlie is completely nude except for a holstered weapon at her side, and a few other tools suspended from her belt.
&gt;Unlike Romy, she leaves her pistol holstered as she opens the bars and gestures for you to come out.
&gt;By now you know the way to the Captain&#039;s cabin, so you and Charlie arrive in short order.
&gt;Charlie motions for you to wait, then knocks respectfully on the cabin door.
&gt;&quot;Come,&quot; a voice calls from within.
&gt;Charlie opens the door and ushers you inside.
&gt;&quot;Ah. Thank you for not making me wait too long, Anonymous. That will be all, Charlie.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Mum,&quot; Charlie says and withdraws, closing the door behind her.
&gt;The Captain tells you to have a seat, gesturing to a thinly padded couch against one wall next to the desk.
&gt;It&#039;s still more comfortable than your cell.
&gt;&quot;So, what&#039;s this deal?&quot;
&gt;Straight to business then.
&quot;Well Captain, as I said, I can&#039;t open the security casket because I don&#039;t have the codes. But I can unclamp it from the cargo deck so you can move it off my ship onto yours.&quot;
&gt;Captain Will leans forward, steepling her fingers in front of her muzzle as though thinking.
&gt;&quot;I can&#039;t say I&#039;m thrilled about the prospect of putting a bomb aboard my ship. Why would I do that?&quot;
&quot;Because you&#039;re going to dump my ship over the side.&quot;
&gt;Her eyebrows arch in surprise.
&gt;&quot;What for?&quot;
&quot;Because if your contact on Jaophus IV is who I think it is, I don&#039;t trust him and neither should you.&quot;
&gt;&quot;We&#039;ve done business with him before. Why should I trust you more than him?&quot;
&gt;That confirms some more of your suspicions.
&quot;Fair question.&quot;
&gt;You consider your words carefully.
&quot;You said it yourself, Captain. You don&#039;t know who he is. I do, and believe me, he&#039;s planning to screw you over.&quot;
&gt;Captain Will sits back in her chair, regarding you thoughtfully.
&gt;Her coat falls open, and you concentrate your attention on her face to avoid any distracting thoughts.
&gt;&quot;So I&#039;d be stuck with a bomb, and no way to disarm it or get at the contents?&quot;
&quot;Not necessarily. I can get the shipping manifest from my ship&#039;s computer.&quot;
&gt;&quot;So?&quot;
&quot;That will tell us exactly where on Mytus VI the shipment was going. The receiving entity would have the keys and codes.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Hmm. And I suppose they&#039;ll just give them to me?&quot;
&quot;Not willingly. But maybe I can help you avoid a nasty fight to get them.&quot;
&gt;The Captain&#039;s expression is calculating, appraising.
&gt;You can&#039;t tell if she&#039;s making up her mind whether to trust you or deciding whether the security casket&#039;s contents would be worth the risk.
&gt;&quot;Why dump your ship over the side then?&quot;
&quot;So they have something to find. If I&#039;m right, their reaction will be worth it. We just have to wait and see what it is.&quot;
&gt;&quot;If you&#039;re right.&quot;
&gt;You nod, acknowledging the qualifier.
&quot;I concede, it&#039;s risky. But a wise member of my people once observed that the risks and costs of action are preferable to the long-term risks of comfortable inaction.&quot;
&gt;Captain Will nods. &quot;John F. Kennedy.&quot;
&gt;It&#039;s your turn to be surprised, that this alien woman knows the source of that quote.
&gt;She&#039;s clearly a lot smarter or more educated than she lets on.
&gt;The Captain leans forward once more, her gaze boring into your eyes.
&gt;&quot;So tell me Anonymous. Are you certain that the rewards of your proposal will outweigh the risks?&quot;
&quot;I am very confident that they will.&quot;
&gt;The Captain keeps her eyes fixed on you a moment longer.
&gt;&quot;In that case, I believe we have a deal.&quot;
&gt;Captain Will rises from her chair and opens a small cabinet, from which she takes a bottle filled with amber liquid and two glasses.
&gt;&quot;On my ship, we seal deals with a drink,&quot; she says, as she uncorks the bottle and pours some of the liquid into each glass.
&quot;Should I interpret that to mean that you trust me?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Guardedly, but yes,&quot; the Captain says, handing you a glass.
&gt;The liquid inside has a smoky odor to it, and plays tricks on your eyes, seeming to change color under the lights in the cabin.
&gt;&quot;So Anonymous, what shall we drink to?&quot;
&gt;You think a moment, then extend your glass towards her.
&quot;To trust.&quot;
&gt;The Captain nods approvingly, a genuine smile creasing her lips.
&gt;&quot;To trust.&quot;
&gt;She clinks her glass against yours and bolts the contents.
/It can&#039;t be that strong, if someone half my size can chug it./
&gt;So you bolt yours.
&gt;That turns out to be a mistake, because the stuff in the glass has a punch like a freight train.
&gt;In the midst of your ensuing coughing fit, you hear surprised laughter coming from the Captain.
&gt;&quot;First time, Anonymous?&quot;
&gt;It&#039;s certainly not your first time, but you&#039;ve never drunk anything like that before.
&gt;The stuff is making your eyes water.
&gt;You finally get your breathing enough under control to half croak a query.
&quot;What the hell was that stuff?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Lorellian Bourbon. I gather it&#039;s rare where you come from.&quot;
&gt;It&#039;s not only rare, but illegal.
&gt;Never mind the trademark infringement, the base intoxicant is nearly ten times stronger than alcohol.
&gt;You feel dizzy, but lucky to have survived.
&gt;And you suspect that you&#039;re not going to enjoy the after-effects, even as a pleasant warmth begins to seep throughout your body.
&gt;At least your headache has vanished for the time-being.
&gt;Captain Will takes your glass from you, and puts both glasses and the bottle away.
&gt;&quot;Come with me, Anonymous. There&#039;s someone you should meet.&quot;
&quot;Okay, sure.&quot;
&gt;Your voice sounds somehow strange to your ears as you follow her.
&gt;Strange enough to make you giggle.
&gt;You manage to avoid the door frame, but continue walking across the narrow passageway until you bump into the far wall.
&gt;Strange, you could&#039;ve sworn the passage was wider than that.
/People are strange, when you&#039;re a stranger.../
&gt;The Captain takes you by the arm and steers you along the passage to another cabin door a short distance away.
&gt;&quot;This cabin belongs to my First Officer, Jenna. She&#039;s the one who brought you down, so technically she gets dibs.&quot;
/Dibs?/
/Dibs, fibs, bibs, cribs... jibs... nibs? Ribs!/
&gt;This nonsensical train of thought causes you to giggle again as Captain Will knocks once on the door.
&gt;&quot;Come in, Captain,&quot; a voice answers smoothly from within.
&gt;The Captain looks you in the eye.
&gt;&quot;Be nice to her.&quot;
&gt;You manage to nod.
&quot;Okay.&quot;
&gt;Captain Will opens the door and ushers you inside.
&gt;&quot;Jenna, your prisoner,&quot; the Captain says, before shutting the door, leaving you alone with a white-furred Tika wearing red armor, and performing an intricate kata with a long sword.
&quot;Hi.&quot;
&gt;You give the Tika a friendly wave, but she ignores you, continuing with her kata.
&quot;I&#039;m Anonnymoush.&quot;
&gt;You watch her movements, some part of your sozzled brain noticing how graceful and fluid they are, not a wasted motion anywhere.
&quot;Are you Jenna?&quot;
&gt;&quot;First Officer Jenna,&quot; she corrects you, not interrupting her kata to do so.
&quot;Okay.&quot;
&gt;She turns toward you, pointing the sword at your throat.
&gt;&quot;Okay what?&quot;
&gt;You retain enough mental faculty to correct your evident mistake.
&quot;Okay... First Officer Jenna.&quot;
&gt;You are rewarded with a tight nod, and the point of the sword sweeps away from your neck, finishing in a sword salute before she sheathes the blade.
&gt;&quot;Take off your clothes and lie down on the bed.&quot;
&quot;What? Wh-what for?&quot;
&gt;Jenna glares at you, menace evident in her eyes.
&quot;Alright, don&#039;t get excited... you want me to take off my clothes and lie down on the bed? I&#039;ll take off my clothes and lie down on the bed.&quot;
&gt;You begin to disrobe, but it takes you longer than you think it should.
/I dunno, some people... ferrets... Tika, whatever. No patience, no romance, just get naked and lie down./
&gt;You hope you didn&#039;t say that out loud as you finally manage to kick off your pants and climb up onto the bed.
&gt;It&#039;s a little too small for you, your legs dangle off the end.
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s my desk.&quot;
&quot;It is? Oh, sorry... Thought it felt weird.&quot;
&gt;You lever yourself back onto your feet and cross over to the correct piece of furniture, lying down on your back.
&gt;You hear a noise and turn your head to look.
&gt;Jenna has divested herself of her armor, and now stands before you, nude, in all her sweaty glory.
&gt;Species difference aside, a pretty woman is a pretty woman.
&quot;Wow,&quot; you say appreciatively.
&gt;Jenna climbs atop you, straddling your chest, and you feel the point of a small dagger at your throat.
&gt;Pointy things aside, Anon Jr. has already come to attention.
&gt;&quot;Now, am I going to need this?&quot; Jenna asks, showing you the dagger, &quot;Or are you going to behave yourself?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh, don&#039;t worry ma&#039;am, I&#039;ll behave. Captain said to be nice to you, so I&#039;ll be nice.&quot;
&gt;A smile creases Jenna&#039;s lips as she sets the dagger down next to the bed.
&gt;&quot;Good boy.&quot;
/What are we gonna do on the bed?/
&gt;It&#039;s an old joke, and you hope you didn&#039;t say it out loud.
&gt;Jenna lays down atop you and begins rubbing her body all over your torso.
&gt;She rubs her head along both of your cheeks and across your throat, liberally smearing her sweat on you.
&gt;Anon Jr. is definitely interested in what&#039;s happening.
&gt;Jenna sits up on your chest, and you feel a moist paw rub roughly along your shaft.
&gt;And just like that it&#039;s over, as Jenna hops off of you and puts on a robe.
&quot;What, is that it?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yep.&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re not sure what exactly you were expecting, but that wasn&#039;t it.
&gt;But the Big Question clamors for attention in your mind.
&quot;Why?&quot;
&gt;Jenna chuckles drily before answering.
&gt;&quot;Like it or not, human, you and I have one thing in common.&quot;
&quot;We do? What&#039;s that?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Neither of us is interested in dicks. Am I right?&quot;
&gt;It takes a moment for your brain to process this before it finally offers you an explanation.
/Jenna&#039;s playing for the other team./
&quot;Oh, yeah, you&#039;re right. No interest in dicks at all.&quot;
&gt;You reconsider.
&quot;Except my own.&quot;
&gt;You feel something sharp at your groin and look down to see Jenna with her dagger menacing your junk.
&gt;&quot;Reputation is everything Anonymous. I trust I don&#039;t need to explain what will happen to you if you impugn mine?&quot;
&gt;You get the idea.
&quot;Duly noted. I get your point.&quot;
&gt;You barely manage to avoid giggling at your joke.
&gt;&quot;Good. If any one of my crew asks, I rode you like a wildebeest. I trust I can rely on your discretion.&quot;
&quot;Yes ma&#039;am, First Officer Jenna, ma&#039;am.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m glad we understand each other.&quot;
&gt;Jenna sits in the chair next to her desk, straightening up the disturbance you created earlier.
&gt;&quot;Contingent on your good behavior, your arrest is suspended. You have the run of the ship.&quot;
&gt;Jenna smiles at you.
&gt;&quot;Try to stay out of trouble.&quot;
&quot;You can count on me, ma&#039;am. Thanks.&quot;
&gt;You give her a mock salute, and open the door and step out.
&gt;&quot;ANONYMOUS!&quot;
&gt;You stick your head back in the door.
&gt;&quot;Yes ma&#039;am?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Put your damn clothes back on!&quot;
&quot;...&quot;
&quot;Oh! Right!&quot;
&gt;You re-enter the cabin, closing the door behind you.
 
&gt;======&lt;
 
&gt;The corridor was straight and clear of obstructions, and free of any of the ship&#039;s crew.
&gt;Nevertheless, you weave unsteadily along it.
&gt;You&#039;re no longer a prisoner, but you&#039;re not sure what to do now.
&gt;At the moment you kind of miss your escort, since you&#039;re still three sheets to the wind, and an escort would be really helpful about now.
&gt;You bump into a fire extinguisher mounted on the wall and excuse yourself politely before stumbling on.
&gt;A door just ahead slides open, and a head topped with a frizzy shock of red hair emerges, looking up and down the corridor.
&gt;&quot;Oh, it&#039;s you!&quot; Doc says, catching sight of you and brightening a bit.
&quot;Yup, still me. Last I checked.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re not looking so hot there, sport. Better come inside.&quot;
&gt;With that, she seizes your wrist in a surprisingly strong grip and nearly pulls you off-balance as you stumble through the door, which slides shut behind you.
&gt;&quot;If I didn&#039;t know any better, I&#039;d say you&#039;ve been celebrating.&quot;
&gt;You nod.
&quot;Made a deal.&quot;
&gt;Doc draws close to you and her whiskers twitch as she sniffs around your torso.
&gt;&quot;Oh, and I see you&#039;ve met Jenna?&quot; she asks, a smile creasing her lips.
&gt;You nod again, and then hasten to add...
&quot;She rode me... like a wild beast.&quot;
&gt;Doc nods approvingly, licking her lips.
&gt;&quot;Well, that&#039;s definitely good news!&quot;
&gt;Doc gives you a hearty slap on the butt, staggering you and causing your coughing fit to return briefly.
&gt;&quot;Congratulations, kiddo! You popped your cherry! And just so you know, you&#039;re about to get a lot more popular on this ship.&quot;
&quot;Gee, thanks...&quot;
&gt;&quot;Speaking of,&quot; Doc says, locking the door, &quot;how about that examination now?&quot;
&gt;This causes you to giggle.
&quot;Do I really look that rough?&quot;
&gt;Come to think of it, you&#039;ve felt better.
&gt;Then you notice Doc removing her lab coat, which she carefully hangs up on a hook near the door.
&quot;Ummm, is this the normal procedure for a medical exam?&quot;
&gt;Doc gives you a lecherous grin in response.
&gt;&quot;Yeah, it&#039;s the latest thing! Go on, you try it.&quot;
&gt;With a shrug, you unfasten the collar of your tunic and pull it off over your head.
&gt;Doc nods appreciatively.
&gt;&quot;Well, you certainly look healthy, I&#039;ll give you that.&quot;
&quot;I work out.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I can see that,&quot; Doc replies, advancing on you. &quot;Let me just check your muscle tone.&quot;
&gt;With another lick of her lips, Doc raises her forepaws and plants them firmly on your midriff, feeling over your abs.
&gt;Feeling a little froggy, you flex them and Doc develops a slight blush.
&gt;&quot;Oh, goodness, yes,&quot; she says approvingly, her forepaws roving around your waist to grope your butt.
&quot;Er, what exactly are you trying to examine there?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Trust me, I&#039;m a professional.&quot;
&gt;Doc fiddles with your waistband some more.
&gt;&quot;How do you get these off?&quot;
&gt;You look down and notice for the first time that you&#039;ve put your pants on back-to-front.
&quot;Ah, I understand your confusion.&quot;
&gt;You turn in a small circle and reach behind you and find the fastener, finally allowing your pants to succumb to gravity.
&quot;Ta-daa, nothing to it.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh, there&#039;s definitely something to it all right.&quot;
&gt;She leans in close and takes a deep whiff of your crotch.
&quot;Hey!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yup, Jenna&#039;s definitely been here.&quot;
&gt;Doc encircles your waist again and presses her warm, furry torso against your leg.
&gt;&quot;So listen, in the interest of looking out for the crew&#039;s health, what say I take you for a test drive?&quot;
&gt;It takes a moment for the concept to leak into your inebriated brain that you&#039;re being propositioned.
&gt;Doc is clearly several years older than Jenna, but at least her bedside manner is much more pleasant.
&quot;What, right here in your office?&quot;
&gt;Doc turns you loose and goes to another door in the back of her examination room/office.
&gt;&quot;Ah, one of the perks of being the ship&#039;s medical officer, you see!&quot;
&gt;Doc presses the door control and the door slides open to reveal a small room with some medical equipment against the wall between two small but serviceable cots.
&gt;Doc turns back to you, her lecherous smile returning in full force.
&gt;&quot;As you so aptly put it, ta-daa! Fortunately no one is sick right now, so we&#039;ll have the sick bay all to ourselves.&quot;
&gt;She returns to you and takes hold of your arm once more, leading you to one of the cots.
&gt;You stumble a bit, still having your pants wrapped around your ankles, but manage to keep your balance until she gently shoves you into a seated position on the cot.
&gt;In a surprisingly smooth motion, Doc hops up into your lap, straddling your left thigh.
&gt;The room spins a bit as her forepaws roam appreciatively over your chest and shoulders.
&gt;She rests her weight on your thigh, and a damp sensation there makes its way into your consciousness.
&gt;&quot;So Anonymous, ever done it with a different species before today?&quot;
&quot;I can honestly say that I haven&#039;t.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well, life is made from new experiences, they say.&quot;
&gt;One paw slides up behind you neck and she pulls you into a sudden kiss.
&gt;It&#039;s different, but not exactly unpleasant, as she grinds her hips on your thigh a bit.
&gt;Doc breaks the kiss and begins peppering your neck and chest with kisses.
&quot;So this is part of the examination too?&quot;
&gt;The room is growing slightly darker and feels more spinny.
&gt;&quot;A very....important...part...to be sure...&quot; Doc replies between kisses.
&gt;She raises her face to look you in the eye.
&gt;&quot;But enough shop talk. Let&#039;s get this party started!&quot;
&gt;She pushes you back onto the cot, and you feel her warm furry torso spread out full length atop yours.
 
&gt;======&lt;
 
&gt;You wake up feeling like the floor of a taxi cab the morning after New Year&#039;s.
&gt;Your mouth is dry, and your tongue feels like leather.
&gt;Your head feels as though a very large puppy is using it for a chew toy.
&gt;A soft, regular beeping noise filters slowly into your consciousness.
&gt;You try to open your eyes, but the room seems insanely bright to you.
&gt;That also doesn&#039;t do your headache any favors, and you groan in pain.
&gt;Hangovers you&#039;ve had before, but this is the pits.
&gt;A slim paw touches your chest.
&gt;&quot;Finally returned to the land of the living have you?&quot;
&quot;Ugh... I almost wish I hadn&#039;t.&quot;
&gt;You regret speaking, since that also seems to aggravate your head.
&gt;&quot;Under the circumstances, not surprising. Let me guess, the Captain gave you a drink from her private stock?&quot;
&gt;It takes a moment before your fuzzy recollections catch up to the question.
&quot;Yeah.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ah. I&#039;m sorry, I should have guessed from your condition last night. A couple of quick questions - is 56 beats per minute a normal heart rate for you?&quot;
&gt;Keeping your eyes closed, you struggle to remember your field medical training.
&quot;That&#039;s a little low.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Uh-huh. And a body temperature of 36 degrees, measured rectally?&quot;
&quot;Also low.&quot;
&gt;Wait, rectally?
&gt;Doc curses under her breath.
&gt;&quot;Dammit Will, are you trying to kill him? Well, I think I have just the thing for you. Hold still.&quot;
&quot;Trust me, I don&#039;t wanna move-YOW!&quot;
&gt;A sharp pinch in your thigh causes you to yelp, more from surprise than pain.
&gt;You turn your head towards the sound of Doc&#039;s voice, your eyes opening to give her a reproachful glare.
&quot;That hurt!&quot;
&gt;She holds a small syringe up for you to see.
&gt;&quot;My own special hangover cocktail. A mild stimulant, some analgesic, and B-complex vitamins to get your metabolism working again. How do you feel?&quot;
&quot;Horrible.&quot;
&gt;Doc drops the needle into a red container.
&gt;&quot;If I had to guess...&quot;
&gt;You see a tight smile cross Doc&#039;s face.
&gt;&quot;Okay, in all honesty, I have to guess... your natural metabolism is slower than ours, so that Lorellian Bourbon hits you a lot harder.&quot;
&gt;You start to feel slightly better, so you sit up, rubbing your face.
&gt;You notice that Doc has her coat on now.
&quot;How long was I out?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nine hours. I stuck around to make sure you didn&#039;t check out.&quot;
&quot;Thanks.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t mention it.&quot;
&gt;You watch Doc as she shuts off the medical monitor next to your cot.
&quot;Umm... did we...&quot;
&gt;The unspoken question hangs in the air as Doc sighs.
&gt;&quot;No, we didn&#039;t. You passed out,&quot; she tells you, with more than a hint of disappointment tinging her voice.
&quot;Oh. Sorry.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Not your fault.&quot;
&gt;Doc turns to face you.
&gt;&quot;And as much as I would like to pick up where we left off, the Captain left instructions for you to meet the Chief Engineer in the cargo hold as soon as it&#039;s practical for you to do so.&quot;
&gt;Oh yeah, you had promised to do some things.
&quot;Okay, just give me a moment to recover.&quot;
&gt;Doc gives you a small smile.
&gt;&quot;So, what do you guys call yourselves?&quot;
&quot;Armored Service Couriers.&quot;
&gt;Doc smiles in amusement.
&gt;&quot;I mean your species.&quot;
&quot;Oh. Human. Homo Sapiens.&quot;
&gt;Doc writes that down.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll see what I can learn about you in case you run into any more problems like that.&quot;
&gt;Doc sets the notepad aside and gives you a hopeful smile.
&gt;&quot;So can I count on you to return later for your examination?&quot;
&quot;Yeah.&quot;
&gt;Doc pats your thigh, high and inside, which immediately reminds you that you&#039;re naked.
&gt;&quot;Good man. I&#039;ll give you some privacy until you feel ready to go.&quot;
 
&gt;======&lt;
 
/Welp, it&#039;s time to face your future./
&gt;That&#039;s what you tell yourself as you step into the cavernous hangar/cargo hold of The Serpent&#039;s Adventure.
&gt;Your hangover accompanies you, though it&#039;s not so strident after Doc&#039;s shot.
&gt;She definitely knows her business.
&gt;&quot;There you are!&quot; Zoe calls brightly to you from the cargo hatch of your ship.
&gt;Her unique coloration is visually jarring, given the current state of your mind.
/Must be a dye job./
&gt;Zoe skips down to where you stop to wait for her.
&gt;&quot;I gotta say, locking down your ship&#039;s computer was a new one. None of the others did that. What happened to you anyhow? You look like you&#039;ve been dragged backwards through a trash converter.&quot;
&quot;That&#039;s a pretty accurate assessment of how I feel. Up late last night celebrating.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh.&quot; Zoe takes a couple of cautious sniffs around your midriff. &quot;With Jenna?&quot;
&quot;Yeah. Among others.&quot;
&gt;The reason for the First Officer&#039;s unaffectionate display of affection towards you is beginning to become clear to you.
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s cool,&quot; Zoe says with apparent disinterest. &quot;So can you unlock the computer?&quot;
&quot;Sure I can.&quot;
&gt;You enter your ship and make your way to the cockpit, Zoe following curiously.
&gt;Along the way you notice that every compartment seems to have been gone over, many left standing open.
&gt;You&#039;ll have to talk to someone now to recover the rest of your personal effects.
&gt;You bat a couple of the compartments closed again so you don&#039;t hit your head on the doors.
&gt;You seat yourself in the pilot&#039;s position as Zoe hovers nearby, which finally arouses your curiosity.
&quot;Hey, I&#039;ve been meaning to ask - most of the crew hardly wear anything except you. Why&#039;s that?&quot;
&gt;Zoe reaches up and grabs the hem of her top and pulls it up, unashamedly flashing you.
&gt;&quot;Because I&#039;m the ship&#039;s engineer, and I work on everything. And I got tired of burning my tits on hot manifolds.&quot;
&gt;Zoe&#039;s unabashed display actually causes you to blush slightly, but on closer inspection you can see that she has a couple of nasty scars.
&quot;Ah... Duly noted.&quot;
&gt;All the displays have gone to sleep to conserve power, but they quickly come back to life when you tap a key on the data entry panel.
&gt;You then key in your ident code, 724651, and hit enter.
&gt;Further displays come to life, displaying new information on the vessel&#039;s status and systems.
&gt;&quot;Welcome, Anonymous.&quot;
&gt;Zoe starts slightly at the sound of the computer&#039;s voice synthesizer.
&quot;Relax, it&#039;s just the computer.&quot;
&gt;&quot;It talks? Keen gear!&quot;
&quot;Alright, shush. Computer, display shipping manifest for current load.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Working.&quot;
&gt;One of the displays changes to show an official-looking document, although it intrigues you now that some of the blocks on the form are left blank.
&quot;Computer, give me a hard copy.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Printing copy.&quot;
&gt;A slot opens up and quickly spits out a standard sheet of paper with the manifest printed on it.
&quot;Excuse me.&quot;
&gt;You reach past Zoe to grab the printout.
&gt;&quot;The computer understands what you say to it as well?&quot;
&quot;Yes, but keep quiet. Two people talking at once tends to confuse it.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh. Sorry.&quot;
&gt;You turn back to the console.
&quot;Computer, release cargo clamps for off-loading, 724651.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Command authenticated.&quot;
&gt;Just one last thing to do.
&gt;But you hesitate.
&gt;Once you do this, there is no turning back.
&gt;You take a deep breath and let it out.
&quot;Computer, dereliction protocol, 724651.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Command authenticated. Good-bye.&quot;
&gt;The displays in the cockpit dissolve into a random jumble of meaningless data before going blank.
&gt;&quot;Dereliction protocol? What&#039;s that?&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s a security protocol when the ship is considered unserviceable, due to mishap or capture. Basically it wipes all the core memory, except for the flight log recorder, which is on a separate core.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Aw, what&#039;d you have to do that for?&quot; Zoe whines.
&gt;&quot;I could have salvaged that computer and put it to work on our ship.&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s a very limited computer, and for security reasons it&#039;s very hard to get at.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I enjoy a challenge.&quot;
&gt;You stand up, folding the manifest, which you tuck into a pocket on your tunic.
&quot;Never mind. Let&#039;s get that security container off the ship.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sure! I&#039;ll get Jo to help.&quot; Zoe runs out to the courier ship&#039;s cargo ramp and calls for Jo.
&gt;You head back to the cargo hold and over to the squat, blocky black shape of the MK4 Secure Transport Container.
&gt;Just then the biggest ferret you&#039;ve ever seen walks into the hold, and looks around curiously.
&quot;You must be Jo.&quot;
&gt;Jo looks at the sound of your voice, but turns away shyly.
&gt;&quot;Jo, we need to take this thing off and secure it in our hold,&quot; Zoe tells the bosun.
&gt;&quot;Oh, sure. Let me get a pallet jack.&quot;
&quot;No need for that.&quot;
&gt;You reach down and unplug the power umbilical from the side of the container.
&gt;&quot;What? This thing must weigh at least half a ton!&quot;
&quot;Three-quarters, actually, but because of that...&quot;
&gt;You open the control panel and activate the container&#039;s repulsor field.
&gt;A blue glow develops beneath the container and it levitates slightly.
&quot;We can move it now, slowly. It doesn&#039;t exactly track straight, and it can be a handful.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Neat,&quot; Zoe says admiringly, while Jo just looks at you and blushes slightly.
&gt;You find her shyness kinda amusing, considering that Jo is as tall as you are and has a few scars, giving her a gruff appearance.
&quot;C&#039;mon Jo, you take that end and I&#039;ll take this. Be careful on the ramp.&quot;
&gt;&quot;O-okay.&quot;
&gt;Between the two of you, you manhandle (Tika-handle?) the heavy container down to the Serpent&#039;s cargo deck, where Jo expertly stows it and gripes it down.
&gt;&quot;Jo is our bosun, she handles all the deck gear and small vessels,&quot; Zoe tells you.
&quot;Thanks for the introduction.&quot;
&gt;You can&#039;t tell if they take your sarcasm for what it is, but the moment ends abruptly.
&gt;&quot;Attention on deck!&quot; Jo calls loudly.
&gt;You turn off the repulsor field and look to see the Captain coming towards you.
&gt;&quot;Knock it off already, this isn&#039;t the Navy. So Anonymous, you done fooling around with your ship?&quot;
&quot;Yes. Here&#039;s the container.&quot;
&gt;&quot;And I can rig power to keep it charged,&quot; Zoe says, coming down your cargo ramp.
&gt;You see that she has the power umbilical for the container with her, which she has cut off of your ship.
&gt;&quot;Good,&quot; Captain Will says, eyeing the container. &quot;We&#039;re almost at the rendezvous point. Did you get the shipping manifest?&quot;
&gt;You unfold the manifest and show it to her.
&quot;Yes. The receiving entity is Vindada &amp; D&#039;raang Shipyard, Tolan City, Mytus VI. The landing coordinates are here.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Good.&quot; The Captain inspects the manifest.
&gt;There are a few things on the manifest that don&#039;t look right to you though.
&gt;No value is listed for the insurance block.
&gt;Another block that should show the name of the cargo&#039;s owner is also blank.
&gt;The cargo description is &quot;Data Processing Equipment&quot;, which is certainly not the sort of cargo you would expect in a MK4.
&gt;&quot;Jo, prepare Anonymous&#039; ship for jettison. Anonymous, you&#039;ll come with me to the bridge.&quot;
&gt;Jo snaps to attention, evidently a veteran.
&gt;&quot;Aye-aye, Captain.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Anonymous, what power does the container take?&quot; Zoe asks you.
&quot;Um, 36 volts, direct current.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Easy,&quot; Zoe says with a grin, and goes to get the parts she needs.
 
&gt;======&lt;
 
&gt;After following Captain Will through a few unfamiliar passages, you arrive in the ship&#039;s bridge.
&gt;It&#039;s about what you&#039;d expect: a number of different consoles, manned by Tika who are intently focused on the information presented by their displays.
&gt;Looking around at the displays and equipment, you are surprised to find that they connect with some memories from your military days.
&quot;Is this a X&#039;tixian ship?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes. You know about the X&#039;tixians?&quot;
&quot;Faced them in combat a few times. Giant cockroaches with really bad attitudes.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; Romy pipes up from her position at the ship&#039;s weapons console, &quot;Crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.&quot;
&gt;Romy&#039;s description makes you feel slightly ill, but draws a wry smile from the Captain.
&gt;&quot;The Serpent&#039;s Adventure is a converted X&#039;tixian Raider. Most of the equipment is well-suited to her current employment, though I wish their computer technology was more advanced. But we make do.&quot;
&gt;The Captain turns to the navigation table, which is occupied by a youngish-looking, skinny Tika with a brown coat, wearing glasses and a colorful vest.
&gt;&quot;We&#039;ve reached the rendezvous point Captain.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Very well Fifi. After we jettison the courier vessel, take us into the asteroids.&quot;
&gt;&quot;The asteroids? Um, sure. I can do that.&quot;
&gt;Funny, she doesn&#039;t sound so sure.
&gt;&quot;We need to be able to watch the rendezvous discreetly.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes Ma&#039;am,&quot; Fifi responds, pulling up a star chart with the asteroid field on her display.
&gt;&quot;Fifi is a stellar mathematician. She has to be, the navigation computer was damaged when we captured the ship.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Thank you, Ma&#039;am.&quot; Fifi looks up and gives you both a shy smile as she crunches numbers with a pencil and paper.
&gt;A comm panel beeps and the Captain presses a switch on it.
&gt;&quot;Bridge, Captain.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Bridge, Cargo. We&#039;re ready to dump the courier vessel.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Very well. Get it done.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes Captain.&quot;
&gt;You are reduced to an observer, occasionally moving out of the way as one of the Tika squeezes past you in the densely packed control space.
&gt;As soon as your ship is clear of the hold, Fifi quickly maneuvers The Serpent&#039;s Adventure into the asteroid field, turning it so that they can watch the rendezvous.
&gt;&quot;All stations, this is the Captain, power down all active sensors and secure external communications. I don&#039;t want them knowing we&#039;re here.&quot;
&gt;&quot;What about weapons?&quot; Romy asks.
&gt;&quot;Optical targeting only. Turn the trackers off.&quot;
&gt;Romy looks less than pleased with her orders, but complies.
&quot;Now what?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Now... we wait, and see if you&#039;re right.&quot;
&gt;You hate waiting.
&quot;And if I&#039;m not right?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well,&quot; the Captain says, &quot;the original plan was to space you, make the delivery and collect our fee. That&#039;s still an option.&quot;
&gt;In the face of the Captain&#039;s matter-of-fact statement, the hunch you had now seems absurdly flimsy, though you had felt certain about it last night.
&gt;&quot;Time to rendezvous?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Seven minutes, Captain.&quot;
 
&gt;======&lt;
 
&gt;Seven minutes drag by with the weight of years.
&gt;Then eleven more minutes do the same.
&gt;You&#039;re starting to feel increasingly unsure of yourself.
&gt;Romy is giving you a significantly hostile glance from her position at the ship&#039;s weapons control console.
&quot;Are they always this late?&quot;
&gt;&quot;They&#039;re usually pretty prompt, in fact.&quot;
&gt;You swallow nervously.
&gt;&quot;Captain, energy field detected, ships coming out of warp.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ships?&quot; The Captain says, with particular emphasis on the plurality, her eyebrows rising.
&gt;One moment there was nothing there except the faint speck of your courier ship.
&gt;In the next moment, two warships suddenly appear, quickly decelerating as they approach the rendezvous point.
&quot;Is that what they usually send to meet you?&quot;
&gt;&quot;No,&quot; the Captain says quietly, &quot;it certainly isn&#039;t.&quot;
&gt;The Captain turns to Romy at the weapons console.
&gt;&quot;Can you make out any markings?&quot;
&gt;You already know what they are. You recognize the shape of the vessels.
&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; Romy replies, her voice tinged with venom, &quot;they&#039;re Espos.&quot;
&gt;Two Security Police Cruisers, in fact.
&gt;Quite a reception committee.
&gt;The two massive warships slowly approach your courier ship, and you see a small shuttle make its way from one of them to your ship.
&quot;I think they&#039;re going to be pretty pissed when they find it empty.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I think you&#039;re right, Anonymous,&quot; the Captain says.
&gt;She turns to the Navigation table.
&gt;&quot;Fifi, maneuvering thrusters only, take us down to the surface of one of the large asteroids. No landing sensors.&quot;
&gt;Fifi gulps nervously.
&gt;&quot;Yes Ma&#039;am.&quot;
&gt;The Tika at the helm gets up and moves out of the way as Fifi takes direct control of maneuvering the ship towards a largish, irregularly-shaped asteroid.
&gt;You keep your eyes fixed on the warships as the shuttle docks with your ship.
&gt;&quot;Captain, sensor sweeps, they&#039;re looking around.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Easy, the debris field should conceal us. Fifi?&quot;
&gt;&quot;One minute to contact, Captain.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Quick as you can, please.&quot;
&gt;The bridge falls silent, but you can practically hear how tense everyone is.
&gt;&quot;We can take &#039;em,&quot; Romy growls.
&gt;&quot;Too risky, and I would prefer not to tip our hand just yet,&quot; the Captain admonishes her.
&quot;Those are the new cruisers. They&#039;re heavily armed and armored. If the Security Police are involved, this might go higher than I think.&quot;
&gt;You REALLY want to know what&#039;s in that security container now.
&gt;&quot;Impact imminent,&quot; Fifi calls out, &quot;BRACE!&quot;
&gt;The Serpent&#039;s Adventure touches down on the asteroid with a gentle bump.
&gt;&quot;Shut down all non-essential systems. Minimal power signature.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes Captain.&quot;
&gt;The lighting on the bridge goes dark, as do some of the displays.
&gt;You watch as the shuttle detaches from your ship and accelerates back towards its mothership.
&gt;Romy is still watching you, the expression on her face unreadable.
&gt;&quot;Captain! Fire control trackers!&quot;
&gt;&quot;On us?&quot;
&gt;&quot;No Ma&#039;am!&quot;
&gt;Your attention is riveted on the warships, and so you are very nearly blinded by the bright light that erupts from that direction.
&gt;The Security Police warships have obliterated your courier vessel.
&gt;&quot;Yeah, they&#039;re pissed all right,&quot; Romy observes.
&gt;&quot;Temper, temper,&quot; the Captain observes wryly.
&gt;&quot;Captain, long-range sensor sweeps. They&#039;re scanning the area.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Very well. We keep quiet, they shouldn&#039;t find us.&quot;
&gt;Several more tense minutes pass until the Security Police warships get tired of looking, or at least hanging around.
&gt;&quot;Captain, hyperspace insertion energy field detected.&quot;
&gt;And in the next moment, both Cruisers are gone.
&gt;You realize that you&#039;ve been holding your breath and let it out in a long sigh.
&gt;&quot;Well well, Anonymous. It seems you were right about this so far. We&#039;ll make a pirate out of you yet.&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re not sure whether that&#039;s a compliment or an insult.
&gt;Some of the tension on the bridge begins to dissipate, as the watch standers express their relief to one another.
&quot;So what&#039;s next?&quot;
&gt;&quot;We&#039;ll lie doggo here for a little while longer, just to be sure. In the meantime... Fifi?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes Ma&#039;am?&quot; the younger Tika pipes up from the helm.
&gt;&quot;Plot us a hyperspace jump to the Mytus System. Let&#039;s see if Anonymous is right about the rest of it.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Aye-aye, Ma&#039;am. We&#039;ll be ready to make the jump in one hour.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Very well.&quot;
&gt;Captain Will takes a deep breath and exhales, some of the tension draining away, then turns to you with a friendly smile.
&gt;&quot;Come with me. Let&#039;s get you some permanent quarters so you don&#039;t have to sleep in the sick bay again.&quot;
&gt;It somehow doesn&#039;t surprise you in the least to learn that she knew about that.</textarea>
