It was early Autumn.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your best friend&#039;s name was Zoey. She was an Anthro German Shepard, and the same age as you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had been the best of friends since childhood.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You still lived relatively close to each other, so unlike the rest of your childhood friends, the two of you had remained close.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey worked as a police officer, her job being to detect drugs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Having the nose of a dog had its benefits in her line of work, and after a large successful drug bust, she had landed some vacation time as a nice bonus.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You worked at some shitty office, but you did well at your job.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When Zoey had told you about the time off she had, the two of you had agreed to take a small vacation together.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were using up most of your vacation time for the year, but you didn&#039;t care. This is what it&#039;s for anyways, right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were sitting in the passenger seat, staring out the window, watching the landscape fly by.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hey, Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You turned to look at Zoey. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was a German Shepherd, with light brown fur on her front, and black fur on her back. She stood at 6&#039;3&quot;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We&#039;re only about 20 minutes away now.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It&#039;s right next to a lake... I used to love the place when I was a kid.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She had gone often as a child, but her parents had never taken you along.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoeys&#039; parents weren&#039;t too big on Humans.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It didn&#039;t matter now, though. They had moved down to Florida a while ago now, so they couldn&#039;t exactly protest to Zoey bringing you up to the cabin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lean back into the seat, and close your eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell Zoey to wake you up when you reach the cabin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey nods, keeping her attention on the wheel.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Okay, Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re startled awake by Zoey shaking your shoulder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come on, wake up! We&#039;re here!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her to stop shaking you, and she smiles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Get up, I want to show you the place!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sounds pretty excited, and as she gets out of the door, you get a nice view of her tail wagging. And her ass.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quickly look away, and get out of the car.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had never quite taken it to the next level with Zoey when you were younger. Mostly because of her parents.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you had dated different people in the past, but nothing had ever come out of the relationships. None of them had ever lasted longer than a few months.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You move away from the car, over to where Zoey is excitedly looking at the cabin, her tail wagging wildly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She turns to look at you, a wide grin on her face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So, what do you think, Anon?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ve got to say. You&#039;re impressed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The cabin is only one story high, but it looks pretty spacious from the outside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Theres a large lake less than 100 feet away from the cabin, with a small shed sitting near a dock. That must be where they keep the canoe.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her it looks nice, and she ushers you inside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s a bit musty smelling in the cabin, but it overall looks pretty good.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It has a small cooking area with a table and chairs near the entrance, leading into a large living room with couches, some bookshelves, and a large stone fireplace against the wall.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see three rooms with doors. One is probably the bathroom, and the other two must be bedrooms.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It looks a bit dusty, but overall nicer than you expected.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell Zoey this, and her tail continues to wag.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Thanks, Anon! I haven&#039;t been up here in... Four years? I&#039;m pretty sure?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shakes her head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Whatever, it doesn&#039;t matter.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gestures back to the door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Alright, now lets go get our luggage in, and then we can settle in. Sound good?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod, and the two of you head back out to her car.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you were spending a week up here, so you had brought plenty of stuff.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The car was filled to the brim.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey drove an old, beat up Jeep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you were standing at the trunk, staring at the luggage.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Alright, Anon. You grab the food, and I&#039;ll grab the clothes.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even though she was bigger and stronger than you, she of course still made you lug the heavy stuff inside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come on, Anon! Work those arms! Maybe someday you&#039;ll be as strong as me!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That was pretty unlikely. You could answer calls and fill out spreadsheets at the speed of sound, but you were seriously lacking in the fitness department. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You weren&#039;t fat or anything, but you didn&#039;t exactly impress the ladies with your twig arms.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was a point Zoey had always joked with you about.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It took a few trips, but you had finally managed to get all the food inside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you were stocking the empty cabinets and fridge, Zoey plopped down on the couch, stretching and yawning.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon, I got all our stuff sitting in our room.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait, our room? You ask her what she meant, and she responds:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well theres two bedrooms. My parents used one of them, and Me and my brothers used the other one.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Since I&#039;m pretty sure neither of us are gonna fit in bunk-beds designed for children, we&#039;re gonna have to share a room. Oh, and a bed.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were a bit nervous. You had never shared a bed with Zoey, and you didn&#039;t want to make things weird.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You offer to sleep on one of the couches, but she quickly replies:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Heck no, Anon. These couches are all old, musty, and cold.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What? Are you intimidated by...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gives you a semi-serious look, then sarcastically strikes a bodybuilder&#039;s pose, flexing her muscles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;ALL OF THIS?!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You chuckle, shaking your head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you&#039;ll share the bed, and she smiles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry, Anon. It&#039;ll be fine.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you settle in to the cabin, and pretty soon the skies begin to darken a bit. Looking at your phone, you can see It&#039;s 7&#039;o clock.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well, it looks like we should get started on dinner, Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod, and ask her what she&#039;s in the mood for.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I think we should cook that chicken we brought. I know my Dad keeps a little propane camping grill around here somewhere. I just have to find it...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you didn&#039;t see it when you were stocking the cabinets, and she shrugs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m going to look around.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Tell you what. While I&#039;m looking around the cabin, why don&#039;t you walk around the property? You know... familiarize yourself with the place.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It sounds like a good idea to you, and you tell her you will. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles, nodding quickly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Great! Okay, I&#039;ll come get you when we&#039;re ready to start cooking. Take your time. Please.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She seems pretty eager to get you out of the cabin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you get up. Zoey heads into one of the other rooms, and you leave out the front door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It wasn&#039;t very bright outside, but the sun was still up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look around, taking in the scenery.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The cabin was surrounded on almost every side by a thick forest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;On one side a large lake sat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Going over to the lake, you step on the small dock.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey had told you that her Father had often fished in the lake, then cooked what he had caught for dinner.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sound like something you should try and do before you left.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had gone fishing a lot as a child, and you had enjoyed it. You didn&#039;t have much time for it nowadays, though.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Stepping off of the dock, you approach an old shed where the dock meets the land.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to open the door, and the hinges creek loudly as it slowly opens.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Inside it&#039;s pretty dark...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get out your phone and turn on Its flashlight. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now you can clearly see the interior. You see a couple canoes hanging up on the side of the shed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nice, you could go fishing right out in the middle of the lake.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;On the other sides of the shed, you just see various tools and some fishing stuff. Nothing too interesting.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You exit the shed, being sure to close the door behind you. The door has no lock or latch, but this place is so far out in the wilderness that you&#039;re pretty sure burglary isn&#039;t much of a concern.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You step over to where the clearing around the cabin meets the forest, peering into the dark woods.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;These were all old growth trees, and they were some of the tallest ones you had ever seen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Most trees still had all of their leaves on them, although they had all turned various shades of red, orange, and yellow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As a result, the forest had a dark, ominous look to them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was starting to get really dark outside, and you think you better wrap up this unoffical tour of the propery.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decide to walk around the cabin before you head back inside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t see anything you wouldn&#039;t expect. There&#039;s a decent sized woodpile for the fireplace out here covered by a tarp, and a small spot to cut more if needed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you walk near one of the windows by the bedrooms though, you hear a strange noise coming from within.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It sounds like Zoey, but she&#039;s making these weird grunting noises.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe she&#039;s moving stuff around inside?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decide to peer through the window.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you see what she&#039;s doing though, it makes your heart skip a beat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s laying on a bed with her pants around her ankles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One of her hands is in her mouth, in an attempt to muffle the sounds that she&#039;s making. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her other hand is knuckle deep in her canine pussy, a few fingers quickly pumping in and out of her triangular folds.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Holy shit, she&#039;s really going to town on herself!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You duck out of sight from the window before she sees you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fuck, this must be why she was so eager for you to get out of the cabin. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You knew that neither of you had dated anyone in awhile, but you had no clue that she was this pent up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decide to wait outside until she comes to get you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn&#039;t want to risk... interrupting her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You move away from the back of the cabin, walking back to the front.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You go over and sit on the dock, and watch the lake, trying to get the image of your best friend masturbating out of your mind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;About 10 more minutes pass, and you hear the cabin door open.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon! I found the grill! Come on, let&#039;s start making dinner!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You yell back that you&#039;ll be right in, and you hear the door shut.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, time to head inside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh, and start to walk back to the cabin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Opening the door, you&#039;re greeted by the sight of Zoey fiddling with the grill, a frown on her face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shut the door, and hang your coat up on a small hook.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks up at you, then speaks up:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon, I can&#039;t get this stupid thing to light. Can you give me a hand?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You say of course, and you look at it with her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s a standard miniature propane camping grill.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The first thing that comes to mind is the propane.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You check the small cylinder of propane, and notice that it&#039;s empty.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You let Zoey know, and she frowns.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I didn&#039;t see any more propane in the closet...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You offer to run out to a store real quick. These propane cylinders were pretty cheap, and you could be back within 45 minutes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You sure, Anon? You don&#039;t know this area too well.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you&#039;ll just use the GPS on your phone, and she considers your idea for a moment before speaking.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well... Okay, Anon. Just be quick. Here&#039;s the keys.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She hands you the car keys, and you pocket them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you&#039;ll make it quick, and you grab your jacket, slipping it back on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You head out the door, and towards the Jeep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Climbing into the Jeep, you get out your phone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You set the GPS to lead you towards a local shop. They should have propane.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pat your pocket to make sure your wallet is on you, and then you stick the key in the ignition, turning it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Jeep starts up, and you pull out into the darkness, the headlights lighting your way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You traverse the bumpy dirt road, before turning onto the main road.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Be Zoey.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were an Anthro German Shepard.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were watching your best friend Anon as he got into your car, and then left the property.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You frowned. You should have gone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anon should be fine. You knew he was a good driver.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Damn it, you should&#039;ve brought propane! You always forget something!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh, sitting down on one of the couches, a puff of dust shooting out from the fabric.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This place was a lot dustier than you remembered. But then again, it HAD been empty for the last four years or so, after all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were thinking about Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You really liked him... And not as a friend, either.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had invited him up to the cabin so you could get to know him a lot... &quot;better&quot; than you already did.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But sadly, you don&#039;t think he had picked up on any of the hints you had been giving him. He was too sweet for his own good.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had bent over when you got out of the car to give him a nice view of your ass, but you saw him look away quickly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then you had teased him about being weak, and you cursed yourself for doing that. You think he might be a little self-conscious about it...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had made him wait outside while you got yourself off... You were hoping he would have come back inside, and caught you in the act.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sadly though, he had followed your instructions to wait outside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You huff, scratching at your loins.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were going into heat pretty soon, and you could feel an itch starting to form deep inside you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were hoping Anon could help you &quot;scratch&quot; it, but the chances of that weren&#039;t looking too good...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh shit, what if he didn&#039;t even LIKE Anthros in the way you were thinking...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well... You still had lots of time. You had planned to stay the whole week here, and that should be plenty of time to convince him to help you out with your heat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stand up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decide to distract yourself from the growing heat in your pants by doing some work.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You move over to the kitchen, noticing the dust on the counters.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You should clean it up a bit while Anon is gone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking into the cabinet under the sink, you grab an old bottle of cleaning fluid. This stuff doesn&#039;t go bad, right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grab a tattered rag, and spray some of the lemon-scented fluid onto the counter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You begin to clean the dust off of the counters. You&#039;re pretty certain that Anon had allergies, and you didn&#039;t want the trip to be ruined by him sneezing every couple of seconds.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a short time, you finish dusting the kitchen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking at the rest of the cabin, you decide you should clean a bit more before Anon gets back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You think that it should make him happy to come back and see that everything is clean.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decide to work on the bedroom first.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had been telling Anon the truth about how the other beds were too small, but you didn&#039;t tell him about the inflatable mattress your parents kept in the cabin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wanted him close, and him sleeping on some cold plastic bubble just wouldn&#039;t do.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Besides, sleeping next to you would be more comfortable.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smiled at the thought.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look at the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There was a small damp spot on the bed where you had got yourself off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stripped the dusty blanket and sheets off of the bed, and shove them into the closet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had brought your own bedding, and you put it on the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hope Anon will be comfortable.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your tail wags at the thought of him snuggled up close to you, grasping onto your chest for warmth...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe he would even grab a bit lower...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your tail wags violently at the thought, and you can even feel a small twitch in your pants.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shake your head at the thought, and walk back into the small kitchen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had to wait for now. Anon was going to be back soon, and you were going to cook him a nice dinner.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then the two of you would go to sleep. Together.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All of a sudden, your canine ears detect the sound of a car pulling up the dirt road leading to the cabin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Peering out the window, you can see your Jeep pull up to the cabin. The lights in it shut off, and you see Anon get out with a couple bags in his hand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile, and sit in the kitchen, waiting for him to enter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Be Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It had taken awhile to get to the store and back, but you got everything you needed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had even picked up a couple extra things. Some fishing bait, and air freshener.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The cabin had a stale smell to it, and you intended to fix that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull up to the cabin, and you shut off the car.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grab the bags, and exit the Jeep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Locking the door behind you, you walk up the cabin with two bags in your hands.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had gotten four canisters of the propane, which enough to last you the week. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or at least you hope it will. You really don&#039;t want to run out again. Not many Humans live out in this part of the state, and you had gotten some strange looks from the people at the store.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You push the door open, and are greeted by Zoey&#039;s smiling face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;How did it go, Anon?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you got everything you needed, and you set the bags down on the counter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey rifles through it, and cocks her head at you when she sees the fishing bait.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Okay, I can understand the air freshener, but what&#039;s with the worms?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I thought we were having chicken.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her that you saw some fishing stuff in the shed, and that you wanted to try your hand at some fishing maybe tomorrow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh, Okay! I was never really into fishing, but I could chat with you while you did it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her that would be fine, and her tail wags.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Okay, let&#039;s try to get this grill working.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You disconnect the old propane canister from the grill, and toss it in the bin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You attach the new one, and light the grill.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It flares to life, and the two of you smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Thanks, Anon!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get the chicken out of the fridge and put it on the counter. It was just some cheap chicken breasts you had picked up on the way here, but they should cook up nicely.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell Zoey that you&#039;ll cook, but she stops you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;No, Anon. You go sit down and relax. I want to cook.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you&#039;d be fine making the chicken, but she isn&#039;t hearing it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shakes her head and tells you:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;No. I&#039;m going to cook for you. I want to treat you. I know you survive mostly off of frozen dinners and takeout. I know you can&#039;t cook for shit.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You frown a bit at the unintended insult, and head over to the couch a bit dejected.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You plop down on the couch, and stretch out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry, Anon. I&#039;ll have it done for you soon. I promise you it&#039;ll be real good~&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile, and sit there, watching the German Shepard cook for you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;20 minutes pass, and eventually the chicken is done.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey had popped some green beans into the old microwave and heated them up for the two of you also.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She plates the meals and calls you over.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon, it&#039;s ready! Come on and sit next to me here.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pulls out the chair next to her as you walk into the kitchen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sit next to her at the table, and she slides a dish in front of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I hope you like it, Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her it looks good, and she grins at you, her tail slapping against you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you begin to eat, and you have to admit. It&#039;s pretty good.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you are pretty silent as you eat, more focused on eating than you are on chatting.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pretty soon the two of you are done eating.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey takes your empty plate and starts to get up, but you quickly stop her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her that you&#039;ll wash the dishes, and she frowns.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;But Anon-&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You cut her off, and tell her that you&#039;ll take care of it. She made you a nice dinner, and you want to pay her back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles, and gives you a small hug, her wet nose poking your ear. You can hear her sniff at you a bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She happily sighs, her tail wagging.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Thanks, Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m going to go... Take a quick shower. Before bed.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She seems eager to go shower.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You watch her as she quickly rushes into the bathroom, shutting the door behind her, the lock clicking shut.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can hear the pipes in the wall creek as warm water rushes through them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can hear water in the shower, and steam drifts from underneath the door as you wash the dishes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you had cleaned your plates, so you don&#039;t have to scrub the plates too hard.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re done pretty quickly, and you wait on the couch for her to finish. You wanted to shower too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Soon, you hear the water in the shower shut off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear a small whine from in the bathroom, and the door opens a tiny bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon? I need you to do me a small favor...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I, Uh... Forgot to grab clothes.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Would you mind just... Going through my stuff and getting me something to wear?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Just... You know. A shirt, pajama pants... Panties...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fuck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Sorry, Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her it&#039;s fine, and you go into the bedroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her suitcase is on the floor, and you unzip it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You uncomfortably dig around in it, looking for something she can wear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It feels a bit wrong going through her stuff, but she DID tell you to do this...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grab some flannel pants for her, a shirt, and a bra.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had never thought that being unable to find panties would ever be a problem you had.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Opening one of the side pockets on the suitcase, you stick your hand inside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull out a pair of clean undergarments.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s a plain white pair of panties, with some simple lace on the sides.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grab everything and stumble back over to the bathroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You knock on the door, and a familiar muzzle peeks out, eyeing you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You thrust the clothes through the crack in the door, and it closes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a couple minutes, the tall German Shepard walks out, and into the bedroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Thanks, Anon! I&#039;m going to get ready for bed now. You coming with?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you&#039;re going to take a quick shower too, and she nods.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You follow her into the bedroom, and grab some of your own clothes out of your suitcase.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey smiles at you as you leave, settling under the covers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Entering the bathroom, you lock the door behind you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The bathroom looks pretty standard. It has a normal toilet, a sink.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The bathtub stands out a bit though. It&#039;s very large and takes up half of the room. It has a showerhead, too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shit, you forgot your soap.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You open the bathroom door and enter the bedroom again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you get inside, you see Zoey on the floor next to your suitcase. She&#039;s holding up one of your shirts to her nose, smelling it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks terrified when she notices you standing there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;OH. Uh, hi. Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m just... putting your clothes away.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I swear I&#039;m not being a creep.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is awkward. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her that you needed the bar of soap you had in your suitcase.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ummm... Here.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She hands you the small green bar of soap, and you quickly shuffle back into the bathroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were just going to pretend you didn&#039;t see that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lock the door behind you again, and undress.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You climb into the large bathtub, and turn on the water.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lucky for you, Zoey had only taken a quick shower, and there was a lot of hot water left.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you wash yourself, your mind drifts to thinking about Zoey.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;More specifically, what you saw her doing earlier.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You close your eyes, trying to think of something else, but it&#039;s no use.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You begin to stiffen as your mind is filled with images of Zoey getting herself off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well... You might as well &quot;take care&quot; of yourself while you&#039;re in here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your hand drifts down below the belt, and images of naked Anthros fill your mind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;15 minutes later, you sigh, turning off the shower.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had managed to relieve yourself, and were feeling satisfied.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All of a sudden you realize you had just jerked off to the memory of your best friend naked.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel a bit ashamed, but what could you do?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn&#039;t want to have a boner while you were sleeping next to her. You didn&#039;t think that would go over too well.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You dry yourself off, and get dressed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Leaving the bathroom, you head into the bedroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey is sitting under the covers, looking at her phone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She notices you enter, and quickly turns it off, setting it on the nightstand next to her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I kept it warm for you, Anon. Now come on, It&#039;s time to sleep...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You notice she was sleeping on the side of the bed farthest away from the window.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were going to have to sleep on the spot where you saw her masturbating.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh. Well, at least she had changed the sheets.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey gives you a concerned look, popping up a bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Something wrong, Anon?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shake your head and tell her no. You&#039;re just... tired.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well... Okay. Go to sleep now, alright?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You climb in bed, easing yourself under the covers. You leave a buffer zone between yourself and Zoey.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey gets comfortable, laying on her side, facing you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re laying on your back, staring at the wooden ceiling.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Goodnight, Anon...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey shuts off the light, and the room fills with darkness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All you can hear is the sound of Zoey gently breathing, insect noises from out the window, and your own heartbeat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You close your eyes, and eventually you drift to sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wake up, your eyes sliding open.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was still dark.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why did you feel so... Hot?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re laying on your side, and you try to sit up, but realize you can&#039;t.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What the hell?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh shit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While the two of you were sleeping, Zoey had pulled you closer to her, and trapped you in her arms.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Both of her arms were wrapped tight around your chest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was essentially spooning you, her legs pressing against hers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stay dead silent, listening. You can hear her gently breathing, her warm breath making a damp spot on your neck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At least she&#039;s asleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The way you see it, you have two options.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Either wriggle your way out of her grasp...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or just go with it and go back to sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her grasp was a little tight, though... And her breathing on you was getting a bit annoying.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You resolve to try and get out of her grasp. You just hope she didn&#039;t wake up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wiggle a bit, trying to get her arm loose.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At first she doesn&#039;t respond, so you get a bit bolder and try a bit harder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You manage to pull away from her, and scooch back over to your side of the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear a small whining noise from Zoey, and she starts to toss and turn.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She ends up grabbing a ton of blankets and cuddling with them, her breathing returning to normal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, now you had another problem.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey wasn&#039;t spooning you anymore, which was good, but now you had no blankets covering you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It pretty damn cold. You should have lighted the fireplace before the two of you had gone to sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sit up, looking at Zoey.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s snoozing quietly, her arms and legs wrapped around a lump of blankets.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You gently try to tug some of them back, only to be met by a quiet growl.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She had lost you, but there was no way she was going to lose the blankets.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You let out a frustrated sigh, and get out of the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You go to the bathroom, and turn on the light.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Might as well piss while you&#039;re up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You finish in the bathroom, and you almost jump out of your skin when you see Zoey appear in the doorway.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon? What are you doing up? It&#039;s late... You woke me up...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She seems more tired than even you are.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lie, telling her you had woken up to go to the bathroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Naturally, it&#039;s pretty difficult to convince a police dog of a lie.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;No, really. Why are you up?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You yawn a bit, and tell her that she had stolen all the blankets and you were cold.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That seems to wake her up a bit, and she quickly apologizes:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Whuh? Oh! I&#039;m sorry! Here, come back to bed, I&#039;ll give you an extra blanket.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you&#039;re fine, but she isn&#039;t having any of it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She holds your hand, and leads you back into the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pretty much tucks you into the bed like she was your grandmother, covering you in a mountain of blankets.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She slips under the covers, her furry shoulder touching yours.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;There. I won&#039;t let you get cold. I&#039;d kick myself if you got a cold while we were up here.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You thank her, and she pats your chest under the covers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Goodnight, Anon. See you in the morning. I lo-&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stops herself, a nervous look on her face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uh... Goodnight.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her goodnight, and the two of you drift back off to sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wake up to the sun shining through the window, light penetrating your eyelids.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You groan, and slowly get up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The first thing you notice is Zoey isn&#039;t next to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The next thing you notice is the smell of hashbrowns and bacon cooking.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh sweet, she was making the two of you breakfast.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You throw on some jeans and a t-shirt out of your suitcase, balling up your sleepwear and jamming it in a small bag you brought for dirty clothes. You leave your phone on the nightstand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Walking out into the kitchen while rubbing your eyes, you see Zoey standing there over the small cooktop.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh, hi Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I already ate, so I thought I&#039;d make you some breakfast.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see her tail wagging slowly as she greets you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You thank her, and her tail wags faster.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It&#039;ll be ready in a minute here, Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sit down at the kitchen table, and the German Shepard plates your food, setting it in front of you with a smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you begin to eat, she sits next to you, leaning forward onto the counter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks at you in the eyes, a wide smile on her face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Sooo Anon. The temperature outside is supposed to get into the mid 80s today.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I was thinking... You want to do some swimming in the lake?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It&#039;ll probably be the last time you&#039;ll be able to swim outside for the year. It&#039;s supposed to cool off tomorrow.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You consider the thought for a moment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you would, but you didn&#039;t bring a swimsuit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh, it doesn&#039;t matter, Anon. You can just go swimming in your underwear.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Or... Nothing at all. I don&#039;t care either way.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ok, so she was suggesting that you skinny dip.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Swimming was pretty fun though, and you couldn&#039;t remember the last time you had a whole lake to yourself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you were game for it, and she sits up, grinning.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Great! That&#039;s good to hear.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m going to head out and check the lake. See what the uh, temperature is.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod, and she quickly gets up and leaves the house, her tail wagging excitedly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She must really like swimming.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That or she really wants to get you naked. It had always sort of been an inside joke between the two of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey had casually flirted with you in the past jokingly, but she was seeming a bit serious now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And the way she had been cooking for you, masturbating right after you had left the cabin, cleaned for you while you were gone, and even going so far as to sniff your clothing...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh shit. The realization hits you like debt hitting the Greek economy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When was her next heat cycle due?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There was no way you were going to ask her, but you knew it was going to be soon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She always got time off when she was on heat, as her line of work couldn&#039;t afford any distractions while on the job.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No wonder the police station had been so willing to give her vacation time. She would have been off duty anyways this week.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Damn. She had brought you up here right before she was about to hit her heat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The week was about to get interesting.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You set your plate in the sink, and head outside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey is waiting patiently for you by the lake, and she waves you over.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon! The water&#039;s real nice!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You want to dig out the canoes? We could go paddling for a bit.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her maybe later, and that you wanted to go fishing maybe tomorrow when it was cooler outside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For now though, you wanted to go swimming.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ok, Anon. Whatever you want to do.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles at you, and walks over on the dock.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You follow her, the two of you standing on the very edge of the dock, looking into the deep blue water.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It looks pretty deep!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask her how deep it really is, and she responds:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Around 10 feet in the shallow parts near the shore, but in the middle it goes down to about 30 feet. I remember my brothers always diving for clams out there. We never ate them, but it was fun seeing who could collect the most.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her it sounds like it was fun, and she frowns.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m sorry I was never able to take you up here with me and the family together, but you know how my parents are... They didn&#039;t even like us hanging out when we were little.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;At least YOUR parents were fine with us being so close.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your parents were pretty liberal when it came to Human-Anthro relations. They thought that the best way to coexist with Anthros was to befriend them, and it had showed in you and Zoey. The two of you had been close since the day you met.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hell, you talked to her more than you did to most of your family.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey snaps you out of your thoughts by throwing her arm over your shoulder, pulling you close.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m glad we did this, Anon. I think we both needed a short break from... I don&#039;t know. Everything.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You agree with her. You were good at your job, but it was soul-crushingly boring. You had been doing to same thing for so long that it was starting to eat away at your sanity.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell Zoey this, and she agrees.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well, being a drug dog... Requires a lot of energy. It&#039;s an exciting job. Maybe a bit TOO exciting if you ask me.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;At least it pays well. Oh well.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A devilish smile suddenly plays across Zoey&#039;s black and brown muzzle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon... You said you wanted to go swimming, right?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her grip tightens on your shoulder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yes?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Good.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She grabs you in a tight hug, and throws the two of you into the lake.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;God damn, it&#039;s colder than your dead grandmother&#039;s heart in here!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You surface, gasping.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey laughs, trudging back to the shore with you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re a bit pissed, but Zoey&#039;s smile disarms your anger.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Sorry, Anon. I&#039;ve always wanted to do that, but my brothers never let me.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh, and begin to take your wet clothes off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see Zoey eyeing you from the corner of your eye as she takes her own soaking wet clothes off, depositing them on the sandy shoreline.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You leave your underwear on, and turn around to look at Zoey to ask her how long she planned on swimming.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you look at her though, your eyes widen in surprise.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She had taken ALL of her clothes off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could see everything.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And by everything, you meant EVERYTHING. Her canine snatch bared to the world.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles mischievously at you, before wading into the lake, the water covering her nude body.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come on in, Anon!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stand there nervously, and Zoey replies.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh, don&#039;t be such a baby, Anon! It&#039;s not like there&#039;s anybody to see us out here. Now come on. Take those underwear off. I took mine off, so It&#039;s only fair.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re not too sure that that&#039;s how it works, but you concede.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You strip off your soaked boxers while Zoey isn&#039;t looking, and you rush back into the water to cover yourself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;That&#039;s more like it, Anon!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Now let&#039;s try and have some fun. I&#039;ll race you around the lake!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You and Zoey spent the next couple hours or so swimming in the cool waters of the lake.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a while, you had become used to the cold waters, and it became relaxing just lazily swimming around the lake.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or it atleast it would have been, if Zoey hadn&#039;t come up to splash or dunk you every few minutes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come on, Anon! Don&#039;t make it so easy for me!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to swim away from her before she can dunk you under the water again, but she&#039;s a better swimmer than you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m gonna getcha&#039;!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She catches up with you, grabbing at your chest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She presses your back against her chest, her tits smooshing against you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Got you~.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh shit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then she leans back, lifting you up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gets a hand under your thigh, flipping you, and suplexes you back down into the water.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a moment you surface, spitting out lake water.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey is laughing, seemingly pleased at your reaction.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You trudge back to the shore, with Zoey following closely behind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon, you ready for lunch? I&#039;m getting a bit hungry.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you were planning on making yourself a sandwich, and she nods.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Alright, I&#039;m going to head in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey walks off to the cabin still in the buff, not even bothering to pick up her scattered clothes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She isn&#039;t leaving much, if anything, to the imagination.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hoped she would be dressed by the time you got inside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look at your clothes laying in a pile on the shore.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They were still really damp, but not dripping wet. You shrug, and put them back on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You walk back into the house as Zoey leaves the bedroom wearing fresh clothes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks a bit upset when she sees you wearing the wet clothes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon, you better not drip water all over the damn place. I just cleaned this place yesterday.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her it&#039;s fine, and she just huffs at you, walking to the fridge.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You enter the bedroom and shut the door behind you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take your damp clothes off, putting them in a bag you used a a hamper.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grab a pair of boxers and slip them on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sit down on the bed mostly naked, sighing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were still pretty tired, as your sleep last night hadn&#039;t been very restful. That and you had just swam for the better part of two hours.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had gone to sleep comfortable, but waking up in the middle of the night had taken a toll on you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You rest your eyes for a second, laying back on the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were just going to rest for a second here. Or maybe a couple minutes. There was no rush.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Be Zoey</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s been a fun day so far.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had woken up right next to Anon, his natural scent filling your sensitive nose.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He had woken up cold last night, so you had slept close to him to keep him warm. You didn&#039;t know how he managed to survive without fur.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was also nice to get your scent on him. It kept other Anthros from trying to take him for themselves.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anon was YOURS, and you intended to keep it that way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thinking about the last couple hours, you smile</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Swimming with Anon had been fun. You had even managed to get him naked!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;His skin had felt soooo~ nice when you had pressed him against you...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had gotten a decent view of his crotch when you had flipped him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had always loved the way humans looked under their shorts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anon had almost caught you looking at a /BRED/ thread last night, but you had been able to close it before he saw.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not that you would mind too much if he knew that you were into the kind of stuff...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Who knew, maybe he browsed the same threads as you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You knew that it was probably wishful thinking though...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anon had never dated an Anthro, as you had never let any get near him. He had dated Human women though.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Too bad you had been too afraid of your parents retribution to ever try anything with him when you were kids...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had always liked Anon. He had always had your back, and he was one of the only people who supported your decision to join the Police Force.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your parents had wanted you do a less dangerous job, like Anon had.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Admittedly, maybe you had watched a little too many cop shows as a pup. Being a cop was a lot tougher than it seemed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That didn&#039;t matter right now, though. You were here for yourself and Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You open the fridge, pulling out some salami and cheese. Anon said he was going to make himself a sandwich, and you knew what he liked. So why not make it for him yourself?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pulled bread and a paper plate out of the cupboard, and got to work making a couple sandwiches for him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You set the plate aside, and wait for Anon to come back out of the bedroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What was taking him so long?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You walk over to the bedroom, and stick your ear against the door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t hear anything... Is Anon Alright?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You gently knock on the door a bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon? Are you alright in there? I got your lunch ready...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There&#039;s no answer, and so you open the door a bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh, he&#039;s fine. He&#039;s just sleeping. You can hear him quietly snoring.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Leave it to Anon to conk out while getting dressed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re about to wake him up, but you notice he&#039;s only wearing his boxers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you see an even more wonderful sight. He has a boner.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looks like seeing you naked had the desired effect on him... Maybe he&#039;s even dreaming about you...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your mouth salivates while you stare at the outline of his dick through the thin fabric...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your triangular folds begin to moisten, and you let out a quiet whine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was taking all your self restraint not to just try and take him while he laid there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shit, you couldn&#039;t do that! You didn&#039;t think Anon would react to well to waking up with his best friend bouncing on his cock.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But still... Just a peek couldn&#039;t hurt...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re reaching for the hem of his boxers, when all of a sudden he yawns.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh shit, he&#039;s waking up!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quickly move to leave the room. This was something you had to take your time with.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You gently shut the door behind you, holding the doorknob open so it doesn&#039;t click.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You slowly let go of the doorknob, and go to sit in the kitchen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were determined to get in his pants, but in a way that didn&#039;t involve flat out raping him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You better find a way to do it FAST though... Your heat was starting to hit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could already feel your hormones going into overdrive.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every whiff of Anon&#039;s natural scent was beginning to excite you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You rub your thighs together, and wait for Anon to come get his sandwich.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Be Anon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your eyes open, and you sit up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Had you dozed off there for a minute?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, time to get up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could take a full nap later.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stand up off of the bed, and grab some more clothes from your suitcase.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quickly get dressed, and walk out into the kitchen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey is sitting at the kitchen table, her muzzle laying on the table with her eye shut.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You walk over, and put your hand on her shoulder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She yips, and sits up quickly, looking at you with wide eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;S-shit, Anon! Don&#039;t sneak up on me like that...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You cock an eye at her. You couldn&#039;t sneak up on her when you tried hard, so how did you spook her when she knew you were coming?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I was uh... Deep in thought.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask her about what she was thinking about, and she responds:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Just, um, stupid stuff. Don&#039;t worry about it, Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gives you a small smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I made you a couple sandwiches. Your favorite.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hell yeah. Salami and cheese. You couldn&#039;t beat the classics.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You jokingly pet her on the head, and to your surprise she leans into your hand, and you hear her let out a satisfied huff.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Normally she hated it when you did that!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her eyes pop open as she realizes what she just did.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ah! Don&#039;t do that, Anon!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You put up your hands in mock surrender, and say you won&#039;t do it again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She leans onto the counter, her head resting on one of her hands.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Just... Enjoy the sandwich, Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Something seems off about Zoey to you. She seems... Conflicted.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask her if she&#039;s feeling alright, and she nods quickly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yeah, yeah. I told you not to worry about it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You threaten to pet her head again if she doesn&#039;t tell you what&#039;s going on, and she stands up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m going to... Check my phone. Eat the food I made you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hated it when she dodged your questions, but you let her go. You didn&#039;t want to ruin the week on the second day you were here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She quickly shuffles into the bedroom, the door shutting behind her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, at least you&#039;ll get to enjoy these sandwiches.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You savor the two sandwiches, and when you&#039;re done you throw the paper plate in the trash.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey was seeming really off after you saw her in the kitchen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe she really was going into heat? You didn&#039;t know much about Canines, let alone Anthros in general, but you knew that when they Went into heat it messed with their heads.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Should you try to cheer her up, or would that just make things worse?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Perhaps you should just leave things alone for now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey had gone into the bedroom, and hadn&#039;t come out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You knew how to cheer her up though. You would ask her if she wanted to go canoeing. Everybody likes canoeing, right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You walk over to the bedroom door, and knock gently on it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Wh-What, Anon? I&#039;m a little, uh, busy.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask her if she wants to go canoeing with you, and she replies:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ah... Not right now... You can go ahead, though... Maybe tomorrow, Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, It&#039;s not the response you wanted, but at least you know she&#039;s not upset with you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You let Zoey know you&#039;re coming in to grab your phone, and she replies quickly:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ah! Just one moment!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear the ruffling of blankets, and then It&#039;s quiet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;O-Okay. Come on in...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You open the door, entering the bedroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey is laying on the bed, covered by a layer of blankets. She smiles sheepishly at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Something in here smells... Strange. You&#039;re not sure what it is, but it&#039;s pretty strong.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decide not to mention it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask Zoey one more time if she wants to go canoeing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Tomorrow, Anon. I&#039;m, uh... Tired. Yeah.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You go on. I&#039;ve got... Stuff to do.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh, and grab your phone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you&#039;ll see her in a bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Have some fun, Anon. Take your time. I&#039;ll be here~.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You leave the cabin with your phone, heading to the shed next to the dock.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You open the wooden door, the old hinges hissing loudly at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Turning on your phone&#039;s flashlight, you locate one of the Canoes hanging on the wall.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This would be a lot easier if Zoey would help you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Should you ask her?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She had seemed pretty eager to get you out of the house, and you knew what she did last time she had told you that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn&#039;t think you were going to look through the bedroom window this time, though.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The canoe isn&#039;t secured by anything. It&#039;s just sitting on a wooden rack.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grab it and lean back, pulling it off of the wall.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It thuds on the ground, and you drag it out of the shed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You walk back in and look for some paddles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There&#039;s a couple paddles leaning on the wall near the canoe rack, and you grab them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You exit the shed, and toss the paddles into the canoe.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There&#039;s no launching point for canoe on the dock, so you just push it to the waters edge near the dock.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once the canoe is far enough into the water that it floats, you hop in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nudge one of the wooden dock supports with the paddle, and you drift towards the middle of the lake.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s nice out. It&#039;s only about 2&#039;o clock, and it&#039;s still pretty warm out. There&#039;s a light breeze over the water, bringing the smells of the autumn forest to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lean back into the dusty canoe, relaxing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If you had known it was this nice out here, you would have gotten Zoey to take you up here a long time ago.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She had talked this place up before, but that was way different than experiencing it for yourself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You cross your hands behind your head, gazing at the azure sky dotted with clouds.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You happily sigh, smiling. This was nice. Way better than working in that shitty office.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After an hour so or relaxing, you sit up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had been using the paddles to row yourself back to the middle of the lake whenever you drifted near the edges, but you decided to paddle along the edge of the lake.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pick up the paddles, and begin to row yourself to the shaded edges of the lake near where the forest met the water.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Many of the trees were leaning over the water, creating shapes and patterns from the light that shone through the leaves.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You watched the light dance across the surface of the water, and you even managed to spot several small fish near the more shallow water near the edge.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is where you should try fishing tomorrow with Zoey.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If she wanted to, anyways. You hoped she would be in a better mood tomorrow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You paddle around the waters edge for another hour, staring into the woods.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The forest was darker the farther away it got from the water&#039;s edge.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was a pretty dense forest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You should take a hike in it with Zoey before you had to leave. You think she would like that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She had always been pretty outdoorsy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After another half hour or so, you begin to think you&#039;ve had your fill of the lake for the day.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It just wasn&#039;t as fun with just you in the canoe.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You start to paddle to the edge of the lake, and you hop out onto the shore.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You drag the canoe back onto the shore, and you leave it there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No need to go through the hassle of putting it back if you&#039;re just going to use it again tomorrow. Hopefully.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You start to walk but to the cabin, but stop.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You just had what you think is a pretty good idea.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You head around the side of the house where the firewood is kept, making sure not to walk past the bedroom window. You were taking the long way this time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You unhook the tarp, and pull it to the side.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Feeling the wood, you can see it&#039;s dry. It should be perfect for a nice warm fire.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You heft as much wood as you can carry under your arms, and head back to the front of the cabin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s a bit of a struggle opening the front door while holding the large amount of firewood, but you manage.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You set the two bundles of wood down next to the fire.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You peer up into the chimney. It looks clear, and you smile. You could build a fire, alright.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your hear the bedroom door open, and Zoey peers out at you with a confused look on her face, her muzzle tilted at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon? What are you doing?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you plan on starting a fire, and she opens the door fully, standing above you as you crouch down by the fireplace.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There&#039;s that smell again... It&#039;s a strange musky smell. At first you thought it was just the cabin, but you didn&#039;t smell it when you first got here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ll just have to spray some air freshener in the bedroom before you go to sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey squats down next to you, her muzzle hanging over your shoulder, watching you stick the firewood into the base of the fireplace.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You as her if there&#039;s anything you can use as kindling, and if she can bring you a match.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stands up, and opens a cabinet near one of the couches.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yeah, we kept some fire-starters in here if I remember correctly.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pulls out a handful of rolled up paper.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It&#039;s just wax coated bits of paper, but they light up pretty good.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod, and she hands them to you. You set them under the wood.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey walks over to the kitchen, and pulls a small pack of matches out of a drawer. She tosses them to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to catch them, but you&#039;re not quick enough, and they land behind you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come on, Anon. You were wide open.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you weren&#039;t much of a sports kind of guy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gives you a smug smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yeah, I can tell.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You jokingly shake your head in disapproval at her, and grab the matches.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull out a match and strike it against the box, before lighting one of the fire-starters in your hand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It quickly ignites, and you press the flaming wad of paper and wax against the other fire-starters in the fireplace.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They all catch, and before long you have a nice fire going.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey puts her hand on your shoulder, and leads you to the couch with her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you plop down on the sofa, and watch the fire.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey and you were chatting, and having a pretty nice time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey seemed to be back to her normal self, which made you happy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Right now she was talking to you about the recent drug bust she had made.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So we&#039;ve got the guy in the car, right? He&#039;s saying something in Spanish, saying that he&#039;s never even touched drugs before.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m smelling the car and I almost let it go, but when I smell alongside the bottom of the car I catch a whiff of something.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I call my supervisor over and he pokes a hole in the body of the car near the bottom of one of the doors.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Boom! White powder everywhere. Dude was hiding like 10 pounds of Coke in each door.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Needless to say, the desk jockeys back at the station were pretty pleased with me.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I got myself the week off, and some nice bonus pay which I used to finance this little getaway of ours.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You congratulate her once more, and she smiles at you, her tail wagging.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To your surprise, she pulls you into a hug, her muzzle resting on your shoulder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Thanks, Anon...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear her sniff you gently, then she pulls away.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles at you with closed eyes, and says:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I like the way you smell. It&#039;s nice.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She realizes what she just said and her eyes pop open.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Wait, I mean I like the way your soap smells!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles nervously.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yeah... The soap. It&#039;s very... Fresh?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I just... Like it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile, and stand up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask her if she&#039;s hungry, and she stands up next to you, her tail wagging.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yeah. I skipped lunch today.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You frown, and tell her she shouldn&#039;t do that. It&#039;s not like the two of you were low on food or anything.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles, saying:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Nice to see you&#039;re concerned about my well-being.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come on, Anon. It&#039;s not like I&#039;m going to lose all my muscles if I miss one meal.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Now let me fix the two of us some dinner. You just sit here and enjoy the fire. Let me take care of everything~&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sits you back down on the couch.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Now this is going to take a while, so you might as well find something to occupy yourself with.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her that you can just talk to her, but she shakes her head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;No. I want to make sure I get this recipe right. I wanna concentrate on it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shrug, and tell her that&#039;s fine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stand up and walk towards the bedroom, telling Zoey that you&#039;re going to take a shower while you&#039;re waiting for dinner.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Okay, Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grab some clothes, and then head into the bathroom, locking the door behind you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Be Zoey.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was getting a bit hard to restrain yourself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your heat was almost in full swing now, and you had openly admitted to him that you enjoyed the way he smells.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had gotten yourself off a couple times while Anon was out in the canoe.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But it did almost nothing for you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You knew that there was only one thing that could extinguish the itching fires of your heat, and He was standing 30 feet away from you, naked in the shower.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You whined a bit, shifting around a bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had been wet all day, and Anon could definitely smell it. You had seen the way his nose had twitched when he entered the bedroom and when you had stood next to him by the fire.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had to focus for now, though. You were going to try and wait one more day. If Anon didn&#039;t make a move by tomorrow, then you were going to be a bit more direct. You couldn&#039;t wait much longer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For now though, you had a plan.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were going to try and cuddle Anon all night. You knew he was a sucker for soft things, and you had a new conditioner you had brought with you. It was a bit expensive, but it was worth it for Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were going to use it before you went to sleep, and then you would show no mercy while you cuddled him furiously.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yeah, that was going to be nice...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You would also have the added benefit of covering him in your scent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That was how most Anthros marked their partners, and Canines were no exceptions. It would let others know who he belonged to.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And he belonged to YOU.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Standing in the kitchen, you&#039;ve gotten all the ingredients for dinner out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were going to make another one of Anon&#039;s favorites. Spaghetti with vodka sauce.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anon was pretty easy to please, and you were grateful for that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You put a pot of water on the small stove-top to boil, and wait.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a short wait, the water is boiling, so you add the spaghetti.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It shouldn&#039;t take too long to cook.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Right as you&#039;re about to drain the pasta, Anon exits the bathroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He&#039;s walking towards the kitchen, but you tell him to stay put in the living room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell him he could come in the kitchen when it was ready. You tell him you didn&#039;t want him to crowd you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But the truth is that you just didn&#039;t want Anon standing near you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;His scent was setting off all sorts of different signals in your brain, and you didn&#039;t want to find out what you would do if you got another nice whiff of him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At least, not until later. You were going to cuddle the shit out of him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;M-maybe even... Lick him a bit... Or try to hold his hand... Oh God, what if he tries to hold yours first?! You would do anything he said...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You snap out of the daydream, shaking your head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You just had to hold it together for just a BIT longer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anon asks you what you&#039;re cooking, and you tell him:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Just some, uh, Spaghetti.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see him smile at you, and you feel your body react to his gentle gaze, your stomach tightening.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He thanks you, and you respond.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You can come over... I, uh... It&#039;s almost ready.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He comes over and sits at the small table while you strain out the spaghetti.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pour the spaghetti back in the pot, and add in the canned sauce.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your stir it, before plating it, setting it in front of Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He thanks you, and begins eating.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get yourself a plate, and join him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hopefully he doesn&#039;t smell you over the pasta... You used a lot of sauce so you should be fine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You finish quicker than he does.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You go to sit on the couch and Anon takes a second plate.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He thanks you once more, saying it was good.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh, It was nothing... All I did was cook some pasta and open a jar...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He tells you that he appreciates you cooking for him, and your heart melts a bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shit, you&#039;ve got to get out of here before he makes you pounce him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stammer out:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I uh, I&#039;m going to go... Make the bed and... Maybe... I don&#039;t know. I&#039;ll be back.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nice one, Zoey. Real smooth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get up, quickly heading into the bedroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shut the door behind you, and lean against the door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shit, you had to get yourself under control.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grab your phone off the table, and open up the /BRED/ thread you lurked on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had been on 4chan for about 6 years now, but you had only recently discovered the magic that was /BRED/.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe some shitposters will help you get yourself under control.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You post in the thread:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;guys help im with my human friend and im in heat. i dont want to make things weird. what do i do?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wait, but all you get are replies saying &quot;&gt;RAPE&quot;, and &quot;/bred/ imminent&quot;.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One poster even sends you a Webm of a Human fucking an Anthro Great Dane in heat, she was yipping loudly, her long legs wrapping around his back while he shoved his thick cock into her-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;NO! You had to get control of yourself...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look around the room. What could you do that would calm you down?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh! You said to Anon you would make the bed for him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That should calm you down enough so you don&#039;t feel like jumping Anon&#039;s bones. Well, at least not as bad as you do right now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull the blankets and pillows off of the bed, before spreading them back flat on the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you pick up Anon&#039;s pillow however, you can&#039;t help but give it a little sniff.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Aahhh... That&#039;s the good shit right there...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You make sure to fluff it up a bit, before lovingly setting it back on the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No way you were ever going to wash that pillow again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With the bed made, you crouch down and open your suitcase.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull out the small bottle of conditioner you had bought especially for this trip.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The label said it was supposed to make fur really soft and fluffy. It was formulated with Canines in mind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It cost you like 70 dollars for 13 ounces, which was really only good for two or three showers, but whatever. It was all worth it for Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It didn&#039;t really have much of a smell to it. It was intended to be used after you had already cleaned your fur.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just use it like normal fur cleaner and it was good to go.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You set the small plastic bottle on your nightstand. You want it ready for later.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look at your phone to check the time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was starting to get late. The clock had just hit 7&#039;o clock.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, you should go back out and talk to Anon... You didn&#039;t want him to think anything was off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You exit the bedroom, leaving the door open.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking into the kitchen, it looks like Anon had cleaned up after the meal you had made.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anon was sitting by the fire, adding another log.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You squat next to him, smiling.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Be Anon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were tossing some logs into the fire before it died.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While you were doing this, Zoey squat down next to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look over at her, and she smiles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Thanks for starting this fire for us, Anon...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She leans close to you, looking at the growing flames.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her that you were probably gonna watch a movie on Netflix to end the day.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey turns to face you, and asks you with a hopeful tone:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Can I watch it with you?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her that of course she can, and she smiles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It might be a bit awkward with the two of you watching it on a phone, but you would make it work.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you sit on one of the sofas.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey is sitting close to you, your sides touching.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She probably wanted to be close so she could see the movie better.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pick out some old shitty movie and the two of you settle in to watch it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wish you would have remembered to bring popcorn. Damn, and you had even gone to the store yesterday. You were never very good at planning things.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It doesn&#039;t matter now, though.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you settle in, and relax while you watch the movie.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Its two and a half hours later, and the movie&#039;s over.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The fire went out a half-hour ago, leaving just some smoldering coals behind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn&#039;t care what anyone said. National Treasure was a damn good movie.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Based on the way Zoey&#039;s tail was wagging, she must have enjoyed it too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She had relaxed next to you during the movie. Her arm was draped over your shoulder, and she was leaning in close to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not a huge fan of Nicholas Cage, but I liked watching it with you, Anon~.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It&#039;s late... You gonna head to bed, now?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You yawn, and she takes that as her answer.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She moves her arm from over your shoulder, and grips your arm a bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come on. I&#039;m gonna take a shower. You settle into bed.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She leads you from the couch to the bedroom, and you sit down on your side of the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey grabs some clothes and a bottle off of her nightstand, then heads to the Bathroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear the hiss of water in the shower, and you undress, getting some sleepwear on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Laying back on the bed, you yawn again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You slip under the covers, after shutting off the light.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You make sure to plug your phone in to charge, and you check out your favorite Taiwanese fruit-picking forum.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nothing interesting seems to have happened recently, except for a couple shitposters arguing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You post a bit in some of your regular threads, and wait for Zoey to come back so the two of you can get to sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just as you&#039;re about to doze off, the bedroom door opens.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can&#039;t see anything in the darkness, but you know it&#039;s Zoey.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon. You still awake?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You respond, telling her that you&#039;re just barely awake.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well, that&#039;s okay. I have a surprise for you~.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sit up a bit, and ask her what it is.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In response, she climbs into bed, slipping under the covers next to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lay back into bed, and roll on your side, facing away from her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her arms reach out and wrap around your shoulders, pulling you closer to her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You protest a bit, but she pulls you into her arms.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shes presses you against her, holding you in her arms.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Holy shit, since when was Zoey so... Soft?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey grins, asking you:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Liking my fur? I got some new fur cleaner I wanted to try out... Makes my fur all fluffy and soft~&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I hope you like it, Anon... Because it&#039;s a bit cold tonight. Gotta keep warm, you know?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her it was already warm under the covers, but she just hushes you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Shh. Anon. You don&#039;t have fur. You can&#039;t possibly be warm. Here, let me hold you...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her hands start to rub your chest a bit, sapping your energy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was so warm and soft... You had to fight to keep your eyelids up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Go to sleep, Anon... I&#039;ll keep you nice and cozy...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This felt kind of weird, sleeping in your friends embrace, but it also felt so... Right.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were extremely comfortable, and so you agreed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Here... Let me get this...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her hands grip the thin fabric of your shirt, and she begins to tug it off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She tosses the shirt off of the bed, and pulls you in close again, your back and chest enveloped in her silky fur.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To your surprise, you can feel that she isn&#039;t wearing a shirt either. Just a plain bra.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re not complaining though. Her fur was just too soft NOT to touch.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Goodnight, Anon...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t respond, as sleep takes you a couple moments later.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wake up early, the first rays of sunshine coming through the window.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re a bit confused for a second, as you can&#039;t move your arms or legs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Quickly though, you realize that Zoey still has her arms wrapped around you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sometime during the night she hooked one of her legs over yours.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to get out of bed, struggling to get her limbs off of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The motion must wake up Zoey, because you feel her grip on you tighten, and she whines, before saying quietly:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Noooo.... Stayyy.....&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re about to tell her you have to get up, but you can&#039;t think of a good reason to.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Breakfast can wait, right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Right.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You settle back into her arms, and she happily chuffs into your hair.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you lay there for a while, until the sun starts shining through the window onto the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Too bad there weren&#039;t any curtains.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey lets out a quiet growl as the sunlight invades her eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Time to get up, Anon...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She lets go of you, and you sit up in bed, rubbing your eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Overall, it was a pretty restful sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You dig around in your suitcase for another shirt, and slip on some jeans.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking back at Zoey, she&#039;s flipped over in bed so she isn&#039;t facing the window, and the covers are over her head. All you can see of her is the tip of her muzzle poking out under the blanket.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask her if she&#039;s getting up, but she just whines and turns over in bed, the covers falling off of her furred head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks up at you with tired eyes, saying:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yeah, I just need a couple minutes...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you&#039;ll be in the kitchen, and her ears flick at you in response.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You step out into the living room, yawning as you stretch out. Sleeping in Zoey&#039;s embrace had been comfortable, if a bit... constricting. She had certainly held you tightly as you had slept.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You crack your knuckles as you walk into the small kitchen area.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking in the fridge, you pull out the tiny bit of leftover spaghetti from last night. Might as well finish it up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You also grab an ice-cold can of your favorite soda. Orange Sunkist™.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey had also brought some Dr Pepper, but you had always thought that it tasted terrible.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She may be your friend, but she had absolute shit taste in soft drinks.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pop the spaghetti in the microwave, and put it on for a couple minutes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wait for it to heat up, leaning on the wall.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The microwave dings, and you take the piping hot leftovers out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not bothering to sit down at the table, you just eat the spaghetti standing up next to the sink.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After five minutes, you finish the meager breakfast, putting the dish in the sink.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fuck it, you&#039;ll wash it later.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re about to go sit down on the couch, but you see Zoey poke her head out of the bedroom, and she looks at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She quickly brings her head back into the bedroom, and the door gently shuts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re not sure what that was about, but whatever.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take a seat on the couch, but you realize you left your phone in the bedroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get up, but stop before you open the bedroom door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear a strange sound. Like cloth rubbing against other cloth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thinking that Zoey might be getting dressed, you knock on the door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get a muffled response:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;W-what, Anon?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask her if you can come in, and theres a small moment of silence before she answers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ye-NO!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m, uh, busy right now.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come back in... Uh... Ten minutes. Y-yeah.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Since you aren&#039;t completely retarded, you quickly realize that she&#039;s probably doing the same thing she was doing when you looked at her through the window the night you first got here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shit, if you still had doubts about her maybe being in heat, they&#039;ve long since vanished.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That smell, too... You can smell it drifting under the door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looks like the rest of the week was about to take a strange turn.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh, and go to sit over on the couch.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Be Zoey</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anon had just stepped away from the door, and you felt like hitting yourself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had come SO CLOSE to letting him walk in on you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you had chickened out at the last moment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You throw your head back onto your pillow in frustration.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You couldn&#039;t take it anymore.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were about to reach the breaking point.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even after you had stripped down to your undergarments and cuddled with Anon all night, he STILL hadn&#039;t made a move on you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You knew he wasn&#039;t some beta faggot, as you know that he&#039;s dated girls in the past.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Girls you had failed to keep away from him. Too bad Human women weren&#039;t very receptive to scents.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You angrily huff, as you dig your fingers deep inside your burning hot, itching gash.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your heat was in full swing now, and you couldn&#039;t do jack shit to relieve it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hadn&#039;t brought your human dildo as you were terrified of what Anon would think if he found it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were kind of regretting that now, as it had been a good tool for helping you out with your heat in the past.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ve tried dating other Canines in the past, but you&#039;ve never actually ever been with any of them sexually.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For some reason, they&#039;ve just never had any appeal to you when compared them to Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had fallen for the /BRED/ meme, and you had fallen for it HARD.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For now though, you were getting nowhere with getting yourself off. It did absolutely nothing for you heat-wise.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You growled a bit, bringing your hand up to your mouth and licking your slick fingers clean.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Damn it, you just had to hold out for the rest of today... If Anon doesn&#039;t make a move on you by tonight, then you were going to throw yourself at him until he WANTED to fuck you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Standing up on wobbly legs, you pull your soaked panties back up and grab some fresh clothes and a towel.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You open the bedroom door and walk into the bathroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you close the bathroom door, you can see Anon walking towards the bedroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shit, there was no way he wasn&#039;t going to smell your arousal in there...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Although that isn&#039;t really too much of a bad thing. Is it? You aren&#039;t sure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Forgetting the internal debate for now, you climb into the large bathtub.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You weren&#039;t sure why your parents had gotten such a large tub for the cabin. Hell, it was bigger than the one you had at home when you were growing up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You turn on the water. You keep it cold.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hopefully it would take your mind off of your heat for a bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You knew it wouldn&#039;t, though. You&#039;ve tried this before and all it does it get you wet. Well, wetter than you already were.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You gasp as you feel the cold water assault your body, but you grit your teeth and begin to clean yourself, not using the expensive fur conditioner this time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That was for special occasions only.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You squeeze out some Fur cleaning gel into your hand and begin to work it through your thick fur.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You close your eyes, and begin to clean yourself. You had to smell nice for Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Be Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After you had seen Zoey enter the bathroom, you had gone back into the bedroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you had stepped in the room though, the smell of her heat had almost knocked you on her ass.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It wasn&#039;t really a bad smell, just a surprisingly familiar one.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Come to think of it, as a child, whenever you had gone over to her house (when her parents weren&#039;t home), hadn&#039;t her room smelt like this?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not as strongly of course, but still recognizable.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh, grabbing your phone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Checking it, you frown.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Damn it, you had forgotten to plug it in to charge last night.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was dead, so you set it back down on the nightstand, and connect it to the charger.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sit back on the bed, bored.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were kind of bored. Zoey had just gotten in the shower, there was no radio, and your phone was dead.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking at Zoey&#039;s nightstand though, you see her phone sitting there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You suddenly get a really bad idea.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe you could just look at Zoey&#039;s phone?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You knew she didn&#039;t use a password lock, as she was always pretty terrible with remembering passwords.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But damn. You couldn&#039;t just look through your friends phone like that... Could you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, she was going to be busy in the shower for at least another 10 minutes...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You move over to her side of the bed, sitting down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was still warm from where she had been laying. And a bit moist...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh, and pick up her phone. You might as well. You would put it back just as you had found it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s not like she would be able to find out you had looked at it, right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You turn on her phone, and are greeted by her lock-screen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s a picture of the last time the two of you went out to eat at a local fast-food place.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Cute.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like you expected, there was no password. Just a &quot;Slide to Unlock&quot; message.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You open up the phone, and your eyes nearly pop out of your socket at what you see.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s a video of an Anthro Great Dane getting fucked hard by a Human.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even more surprisingly, it&#039;s on 4chan. On a /BRED/ thread.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Holy shit, she browses these threads?!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had heard of /BRED/ before. It was pretty infamous on the internet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Human-Anthro relationships weren&#039;t really looked on too fondly everywhere in the world.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had never asked Zoey how she felt about it, because you didn&#039;t want to come off as being awkward.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, you guess this answers it though.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You scroll through the thread, and you begin to sweat a bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see she had posted last night about saying she was in heat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It had a lot of replies, mostly saying that you were either about to have a really fun time, or be brutally raped. Or a combination of the two.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The thread is full of images and Webms of Humans pounding away at Anthros of various species.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had to admit that you had looked at Human on Anthro porn before. You had been curious.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But this stuff was on a whole new level.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you&#039;re browsing through the thread with wide eyes, you suddenly hear the water in the shower shut off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh shit, she&#039;s done already.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You move the thread back up to where it was when you unlocked her phone, and set it back down on the nightstand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sit back over on your side of the bed, and pick up your phone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s charged enough to be turned on, and as you turn it back on, the door opens and you hear a small surprised yip from behind you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;A-Anon? I didn&#039;t think you&#039;d be in here...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Turning around to look at Zoey, you can see she&#039;s dressed in some basic jeans and a white t-shirt.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can definitely tell she isn&#039;t wearing a bra. Her nipples are poking right through the thin fabric.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quickly tear your eyes away from them before she can notice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To your slight terror and surprise, you can feel yourself begin to harden.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had never really thought of Zoey in that way... Well, besides the first night you were here. But that was different.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now you knew that she was DEFINITELY interested in Humans. Oh shit, was that why she had brought you up here?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shift around a bit, trying to ignore the swelling problem in your crotch.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s looking at you with a curious look, as if expecting you to say something.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quickly speak up, stammering out that you were just in here because you needed to charge your phone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh... Okay. Did you not charge it last night?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sits down on the bed on her side, and picks up her phone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She moves her face to peek at you over her shoulder, but quickly faces her phone when she sees you&#039;re still looking at her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;S-so, Anon... Did you want to do anything today?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You think for a moment, but you&#039;re having trouble gathering your thoughts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her that she should pick, and she turns around to look at you, holding her phone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Umm... How about we... Uh...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Suddenly, she perks up, and her long fluffy tail starts to wag.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh! How about we go through the woods? I haven&#039;t done that since I was pretty young.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her tail stops wagging for a moment, and she says with a frown:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;None of my brothers would ever want to go with me, and my Dad never wanted to let me go through the forest alone...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She perks up again, and she smiles, her fluffy tail wagging once more.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;But now you&#039;re here! And we can go together!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask her if there&#039;s a path, and she shakes her head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;No, but I know this property pretty well. Don&#039;t worry, we won&#039;t get lost.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;My Dad never wanted me to go in the woods on my own, but that doesn&#039;t mean I ever listened to him.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re genuinely curious at this point, and you ask her if there&#039;s anything worth seeing out in the forest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yeah. There&#039;s a lot of creeks and criks... A small cave... Lots of rock outcroppings... There&#039;s even an old mine-shaft, but I was always too afraid to go near it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stand up, telling her that she&#039;s won you over, and that of course you&#039;re willing to go.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pockets her phone before standing up too, a wide grin on her face, her tail wagging really quickly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Thanks, Anon!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She walks over to you, and pulls you into a quick, but tight, hug.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her muzzles presses against where your neck meets your shoulder, and you feel her huff a single warm breath onto your neck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Huh. Déjà vu.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you walk out of the bedroom, a goofy smile on Zoey&#039;s face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sit down in the living room without your phone. You might as well leave it to charge for now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey goes to the kitchen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She whines a bit, saying:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Did you already eat, Anon?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you had the rest of the spaghetti from last night, and she gives you a neutral expression.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh. I was going to make you breakfast...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her that it was alright. She had made you every meal you&#039;ve had up here so far. All you did was just microwave some spaghetti.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yeah, well... I just want you to be relaxed. I like cooking for you...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you were glad she did. Back at your shitty one-man apartment, you mainly subsisted on pre-made, processed, frozen food.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey making you all your meals was a VERY welcome change of pace. She wasn&#039;t some Master Chef or anything, but she knew way more about cooking than you did.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If you remembered correctly, you&#039;re pretty sure you had read somewhere that cooking was a very important part of Canine cultures.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Something about forming bonds, you think. Whatever, it didn&#039;t matter right now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We can go hiking after I eat. I&#039;ll make us some sandwiches to eat while we&#039;re out in the forest.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You go stand near the kitchen where she&#039;s making herself some eggs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You offer to make the sandwiches while she&#039;s eating, but she just shakes her head at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;No. I want to make them for you. Besides, you use way too much meat in them. I don&#039;t want you eating all the salami...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She frowns a bit, giving you a bit of a sympathetic look.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Also, I wanted to talk to you a bit about that... Why don&#039;t you start coming to the gym with me?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She points to your stomach.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You weren&#039;t fat or really even chubby, but you had almost no muscles to really speak of.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I know I like to tease you about it, but I want to see you healthy... You gotta cut back on the processed foods, Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh, and tell her you&#039;d think about it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Aw, come on, Anon. You always say that, but then never bring it up again.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;If it&#039;s because you&#039;re intimidated by being in a gym, then you could always just come over to my place and we could work out together. Just the two of us.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to weasel your way out of exercise by saying that you had a pretty tight schedule, and that you weren&#039;t sure if you could find the time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She isn&#039;t having any of it, though.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon, that&#039;s bullshit and you know it. Neither of us work weekends, and you live like 15 minutes away from me.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It looks to you like you can&#039;t dig your way out of this hole, so you relent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You agree to work out with her next time she wants to, and she smiles at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then she gets a mortified look on her face, and turns back around to look at the eggs she&#039;s cooking.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh shit, I burned them!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Be Zoey.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To your dissapointment, the eggs were unable to be salvaged, and you had to start cooking some more.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To your elation though, Anon had finally agreed to work out with you!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had always wanted to help him get /fit/.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn&#039;t want him to do it just to look good, as no matter what he looked like, you knew that he would always be yours.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wanted him to do it for his health.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And he had agreed to do it privately, in the comfort of your own home...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your mouth was salivating, but not from the aroma of the eggs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just thinking about having Anon all to yourself, having him sweaty and out of breath next to you...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shit! He&#039;s sitting right next to you! This is NOT the time to be having these thoughts! You&#039;re pretty sure that you could still hold out for ONE day, and you intended to spend it having fun with Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You felt bad, because you hadn&#039;t really done anything with him other than swim, watch a movie with him, and cook for him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All you had really done so far was get yourself off to images of him from your phone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shovel the steaming eggs into your mouth, not focusing so much on the flavor as you are on Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This was going to be so fun! You had always loved these woods, and now you finally had someone to share that joy with.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You liked your brothers, but they had never really been outdoorsy like you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had always fantasied about taking Anon into the woods with you as a teenager... Among doing other things to him...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had kept yourself pure for him, and you were dying to let him take you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And it better happen soon, too. You were halfway to wizard status, and you were damn ready for that to end.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were pretty certain that Anon had been with atleast one or two women in the past, but it didn&#039;t matter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once he had been with you, you were going to be certain that you were going to be the only person in the world he would ever want again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It would be just like you&#039;ve seen in the /BRED/ threads!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sometimes you worried about whether or not he would even be interested in you &quot;that&quot; way, though...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You knew that Canines were A LOT different than human women downstairs. Well, maybe not that different.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But still. What if he took one look at your steaming hot fortune cookie and was grossed out!?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shit, you didn&#039;t know WHAT you would do...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you knew he would never do that to you. You had been the best of friends since you had met in kindergarten.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You weren&#039;t paying much attention to your food as you ate, and so you finish it quicker than you expected, your fork tapping the plate.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look at Anon, who&#039;s leaning on the kitchen counter, staring at the wooden grain of the ceiling.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He looks at you expectantly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m going to make the sandwiches for us... You wanna go get ready?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He asks you what you should bring, and you just shrug.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uh... There&#039;s an old backpack in the bedroom closet. Grab it and I&#039;ll put the sandwiches and some water in it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We shouldn&#039;t really need much. The forest isn&#039;t really that strenuous to walk around in. It has some hills, but nothing too bad.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anon nods and walks off back to the bedroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile to yourself as your tail wags giddily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were REALLY excited about going into the woods with Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;M-maybe if you were lucky, you would even get to live out one of your fantasies...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pick up your dish, and set in the sink.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take a page from Anon&#039;s book, and decide to wash the dishes later.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking into one of the cupboards, you take out a couple of canteens and fill them with the tap.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Opening the fridge, you take out the bread, cheese, and salami, beginning to make some more sandwiches.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you make the sandwiches, Anon walks out from your shared bedroom with your old backpack, and sets in on the floor next to the kitchen counter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While he was in the bedroom, it looks like he had put on a red sweatshirt. It made sense. It was still early, and kind of chilly out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell him to put the canteens into the pack as you finish up the sandwiches, putting them in small bags.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He offers to carry the backpack, and you nod.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He had agreed to work out with you, so you might as well let him get started, even if he&#039;s only carrying sandwiches and water. It was better than nothing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Anon has to adjust the straps a bit, but after he gets them set to a comfortable length, he puts in on his back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look at the clock right before you leave, and see that it&#039;s 10:30 AM.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You open the door for the two of you, and he follows you out near the edge of the woods.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Almost all of the leaves had changed their color already, with only scattered evergreens standing out with bright green needles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Most trees still were covered in a thick layer of leaves though, making the forest look pretty dark.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look back at Anon, smiling.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well, let&#039;s go! This gonna be fun!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He smiles at you, saying that he&#039;s glad he got to do this with you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your heart flutters a bit when you hear this, but you get yourself under control quickly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grin back at him, before setting off with him deep into the forest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Be Anon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were happy to see that Zoey was feeling good today.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe her heat wasn&#039;t as bad as you thought.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That or the excitement of hiking through the woods with you was distracting her from her more base needs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had been walking through the woods with Zoey for about 20 minutes now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was quite literally leading you by the hand, her hand gently squeezing yours as she led you through the trees.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She had told you it was to keep you from getting lost, but you think she just wanted to hold your hand like some sort of degenerate.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There wasn&#039;t really any defined paths, but it seemed like Zoey knew her way through these woods like the back of her hand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had passed a couple small creeks, Zoey sharing with you a small story about each one.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I used to always catch frogs and tadpoles over here. My Mom always made me dump out the jars of tadpoles I&#039;d bring back, though.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;One time I went swimming in here and I got a leech on me! It scared me, and I cried for almost an hour.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Currently, you were walking up a small rocky hill, several chunks of granite jutting out of the ground.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come on, Anon! We&#039;re almost to the cave!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She seemed pretty eager to show you the cave, to the point of being a bit impatient with your slower walking speed. Not your fault you had shorter legs than her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She tugs your hand a bit, and you make an effort to speed up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It should be just over this hill... I think.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You huff out a quick sigh, sweating a little bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It wasn&#039;t very warm out, but her quick pace was exhausting you a bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a couple minutes, you scale the top of the hill.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey looks back at you smiling, but her ears fold back a bit and she lets out a small whine when she sees you out of breath and sweating.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Sorry, Anon... I&#039;ll try to go a bit slower for you. I guess I&#039;m just excited to show you around...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wave your hand at her, telling her not to worry, and that you were fine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You just weren&#039;t in the best of shape, and you weren&#039;t used to rushing up hills.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She raises her other hand, pointing at the bottom of the hill.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well, we can rest at the bottom of the hill there. I can see the cave entrance!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look at where she&#039;s pointing, and you can see a large rock overhang which formed a open cave in the side of the hill next to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you walk down the hill, Zoey slowing her pace down a bit for you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Here it is, Anon!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I know it isn&#039;t the biggest cave, but I love this place.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look around the cave. It wasn&#039;t very big, but it definitely wasn&#039;t small either.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The roof of the cave was about 8 feet away from the ground at the entrance, but gradually sloped down behind you until it met with the rocky floor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I know it doesn&#039;t really count as a cave, but it was always a nice, cool, secluded place to hang out when I was younger. Sometimes I just had to get away from my brothers, you know?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had met Zoey&#039;s brothers before, and you nod. She had three of them. There were nice enough, but they were no stranger to roughhousing with each other. Every time you had visited, you were pretty sure at least one of them had a broken bone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As for the cave being cool, she wasn&#039;t kidding. It felt about 10 degrees cooler in the back part of the cave.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It wasn&#039;t really too great when it was already kind of cold outside, though.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you start to shiver a bit, you head back to the large mouth of the cave, over where Zoey is standing, staring at you with a wide grin, her tail wagging a bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So, what do you think of the place?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her that you think it&#039;s pretty nice. You had never been to a real cave before.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Really? I thought you loved the outdoors, Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her that you had always been more of a fishing kind of guy, and she just shrugs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;To each his own, I suppose.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask her if there&#039;s anything else notable about the area, and she stands up straight, her tail wagging a bit faster.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;O-oh! Yeah! There&#039;s the mine-shaft I told you about! It&#039;s somewhere around here, too!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask her if she knew where it was, and she considers your question a moment before answering:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yeah, I remember it being near this place... I think over in this direction?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She points to your right, through a rough-looking thicket of tall bushes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m pretty certain, at least. Do you... Want to go see it?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You give her a thumbs up, and tell her to lead the way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles, before taking your hand in hers once more.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She starts to walk with you, leading you to where the old mine is.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After another 5 minutes, you arrive at a wide hole in the side of a hill.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The entrance is halfway covered in dirt, but it still looks like it has has enough room for the two of you to fit through if you duck down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you pause at the entrance, and Zoey looks at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well, this is it. The old mine.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I asked my Dad a couple of times, but he has no clue what they mined here. Maybe Zinc. I know they mine that up in the Appalachians, and that isn&#039;t too far away from here.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was probably right. You couldn&#039;t think of any other abundant mineral or metal around here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anyways, I&#039;ve never even been inside it. It always scared me when I was young.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She huffs a bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t know. I guess it&#039;s just something about an abandoned mine-shaft that just gives me the spooks.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;And we didn&#039;t bring flashlights, so I guess it&#039;s exploration will just have to wait another day.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You knew your phone had a flashlight, but you had left it back at the cabin to charge.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had kind of wanted to explore it further, but there was no way you were exploring an old rotting mine-shaft with no source of light.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That&#039;s how people go missing and die.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey taps you on the shoulder as you stare into the dark maw of the mine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s go somewhere else. I hate this place.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stiffens up a bit after saying this.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;B-but we can stay if you want to, of course... Don&#039;t feel pressured to leave just because of me. This is your vacation too.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You give her a reassuring smile, and tell her it&#039;s fine. There was no use hanging around some dumb old mineshaft when you had a whole forest to look around.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She takes hold of your hand again, and tells you:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come on, Anon! I still have lots of places to show you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod, and let her lead you back into the dark woods.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For the next hour and a half, Zoey gives you an encompassing tour of the forest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had joked about it, but it looks like she really DOES know this place like the back of her hand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a while though, you had started to feel a bit peckish.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ignored it, but the second Zoey heard your stomach start to growl, she refused to continue until you sated your hunger.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sits you down on a fallen log, and sits right next to you, her shoulder bumping into yours.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come on, Anon. Bust out those sandwiches.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod, and take the pack off, setting on the ground in front of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You unzip it, handing her a canteen and a sandwich.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She bites into her sandwich, before turning to look at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I gotta say, Anon. I can see why you love these so much.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Salami and cheese is pretty nice once in awhile.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you eat your sandwiches, savoring every bite.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You brush the crumbs off of your pants and hands, then turn to look at Zoey sitting next to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You thank her for making it for you, and she gently bumps her muzzle against the side of your head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Thanks Anon. It&#039;s... Nice to hear that from you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I like how we&#039;ve always got along. We&#039;re like two pieces of a puzzle.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You&#039;ve always so nice to me...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She slips an arm over your shoulders and pulls you closer, her head resting on top of yours.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s just sit here for a bit... This is nice.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You open your mouth to say something, but quickly close it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is pretty nice, and you don&#039;t want to ruin it by saying something stupid.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can hear Zoey gently breathing through her nose, taking in your scent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She tightens her grip on your shoulder a bit, bringing you into her fluff a bit more.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can hear her tail as it wags against the log, making a small brushing noise.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It wags a bit more slowly though, as she lifts her muzzle off of your head to look at your face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Theres an shy, almost uncomfortable look on her face as she asks you:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon... Can I tell you something?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her that you&#039;ll listen to anything she has to say.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon... I... I really like you...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pat her on the back, and tell her that you like her too. You&#039;re glad that the two of you have always been close.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She whines a bit, and you can see she looks very nervous.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;No, Anon... What I&#039;m trying to say is that...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She whines louder and longer this time, and it almost seems like she&#039;s about to cry.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon... I love you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you can answer, she buries her muzzle in your neck, her arms wrapped tightly around you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s whining almost nonstop, and you can feel her tears start to dampen your shoulder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, shit. You didn&#039;t see this coming.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you feel her breath start to hitch, you can feel her start to cry a bit.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull one arm out of her grasp, and rest it around her shoulder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She brings her snout out of your neck a bit, her tear-stained eyes peeking out at you with a worried look.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;A-Anon?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lean towards her, and give her a small kiss on the top of her head, and you can hear her let out a small gasp.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her that you&#039;ve always liked her too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stares at you frozen, a wide smile on her face. Her eyes are still full of tears, but you don&#039;t think they&#039;re tears of stress anymore.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her that you were always terrified of making the first move. You didn&#039;t want to make things weird between the two of you, just in case she didn&#039;t share the same feelings as you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her mouth opens, and she quickly says:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon... Anon, I&#039;ve always loved you!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pulls you into a tight hug, the side of her muzzle pressing into your neck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I felt the same way... I never knew if you liked me in that way or not...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You&#039;ve always been there to support me, even when nobody else did...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pulls back a bit, and looks at you with a hopeful look on her face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon, Can... Can I kiss you?

I won&#039;t stop until you BREED me PROPERLY!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And with that, one of her hands reach down and grabs your length, stroking it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t need any further lubrication. You&#039;re still slick from her saliva, and her own natural lubricants are dripping down from her triangle shaped pussy onto your cock.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She rubs the head of your cock against her steaming hot snatch, causing the two of you to shudder will glee.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She takes a couple seconds to align your dick with her entrance, then she slowly lowers herself onto you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your dick slips inside of her like it had always belonged there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey gasps, and drops her weight on you, slamming you to the hilt inside of her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you yell out each others names in a fit of pleasure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking at Zoey, she looks like she&#039;s about to pass out from the stimulation.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You arent faring much better.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her depths grip your cock like a slime covered vice, trying to milk you of your seed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She slowly grinds against you, forcing a low moan out of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey looks down at you, tears in the corners of her eyes, a loving grin on her face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;A-Anon... I... I love you... So,so much...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I hope you- Ah! I hope you l-like how I feel!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her tail is wagging extremely fast, brushing across your thighs behind her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I... I saved myself just for you! You&#039;re the first one to ever be inside me... And I&#039;m going to keep you the ONLY person to ever be inside me...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sees the alarm in your eyes as you realize she&#039;s a virgin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;N-No! Don&#039;t worry- Ah! Don&#039;t worry, Anon! You aren&#039;t hurting me... C-Canines are a lot different than hu-human girls...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sees that you&#039;re still concerned, so she grabs your shoulders and pulls you until you&#039;re sitting up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gives you a reassuring kiss, and wraps her arms around your back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Are y-you ready, Anon?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You answer her by bucking your hips into her a tiny bit, causing her to yip and grip your tighter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gives a couple quick pants, before saying:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll... I&#039;ll get you back for that...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her to do her worst and she just grins at you, easing you back down onto the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Just... Just let me do all the work... You just... Enjoy...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you can respond, she lifts off of you a couple inches, then slams back onto your hips.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then she does it again. And again. And again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She settles into a steady rhythm, riding you with all she has, crying out your name.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your mind becomes cloudy with pleasure, and all you can do is moan and thrust your hips up to meet her when she comes down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Suddenly, Zoey drops down on you but doesn&#039;t pop back up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Instead, you feel her folds clench tightly around you, and she cries out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s a bit unsteady, and falls forward onto your chest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your a bit irritated that you weren&#039;t able to finish, but Zoey soothes your worries by saying:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not... Not done yet, Anon... Gonna make you fuck a load of puppies into me... Gonna make you MINE...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She moves off of you, and your dick flops out of her, still rock hard and glistening with her fluids.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She turns around on her hands and knees, raising her tail to expose herself to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It truly is a wonderful sight, and you find yourself staring at it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey whines, turning around.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;D-Don&#039;t just stare at it... Come on, Anon! I want you! I NEED YOU!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not wanting to keep her waiting, you grab her ass (making her let out a pleasured yip), and position it better.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You slide your dick back inside of her steaming, puffy, dog pussy, forcing a moan out of the two of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Go as r-rough as you want, Anon! I want it ALL!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t want to disappoint her, and so you&#039;re happy to oblige.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not taking the time to build up a rhythm, you immediately start pounding her, causing the bed to rock and creak.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey certainly seems to enjoy it, yelling:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;YES! OH, FUUUCK! BREED ME, ANON!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pound at her plump hole, intent on filling her up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There was no fucking way that you were ever going back to Human women after this.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shit, you didn&#039;t even think you would even be able to go back to using your hand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There was just no competing with Zoey.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Several minutes later, Zoey has already cum twice, and you begin to feel a familiar feeling beginning to creep up through your body.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey is face down in the mattress, moaning and groaning as you pound away at her slippery cunt.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you let her know you&#039;re about to cum, she immediately perks up, shouting:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;INSIDE! I NEED IT INSIDE! PLEASE, ANON!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She starts thrusting her ass back at you to meet your thrusts, causing your cock to plunge into the deepest parts of her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her added efforts tip you over the edge, and you grab her ass, stuffing yourself as deep inside of her as you can.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your eyes pop open wide, and you swear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have the most violent, most pleasurable orgasm you&#039;ve ever had.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your cock explodes deep inside of her, the cum getting blasted straight into her waiting womb.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;YES! OH GOD, YES ANON! GIVE IT ALL TO ME!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gleefully yips as the last of your jizz shoots into her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When the last of your cum is safely resting deep inside of Zoey, you slowly pull out of her, groaning.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey flops forward onto her chest, a thin stream of drool hanging out of her mouth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;A-Anon... You... You did it...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gets back on her hands, crawling over to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She grabs hold of you, forcing you under the blankets with her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She holds you tight, one hand on your back, the other hand on the back of your head, gently pushing your face into the crook of her neck, deep into her floof.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The rest of her body rubs against you, rubbing her scent deep into your skin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey licks your ear and neck, and whispers in your ear:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We&#039;re mates now, Anon... I&#039;m all yours, and you&#039;re all mine... Forever...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You slide your arms over and under her, holding her close.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She lets out a content noise, her muzzle pressing into your hair, her nose lightly blowing warm air onto your hair and scalp.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Forever...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You gently stroke her back, soothing her to sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually you feel Zoey&#039;s grip on you relax, and she stops rubbing against you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yeah, she&#039;s asleep alright.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quickly follow her, your eyes shutting, and sleep takes you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wake up first, light shining through the window onto you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can&#039;t bear to wake up Zoey, though. You&#039;re just too damn comfortable to let this end.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your arms must have slipped off of her while you slept, and you quickly wrap them back around her, your fingers sinking into her soft fur.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sadly though, this stirs her awake, and she lets out a whining yawn.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see one of her eyes slowly open, but when she sees you laying in her arms she&#039;s awake in an instant.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon!? Oh thank God! I was so worried that it was all a dream...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You assure you that it was all real, and she strokes your back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I hope you realize that we&#039;re together now, Anon... Forever. I&#039;m NEVER letting you go...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile, telling her that if she&#039;s happy, you&#039;re happy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can hear her tail wag, swishing in-between the sheets and blankets.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you tell her that she&#039;ll have to let go of you for just a moment. Then you&#039;ll return to her right away.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gives you a confused and worried look.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;W-what? Anon?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You slide out of her hold, causing her to let out a loud whine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Nooo... Stay...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile, and walk over to the window.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You close the curtains, blocking out that damn sunshine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nature could fucking wait. You had all you needed in life laying in bed 5 feet away from you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She slides the covers off of her as you walk back, and she spreads her arms and legs out for your return.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lay back in bed next to her, sliding into her grasp.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon... Can you, uh... Pet me? Please?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile, saying that of course you&#039;ll pet her whenever she wants. All she needs to do is ask.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shudders a bit as your hands get to work on her large pointed ears.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They&#039;re a bit cold, but you&#039;re all too happy to warm them up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;From the way Zoey is happily sighing, you think she doesn&#039;t mind it either.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This was the best morning you&#039;ve ever had in your life.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The rest of the week seemingly flies by, either spent exploring the wilderness with your new partner, or fucking each others brains out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sometimes both. Usually both.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No fucking way you were ever having sex in a canoe ever again, though.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s not fun being suddenly dunked into ice cold water when the boat flips as you&#039;re balls deep in your doggy lover.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Other than that one unfortunate incident though, the rest of the week is spent in a state of almost constant bliss.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sadly though, all good things come to an end sooner or later.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Currently, it was the afternoon, and after a late breakfast you and Zoey started packing away all of your belongings.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You both had work tomorrow, and so you had to get back to town.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you had already cleaned up the living room, kitchen, and bathroom of all your belongings.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re lazily cramming your belongings back into the suitcase, and you let out a disappointed sigh.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You knew that the week was going to end sooner or later, but it seems like it just flew by so quickly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey must sense your discontent, as she comes next to you, squatting next to you to plant a kiss on the back of your neck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry, Anon. It&#039;s not like you won&#039;t see me again.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;In fact, I wanted to talk to ypu about that. How does dinner together sound after work tomorrow? At my place.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looked at you with her eyes fully open, a hopeful look on her face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her that of course you would. You think you&#039;ll be spending A LOT more time with her now. Even more than you already did.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gleefully claps her hands together, smiling.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Thank you, Anon! I promise I&#039;ll make you the best dinner you&#039;ve ever had!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey puts her arm around you, resting her head on your shoulder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon... I hope you know that I meant what I said when I told you that I loved you... That wasn&#039;t just the heat talking.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You zip up your suitcase, smiling.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You bring up one of your hands to gently pat her on the head, telling her that you love her too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She lets out a satisfied huff, her tail thumping against the floor as you pet her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Th-thank you, Anon...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It brought you great satisfaction to see how she practically melted in your hands when you started petting her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She reluctantly pulls way from you, sighing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well, we can continue this later. For now let&#039;s just focus on getting our shit packed up.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod, standing up with your suitcase.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Okay, You load our luggage into the car, and I&#039;ll make sure we didn&#039;t miss anything.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Goddammit, she was still making you carry the heavy stuff.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You suppose that some things never change.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The trunk of Zoey&#039;s Jeep shuts with a muffled thump as you close it shut.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey leans out of the open window, saying:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come on, Anon! I know you like it out here, but I&#039;m not leaving you behind!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you&#039;ll be right there, as you gaze out at the cabin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were going to miss this place.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh, turning around to climb into the Jeep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It had been one of the best weeks of your life, and now you had to return to your monotonous job.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That&#039;s just the way things go, though.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You open the door to the Jeep, before planting yourself on the seat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Zoey leans over to you with a smile, licking your cheek.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You know, I got my scent on you now.

        <textarea class="textarea">TIME OF THE SEASON

&gt;Be Anon.
&gt;You stood at 5&#039;9&quot;, and were 26 years old.
&gt;You were currently in the passenger seat of your best friend&#039;s car, heading out to her parent&#039;s cabin in the middle of the woods. It was early Autumn.
&gt;Your best friend&#039;s name was Zoey. She was an Anthro German Shepard, and the same age as you.
&gt;You had been the best of friends since childhood.
&gt;You still lived relatively close to each other, so unlike the rest of your childhood friends, the two of you had remained close.
&gt;Zoey worked as a police officer, her job being to detect drugs.
&gt;Having the nose of a dog had its benefits in her line of work, and after a large successful drug bust, she had landed some vacation time as a nice bonus.
&gt;You worked at some shitty office, but you did well at your job.
&gt;When Zoey had told you about the time off she had, the two of you had agreed to take a small vacation together.
&gt;You were using up most of your vacation time for the year, but you didn&#039;t care. This is what it&#039;s for anyways, right?

&gt;You were sitting in the passenger seat, staring out the window, watching the landscape fly by.
&gt;&quot;Hey, Anon.&quot;
&gt;You turned to look at Zoey. 
&gt;She was a German Shepherd, with light brown fur on her front, and black fur on her back. She stood at 6&#039;3&quot;.
&gt;&quot;We&#039;re only about 20 minutes away now.&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s right next to a lake... I used to love the place when I was a kid.&quot;
&gt;She had gone often as a child, but her parents had never taken you along.
&gt;Zoeys&#039; parents weren&#039;t too big on Humans.
&gt;It didn&#039;t matter now, though. They had moved down to Florida a while ago now, so they couldn&#039;t exactly protest to Zoey bringing you up to the cabin.
&gt;You lean back into the seat, and close your eyes.
&gt;You tell Zoey to wake you up when you reach the cabin.
&gt;Zoey nods, keeping her attention on the wheel.
&gt;&quot;Okay, Anon.&quot;

&gt;You&#039;re startled awake by Zoey shaking your shoulder.
&gt;&quot;Come on, wake up! We&#039;re here!&quot;
&gt;You tell her to stop shaking you, and she smiles.
&gt;&quot;Get up, I want to show you the place!&quot;
&gt;She sounds pretty excited, and as she gets out of the door, you get a nice view of her tail wagging. And her ass.
&gt;You quickly look away, and get out of the car.
&gt;You had never quite taken it to the next level with Zoey when you were younger. Mostly because of her parents.
&gt;The two of you had dated different people in the past, but nothing had ever come out of the relationships. None of them had ever lasted longer than a few months.
&gt;You move away from the car, over to where Zoey is excitedly looking at the cabin, her tail wagging wildly.
&gt;She turns to look at you, a wide grin on her face.
&gt;&quot;So, what do you think, Anon?&quot;
&gt;You&#039;ve got to say. You&#039;re impressed. 
&gt;The cabin is only one story high, but it looks pretty spacious from the outside.
&gt;Theres a large lake less than 100 feet away from the cabin, with a small shed sitting near a dock. That must be where they keep the canoe.
&gt;You tell her it looks nice, and she ushers you inside.
&gt;It&#039;s a bit musty smelling in the cabin, but it overall looks pretty good.
&gt;It has a small cooking area with a table and chairs near the entrance, leading into a large living room with couches, some bookshelves, and a large stone fireplace against the wall.
&gt;You can see three rooms with doors. One is probably the bathroom, and the other two must be bedrooms.
&gt;It looks a bit dusty, but overall nicer than you expected.
&gt;You tell Zoey this, and her tail continues to wag.
&gt;&quot;Thanks, Anon! I haven&#039;t been up here in... Four years? I&#039;m pretty sure?&quot;
&gt;She shakes her head.
&gt;&quot;Whatever, it doesn&#039;t matter.&quot;
&gt;She gestures back to the door.
&gt;&quot;Alright, now lets go get our luggage in, and then we can settle in. Sound good?&quot;
&gt;You nod, and the two of you head back out to her car.

&gt;The two of you were spending a week up here, so you had brought plenty of stuff.
&gt;The car was filled to the brim.
&gt;Zoey drove an old, beat up Jeep.
&gt;The two of you were standing at the trunk, staring at the luggage.
&gt;&quot;Alright, Anon. You grab the food, and I&#039;ll grab the clothes.&quot;
&gt;Even though she was bigger and stronger than you, she of course still made you lug the heavy stuff inside.
&gt;&quot;Come on, Anon! Work those arms! Maybe someday you&#039;ll be as strong as me!&quot;
&gt;That was pretty unlikely. You could answer calls and fill out spreadsheets at the speed of sound, but you were seriously lacking in the fitness department. 
&gt;You weren&#039;t fat or anything, but you didn&#039;t exactly impress the ladies with your twig arms.
&gt;It was a point Zoey had always joked with you about.
&gt;It took a few trips, but you had finally managed to get all the food inside.
&gt;As you were stocking the empty cabinets and fridge, Zoey plopped down on the couch, stretching and yawning.
&gt;&quot;Anon, I got all our stuff sitting in our room.&quot;
&gt;Wait, our room? You ask her what she meant, and she responds:
&gt;&quot;Well theres two bedrooms. My parents used one of them, and Me and my brothers used the other one.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Since I&#039;m pretty sure neither of us are gonna fit in bunk-beds designed for children, we&#039;re gonna have to share a room. Oh, and a bed.&quot;
&gt;You were a bit nervous. You had never shared a bed with Zoey, and you didn&#039;t want to make things weird.
&gt;You offer to sleep on one of the couches, but she quickly replies:
&gt;&quot;Heck no, Anon. These couches are all old, musty, and cold.&quot;
&gt;&quot;What? Are you intimidated by...&quot;
&gt;She gives you a semi-serious look, then sarcastically strikes a bodybuilder&#039;s pose, flexing her muscles.
&gt;&quot;ALL OF THIS?!&quot;
&gt;You chuckle, shaking your head.
&gt;You tell her you&#039;ll share the bed, and she smiles.
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry, Anon. It&#039;ll be fine.&quot;

&gt;The two of you settle in to the cabin, and pretty soon the skies begin to darken a bit. Looking at your phone, you can see It&#039;s 7&#039;o clock.
&gt;&quot;Well, it looks like we should get started on dinner, Anon.&quot;
&gt;You nod, and ask her what she&#039;s in the mood for.
&gt;&quot;I think we should cook that chicken we brought. I know my Dad keeps a little propane camping grill around here somewhere. I just have to find it...&quot;
&gt;You tell her you didn&#039;t see it when you were stocking the cabinets, and she shrugs.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m going to look around.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Tell you what. While I&#039;m looking around the cabin, why don&#039;t you walk around the property? You know... familiarize yourself with the place.&quot;
&gt;It sounds like a good idea to you, and you tell her you will. 
&gt;She smiles, nodding quickly.
&gt;&quot;Great! Okay, I&#039;ll come get you when we&#039;re ready to start cooking. Take your time. Please.&quot;
&gt;She seems pretty eager to get you out of the cabin.
&gt;The two of you get up. Zoey heads into one of the other rooms, and you leave out the front door.

&gt;It wasn&#039;t very bright outside, but the sun was still up.
&gt;You look around, taking in the scenery.
&gt;The cabin was surrounded on almost every side by a thick forest.
&gt;On one side a large lake sat.
&gt;Going over to the lake, you step on the small dock.
&gt;Zoey had told you that her Father had often fished in the lake, then cooked what he had caught for dinner.
&gt;Sound like something you should try and do before you left.
&gt;You had gone fishing a lot as a child, and you had enjoyed it. You didn&#039;t have much time for it nowadays, though.
&gt;Stepping off of the dock, you approach an old shed where the dock meets the land.
&gt;You try to open the door, and the hinges creek loudly as it slowly opens.
&gt;Inside it&#039;s pretty dark...
&gt;You get out your phone and turn on Its flashlight. 
&gt;Now you can clearly see the interior. You see a couple canoes hanging up on the side of the shed.
&gt;Nice, you could go fishing right out in the middle of the lake.
&gt;On the other sides of the shed, you just see various tools and some fishing stuff. Nothing too interesting.
&gt;You exit the shed, being sure to close the door behind you. The door has no lock or latch, but this place is so far out in the wilderness that you&#039;re pretty sure burglary isn&#039;t much of a concern.
&gt;You step over to where the clearing around the cabin meets the forest, peering into the dark woods.
&gt;These were all old growth trees, and they were some of the tallest ones you had ever seen.
&gt;Most trees still had all of their leaves on them, although they had all turned various shades of red, orange, and yellow.
&gt;As a result, the forest had a dark, ominous look to them.
&gt;It was starting to get really dark outside, and you think you better wrap up this unoffical tour of the propery.
&gt;You decide to walk around the cabin before you head back inside.

&gt;You don&#039;t see anything you wouldn&#039;t expect. There&#039;s a decent sized woodpile for the fireplace out here covered by a tarp, and a small spot to cut more if needed.
&gt;As you walk near one of the windows by the bedrooms though, you hear a strange noise coming from within.
&gt;It sounds like Zoey, but she&#039;s making these weird grunting noises.
&gt;Maybe she&#039;s moving stuff around inside?
&gt;You decide to peer through the window.
&gt;When you see what she&#039;s doing though, it makes your heart skip a beat.
&gt;She&#039;s laying on a bed with her pants around her ankles.
&gt;One of her hands is in her mouth, in an attempt to muffle the sounds that she&#039;s making. 
&gt;Her other hand is knuckle deep in her canine pussy, a few fingers quickly pumping in and out of her triangular folds.
&gt;Holy shit, she&#039;s really going to town on herself!
&gt;You duck out of sight from the window before she sees you.
&gt;Fuck, this must be why she was so eager for you to get out of the cabin. 
&gt;You knew that neither of you had dated anyone in awhile, but you had no clue that she was this pent up.
&gt;You decide to wait outside until she comes to get you.
&gt;You didn&#039;t want to risk... interrupting her.
&gt;You move away from the back of the cabin, walking back to the front.
&gt;You go over and sit on the dock, and watch the lake, trying to get the image of your best friend masturbating out of your mind.

&gt;About 10 more minutes pass, and you hear the cabin door open.
&gt;&quot;Anon! I found the grill! Come on, let&#039;s start making dinner!&quot;
&gt;You yell back that you&#039;ll be right in, and you hear the door shut.
&gt;Well, time to head inside.
&gt;You sigh, and start to walk back to the cabin.
&gt;Opening the door, you&#039;re greeted by the sight of Zoey fiddling with the grill, a frown on her face.
&gt;You shut the door, and hang your coat up on a small hook.
&gt;She looks up at you, then speaks up:
&gt;&quot;Anon, I can&#039;t get this stupid thing to light. Can you give me a hand?&quot;
&gt;You say of course, and you look at it with her.
&gt;It&#039;s a standard miniature propane camping grill.
&gt;The first thing that comes to mind is the propane.
&gt;You check the small cylinder of propane, and notice that it&#039;s empty.
&gt;You let Zoey know, and she frowns.
&gt;&quot;I didn&#039;t see any more propane in the closet...&quot;
&gt;You offer to run out to a store real quick. These propane cylinders were pretty cheap, and you could be back within 45 minutes.
&gt;&quot;You sure, Anon? You don&#039;t know this area too well.&quot;
&gt;You tell her you&#039;ll just use the GPS on your phone, and she considers your idea for a moment before speaking.
&gt;&quot;Well... Okay, Anon. Just be quick. Here&#039;s the keys.&quot;
&gt;She hands you the car keys, and you pocket them.
&gt;You tell her you&#039;ll make it quick, and you grab your jacket, slipping it back on.
&gt;You head out the door, and towards the Jeep.
&gt;Climbing into the Jeep, you get out your phone.
&gt;You set the GPS to lead you towards a local shop. They should have propane.
&gt;You pat your pocket to make sure your wallet is on you, and then you stick the key in the ignition, turning it.
&gt;The Jeep starts up, and you pull out into the darkness, the headlights lighting your way.
&gt;You traverse the bumpy dirt road, before turning onto the main road.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt;Be Zoey.
&gt;You were an Anthro German Shepard.
&gt;You were watching your best friend Anon as he got into your car, and then left the property.
&gt;You frowned. You should have gone.
&gt;Anon should be fine. You knew he was a good driver.
&gt;Damn it, you should&#039;ve brought propane! You always forget something!
&gt;You sigh, sitting down on one of the couches, a puff of dust shooting out from the fabric.
&gt;This place was a lot dustier than you remembered. But then again, it HAD been empty for the last four years or so, after all.
&gt;You were thinking about Anon.
&gt;You really liked him... And not as a friend, either.
&gt;You had invited him up to the cabin so you could get to know him a lot... &quot;better&quot; than you already did.
&gt;But sadly, you don&#039;t think he had picked up on any of the hints you had been giving him. He was too sweet for his own good.
&gt;You had bent over when you got out of the car to give him a nice view of your ass, but you saw him look away quickly.
&gt;Then you had teased him about being weak, and you cursed yourself for doing that. You think he might be a little self-conscious about it...
&gt;You had made him wait outside while you got yourself off... You were hoping he would have come back inside, and caught you in the act.
&gt;Sadly though, he had followed your instructions to wait outside.
&gt;You huff, scratching at your loins.
&gt;You were going into heat pretty soon, and you could feel an itch starting to form deep inside you.
&gt;You were hoping Anon could help you &quot;scratch&quot; it, but the chances of that weren&#039;t looking too good...
&gt;Oh shit, what if he didn&#039;t even LIKE Anthros in the way you were thinking...
&gt;Well... You still had lots of time. You had planned to stay the whole week here, and that should be plenty of time to convince him to help you out with your heat.
&gt;You stand up.
&gt;You decide to distract yourself from the growing heat in your pants by doing some work.
&gt;You move over to the kitchen, noticing the dust on the counters.
&gt;You should clean it up a bit while Anon is gone.
&gt;Looking into the cabinet under the sink, you grab an old bottle of cleaning fluid. This stuff doesn&#039;t go bad, right?
&gt;You grab a tattered rag, and spray some of the lemon-scented fluid onto the counter.
&gt;You begin to clean the dust off of the counters. You&#039;re pretty certain that Anon had allergies, and you didn&#039;t want the trip to be ruined by him sneezing every couple of seconds.

&gt;After a short time, you finish dusting the kitchen.
&gt;Looking at the rest of the cabin, you decide you should clean a bit more before Anon gets back.
&gt;You think that it should make him happy to come back and see that everything is clean.
&gt;You decide to work on the bedroom first.
&gt;You had been telling Anon the truth about how the other beds were too small, but you didn&#039;t tell him about the inflatable mattress your parents kept in the cabin.
&gt;You wanted him close, and him sleeping on some cold plastic bubble just wouldn&#039;t do.
&gt;Besides, sleeping next to you would be more comfortable.
&gt;You smiled at the thought.
&gt;You look at the bed.
&gt;There was a small damp spot on the bed where you had got yourself off.
&gt;You stripped the dusty blanket and sheets off of the bed, and shove them into the closet.
&gt;You had brought your own bedding, and you put it on the bed.
&gt;You hope Anon will be comfortable.
&gt;Your tail wags at the thought of him snuggled up close to you, grasping onto your chest for warmth...
&gt;Maybe he would even grab a bit lower...
&gt;Your tail wags violently at the thought, and you can even feel a small twitch in your pants.
&gt;You shake your head at the thought, and walk back into the small kitchen.
&gt;You had to wait for now. Anon was going to be back soon, and you were going to cook him a nice dinner.
&gt;Then the two of you would go to sleep. Together.
&gt;All of a sudden, your canine ears detect the sound of a car pulling up the dirt road leading to the cabin.
&gt;Peering out the window, you can see your Jeep pull up to the cabin. The lights in it shut off, and you see Anon get out with a couple bags in his hand.
&gt;You smile, and sit in the kitchen, waiting for him to enter.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt;Be Anon.
&gt;It had taken awhile to get to the store and back, but you got everything you needed.
&gt;You had even picked up a couple extra things. Some fishing bait, and air freshener.
&gt;The cabin had a stale smell to it, and you intended to fix that.
&gt;You pull up to the cabin, and you shut off the car.
&gt;You grab the bags, and exit the Jeep.
&gt;Locking the door behind you, you walk up the cabin with two bags in your hands.
&gt;You had gotten four canisters of the propane, which enough to last you the week. 
&gt;Or at least you hope it will. You really don&#039;t want to run out again. Not many Humans live out in this part of the state, and you had gotten some strange looks from the people at the store.
&gt;You push the door open, and are greeted by Zoey&#039;s smiling face.
&gt;&quot;How did it go, Anon?&quot;
&gt;You tell her you got everything you needed, and you set the bags down on the counter.
&gt;Zoey rifles through it, and cocks her head at you when she sees the fishing bait.
&gt;&quot;Okay, I can understand the air freshener, but what&#039;s with the worms?&quot;
&gt;She smiles.
&gt;&quot;I thought we were having chicken.&quot;
&gt;You tell her that you saw some fishing stuff in the shed, and that you wanted to try your hand at some fishing maybe tomorrow.
&gt;&quot;Oh, Okay! I was never really into fishing, but I could chat with you while you did it.&quot;
&gt;You tell her that would be fine, and her tail wags.
&gt;&quot;Okay, let&#039;s try to get this grill working.&quot;
&gt;You disconnect the old propane canister from the grill, and toss it in the bin.
&gt;You attach the new one, and light the grill.
&gt;It flares to life, and the two of you smile.
&gt;&quot;Thanks, Anon!&quot;
&gt;You get the chicken out of the fridge and put it on the counter. It was just some cheap chicken breasts you had picked up on the way here, but they should cook up nicely.
&gt;You tell Zoey that you&#039;ll cook, but she stops you.
&gt;&quot;No, Anon. You go sit down and relax. I want to cook.&quot;
&gt;You tell her you&#039;d be fine making the chicken, but she isn&#039;t hearing it.
&gt;She shakes her head and tells you:
&gt;&quot;No. I&#039;m going to cook for you. I want to treat you. I know you survive mostly off of frozen dinners and takeout. I know you can&#039;t cook for shit.&quot;
&gt;You frown a bit at the unintended insult, and head over to the couch a bit dejected.
&gt;You plop down on the couch, and stretch out.
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry, Anon. I&#039;ll have it done for you soon. I promise you it&#039;ll be real good~&quot;
&gt;You smile, and sit there, watching the German Shepard cook for you.

&gt;20 minutes pass, and eventually the chicken is done.
&gt;Zoey had popped some green beans into the old microwave and heated them up for the two of you also.
&gt;She plates the meals and calls you over.
&gt;&quot;Anon, it&#039;s ready! Come on and sit next to me here.&quot;
&gt;She pulls out the chair next to her as you walk into the kitchen.
&gt;You sit next to her at the table, and she slides a dish in front of you.
&gt;&quot;I hope you like it, Anon.&quot;
&gt;You tell her it looks good, and she grins at you, her tail slapping against you.
&gt;The two of you begin to eat, and you have to admit. It&#039;s pretty good.
&gt;The two of you are pretty silent as you eat, more focused on eating than you are on chatting.
&gt;Pretty soon the two of you are done eating.
&gt;Zoey takes your empty plate and starts to get up, but you quickly stop her.
&gt;You tell her that you&#039;ll wash the dishes, and she frowns.
&gt;&quot;But Anon-&quot;
&gt;You cut her off, and tell her that you&#039;ll take care of it. She made you a nice dinner, and you want to pay her back.
&gt;She smiles, and gives you a small hug, her wet nose poking your ear. You can hear her sniff at you a bit.
&gt;She happily sighs, her tail wagging.
&gt;&quot;Thanks, Anon.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m going to go... Take a quick shower. Before bed.&quot;
&gt;She seems eager to go shower.
&gt;You watch her as she quickly rushes into the bathroom, shutting the door behind her, the lock clicking shut.
&gt;You can hear the pipes in the wall creek as warm water rushes through them.
&gt;You can hear water in the shower, and steam drifts from underneath the door as you wash the dishes.
&gt;The two of you had cleaned your plates, so you don&#039;t have to scrub the plates too hard.
&gt;You&#039;re done pretty quickly, and you wait on the couch for her to finish. You wanted to shower too.

&gt;Soon, you hear the water in the shower shut off.
&gt;You hear a small whine from in the bathroom, and the door opens a tiny bit.
&gt;&quot;Anon? I need you to do me a small favor...&quot;
&gt;&quot;I, Uh... Forgot to grab clothes.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Would you mind just... Going through my stuff and getting me something to wear?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Just... You know. A shirt, pajama pants... Panties...&quot;
&gt;Fuck.
&gt;&quot;Sorry, Anon.&quot;
&gt;You tell her it&#039;s fine, and you go into the bedroom.
&gt;Her suitcase is on the floor, and you unzip it.
&gt;You uncomfortably dig around in it, looking for something she can wear.
&gt;It feels a bit wrong going through her stuff, but she DID tell you to do this...
&gt;You grab some flannel pants for her, a shirt, and a bra.
&gt;You had never thought that being unable to find panties would ever be a problem you had.
&gt;Opening one of the side pockets on the suitcase, you stick your hand inside.
&gt;You pull out a pair of clean undergarments.
&gt;It&#039;s a plain white pair of panties, with some simple lace on the sides.
&gt;You grab everything and stumble back over to the bathroom.
&gt;You knock on the door, and a familiar muzzle peeks out, eyeing you.
&gt;You thrust the clothes through the crack in the door, and it closes.
&gt;After a couple minutes, the tall German Shepard walks out, and into the bedroom.
&gt;&quot;Thanks, Anon! I&#039;m going to get ready for bed now. You coming with?&quot;
&gt;You tell her you&#039;re going to take a quick shower too, and she nods.
&gt;You follow her into the bedroom, and grab some of your own clothes out of your suitcase.
&gt;Zoey smiles at you as you leave, settling under the covers.

&gt;Entering the bathroom, you lock the door behind you.
&gt;The bathroom looks pretty standard. It has a normal toilet, a sink.
&gt;The bathtub stands out a bit though. It&#039;s very large and takes up half of the room. It has a showerhead, too.
&gt;Shit, you forgot your soap.
&gt;You open the bathroom door and enter the bedroom again.
&gt;When you get inside, you see Zoey on the floor next to your suitcase. She&#039;s holding up one of your shirts to her nose, smelling it.
&gt;She looks terrified when she notices you standing there.
&gt;&quot;OH. Uh, hi. Anon.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m just... putting your clothes away.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I swear I&#039;m not being a creep.&quot;
&gt;This is awkward. 
&gt;You tell her that you needed the bar of soap you had in your suitcase.
&gt;&quot;Ummm... Here.&quot;
&gt;She hands you the small green bar of soap, and you quickly shuffle back into the bathroom.
&gt;You were just going to pretend you didn&#039;t see that.
&gt;You lock the door behind you again, and undress.
&gt;You climb into the large bathtub, and turn on the water.
&gt;Lucky for you, Zoey had only taken a quick shower, and there was a lot of hot water left.
&gt;As you wash yourself, your mind drifts to thinking about Zoey.
&gt;More specifically, what you saw her doing earlier.
&gt;You close your eyes, trying to think of something else, but it&#039;s no use.
&gt;You begin to stiffen as your mind is filled with images of Zoey getting herself off.
&gt;Well... You might as well &quot;take care&quot; of yourself while you&#039;re in here.
&gt;Your hand drifts down below the belt, and images of naked Anthros fill your mind.

&gt;15 minutes later, you sigh, turning off the shower.
&gt;You had managed to relieve yourself, and were feeling satisfied.
&gt;All of a sudden you realize you had just jerked off to the memory of your best friend naked.
&gt;You feel a bit ashamed, but what could you do?
&gt;You didn&#039;t want to have a boner while you were sleeping next to her. You didn&#039;t think that would go over too well.
&gt;You dry yourself off, and get dressed.
&gt;Leaving the bathroom, you head into the bedroom.
&gt;Zoey is sitting under the covers, looking at her phone.
&gt;She notices you enter, and quickly turns it off, setting it on the nightstand next to her.
&gt;&quot;I kept it warm for you, Anon. Now come on, It&#039;s time to sleep...&quot;
&gt;You notice she was sleeping on the side of the bed farthest away from the window.
&gt;You were going to have to sleep on the spot where you saw her masturbating.
&gt;You sigh. Well, at least she had changed the sheets.
&gt;Zoey gives you a concerned look, popping up a bit.
&gt;&quot;Something wrong, Anon?&quot;
&gt;You shake your head and tell her no. You&#039;re just... tired.
&gt;&quot;Well... Okay. Go to sleep now, alright?&quot;
&gt;You climb in bed, easing yourself under the covers. You leave a buffer zone between yourself and Zoey.
&gt;Zoey gets comfortable, laying on her side, facing you.
&gt;You&#039;re laying on your back, staring at the wooden ceiling.
&gt;&quot;Goodnight, Anon...&quot;
&gt;Zoey shuts off the light, and the room fills with darkness.
&gt;All you can hear is the sound of Zoey gently breathing, insect noises from out the window, and your own heartbeat.
&gt;You close your eyes, and eventually you drift to sleep.

&gt;You wake up, your eyes sliding open.
&gt;It was still dark.
&gt;Why did you feel so... Hot?
&gt;You&#039;re laying on your side, and you try to sit up, but realize you can&#039;t.
&gt;What the hell?
&gt;Oh shit.
&gt;While the two of you were sleeping, Zoey had pulled you closer to her, and trapped you in her arms.
&gt;Both of her arms were wrapped tight around your chest.
&gt;She was essentially spooning you, her legs pressing against hers.
&gt;You stay dead silent, listening. You can hear her gently breathing, her warm breath making a damp spot on your neck.
&gt;At least she&#039;s asleep.
&gt;The way you see it, you have two options.
&gt;Either wriggle your way out of her grasp...
&gt;Or just go with it and go back to sleep.
&gt;Her grasp was a little tight, though... And her breathing on you was getting a bit annoying.
&gt;You resolve to try and get out of her grasp. You just hope she didn&#039;t wake up.
&gt;You wiggle a bit, trying to get her arm loose.
&gt;At first she doesn&#039;t respond, so you get a bit bolder and try a bit harder.
&gt;You manage to pull away from her, and scooch back over to your side of the bed.
&gt;You hear a small whining noise from Zoey, and she starts to toss and turn.
&gt;She ends up grabbing a ton of blankets and cuddling with them, her breathing returning to normal.
&gt;Well, now you had another problem.
&gt;Zoey wasn&#039;t spooning you anymore, which was good, but now you had no blankets covering you.
&gt;It pretty damn cold. You should have lighted the fireplace before the two of you had gone to sleep.
&gt;You sit up, looking at Zoey.
&gt;She&#039;s snoozing quietly, her arms and legs wrapped around a lump of blankets.
&gt;You gently try to tug some of them back, only to be met by a quiet growl.
&gt;She had lost you, but there was no way she was going to lose the blankets.
&gt;You let out a frustrated sigh, and get out of the bed.
&gt;You go to the bathroom, and turn on the light.
&gt;Might as well piss while you&#039;re up.

&gt;You finish in the bathroom, and you almost jump out of your skin when you see Zoey appear in the doorway.
&gt;&quot;Anon? What are you doing up? It&#039;s late... You woke me up...&quot;
&gt;She seems more tired than even you are.
&gt;You lie, telling her you had woken up to go to the bathroom.
&gt;Naturally, it&#039;s pretty difficult to convince a police dog of a lie.
&gt;&quot;No, really. Why are you up?&quot;
&gt;You yawn a bit, and tell her that she had stolen all the blankets and you were cold.
&gt;That seems to wake her up a bit, and she quickly apologizes:
&gt;&quot;Whuh? Oh! I&#039;m sorry! Here, come back to bed, I&#039;ll give you an extra blanket.&quot;
&gt;You tell her you&#039;re fine, but she isn&#039;t having any of it.
&gt;She holds your hand, and leads you back into the bed.
&gt;She pretty much tucks you into the bed like she was your grandmother, covering you in a mountain of blankets.
&gt;She slips under the covers, her furry shoulder touching yours.
&gt;&quot;There. I won&#039;t let you get cold. I&#039;d kick myself if you got a cold while we were up here.&quot;
&gt;You thank her, and she pats your chest under the covers.
&gt;&quot;Goodnight, Anon. See you in the morning. I lo-&quot;
&gt;She stops herself, a nervous look on her face.
&gt;&quot;Uh... Goodnight.&quot;
&gt;You tell her goodnight, and the two of you drift back off to sleep.

&gt;You wake up to the sun shining through the window, light penetrating your eyelids.
&gt;You groan, and slowly get up.
&gt;The first thing you notice is Zoey isn&#039;t next to you.
&gt;The next thing you notice is the smell of hashbrowns and bacon cooking.
&gt;Oh sweet, she was making the two of you breakfast.
&gt;You throw on some jeans and a t-shirt out of your suitcase, balling up your sleepwear and jamming it in a small bag you brought for dirty clothes. You leave your phone on the nightstand.
&gt;Walking out into the kitchen while rubbing your eyes, you see Zoey standing there over the small cooktop.
&gt;&quot;Oh, hi Anon.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I already ate, so I thought I&#039;d make you some breakfast.&quot;
&gt;You can see her tail wagging slowly as she greets you.
&gt;You thank her, and her tail wags faster.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;ll be ready in a minute here, Anon.&quot;
&gt;You sit down at the kitchen table, and the German Shepard plates your food, setting it in front of you with a smile.
&gt;As you begin to eat, she sits next to you, leaning forward onto the counter.
&gt;She looks at you in the eyes, a wide smile on her face.
&gt;&quot;Sooo Anon. The temperature outside is supposed to get into the mid 80s today.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I was thinking... You want to do some swimming in the lake?&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;ll probably be the last time you&#039;ll be able to swim outside for the year. It&#039;s supposed to cool off tomorrow.&quot;
&gt;You consider the thought for a moment.
&gt;You tell her you would, but you didn&#039;t bring a swimsuit.
&gt;&quot;Oh, it doesn&#039;t matter, Anon. You can just go swimming in your underwear.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Or... Nothing at all. I don&#039;t care either way.&quot;
&gt;Ok, so she was suggesting that you skinny dip.
&gt;Swimming was pretty fun though, and you couldn&#039;t remember the last time you had a whole lake to yourself.
&gt;You tell her you were game for it, and she sits up, grinning.
&gt;&quot;Great! That&#039;s good to hear.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m going to head out and check the lake. See what the uh, temperature is.&quot;
&gt;You nod, and she quickly gets up and leaves the house, her tail wagging excitedly.
&gt;She must really like swimming.
&gt;That or she really wants to get you naked. It had always sort of been an inside joke between the two of you.
&gt;Zoey had casually flirted with you in the past jokingly, but she was seeming a bit serious now.
&gt;And the way she had been cooking for you, masturbating right after you had left the cabin, cleaned for you while you were gone, and even going so far as to sniff your clothing...
&gt;Oh shit. The realization hits you like debt hitting the Greek economy.
&gt;When was her next heat cycle due?
&gt;There was no way you were going to ask her, but you knew it was going to be soon.
&gt;She always got time off when she was on heat, as her line of work couldn&#039;t afford any distractions while on the job.
&gt;No wonder the police station had been so willing to give her vacation time. She would have been off duty anyways this week.
&gt;Damn. She had brought you up here right before she was about to hit her heat.
&gt;The week was about to get interesting.

&gt;You set your plate in the sink, and head outside.
&gt;Zoey is waiting patiently for you by the lake, and she waves you over.
&gt;&quot;Anon! The water&#039;s real nice!&quot;
&gt;&quot;You want to dig out the canoes? We could go paddling for a bit.&quot;
&gt;You tell her maybe later, and that you wanted to go fishing maybe tomorrow when it was cooler outside.
&gt;For now though, you wanted to go swimming.
&gt;&quot;Ok, Anon. Whatever you want to do.&quot;
&gt;She smiles at you, and walks over on the dock.
&gt;You follow her, the two of you standing on the very edge of the dock, looking into the deep blue water.
&gt;It looks pretty deep!
&gt;You ask her how deep it really is, and she responds:
&gt;&quot;Around 10 feet in the shallow parts near the shore, but in the middle it goes down to about 30 feet. I remember my brothers always diving for clams out there. We never ate them, but it was fun seeing who could collect the most.&quot;
&gt;You tell her it sounds like it was fun, and she frowns.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m sorry I was never able to take you up here with me and the family together, but you know how my parents are... They didn&#039;t even like us hanging out when we were little.&quot;
&gt;&quot;At least YOUR parents were fine with us being so close.&quot;
&gt;Your parents were pretty liberal when it came to Human-Anthro relations. They thought that the best way to coexist with Anthros was to befriend them, and it had showed in you and Zoey. The two of you had been close since the day you met.
&gt;Hell, you talked to her more than you did to most of your family.
&gt;Zoey snaps you out of your thoughts by throwing her arm over your shoulder, pulling you close.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m glad we did this, Anon. I think we both needed a short break from... I don&#039;t know. Everything.&quot;
&gt;You agree with her. You were good at your job, but it was soul-crushingly boring. You had been doing to same thing for so long that it was starting to eat away at your sanity.
&gt;You tell Zoey this, and she agrees.
&gt;&quot;Well, being a drug dog... Requires a lot of energy. It&#039;s an exciting job. Maybe a bit TOO exciting if you ask me.&quot;
&gt;&quot;At least it pays well. Oh well.&quot;
&gt;A devilish smile suddenly plays across Zoey&#039;s black and brown muzzle.
&gt;&quot;Anon... You said you wanted to go swimming, right?&quot;
&gt;Her grip tightens on your shoulder.
&gt;Yes?
&gt;&quot;Good.&quot;
&gt;She grabs you in a tight hug, and throws the two of you into the lake.

&gt;God damn, it&#039;s colder than your dead grandmother&#039;s heart in here!
&gt;You surface, gasping.
&gt;Zoey laughs, trudging back to the shore with you.
&gt;You&#039;re a bit pissed, but Zoey&#039;s smile disarms your anger.
&gt;&quot;Sorry, Anon. I&#039;ve always wanted to do that, but my brothers never let me.&quot;
&gt;You sigh, and begin to take your wet clothes off.
&gt;You can see Zoey eyeing you from the corner of your eye as she takes her own soaking wet clothes off, depositing them on the sandy shoreline.
&gt;You leave your underwear on, and turn around to look at Zoey to ask her how long she planned on swimming.
&gt;When you look at her though, your eyes widen in surprise.
&gt;She had taken ALL of her clothes off.
&gt;You could see everything.
&gt;And by everything, you meant EVERYTHING. Her canine snatch bared to the world.
&gt;She smiles mischievously at you, before wading into the lake, the water covering her nude body.
&gt;&quot;Come on in, Anon!&quot;
&gt;You stand there nervously, and Zoey replies.
&gt;&quot;Oh, don&#039;t be such a baby, Anon! It&#039;s not like there&#039;s anybody to see us out here. Now come on. Take those underwear off. I took mine off, so It&#039;s only fair.&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re not too sure that that&#039;s how it works, but you concede.
&gt;You strip off your soaked boxers while Zoey isn&#039;t looking, and you rush back into the water to cover yourself.
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s more like it, Anon!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Now let&#039;s try and have some fun. I&#039;ll race you around the lake!&quot;

&gt;You and Zoey spent the next couple hours or so swimming in the cool waters of the lake.
&gt;After a while, you had become used to the cold waters, and it became relaxing just lazily swimming around the lake.
&gt;Or it atleast it would have been, if Zoey hadn&#039;t come up to splash or dunk you every few minutes.
&gt;&quot;Come on, Anon! Don&#039;t make it so easy for me!&quot;
&gt;You try to swim away from her before she can dunk you under the water again, but she&#039;s a better swimmer than you.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m gonna getcha&#039;!&quot;
&gt;She catches up with you, grabbing at your chest.
&gt;She presses your back against her chest, her tits smooshing against you.
&gt;&quot;Got you~.&quot;
&gt;Oh shit.
&gt;Then she leans back, lifting you up.
&gt;She gets a hand under your thigh, flipping you, and suplexes you back down into the water.
&gt;After a moment you surface, spitting out lake water.
&gt;Zoey is laughing, seemingly pleased at your reaction.
&gt;You trudge back to the shore, with Zoey following closely behind.
&gt;&quot;Anon, you ready for lunch? I&#039;m getting a bit hungry.&quot;
&gt;You tell her you were planning on making yourself a sandwich, and she nods.
&gt;Alright, I&#039;m going to head in.
&gt;Zoey walks off to the cabin still in the buff, not even bothering to pick up her scattered clothes.
&gt;She isn&#039;t leaving much, if anything, to the imagination.
&gt;You hoped she would be dressed by the time you got inside.
&gt;You look at your clothes laying in a pile on the shore.
&gt;They were still really damp, but not dripping wet. You shrug, and put them back on.
&gt;You walk back into the house as Zoey leaves the bedroom wearing fresh clothes.
&gt;She looks a bit upset when she sees you wearing the wet clothes.
&gt;&quot;Anon, you better not drip water all over the damn place. I just cleaned this place yesterday.&quot;
&gt;You tell her it&#039;s fine, and she just huffs at you, walking to the fridge.
&gt;You enter the bedroom and shut the door behind you.
&gt;You take your damp clothes off, putting them in a bag you used a a hamper.
&gt;You grab a pair of boxers and slip them on.
&gt;You sit down on the bed mostly naked, sighing.
&gt;You were still pretty tired, as your sleep last night hadn&#039;t been very restful. That and you had just swam for the better part of two hours.
&gt;You had gone to sleep comfortable, but waking up in the middle of the night had taken a toll on you.
&gt;You rest your eyes for a second, laying back on the bed.
&gt;You were just going to rest for a second here. Or maybe a couple minutes. There was no rush.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt;Be Zoey
&gt;It&#039;s been a fun day so far.
&gt;You had woken up right next to Anon, his natural scent filling your sensitive nose.
&gt;He had woken up cold last night, so you had slept close to him to keep him warm. You didn&#039;t know how he managed to survive without fur.
&gt;It was also nice to get your scent on him. It kept other Anthros from trying to take him for themselves.
&gt;Anon was YOURS, and you intended to keep it that way.
&gt;Thinking about the last couple hours, you smile
&gt;Swimming with Anon had been fun. You had even managed to get him naked!
&gt;His skin had felt soooo~ nice when you had pressed him against you...
&gt;You had gotten a decent view of his crotch when you had flipped him.
&gt;You had always loved the way humans looked under their shorts.
&gt;Anon had almost caught you looking at a /BRED/ thread last night, but you had been able to close it before he saw.
&gt;Not that you would mind too much if he knew that you were into the kind of stuff...
&gt;Who knew, maybe he browsed the same threads as you?
&gt;You knew that it was probably wishful thinking though...
&gt;Anon had never dated an Anthro, as you had never let any get near him. He had dated Human women though.
&gt;Too bad you had been too afraid of your parents retribution to ever try anything with him when you were kids...
&gt;You had always liked Anon. He had always had your back, and he was one of the only people who supported your decision to join the Police Force.
&gt;Your parents had wanted you do a less dangerous job, like Anon had.
&gt;Admittedly, maybe you had watched a little too many cop shows as a pup. Being a cop was a lot tougher than it seemed.
&gt;That didn&#039;t matter right now, though. You were here for yourself and Anon.

&gt;You open the fridge, pulling out some salami and cheese. Anon said he was going to make himself a sandwich, and you knew what he liked. So why not make it for him yourself?
&gt;You pulled bread and a paper plate out of the cupboard, and got to work making a couple sandwiches for him.
&gt;You set the plate aside, and wait for Anon to come back out of the bedroom.
&gt;What was taking him so long?
&gt;You walk over to the bedroom, and stick your ear against the door.
&gt;You don&#039;t hear anything... Is Anon Alright?
&gt;You gently knock on the door a bit.
&gt;&quot;Anon? Are you alright in there? I got your lunch ready...&quot;
&gt;There&#039;s no answer, and so you open the door a bit.
&gt;Oh, he&#039;s fine. He&#039;s just sleeping. You can hear him quietly snoring.
&gt;Leave it to Anon to conk out while getting dressed.
&gt;You&#039;re about to wake him up, but you notice he&#039;s only wearing his boxers.
&gt;And you see an even more wonderful sight. He has a boner.
&gt;Looks like seeing you naked had the desired effect on him... Maybe he&#039;s even dreaming about you...
&gt;Your mouth salivates while you stare at the outline of his dick through the thin fabric...
&gt;Your triangular folds begin to moisten, and you let out a quiet whine.
&gt;It was taking all your self restraint not to just try and take him while he laid there.
&gt;Shit, you couldn&#039;t do that! You didn&#039;t think Anon would react to well to waking up with his best friend bouncing on his cock.
&gt;But still... Just a peek couldn&#039;t hurt...
&gt;You&#039;re reaching for the hem of his boxers, when all of a sudden he yawns.
&gt;Oh shit, he&#039;s waking up!
&gt;You quickly move to leave the room. This was something you had to take your time with.
&gt;You gently shut the door behind you, holding the doorknob open so it doesn&#039;t click.
&gt;You slowly let go of the doorknob, and go to sit in the kitchen.
&gt;You were determined to get in his pants, but in a way that didn&#039;t involve flat out raping him.
&gt;You better find a way to do it FAST though... Your heat was starting to hit.
&gt;You could already feel your hormones going into overdrive.
&gt;Every whiff of Anon&#039;s natural scent was beginning to excite you.
&gt;You rub your thighs together, and wait for Anon to come get his sandwich.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt;Be Anon
&gt;Your eyes open, and you sit up.
&gt;Had you dozed off there for a minute?
&gt;Well, time to get up.
&gt;You could take a full nap later.
&gt;You stand up off of the bed, and grab some more clothes from your suitcase.
&gt;You quickly get dressed, and walk out into the kitchen.
&gt;Zoey is sitting at the kitchen table, her muzzle laying on the table with her eye shut.
&gt;You walk over, and put your hand on her shoulder.
&gt;She yips, and sits up quickly, looking at you with wide eyes.
&gt;&quot;S-shit, Anon! Don&#039;t sneak up on me like that...&quot;
&gt;You cock an eye at her. You couldn&#039;t sneak up on her when you tried hard, so how did you spook her when she knew you were coming?
&gt;&quot;I was uh... Deep in thought.&quot;
&gt;You ask her about what she was thinking about, and she responds:
&gt;&quot;Just, um, stupid stuff. Don&#039;t worry about it, Anon.&quot;
&gt;She gives you a small smile.
&gt;&quot;I made you a couple sandwiches. Your favorite.&quot;
&gt;Hell yeah. Salami and cheese. You couldn&#039;t beat the classics.
&gt;You jokingly pet her on the head, and to your surprise she leans into your hand, and you hear her let out a satisfied huff.
&gt;Normally she hated it when you did that!
&gt;Her eyes pop open as she realizes what she just did.
&gt;&quot;Ah! Don&#039;t do that, Anon!&quot;
&gt;You put up your hands in mock surrender, and say you won&#039;t do it again.
&gt;She leans onto the counter, her head resting on one of her hands.
&gt;&quot;Just... Enjoy the sandwich, Anon.&quot;
&gt;Something seems off about Zoey to you. She seems... Conflicted.
&gt;You ask her if she&#039;s feeling alright, and she nods quickly.
&gt;&quot;Yeah, yeah. I told you not to worry about it.&quot;
&gt;You threaten to pet her head again if she doesn&#039;t tell you what&#039;s going on, and she stands up.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m going to... Check my phone. Eat the food I made you.&quot;
&gt;You hated it when she dodged your questions, but you let her go. You didn&#039;t want to ruin the week on the second day you were here.
&gt;She quickly shuffles into the bedroom, the door shutting behind her.
&gt;Well, at least you&#039;ll get to enjoy these sandwiches.

&gt;You savor the two sandwiches, and when you&#039;re done you throw the paper plate in the trash.
&gt;Zoey was seeming really off after you saw her in the kitchen.
&gt;Maybe she really was going into heat? You didn&#039;t know much about Canines, let alone Anthros in general, but you knew that when they Went into heat it messed with their heads.
&gt;Should you try to cheer her up, or would that just make things worse?
&gt;Perhaps you should just leave things alone for now.
&gt;Zoey had gone into the bedroom, and hadn&#039;t come out.
&gt;You knew how to cheer her up though. You would ask her if she wanted to go canoeing. Everybody likes canoeing, right?
&gt;You walk over to the bedroom door, and knock gently on it.
&gt;&quot;Wh-What, Anon? I&#039;m a little, uh, busy.&quot;
&gt;You ask her if she wants to go canoeing with you, and she replies:
&gt;&quot;Ah... Not right now... You can go ahead, though... Maybe tomorrow, Anon.&quot;
&gt;Well, It&#039;s not the response you wanted, but at least you know she&#039;s not upset with you.
&gt;You let Zoey know you&#039;re coming in to grab your phone, and she replies quickly:
&gt;&quot;Ah! Just one moment!&quot;
&gt;You hear the ruffling of blankets, and then It&#039;s quiet.
&gt;&quot;O-Okay. Come on in...&quot;
&gt;You open the door, entering the bedroom.
&gt;Zoey is laying on the bed, covered by a layer of blankets. She smiles sheepishly at you.
&gt;Something in here smells... Strange. You&#039;re not sure what it is, but it&#039;s pretty strong.
&gt;You decide not to mention it.
&gt;You ask Zoey one more time if she wants to go canoeing.
&gt;&quot;Tomorrow, Anon. I&#039;m, uh... Tired. Yeah.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You go on. I&#039;ve got... Stuff to do.&quot;
&gt;You sigh, and grab your phone.
&gt;You tell her you&#039;ll see her in a bit.
&gt;&quot;Have some fun, Anon. Take your time. I&#039;ll be here~.&quot;

&gt;You leave the cabin with your phone, heading to the shed next to the dock.
&gt;You open the wooden door, the old hinges hissing loudly at you.
&gt;Turning on your phone&#039;s flashlight, you locate one of the Canoes hanging on the wall.
&gt;This would be a lot easier if Zoey would help you.
&gt;Should you ask her?
&gt;She had seemed pretty eager to get you out of the house, and you knew what she did last time she had told you that.
&gt;You didn&#039;t think you were going to look through the bedroom window this time, though.
&gt;The canoe isn&#039;t secured by anything. It&#039;s just sitting on a wooden rack.
&gt;You grab it and lean back, pulling it off of the wall.
&gt;It thuds on the ground, and you drag it out of the shed.
&gt;You walk back in and look for some paddles.
&gt;There&#039;s a couple paddles leaning on the wall near the canoe rack, and you grab them.
&gt;You exit the shed, and toss the paddles into the canoe.
&gt;There&#039;s no launching point for canoe on the dock, so you just push it to the waters edge near the dock.
&gt;Once the canoe is far enough into the water that it floats, you hop in.
&gt;You nudge one of the wooden dock supports with the paddle, and you drift towards the middle of the lake.
&gt;It&#039;s nice out. It&#039;s only about 2&#039;o clock, and it&#039;s still pretty warm out. There&#039;s a light breeze over the water, bringing the smells of the autumn forest to you.
&gt;You lean back into the dusty canoe, relaxing.
&gt;If you had known it was this nice out here, you would have gotten Zoey to take you up here a long time ago.
&gt;She had talked this place up before, but that was way different than experiencing it for yourself.
&gt;You cross your hands behind your head, gazing at the azure sky dotted with clouds.
&gt;You happily sigh, smiling. This was nice. Way better than working in that shitty office.

&gt;After an hour so or relaxing, you sit up.
&gt;You had been using the paddles to row yourself back to the middle of the lake whenever you drifted near the edges, but you decided to paddle along the edge of the lake.
&gt;You pick up the paddles, and begin to row yourself to the shaded edges of the lake near where the forest met the water.
&gt;Many of the trees were leaning over the water, creating shapes and patterns from the light that shone through the leaves.
&gt;You watched the light dance across the surface of the water, and you even managed to spot several small fish near the more shallow water near the edge.
&gt;This is where you should try fishing tomorrow with Zoey.
&gt;If she wanted to, anyways. You hoped she would be in a better mood tomorrow.
&gt;You paddle around the waters edge for another hour, staring into the woods.
&gt;The forest was darker the farther away it got from the water&#039;s edge.
&gt;It was a pretty dense forest.
&gt;You should take a hike in it with Zoey before you had to leave. You think she would like that.
&gt;She had always been pretty outdoorsy.
&gt;After another half hour or so, you begin to think you&#039;ve had your fill of the lake for the day.
&gt;It just wasn&#039;t as fun with just you in the canoe.
&gt;You start to paddle to the edge of the lake, and you hop out onto the shore.
&gt;You drag the canoe back onto the shore, and you leave it there.
&gt;No need to go through the hassle of putting it back if you&#039;re just going to use it again tomorrow. Hopefully.
&gt;You start to walk but to the cabin, but stop.
&gt;You just had what you think is a pretty good idea.
&gt;You head around the side of the house where the firewood is kept, making sure not to walk past the bedroom window. You were taking the long way this time.
&gt;You unhook the tarp, and pull it to the side.
&gt;Feeling the wood, you can see it&#039;s dry. It should be perfect for a nice warm fire.
&gt;You heft as much wood as you can carry under your arms, and head back to the front of the cabin.
&gt;It&#039;s a bit of a struggle opening the front door while holding the large amount of firewood, but you manage.

&gt;You set the two bundles of wood down next to the fire.
&gt;You peer up into the chimney. It looks clear, and you smile. You could build a fire, alright.
&gt;Your hear the bedroom door open, and Zoey peers out at you with a confused look on her face, her muzzle tilted at you.
&gt;&quot;Anon? What are you doing?&quot;
&gt;You tell her you plan on starting a fire, and she opens the door fully, standing above you as you crouch down by the fireplace.
&gt;There&#039;s that smell again... It&#039;s a strange musky smell. At first you thought it was just the cabin, but you didn&#039;t smell it when you first got here.
&gt;You&#039;ll just have to spray some air freshener in the bedroom before you go to sleep.
&gt;Zoey squats down next to you, her muzzle hanging over your shoulder, watching you stick the firewood into the base of the fireplace.
&gt;You as her if there&#039;s anything you can use as kindling, and if she can bring you a match.
&gt;She stands up, and opens a cabinet near one of the couches.
&gt;&quot;Yeah, we kept some fire-starters in here if I remember correctly.&quot;
&gt;She pulls out a handful of rolled up paper.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s just wax coated bits of paper, but they light up pretty good.&quot;
&gt;You nod, and she hands them to you. You set them under the wood.
&gt;Zoey walks over to the kitchen, and pulls a small pack of matches out of a drawer. She tosses them to you.
&gt;You try to catch them, but you&#039;re not quick enough, and they land behind you.
&gt;&quot;Come on, Anon. You were wide open.&quot;
&gt;You tell her you weren&#039;t much of a sports kind of guy.
&gt;She gives you a smug smile.
&gt;&quot;Yeah, I can tell.&quot;
&gt;You jokingly shake your head in disapproval at her, and grab the matches.
&gt;You pull out a match and strike it against the box, before lighting one of the fire-starters in your hand.
&gt;It quickly ignites, and you press the flaming wad of paper and wax against the other fire-starters in the fireplace.
&gt;They all catch, and before long you have a nice fire going.
&gt;Zoey puts her hand on your shoulder, and leads you to the couch with her.
&gt;The two of you plop down on the sofa, and watch the fire.

&gt;Zoey and you were chatting, and having a pretty nice time.
&gt;Zoey seemed to be back to her normal self, which made you happy.
&gt;Right now she was talking to you about the recent drug bust she had made.
&gt;&quot;So we&#039;ve got the guy in the car, right? He&#039;s saying something in Spanish, saying that he&#039;s never even touched drugs before.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m smelling the car and I almost let it go, but when I smell alongside the bottom of the car I catch a whiff of something.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I call my supervisor over and he pokes a hole in the body of the car near the bottom of one of the doors.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Boom! White powder everywhere. Dude was hiding like 10 pounds of Coke in each door.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Needless to say, the desk jockeys back at the station were pretty pleased with me.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I got myself the week off, and some nice bonus pay which I used to finance this little getaway of ours.&quot;
&gt;You congratulate her once more, and she smiles at you, her tail wagging.
&gt;To your surprise, she pulls you into a hug, her muzzle resting on your shoulder.
&gt;&quot;Thanks, Anon...&quot;
&gt;You hear her sniff you gently, then she pulls away.
&gt;She smiles at you with closed eyes, and says:
&gt;&quot;I like the way you smell. It&#039;s nice.&quot;
&gt;She realizes what she just said and her eyes pop open.
&gt;&quot;Wait, I mean I like the way your soap smells!&quot;
&gt;She smiles nervously.
&gt;&quot;Yeah... The soap. It&#039;s very... Fresh?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I just... Like it.&quot;
&gt;You smile, and stand up.
&gt;You ask her if she&#039;s hungry, and she stands up next to you, her tail wagging.
&gt;&quot;Yeah. I skipped lunch today.&quot;
&gt;You frown, and tell her she shouldn&#039;t do that. It&#039;s not like the two of you were low on food or anything.
&gt;She smiles, saying:
&gt;&quot;Nice to see you&#039;re concerned about my well-being.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Come on, Anon. It&#039;s not like I&#039;m going to lose all my muscles if I miss one meal.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Now let me fix the two of us some dinner. You just sit here and enjoy the fire. Let me take care of everything~&quot;
&gt;She sits you back down on the couch.
&gt;&quot;Now this is going to take a while, so you might as well find something to occupy yourself with.&quot;
&gt;You tell her that you can just talk to her, but she shakes her head.
&gt;&quot;No. I want to make sure I get this recipe right. I wanna concentrate on it.&quot;
&gt;You shrug, and tell her that&#039;s fine.
&gt;You stand up and walk towards the bedroom, telling Zoey that you&#039;re going to take a shower while you&#039;re waiting for dinner.
&gt;&quot;Okay, Anon.&quot;
&gt;You grab some clothes, and then head into the bathroom, locking the door behind you.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt;Be Zoey.
&gt;It was getting a bit hard to restrain yourself.
&gt;Your heat was almost in full swing now, and you had openly admitted to him that you enjoyed the way he smells.
&gt;You had gotten yourself off a couple times while Anon was out in the canoe.
&gt;But it did almost nothing for you.
&gt;You knew that there was only one thing that could extinguish the itching fires of your heat, and He was standing 30 feet away from you, naked in the shower.
&gt;You whined a bit, shifting around a bit.
&gt;You had been wet all day, and Anon could definitely smell it. You had seen the way his nose had twitched when he entered the bedroom and when you had stood next to him by the fire.
&gt;You had to focus for now, though. You were going to try and wait one more day. If Anon didn&#039;t make a move by tomorrow, then you were going to be a bit more direct. You couldn&#039;t wait much longer.
&gt;For now though, you had a plan.
&gt;You were going to try and cuddle Anon all night. You knew he was a sucker for soft things, and you had a new conditioner you had brought with you. It was a bit expensive, but it was worth it for Anon.
&gt;You were going to use it before you went to sleep, and then you would show no mercy while you cuddled him furiously.
&gt;Yeah, that was going to be nice...
&gt;You would also have the added benefit of covering him in your scent.
&gt;That was how most Anthros marked their partners, and Canines were no exceptions. It would let others know who he belonged to.
&gt;And he belonged to YOU.

&gt;Standing in the kitchen, you&#039;ve gotten all the ingredients for dinner out.
&gt;You were going to make another one of Anon&#039;s favorites. Spaghetti with vodka sauce.
&gt;Anon was pretty easy to please, and you were grateful for that.
&gt;You put a pot of water on the small stove-top to boil, and wait.
&gt;After a short wait, the water is boiling, so you add the spaghetti.
&gt;It shouldn&#039;t take too long to cook.
&gt;Right as you&#039;re about to drain the pasta, Anon exits the bathroom.
&gt;He&#039;s walking towards the kitchen, but you tell him to stay put in the living room.
&gt;You tell him he could come in the kitchen when it was ready. You tell him you didn&#039;t want him to crowd you.
&gt;But the truth is that you just didn&#039;t want Anon standing near you.
&gt;His scent was setting off all sorts of different signals in your brain, and you didn&#039;t want to find out what you would do if you got another nice whiff of him.
&gt;At least, not until later. You were going to cuddle the shit out of him.
&gt;M-maybe even... Lick him a bit... Or try to hold his hand... Oh God, what if he tries to hold yours first?! You would do anything he said...
&gt;You snap out of the daydream, shaking your head.
&gt;You just had to hold it together for just a BIT longer.
&gt;Anon asks you what you&#039;re cooking, and you tell him:
&gt;&quot;Just some, uh, Spaghetti.&quot;
&gt;You can see him smile at you, and you feel your body react to his gentle gaze, your stomach tightening.
&gt;He thanks you, and you respond.
&gt;&quot;You can come over... I, uh... It&#039;s almost ready.&quot;
&gt;He comes over and sits at the small table while you strain out the spaghetti.
&gt;You pour the spaghetti back in the pot, and add in the canned sauce.
&gt;Your stir it, before plating it, setting it in front of Anon.
&gt;He thanks you, and begins eating.
&gt;You get yourself a plate, and join him.
&gt;Hopefully he doesn&#039;t smell you over the pasta... You used a lot of sauce so you should be fine.
&gt;You finish quicker than he does.
&gt;You go to sit on the couch and Anon takes a second plate.
&gt;He thanks you once more, saying it was good.
&gt;&quot;Oh, It was nothing... All I did was cook some pasta and open a jar...&quot;
&gt;He tells you that he appreciates you cooking for him, and your heart melts a bit.
&gt;Shit, you&#039;ve got to get out of here before he makes you pounce him.
&gt;You stammer out:
&gt;&quot;I uh, I&#039;m going to go... Make the bed and... Maybe... I don&#039;t know. I&#039;ll be back.&quot;
&gt;Nice one, Zoey. Real smooth.
&gt;You get up, quickly heading into the bedroom.
&gt;You shut the door behind you, and lean against the door.

&gt;Shit, you had to get yourself under control.
&gt;You grab your phone off the table, and open up the /BRED/ thread you lurked on.
&gt;You had been on 4chan for about 6 years now, but you had only recently discovered the magic that was /BRED/.
&gt;Maybe some shitposters will help you get yourself under control.
&gt;You post in the thread:
&gt;&quot;guys help im with my human friend and im in heat. i dont want to make things weird. what do i do?&quot;
&gt;You wait, but all you get are replies saying &quot;&gt;RAPE&quot;, and &quot;/bred/ imminent&quot;.
&gt;One poster even sends you a Webm of a Human fucking an Anthro Great Dane in heat, she was yipping loudly, her long legs wrapping around his back while he shoved his thick cock into her-
&gt;NO! You had to get control of yourself...
&gt;You look around the room. What could you do that would calm you down?
&gt;Oh! You said to Anon you would make the bed for him.
&gt;That should calm you down enough so you don&#039;t feel like jumping Anon&#039;s bones. Well, at least not as bad as you do right now.

&gt;You pull the blankets and pillows off of the bed, before spreading them back flat on the bed.
&gt;When you pick up Anon&#039;s pillow however, you can&#039;t help but give it a little sniff.
&gt;Aahhh... That&#039;s the good shit right there...
&gt;You make sure to fluff it up a bit, before lovingly setting it back on the bed.
&gt;No way you were ever going to wash that pillow again.
&gt;With the bed made, you crouch down and open your suitcase.
&gt;You pull out the small bottle of conditioner you had bought especially for this trip.
&gt;The label said it was supposed to make fur really soft and fluffy. It was formulated with Canines in mind.
&gt;It cost you like 70 dollars for 13 ounces, which was really only good for two or three showers, but whatever. It was all worth it for Anon.
&gt;It didn&#039;t really have much of a smell to it. It was intended to be used after you had already cleaned your fur.
&gt;Just use it like normal fur cleaner and it was good to go.
&gt;You set the small plastic bottle on your nightstand. You want it ready for later.
&gt;You look at your phone to check the time.
&gt;It was starting to get late. The clock had just hit 7&#039;o clock.
&gt;Well, you should go back out and talk to Anon... You didn&#039;t want him to think anything was off.
&gt;You exit the bedroom, leaving the door open.
&gt;Looking into the kitchen, it looks like Anon had cleaned up after the meal you had made.
&gt;Anon was sitting by the fire, adding another log.
&gt;You squat next to him, smiling.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt;Be Anon
&gt;You were tossing some logs into the fire before it died.
&gt;While you were doing this, Zoey squat down next to you.
&gt;You look over at her, and she smiles.
&gt;&quot;Thanks for starting this fire for us, Anon...&quot;
&gt;She leans close to you, looking at the growing flames.
&gt;You tell her that you were probably gonna watch a movie on Netflix to end the day.
&gt;Zoey turns to face you, and asks you with a hopeful tone:
&gt;&quot;Can I watch it with you?&quot;
&gt;You tell her that of course she can, and she smiles.
&gt;It might be a bit awkward with the two of you watching it on a phone, but you would make it work.
&gt;The two of you sit on one of the sofas.
&gt;Zoey is sitting close to you, your sides touching.
&gt;She probably wanted to be close so she could see the movie better.
&gt;You pick out some old shitty movie and the two of you settle in to watch it.
&gt;You wish you would have remembered to bring popcorn. Damn, and you had even gone to the store yesterday. You were never very good at planning things.
&gt;It doesn&#039;t matter now, though.
&gt;The two of you settle in, and relax while you watch the movie.

&gt;Its two and a half hours later, and the movie&#039;s over.
&gt;The fire went out a half-hour ago, leaving just some smoldering coals behind.
&gt;You didn&#039;t care what anyone said. National Treasure was a damn good movie.
&gt;Based on the way Zoey&#039;s tail was wagging, she must have enjoyed it too.
&gt;She had relaxed next to you during the movie. Her arm was draped over your shoulder, and she was leaning in close to you.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not a huge fan of Nicholas Cage, but I liked watching it with you, Anon~.&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s late... You gonna head to bed, now?&quot;
&gt;You yawn, and she takes that as her answer.
&gt;She moves her arm from over your shoulder, and grips your arm a bit.
&gt;&quot;Come on. I&#039;m gonna take a shower. You settle into bed.&quot;
&gt;She leads you from the couch to the bedroom, and you sit down on your side of the bed.
&gt;Zoey grabs some clothes and a bottle off of her nightstand, then heads to the Bathroom.
&gt;You hear the hiss of water in the shower, and you undress, getting some sleepwear on.
&gt;Laying back on the bed, you yawn again.
&gt;You slip under the covers, after shutting off the light.
&gt;You make sure to plug your phone in to charge, and you check out your favorite Taiwanese fruit-picking forum.
&gt;Nothing interesting seems to have happened recently, except for a couple shitposters arguing.
&gt;You post a bit in some of your regular threads, and wait for Zoey to come back so the two of you can get to sleep.

&gt;Just as you&#039;re about to doze off, the bedroom door opens.
&gt;You can&#039;t see anything in the darkness, but you know it&#039;s Zoey.
&gt;&quot;Anon. You still awake?&quot;
&gt;You respond, telling her that you&#039;re just barely awake.
&gt;&quot;Well, that&#039;s okay. I have a surprise for you~.&quot;
&gt;You sit up a bit, and ask her what it is.
&gt;In response, she climbs into bed, slipping under the covers next to you.
&gt;You lay back into bed, and roll on your side, facing away from her.
&gt;Her arms reach out and wrap around your shoulders, pulling you closer to her.
&gt;You protest a bit, but she pulls you into her arms.
&gt;Shes presses you against her, holding you in her arms.
&gt;Holy shit, since when was Zoey so... Soft?
&gt;Zoey grins, asking you:
&gt;&quot;Liking my fur? I got some new fur cleaner I wanted to try out... Makes my fur all fluffy and soft~&quot;
&gt;&quot;I hope you like it, Anon... Because it&#039;s a bit cold tonight. Gotta keep warm, you know?&quot;
&gt;You tell her it was already warm under the covers, but she just hushes you.
&gt;&quot;Shh. Anon. You don&#039;t have fur. You can&#039;t possibly be warm. Here, let me hold you...&quot;
&gt;Her hands start to rub your chest a bit, sapping your energy.
&gt;It was so warm and soft... You had to fight to keep your eyelids up.
&gt;&quot;Go to sleep, Anon... I&#039;ll keep you nice and cozy...&quot;
&gt;This felt kind of weird, sleeping in your friends embrace, but it also felt so... Right.
&gt;You were extremely comfortable, and so you agreed.
&gt;&quot;Here... Let me get this...&quot;
&gt;Her hands grip the thin fabric of your shirt, and she begins to tug it off.
&gt;She tosses the shirt off of the bed, and pulls you in close again, your back and chest enveloped in her silky fur.
&gt;To your surprise, you can feel that she isn&#039;t wearing a shirt either. Just a plain bra.
&gt;You&#039;re not complaining though. Her fur was just too soft NOT to touch.
&gt;&quot;Goodnight, Anon...&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t respond, as sleep takes you a couple moments later.

&gt;You wake up early, the first rays of sunshine coming through the window.
&gt;You&#039;re a bit confused for a second, as you can&#039;t move your arms or legs.
&gt;Quickly though, you realize that Zoey still has her arms wrapped around you.
&gt;Sometime during the night she hooked one of her legs over yours.
&gt;You try to get out of bed, struggling to get her limbs off of you.
&gt;The motion must wake up Zoey, because you feel her grip on you tighten, and she whines, before saying quietly:
&gt;&quot;Noooo.... Stayyy.....&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re about to tell her you have to get up, but you can&#039;t think of a good reason to.
&gt;Breakfast can wait, right?
&gt;Right.
&gt;You settle back into her arms, and she happily chuffs into your hair.
&gt;The two of you lay there for a while, until the sun starts shining through the window onto the bed.
&gt;Too bad there weren&#039;t any curtains.
&gt;Zoey lets out a quiet growl as the sunlight invades her eyes.
&gt;&quot;Time to get up, Anon...&quot;
&gt;She lets go of you, and you sit up in bed, rubbing your eyes.
&gt;Overall, it was a pretty restful sleep.
&gt;You dig around in your suitcase for another shirt, and slip on some jeans.
&gt;Looking back at Zoey, she&#039;s flipped over in bed so she isn&#039;t facing the window, and the covers are over her head. All you can see of her is the tip of her muzzle poking out under the blanket.
&gt;You ask her if she&#039;s getting up, but she just whines and turns over in bed, the covers falling off of her furred head.
&gt;She looks up at you with tired eyes, saying:
&gt;&quot;Yeah, I just need a couple minutes...&quot;
&gt;You tell her you&#039;ll be in the kitchen, and her ears flick at you in response.

&gt;You step out into the living room, yawning as you stretch out. Sleeping in Zoey&#039;s embrace had been comfortable, if a bit... constricting. She had certainly held you tightly as you had slept.
&gt;You crack your knuckles as you walk into the small kitchen area.
&gt;Looking in the fridge, you pull out the tiny bit of leftover spaghetti from last night. Might as well finish it up.
&gt;You also grab an ice-cold can of your favorite soda. Orange Sunkist™.
&gt;Zoey had also brought some Dr Pepper, but you had always thought that it tasted terrible.
&gt;She may be your friend, but she had absolute shit taste in soft drinks.
&gt;You pop the spaghetti in the microwave, and put it on for a couple minutes.
&gt;You wait for it to heat up, leaning on the wall.
&gt;The microwave dings, and you take the piping hot leftovers out.
&gt;Not bothering to sit down at the table, you just eat the spaghetti standing up next to the sink.
&gt;After five minutes, you finish the meager breakfast, putting the dish in the sink.
&gt;Fuck it, you&#039;ll wash it later.
&gt;You&#039;re about to go sit down on the couch, but you see Zoey poke her head out of the bedroom, and she looks at you.
&gt;She quickly brings her head back into the bedroom, and the door gently shuts.
&gt;You&#039;re not sure what that was about, but whatever.
&gt;You take a seat on the couch, but you realize you left your phone in the bedroom.
&gt;You get up, but stop before you open the bedroom door.
&gt;You hear a strange sound. Like cloth rubbing against other cloth.
&gt;Thinking that Zoey might be getting dressed, you knock on the door.
&gt;You get a muffled response:
&gt;&quot;W-what, Anon?&quot;
&gt;You ask her if you can come in, and theres a small moment of silence before she answers.
&gt;&quot;Ye-NO!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m, uh, busy right now.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Come back in... Uh... Ten minutes. Y-yeah.&quot;
&gt;Since you aren&#039;t completely retarded, you quickly realize that she&#039;s probably doing the same thing she was doing when you looked at her through the window the night you first got here.
&gt;Shit, if you still had doubts about her maybe being in heat, they&#039;ve long since vanished.
&gt;That smell, too... You can smell it drifting under the door.
&gt;Looks like the rest of the week was about to take a strange turn.
&gt;You sigh, and go to sit over on the couch.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt;Be Zoey
&gt;Anon had just stepped away from the door, and you felt like hitting yourself.
&gt;You had come SO CLOSE to letting him walk in on you.
&gt;But you had chickened out at the last moment.
&gt;You throw your head back onto your pillow in frustration.
&gt;You couldn&#039;t take it anymore.
&gt;You were about to reach the breaking point.
&gt;Even after you had stripped down to your undergarments and cuddled with Anon all night, he STILL hadn&#039;t made a move on you.
&gt;You knew he wasn&#039;t some beta faggot, as you know that he&#039;s dated girls in the past.
&gt;Girls you had failed to keep away from him. Too bad Human women weren&#039;t very receptive to scents.
&gt;You angrily huff, as you dig your fingers deep inside your burning hot, itching gash.
&gt;Your heat was in full swing now, and you couldn&#039;t do jack shit to relieve it.
&gt;You hadn&#039;t brought your human dildo as you were terrified of what Anon would think if he found it.
&gt;You were kind of regretting that now, as it had been a good tool for helping you out with your heat in the past.
&gt;You&#039;ve tried dating other Canines in the past, but you&#039;ve never actually ever been with any of them sexually.
&gt;For some reason, they&#039;ve just never had any appeal to you when compared them to Anon.
&gt;You had fallen for the /BRED/ meme, and you had fallen for it HARD.
&gt;For now though, you were getting nowhere with getting yourself off. It did absolutely nothing for you heat-wise.
&gt;You growled a bit, bringing your hand up to your mouth and licking your slick fingers clean.
&gt;Damn it, you just had to hold out for the rest of today... If Anon doesn&#039;t make a move on you by tonight, then you were going to throw yourself at him until he WANTED to fuck you.
&gt;Standing up on wobbly legs, you pull your soaked panties back up and grab some fresh clothes and a towel.
&gt;You open the bedroom door and walk into the bathroom.
&gt;As you close the bathroom door, you can see Anon walking towards the bedroom.
&gt;Shit, there was no way he wasn&#039;t going to smell your arousal in there...
&gt;Although that isn&#039;t really too much of a bad thing. Is it? You aren&#039;t sure.
&gt;Forgetting the internal debate for now, you climb into the large bathtub.
&gt;You weren&#039;t sure why your parents had gotten such a large tub for the cabin. Hell, it was bigger than the one you had at home when you were growing up.
&gt;You turn on the water. You keep it cold.
&gt;Hopefully it would take your mind off of your heat for a bit.
&gt;You knew it wouldn&#039;t, though. You&#039;ve tried this before and all it does it get you wet. Well, wetter than you already were.
&gt;You gasp as you feel the cold water assault your body, but you grit your teeth and begin to clean yourself, not using the expensive fur conditioner this time.
&gt;That was for special occasions only.
&gt;You squeeze out some Fur cleaning gel into your hand and begin to work it through your thick fur.
&gt;You close your eyes, and begin to clean yourself. You had to smell nice for Anon.
&gt;For Anon.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt;Be Anon.
&gt;After you had seen Zoey enter the bathroom, you had gone back into the bedroom.
&gt;When you had stepped in the room though, the smell of her heat had almost knocked you on her ass.
&gt;It wasn&#039;t really a bad smell, just a surprisingly familiar one.
&gt;Come to think of it, as a child, whenever you had gone over to her house (when her parents weren&#039;t home), hadn&#039;t her room smelt like this?
&gt;Not as strongly of course, but still recognizable.
&gt;You sigh, grabbing your phone.
&gt;Checking it, you frown.
&gt;Damn it, you had forgotten to plug it in to charge last night.
&gt;It was dead, so you set it back down on the nightstand, and connect it to the charger.
&gt;You sit back on the bed, bored.
&gt;You were kind of bored. Zoey had just gotten in the shower, there was no radio, and your phone was dead.
&gt;Looking at Zoey&#039;s nightstand though, you see her phone sitting there.
&gt;You suddenly get a really bad idea.
&gt;Maybe you could just look at Zoey&#039;s phone?
&gt;You knew she didn&#039;t use a password lock, as she was always pretty terrible with remembering passwords.
&gt;But damn. You couldn&#039;t just look through your friends phone like that... Could you?
&gt;Well, she was going to be busy in the shower for at least another 10 minutes...
&gt;You move over to her side of the bed, sitting down.
&gt;It was still warm from where she had been laying. And a bit moist...
&gt;You sigh, and pick up her phone. You might as well. You would put it back just as you had found it.
&gt;It&#039;s not like she would be able to find out you had looked at it, right?
&gt;You turn on her phone, and are greeted by her lock-screen.
&gt;It&#039;s a picture of the last time the two of you went out to eat at a local fast-food place.
&gt;Cute.
&gt;Like you expected, there was no password. Just a &quot;Slide to Unlock&quot; message.
&gt;You open up the phone, and your eyes nearly pop out of your socket at what you see.

&gt;It&#039;s a video of an Anthro Great Dane getting fucked hard by a Human.
&gt;Even more surprisingly, it&#039;s on 4chan. On a /BRED/ thread.
&gt;Holy shit, she browses these threads?!
&gt;You had heard of /BRED/ before. It was pretty infamous on the internet.
&gt;Human-Anthro relationships weren&#039;t really looked on too fondly everywhere in the world.
&gt;You had never asked Zoey how she felt about it, because you didn&#039;t want to come off as being awkward.
&gt;Well, you guess this answers it though.
&gt;You scroll through the thread, and you begin to sweat a bit.
&gt;You can see she had posted last night about saying she was in heat.
&gt;It had a lot of replies, mostly saying that you were either about to have a really fun time, or be brutally raped. Or a combination of the two.
&gt;The thread is full of images and Webms of Humans pounding away at Anthros of various species.
&gt;You had to admit that you had looked at Human on Anthro porn before. You had been curious.
&gt;But this stuff was on a whole new level.
&gt;As you&#039;re browsing through the thread with wide eyes, you suddenly hear the water in the shower shut off.
&gt;Oh shit, she&#039;s done already.
&gt;You move the thread back up to where it was when you unlocked her phone, and set it back down on the nightstand.
&gt;You sit back over on your side of the bed, and pick up your phone.
&gt;It&#039;s charged enough to be turned on, and as you turn it back on, the door opens and you hear a small surprised yip from behind you.
&gt;&quot;A-Anon? I didn&#039;t think you&#039;d be in here...&quot;
&gt;Turning around to look at Zoey, you can see she&#039;s dressed in some basic jeans and a white t-shirt.
&gt;You can definitely tell she isn&#039;t wearing a bra. Her nipples are poking right through the thin fabric.
&gt;You quickly tear your eyes away from them before she can notice.
&gt;To your slight terror and surprise, you can feel yourself begin to harden.
&gt;You had never really thought of Zoey in that way... Well, besides the first night you were here. But that was different.
&gt;Now you knew that she was DEFINITELY interested in Humans. Oh shit, was that why she had brought you up here?
&gt;You shift around a bit, trying to ignore the swelling problem in your crotch.
&gt;She&#039;s looking at you with a curious look, as if expecting you to say something.
&gt;You quickly speak up, stammering out that you were just in here because you needed to charge your phone.
&gt;&quot;Oh... Okay. Did you not charge it last night?&quot;
&gt;She sits down on the bed on her side, and picks up her phone.
&gt;She moves her face to peek at you over her shoulder, but quickly faces her phone when she sees you&#039;re still looking at her.
&gt;&quot;S-so, Anon... Did you want to do anything today?&quot;
&gt;You think for a moment, but you&#039;re having trouble gathering your thoughts.
&gt;You tell her that she should pick, and she turns around to look at you, holding her phone.
&gt;&quot;Umm... How about we... Uh...&quot;
&gt;Suddenly, she perks up, and her long fluffy tail starts to wag.
&gt;&quot;Oh! How about we go through the woods? I haven&#039;t done that since I was pretty young.&quot;
&gt;Her tail stops wagging for a moment, and she says with a frown:
&gt;&quot;None of my brothers would ever want to go with me, and my Dad never wanted to let me go through the forest alone...&quot;
&gt;She perks up again, and she smiles, her fluffy tail wagging once more.
&gt;&quot;But now you&#039;re here! And we can go together!&quot;
&gt;You ask her if there&#039;s a path, and she shakes her head.
&gt;&quot;No, but I know this property pretty well. Don&#039;t worry, we won&#039;t get lost.&quot;
&gt;&quot;My Dad never wanted me to go in the woods on my own, but that doesn&#039;t mean I ever listened to him.&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re genuinely curious at this point, and you ask her if there&#039;s anything worth seeing out in the forest.
&gt;&quot;Yeah. There&#039;s a lot of creeks and criks... A small cave... Lots of rock outcroppings... There&#039;s even an old mine-shaft, but I was always too afraid to go near it.&quot;
&gt;You stand up, telling her that she&#039;s won you over, and that of course you&#039;re willing to go.
&gt;She pockets her phone before standing up too, a wide grin on her face, her tail wagging really quickly.
&gt;&quot;Thanks, Anon!&quot;
&gt;She walks over to you, and pulls you into a quick, but tight, hug.
&gt;Her muzzles presses against where your neck meets your shoulder, and you feel her huff a single warm breath onto your neck.
&gt;Huh. Déjà vu.

&gt;The two of you walk out of the bedroom, a goofy smile on Zoey&#039;s face.
&gt;You sit down in the living room without your phone. You might as well leave it to charge for now.
&gt;Zoey goes to the kitchen.
&gt;She whines a bit, saying:
&gt;&quot;Did you already eat, Anon?&quot;
&gt;You tell her you had the rest of the spaghetti from last night, and she gives you a neutral expression.
&gt;&quot;Oh. I was going to make you breakfast...&quot;
&gt;You tell her that it was alright. She had made you every meal you&#039;ve had up here so far. All you did was just microwave some spaghetti.
&gt;&quot;Yeah, well... I just want you to be relaxed. I like cooking for you...&quot;
&gt;And you were glad she did. Back at your shitty one-man apartment, you mainly subsisted on pre-made, processed, frozen food.
&gt;Zoey making you all your meals was a VERY welcome change of pace. She wasn&#039;t some Master Chef or anything, but she knew way more about cooking than you did.
&gt;If you remembered correctly, you&#039;re pretty sure you had read somewhere that cooking was a very important part of Canine cultures.
&gt;Something about forming bonds, you think. Whatever, it didn&#039;t matter right now.
&gt;&quot;We can go hiking after I eat. I&#039;ll make us some sandwiches to eat while we&#039;re out in the forest.&quot;
&gt;You go stand near the kitchen where she&#039;s making herself some eggs.
&gt;You offer to make the sandwiches while she&#039;s eating, but she just shakes her head at you.
&gt;&quot;No. I want to make them for you. Besides, you use way too much meat in them. I don&#039;t want you eating all the salami...&quot;
&gt;She frowns a bit, giving you a bit of a sympathetic look.
&gt;&quot;Also, I wanted to talk to you a bit about that... Why don&#039;t you start coming to the gym with me?&quot;
&gt;She points to your stomach.
&gt;You weren&#039;t fat or really even chubby, but you had almost no muscles to really speak of.
&gt;&quot;I know I like to tease you about it, but I want to see you healthy... You gotta cut back on the processed foods, Anon.&quot;
&gt;You sigh, and tell her you&#039;d think about it.
&gt;&quot;Aw, come on, Anon. You always say that, but then never bring it up again.&quot;
&gt;&quot;If it&#039;s because you&#039;re intimidated by being in a gym, then you could always just come over to my place and we could work out together. Just the two of us.&quot;
&gt;You try to weasel your way out of exercise by saying that you had a pretty tight schedule, and that you weren&#039;t sure if you could find the time.
&gt;She isn&#039;t having any of it, though.
&gt;&quot;Anon, that&#039;s bullshit and you know it. Neither of us work weekends, and you live like 15 minutes away from me.&quot;
&gt;It looks to you like you can&#039;t dig your way out of this hole, so you relent.
&gt;You agree to work out with her next time she wants to, and she smiles at you.
&gt;Then she gets a mortified look on her face, and turns back around to look at the eggs she&#039;s cooking.
&gt;&quot;Oh shit, I burned them!&quot;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt;Be Zoey.
&gt;To your dissapointment, the eggs were unable to be salvaged, and you had to start cooking some more.
&gt;To your elation though, Anon had finally agreed to work out with you!
&gt;You had always wanted to help him get /fit/.
&gt;You didn&#039;t want him to do it just to look good, as no matter what he looked like, you knew that he would always be yours.
&gt;You wanted him to do it for his health.
&gt;And he had agreed to do it privately, in the comfort of your own home...
&gt;Your mouth was salivating, but not from the aroma of the eggs.
&gt;Just thinking about having Anon all to yourself, having him sweaty and out of breath next to you...
&gt;Shit! He&#039;s sitting right next to you! This is NOT the time to be having these thoughts! You&#039;re pretty sure that you could still hold out for ONE day, and you intended to spend it having fun with Anon.
&gt;You felt bad, because you hadn&#039;t really done anything with him other than swim, watch a movie with him, and cook for him.
&gt;All you had really done so far was get yourself off to images of him from your phone.
&gt;You shovel the steaming eggs into your mouth, not focusing so much on the flavor as you are on Anon.
&gt;This was going to be so fun! You had always loved these woods, and now you finally had someone to share that joy with.
&gt;You liked your brothers, but they had never really been outdoorsy like you.
&gt;You had always fantasied about taking Anon into the woods with you as a teenager... Among doing other things to him...
&gt;You had kept yourself pure for him, and you were dying to let him take you.
&gt;And it better happen soon, too. You were halfway to wizard status, and you were damn ready for that to end.
&gt;You were pretty certain that Anon had been with atleast one or two women in the past, but it didn&#039;t matter.
&gt;Once he had been with you, you were going to be certain that you were going to be the only person in the world he would ever want again.
&gt;It would be just like you&#039;ve seen in the /BRED/ threads!
&gt;Sometimes you worried about whether or not he would even be interested in you &quot;that&quot; way, though...
&gt;You knew that Canines were A LOT different than human women downstairs. Well, maybe not that different.
&gt;But still. What if he took one look at your steaming hot fortune cookie and was grossed out!?
&gt;Shit, you didn&#039;t know WHAT you would do...
&gt;But you knew he would never do that to you. You had been the best of friends since you had met in kindergarten.

&gt;You weren&#039;t paying much attention to your food as you ate, and so you finish it quicker than you expected, your fork tapping the plate.
&gt;You look at Anon, who&#039;s leaning on the kitchen counter, staring at the wooden grain of the ceiling.
&gt;&quot;Anon.&quot;
&gt;He looks at you expectantly.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m going to make the sandwiches for us... You wanna go get ready?&quot;
&gt;He asks you what you should bring, and you just shrug.
&gt;&quot;Uh... There&#039;s an old backpack in the bedroom closet. Grab it and I&#039;ll put the sandwiches and some water in it.&quot;
&gt;&quot;We shouldn&#039;t really need much. The forest isn&#039;t really that strenuous to walk around in. It has some hills, but nothing too bad.&quot;
&gt;Anon nods and walks off back to the bedroom.
&gt;You smile to yourself as your tail wags giddily.
&gt;You were REALLY excited about going into the woods with Anon.
&gt;M-maybe if you were lucky, you would even get to live out one of your fantasies...
&gt;You pick up your dish, and set in the sink.
&gt;You take a page from Anon&#039;s book, and decide to wash the dishes later.
&gt;Looking into one of the cupboards, you take out a couple of canteens and fill them with the tap.
&gt;Opening the fridge, you take out the bread, cheese, and salami, beginning to make some more sandwiches.

&gt;As you make the sandwiches, Anon walks out from your shared bedroom with your old backpack, and sets in on the floor next to the kitchen counter.
&gt;While he was in the bedroom, it looks like he had put on a red sweatshirt. It made sense. It was still early, and kind of chilly out.
&gt;You tell him to put the canteens into the pack as you finish up the sandwiches, putting them in small bags.
&gt;He offers to carry the backpack, and you nod.
&gt;He had agreed to work out with you, so you might as well let him get started, even if he&#039;s only carrying sandwiches and water. It was better than nothing.
&gt;Anon has to adjust the straps a bit, but after he gets them set to a comfortable length, he puts in on his back.
&gt;You look at the clock right before you leave, and see that it&#039;s 10:30 AM.
&gt;You open the door for the two of you, and he follows you out near the edge of the woods.
&gt;Almost all of the leaves had changed their color already, with only scattered evergreens standing out with bright green needles.
&gt;Most trees still were covered in a thick layer of leaves though, making the forest look pretty dark.
&gt;You look back at Anon, smiling.
&gt;&quot;Well, let&#039;s go! This gonna be fun!&quot;
&gt;He smiles at you, saying that he&#039;s glad he got to do this with you.
&gt;Your heart flutters a bit when you hear this, but you get yourself under control quickly.
&gt;You grin back at him, before setting off with him deep into the forest.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt;Be Anon
&gt;You were happy to see that Zoey was feeling good today.
&gt;Maybe her heat wasn&#039;t as bad as you thought.
&gt;That or the excitement of hiking through the woods with you was distracting her from her more base needs.
&gt;You had been walking through the woods with Zoey for about 20 minutes now.
&gt;She was quite literally leading you by the hand, her hand gently squeezing yours as she led you through the trees.
&gt;She had told you it was to keep you from getting lost, but you think she just wanted to hold your hand like some sort of degenerate.
&gt;There wasn&#039;t really any defined paths, but it seemed like Zoey knew her way through these woods like the back of her hand.
&gt;You had passed a couple small creeks, Zoey sharing with you a small story about each one.
&gt;&quot;I used to always catch frogs and tadpoles over here. My Mom always made me dump out the jars of tadpoles I&#039;d bring back, though.&quot;
&gt;&quot;One time I went swimming in here and I got a leech on me! It scared me, and I cried for almost an hour.&quot;
&gt;Currently, you were walking up a small rocky hill, several chunks of granite jutting out of the ground.
&gt;&quot;Come on, Anon! We&#039;re almost to the cave!&quot;
&gt;She seemed pretty eager to show you the cave, to the point of being a bit impatient with your slower walking speed. Not your fault you had shorter legs than her.
&gt;She tugs your hand a bit, and you make an effort to speed up.
&gt;&quot;It should be just over this hill... I think.&quot;
&gt;You huff out a quick sigh, sweating a little bit.
&gt;It wasn&#039;t very warm out, but her quick pace was exhausting you a bit.
&gt;After a couple minutes, you scale the top of the hill.
&gt;Zoey looks back at you smiling, but her ears fold back a bit and she lets out a small whine when she sees you out of breath and sweating.
&gt;&quot;Sorry, Anon... I&#039;ll try to go a bit slower for you. I guess I&#039;m just excited to show you around...&quot;
&gt;You wave your hand at her, telling her not to worry, and that you were fine.
&gt;You just weren&#039;t in the best of shape, and you weren&#039;t used to rushing up hills.
&gt;She raises her other hand, pointing at the bottom of the hill.
&gt;&quot;Well, we can rest at the bottom of the hill there. I can see the cave entrance!&quot;
&gt;You look at where she&#039;s pointing, and you can see a large rock overhang which formed a open cave in the side of the hill next to you.

&gt;The two of you walk down the hill, Zoey slowing her pace down a bit for you.
&gt;&quot;Here it is, Anon!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I know it isn&#039;t the biggest cave, but I love this place.&quot;
&gt;You look around the cave. It wasn&#039;t very big, but it definitely wasn&#039;t small either.
&gt;The roof of the cave was about 8 feet away from the ground at the entrance, but gradually sloped down behind you until it met with the rocky floor.
&gt;&quot;I know it doesn&#039;t really count as a cave, but it was always a nice, cool, secluded place to hang out when I was younger. Sometimes I just had to get away from my brothers, you know?&quot;
&gt;You had met Zoey&#039;s brothers before, and you nod. She had three of them. There were nice enough, but they were no stranger to roughhousing with each other. Every time you had visited, you were pretty sure at least one of them had a broken bone.
&gt;As for the cave being cool, she wasn&#039;t kidding. It felt about 10 degrees cooler in the back part of the cave.
&gt;It wasn&#039;t really too great when it was already kind of cold outside, though.
&gt;Before you start to shiver a bit, you head back to the large mouth of the cave, over where Zoey is standing, staring at you with a wide grin, her tail wagging a bit.
&gt;&quot;So, what do you think of the place?&quot;
&gt;You tell her that you think it&#039;s pretty nice. You had never been to a real cave before.
&gt;&quot;Really? I thought you loved the outdoors, Anon.&quot;
&gt;You tell her that you had always been more of a fishing kind of guy, and she just shrugs.
&gt;&quot;To each his own, I suppose.&quot;
&gt;You ask her if there&#039;s anything else notable about the area, and she stands up straight, her tail wagging a bit faster.
&gt;&quot;O-oh! Yeah! There&#039;s the mine-shaft I told you about! It&#039;s somewhere around here, too!&quot;
&gt;You ask her if she knew where it was, and she considers your question a moment before answering:
&gt;&quot;Yeah, I remember it being near this place... I think over in this direction?&quot;
&gt;She points to your right, through a rough-looking thicket of tall bushes.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m pretty certain, at least. Do you... Want to go see it?&quot;
&gt;You give her a thumbs up, and tell her to lead the way.
&gt;She smiles, before taking your hand in hers once more.
&gt;She starts to walk with you, leading you to where the old mine is.

&gt;After another 5 minutes, you arrive at a wide hole in the side of a hill.
&gt;The entrance is halfway covered in dirt, but it still looks like it has has enough room for the two of you to fit through if you duck down.
&gt;The two of you pause at the entrance, and Zoey looks at you.
&gt;&quot;Well, this is it. The old mine.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I asked my Dad a couple of times, but he has no clue what they mined here. Maybe Zinc. I know they mine that up in the Appalachians, and that isn&#039;t too far away from here.&quot;
&gt;She was probably right. You couldn&#039;t think of any other abundant mineral or metal around here.
&gt;&quot;Anyways, I&#039;ve never even been inside it. It always scared me when I was young.&quot;
&gt;She huffs a bit.
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t know. I guess it&#039;s just something about an abandoned mine-shaft that just gives me the spooks.&quot;
&gt;&quot;And we didn&#039;t bring flashlights, so I guess it&#039;s exploration will just have to wait another day.&quot;
&gt;You knew your phone had a flashlight, but you had left it back at the cabin to charge.
&gt;You had kind of wanted to explore it further, but there was no way you were exploring an old rotting mine-shaft with no source of light.
&gt;That&#039;s how people go missing and die.
&gt;Zoey taps you on the shoulder as you stare into the dark maw of the mine.
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s go somewhere else. I hate this place.&quot;
&gt;She stiffens up a bit after saying this.
&gt;&quot;B-but we can stay if you want to, of course... Don&#039;t feel pressured to leave just because of me. This is your vacation too.&quot;
&gt;You give her a reassuring smile, and tell her it&#039;s fine. There was no use hanging around some dumb old mineshaft when you had a whole forest to look around.
&gt;She takes hold of your hand again, and tells you:
&gt;&quot;Come on, Anon! I still have lots of places to show you.&quot;
&gt;You nod, and let her lead you back into the dark woods.

&gt;For the next hour and a half, Zoey gives you an encompassing tour of the forest.
&gt;You had joked about it, but it looks like she really DOES know this place like the back of her hand.
&gt;After a while though, you had started to feel a bit peckish.
&gt;You ignored it, but the second Zoey heard your stomach start to growl, she refused to continue until you sated your hunger.
&gt;She sits you down on a fallen log, and sits right next to you, her shoulder bumping into yours.
&gt;&quot;Come on, Anon. Bust out those sandwiches.&quot;
&gt;You nod, and take the pack off, setting on the ground in front of you.
&gt;You unzip it, handing her a canteen and a sandwich.
&gt;She bites into her sandwich, before turning to look at you.
&gt;&quot;I gotta say, Anon. I can see why you love these so much.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Salami and cheese is pretty nice once in awhile.&quot;
&gt;The two of you eat your sandwiches, savoring every bite.
&gt;You brush the crumbs off of your pants and hands, then turn to look at Zoey sitting next to you.
&gt;You thank her for making it for you, and she gently bumps her muzzle against the side of your head.
&gt;&quot;Thanks Anon. It&#039;s... Nice to hear that from you.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I like how we&#039;ve always got along. We&#039;re like two pieces of a puzzle.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;ve always so nice to me...&quot;
&gt;She slips an arm over your shoulders and pulls you closer, her head resting on top of yours.
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s just sit here for a bit... This is nice.&quot;
&gt;You open your mouth to say something, but quickly close it.
&gt;This is pretty nice, and you don&#039;t want to ruin it by saying something stupid.
&gt;You can hear Zoey gently breathing through her nose, taking in your scent.
&gt;She tightens her grip on your shoulder a bit, bringing you into her fluff a bit more.
&gt;You can hear her tail as it wags against the log, making a small brushing noise.
&gt;It wags a bit more slowly though, as she lifts her muzzle off of your head to look at your face.
&gt;Theres an shy, almost uncomfortable look on her face as she asks you:
&gt;&quot;Anon... Can I tell you something?&quot;
&gt;You tell her that you&#039;ll listen to anything she has to say.
&gt;&quot;Anon... I... I really like you...&quot;
&gt;You pat her on the back, and tell her that you like her too. You&#039;re glad that the two of you have always been close.
&gt;She whines a bit, and you can see she looks very nervous.
&gt;&quot;No, Anon... What I&#039;m trying to say is that...&quot;
&gt;She whines louder and longer this time, and it almost seems like she&#039;s about to cry.
&gt;&quot;Anon... I love you.&quot;

&gt;Before you can answer, she buries her muzzle in your neck, her arms wrapped tightly around you.
&gt;She&#039;s whining almost nonstop, and you can feel her tears start to dampen your shoulder.
&gt;Well, shit. You didn&#039;t see this coming.
&gt;As you feel her breath start to hitch, you can feel her start to cry a bit.
&gt;You pull one arm out of her grasp, and rest it around her shoulder.
&gt;She brings her snout out of your neck a bit, her tear-stained eyes peeking out at you with a worried look.
&gt;&quot;A-Anon?&quot;
&gt;You lean towards her, and give her a small kiss on the top of her head, and you can hear her let out a small gasp.
&gt;You tell her that you&#039;ve always liked her too.
&gt;She stares at you frozen, a wide smile on her face. Her eyes are still full of tears, but you don&#039;t think they&#039;re tears of stress anymore.
&gt;You tell her that you were always terrified of making the first move. You didn&#039;t want to make things weird between the two of you, just in case she didn&#039;t share the same feelings as you.
&gt;Her mouth opens, and she quickly says:
&gt;&quot;Anon... Anon, I&#039;ve always loved you!&quot;
&gt;She pulls you into a tight hug, the side of her muzzle pressing into your neck.
&gt;&quot;I felt the same way... I never knew if you liked me in that way or not...&quot;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;ve always been there to support me, even when nobody else did...&quot;
&gt;She pulls back a bit, and looks at you with a hopeful look on her face.
&gt;&quot;Anon, Can... Can I kiss you? Please!?&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t answer.
&gt;Instead, you lean forward, and meet her lips with yours.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt;Be Zoey
&gt;HOLY FUCKING SHIT, HE ACTUALLY DID IT.
&gt;ANON IS KISSING YOU.
&gt;You waste no time, and bring one of your hands up from his back, and grasp the back of his head.
&gt;You lean into the kiss, your tongue slipping out of your mouth and into his.
&gt;The rest of your body leans into him too, and he ends up laying on his back atop the log.
&gt;You&#039;re pretty much lying on top of him, but he doesn&#039;t seem to mind. That or he&#039;s too busy making out with you to care.
&gt;Your tongue slips out of his mouth, but you don&#039;t care.
&gt;Instead, you start to lick his face, painting him with your saliva.
&gt;You had been waiting for this for so long... And it was all worth it.
&gt;You were going to make him yours, and make yourself his.
&gt;As your excitement grows, your grip on him tightens.
&gt;&quot;Hold me tighter, Anon!&quot;
&gt;Anon puts his free arm around your back, and begins to pet and scratch you all along your back and neck.
&gt;It was agonizing, but you had to resist the urge to have him take you right here right now.
&gt;You had been visualizing this moment almost every night for the past several years.
&gt;The day was finally here, and you intended to do things RIGHT.
&gt;You give Anon another quick smooch before pulling away.
&gt;You pull him up by the shoulders, until he&#039;s sitting up, facing you.
&gt;Looking at him, you can&#039;t resist giving him another good kiss.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt;Be Anon
&gt;Things were moving pretty quickly.
&gt;Zoey stops kissing you, and pulls you up.
&gt;She kisses you once more, then lets out a small whine
&gt;&quot;Anon... Cabin. Now.&quot;
&gt;You nod, and she pulls you to your feet.
&gt;You can smell the scent of her heat hanging heavily in the air. You guess that a little foreplay went a LONG way while she was in heat.
&gt;Looking at her as you stand up, you can see a large stain around the crotch of her jeans. 
&gt;To say she was wet would be an understatement. It looks like someone threw a water balloon at her.
&gt;She whines a bit as she sees you staring at the growing wet patch.
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t stare...&quot;
&gt;She takes your hand in hers, and starts to quickly walk back in the direction of what you assume is the cabin.
&gt;&quot;Come, on! Faster, Anon!&quot;
&gt;Seeing that her pace is too quick for you, she stops suddenly.
&gt;It isn&#039;t to slow down for you, though.
&gt;She huffs at you, before squatting down a bit, grabbing at you and pulling you close.
&gt;She stands back up, hefting you over her shoulder.
&gt;There&#039;s no time for you to protest, as she starts to full on sprint back in the direction of the cabin, bouncing you on her shoulder.
&gt;You feel a bit flattered at how much Zoey wants you, but a small part of you worries about what state your pelvis is going to be in when you wake up tomorrow.
&gt;For now though, that didn&#039;t matter.
&gt;When the two of you got back to the cabin, you knew what was going to happen.
&gt;The two of you were going to fuck each other until you both passed out.

&gt;Just when your stomach and ribs start to hurt from being bumped up and down on your furred friend&#039;s shoulder, she sets you down.
&gt;&quot;Come on, Anon! We&#039;re here!&quot;
&gt;Looking at Zoey, you can see her eyes are wide, her jaw is slack, and her tongue is hanging out of her mouth.
&gt;A classic Canine smile.
&gt;You rush alongside of her to keep up, and when you get up to the cabin she practically kicks the door down.
&gt;The two of you enter the cabin, and her eyes dart back at you.
&gt;She rushes over to your side, and pulls you over to the couch.
&gt;She sits you down, then plops down in your lap, straddling you.
&gt;She wraps her arms around you, and buries her nose back into the crook of your neck, her cold, wet nose poking you, and begins to inhale deeply.
&gt;She&#039;s smelling you with so much intensity, you almost feel like she&#039;s trying to snort you.
&gt;As she sniffs you, she starts to rub her furry hands and arms across your back and neck.
&gt;She starts to moan a bit, and you can hear her mumbling into your shoulder.
&gt;&quot;Love you... Love you, Anon... Always loved you...&quot;
&gt;Hearing her say that melts your heart a bit.
&gt;You had always had some degree of feelings for her, but you had always kept them suppressed, just in case she didn&#039;t share them.
&gt;Although seeing as how you were pinned down on the couch with her arms wrapped around you, her scent starting to coat your body, it was pretty clear to you that she shared them, alright.
&gt;As she sits on your lap, you can start to feel something warm and set start to soak into the fabric of your pants.
&gt;Shit, your scent must be having a bigger effect on her than you thought!
&gt;She slowly pulls her muzzle out of your neck, letting out a small whine.
&gt;&quot;Anon, I... I need you. Now.&quot;
&gt;You tell her you feel the same way, and her tongue droops out of her mouth to lick across your face.
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s... Uh... Bedroom.&quot;
&gt;You nod, and she gets off of your lap, holding you by the hand once more as she hastily leads you into the bedroom.

&gt;Zoey practically drags you into the bed, licking and smelling you the whole way there.
&gt;She leans back onto the bed, dropping herself onto her back.
&gt;She doesn&#039;t let go of you however, and she drags you down with her, your face pressing into her neck.
&gt;You can feel Zoey&#039;s hands slip over you, removing your jacket.
&gt;Her hands then slip under your shirt, pulling it off and throwing it on the other side of the room.
&gt;You decide to return the favor, and the two of you begin to remove each others clothes.
&gt;Zoey&#039;s arms drop to her sides when she sees you taking some more initiative, and she pants as your hands rub along her body, slowly peeling her out of her clothes.
&gt;Eventually, all that&#039;s left of her is her panties.
&gt;They were light gray, with a little bit of lace on them.
&gt;They were also sopping wet with Zoey&#039;s fluids.
&gt;You can see the thick outline of her Canine vagina through the fabric, her triangular lips being all puffed out, likely due to her heat.
&gt;She lets out a couple eager whimpers as your hands reach down to take her last piece of clothing off.
&gt;You slowly drag the fabric down her legs, a thin string of her inner juices linking the panties to her puffy pussy.
&gt;Dropping the wet piece of clothing to the bedroom floor, you look with a wide eyed smile at your naked lover.
&gt;You had of course seen her naked before, but you had never actually gotten an eyeful of her like you were getting right now.
&gt;Her long, muscular legs were splayed apart, a stream of juices practically dripping from her steaming hot loins.
&gt;&quot;A-Anon... It&#039;s your... Turn. Clothes off! P-please...&quot;
&gt;You had reduced her to a shivering mess, and you had barely even touched her yet.
&gt;This was going to be a fun night.

&gt;You slowly take the remainder of your clothes off, intending to give her a bit of a show.
&gt;She watches you with wide eyes, her tongue hanging out of her mouth, panting and drooling as she watches you pull down your pants, kicking them off.
&gt;You slowly shuck off your boxers, and and you can hear a gasp. When she watches your erect cock spring out of the constraining fabric, her fingers dig deep into the sheets.
&gt;It seems like she is making it a point not to touch herself.
&gt;She&#039;s waiting for you, and you only.
&gt;As you close the small distance between you two, you can see she has a shaky grin from ear to ear, tears of joy visibly forming in her eyes.
&gt;She sits up suddenly, grabbing you as you stand less than a foot away from her.
&gt;She pulls you down next to you, the two of you laying on your sides.
&gt;Her pink tongue darts out of her mouth to cover whatever it can reach in her thin saliva.
&gt;You open your mouth to say something, but she seizes the opportunity the second it happens, and her tongue jabs into your mouth, her tongue wrestling with yours.
&gt;You press yourself deeper into the kiss, causing Zoey to whine into your mouth, and paw at the back of your neck.
&gt;It looks like she intended to keep you right where you are. For the current moment, anyways.
&gt;Your hands roam across her soft, furred body, exploring and gently scratching every inch of fur that they can reach.
&gt;The two of your mouths separate with a wet pop as you pull back for some air.
&gt;You look at Zoey and you can see her staring at you with a lecherous, glazed over look in her eyes.
&gt;&quot;I... Anon, I... I need you inside me! Now! PLEASE!&quot;
&gt;Theres no way you can say no to that request, and you move back a bit, and ask her how she wants you.
&gt;She considers your question for a moment, biting one of her knuckles.
&gt;She looks back at you, whining softly, and sheepishly says:
&gt;&quot;Can I, um...  I... I want you in my mouth! I&#039;ll be gentle, I promise!&quot;
&gt;You eye her canine teeth cautiously, but you relent.
&gt;You would do anything in this moment to make her happy.
&gt;She pushes you onto your back, and gives you one more kiss.
&gt;She snakes down the bed until her muzzle is hanging just inches away from your cock
&gt;You sit up a bit, watching her.
&gt;She&#039;s drooling, staring with wide eyes at your crotch.
&gt;She reaches a shaky hand up, and gasps when she finally gets her hand around it.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s so... Warm...&quot;
&gt;She gives it a good sniff, and her tongue falls out of her mouth, a thick string of saliva hanging from it.
&gt;Without any further warning, she begins to slather your dick and balls with her tongue.
&gt;You choke out a gasp, falling on your back.
&gt;Holy SHIT.
&gt;You knew that Canines generally had a higher body temperature than Humans did, but you didn&#039;t expect it to be so noticeable.
&gt;You reach a hand down, and gently pet her on the head as she begins to slide your lubricated member into her hot maw.
&gt;She moans, and you aren&#039;t sure if it&#039;s from the petting or just the euphoria she&#039;s getting from finally having you all to herself.
&gt;Maybe both.
 
&gt;Zoey starts to bob her head up and down, and with how fast she&#039;s going, you&#039;re surprised she isn&#039;t choking herself every couple of seconds.
&gt;When you start to play with her stiff ears however, she goes crazy, one her hands shooting down to dig inside of her canine snatch.
&gt;You can hear (and smell) her rubbing herself off furiously.
&gt;Her other hand rests on your hip, pressing down on you as she mounts a final assault with her tongue, dragging the wide muscle across your length in attempt to milk out everything you&#039;ve got.
&gt;You choke out to her that you&#039;re getting close, and her eyes pop open wide.
&gt;Her head starts bobbing faster than a tweaker at a metal concert, and you feel like your soul is about to leave your body.
&gt;Before you can even process what&#039;s happening, your cock explodes inside her mouth, filling her throat with your thick and sticky emissions.
&gt;She opens her mouth, sighing happily, drops of your seed leaking out.
&gt;You&#039;re laying back on the pillow, gasping for air, when you feel her tongue on your crotch again.
&gt;You quickly look back down, and you can see both of her hands on your hips, one of them slick with her own juices.
&gt;She&#039;s gently licking the excess fluids off of your cock, her eyes half lidded.
&gt;When she sees you looking, she lets out a needy whine, and crawls up on the bed next to you.
&gt;&quot;Anon, I need you to... I...&quot;
&gt;She gives you a really nervous look, and loosely graps your hands.
&gt;She places one of your hands on her breast, sighing as you grip it gently, rubbing the erect nipple with your palm a little.
&gt;Your other hand she reserves for her triangular slit, urging you to take it in your grasp.
&gt;You hold her fortune cookie gently, the intense heat of it surprising you.
&gt;Less surprisingly, you can feel a sticky fluid dribbling out and into your own palm.
&gt;&quot;I...&quot;
&gt;Her ears flatten against her head, and she says:
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m ready for you... Please... I need it inside me now...&quot;
&gt;Her muzzle hangs an inch from your ear. She gives it a small lick before continuing.
&gt;&quot;Just take me, Anon... Any way you want me... I&#039;m all yours...&quot;
&gt;&quot;I want to know how much you love me... I want to FEEL how much you love me...&quot;
&gt;&quot;Take me like I&#039;m your wife... Make me feel loved!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Please, Anon! Do anything you want with me!&quot;
&gt;You smile, telling her you&#039;ve got a couple ideas.
&gt;You take your hands off of her, and use one to scratch her ear.
&gt;You tell her that you think she&#039;d look pretty nice laying on her back, and she grins widely.
 
&gt;And with that, she flops onto her back, spreading her legs just for you.
&gt;She props herself up on her elbows, looking at you excitedly.
&gt;Her tongue is hanging limply out of her mouth, and you can hear her panting.
&gt;Looking at her pussy, you can see a dribble of clear fluid leaking out.
&gt;You want to desperately just dive in and start pounding her, but you need a couple more minutes to get fully hard again.
&gt;That and the crueler side of you wants to tease her a bit more.
&gt;What&#039;s the worst that could happen? Hell, she&#039;s been waiting YEARS for this. She can wait a few more minutes before she finally gets her wish.
&gt;&quot;A-Anon? Come on, I&#039;m ready...&quot;
&gt;You scoot closer to her, sitting on your knees over her.
&gt;&quot;Wh-What are you doing, Anon? I&#039;m down here...&quot;
&gt;You give her a warm smile.
&gt;You bend over a bit, reaching down to gently scratch her all along her toned body, your fingers quickly working around in her fur from her midriff all the way up to her chin.
&gt;For the cherry on top, you even call her a good girl.
&gt;She sucks in a lungful of air, looking like she&#039;s just been punched in the gut.
&gt;You&#039;re about to stop, thinking you might be hurting her, then then she lets out a load, screaming moan, her arms and legs shaking.
&gt;She never EVER let you pet her, even as a joke. You guess you know why now.
&gt;You can&#039;t help but smile at her reaction.
&gt;You call her a good girl again, and she lets out a happy yip.
&gt;&quot;Oh- Oh, GOD, Anon! Don&#039;t stop! Don&#039;t fucking stop~!
&gt;It&#039;s nice to see she&#039;s enjoying this as much as you are.
&gt;Her hands lift off of the bed to gently hang onto your wrists as they glide across her midsection.
 
&gt;After a couple more minutes of vigorous petting, Zoey&#039;s whole body starts to tremble and shake.
&gt;You were planning on stopping right before she got off, but you change your mind.
&gt;You just wanted to tease her. You didn&#039;t want to be mean.
&gt;Instead, you double up on the petting, raking your fingers through her silky fur.
&gt;It was still really soft from last night.
&gt;You remember her telling you that she had used a special fur cleaner.
&gt;Must be some pretty quality stuff, because you feel like you could pet Zoey all night without tiring from it.
&gt;But that could come later.
&gt;For now, you had other things on your mind.
&gt;Such as making Zoey cum from simply being petted.
&gt;You mount your final assault, scritching her with absolutely no degree of mercy whatsoever.
&gt;Zoey&#039;s arms fly up and wrap around your neck and shoulder, and she pulls you in for a deep kiss as her explosive orgasm wracks her body.
&gt;She causes you to fall forward onto her, your cock pressing against her furred abs.
&gt;One of her legs quickly wraps around you, pinning you to her fluff as she jams her tongue down your throat.
&gt;She&#039;s moaning and yipping loudly into your mouth all throughout the kiss, her body shaking all around you.
&gt;Eventually she goes limp, and you flop off of her, landing on the blankets next to her.
&gt;You&#039;re pretty happy with yourself at what you&#039;ve reduced her to, but then you see her tremble as she shakily rolls over onto your front, straddling you.
&gt;She&#039;s still trembling a bit, but she surprised you with how fast she had recovered.
&gt;Looks like her heat was taking over. She had you right where she wanted you, and there was no way she was going to let you go.
&gt;Especially after you had just gotten her off with no penetration of any kind.
 
&gt;She pants heavily over you, her tongue dipping in and out of her mouth which each shaky breath.
&gt;&quot;Y-you... You just...&quot;
&gt;She leans forward, her hands gripping your shoulders.
&gt;You can feel her dull claws jabbing your shoulders, and your heart starts beating a bit faster. Is she angry with you?
&gt;&quot;I... I&#039;m going to fuck you... SO HARD.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re not leaving this bed... Not until you pump me properly, and fill me up~...&quot;
&gt;She actually growls a bit at you, and you feel a bit of surprise when you feel yourself getting a bit harder.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m going to make you cum DEEP~ inside of me... I won&#039;t stop until you BREED me PROPERLY!&quot;
&gt;And with that, one of her hands reach down and grabs your length, stroking it.
&gt;You don&#039;t need any further lubrication. You&#039;re still slick from her saliva, and her own natural lubricants are dripping down from her triangle shaped pussy onto your cock.
&gt;She rubs the head of your cock against her steaming hot snatch, causing the two of you to shudder will glee.
&gt;She takes a couple seconds to align your dick with her entrance, then she slowly lowers herself onto you.
&gt;Your dick slips inside of her like it had always belonged there.
 
&gt;Zoey gasps, and drops her weight on you, slamming you to the hilt inside of her.
&gt;The two of you yell out each others names in a fit of pleasure.
&gt;Looking at Zoey, she looks like she&#039;s about to pass out from the stimulation.
&gt;You arent faring much better.
&gt;Her depths grip your cock like a slime covered vice, trying to milk you of your seed.
&gt;She slowly grinds against you, forcing a low moan out of you.
&gt;Zoey looks down at you, tears in the corners of her eyes, a loving grin on her face.
&gt;&quot;A-Anon... I... I love you... So,so much...&quot;
&gt;&quot;I hope you- Ah! I hope you l-like how I feel!&quot;
&gt;Her tail is wagging extremely fast, brushing across your thighs behind her.
&gt;&quot;I... I saved myself just for you! You&#039;re the first one to ever be inside me... And I&#039;m going to keep you the ONLY person to ever be inside me...&quot;
&gt;She sees the alarm in your eyes as you realize she&#039;s a virgin.
&gt;&quot;N-No! Don&#039;t worry- Ah! Don&#039;t worry, Anon! You aren&#039;t hurting me... C-Canines are a lot different than hu-human girls...&quot;
&gt;She sees that you&#039;re still concerned, so she grabs your shoulders and pulls you until you&#039;re sitting up.
&gt;She gives you a reassuring kiss, and wraps her arms around your back.
&gt;&quot;Are y-you ready, Anon?&quot;
&gt;You answer her by bucking your hips into her a tiny bit, causing her to yip and grip your tighter.
&gt;She gives a couple quick pants, before saying:
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll... I&#039;ll get you back for that...&quot;
&gt;You tell her to do her worst and she just grins at you, easing you back down onto the bed.
&gt;&quot;Just... Just let me do all the work... You just... Enjoy...&quot;
&gt;Before you can respond, she lifts off of you a couple inches, then slams back onto your hips.
&gt;Then she does it again. And again. And again.
&gt;She settles into a steady rhythm, riding you with all she has, crying out your name.
&gt;Your mind becomes cloudy with pleasure, and all you can do is moan and thrust your hips up to meet her when she comes down.
&gt;Suddenly, Zoey drops down on you but doesn&#039;t pop back up.
&gt;Instead, you feel her folds clench tightly around you, and she cries out.
&gt;She&#039;s a bit unsteady, and falls forward onto your chest.
&gt;Your a bit irritated that you weren&#039;t able to finish, but Zoey soothes your worries by saying:
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not... Not done yet, Anon... Gonna make you fuck a load of puppies into me... Gonna make you MINE...&quot;
&gt;She moves off of you, and your dick flops out of her, still rock hard and glistening with her fluids.
&gt;She turns around on her hands and knees, raising her tail to expose herself to you.
&gt;It truly is a wonderful sight, and you find yourself staring at it.
&gt;Zoey whines, turning around.
&gt;&quot;D-Don&#039;t just stare at it... Come on, Anon! I want you! I NEED YOU!&quot;
&gt;Not wanting to keep her waiting, you grab her ass (making her let out a pleasured yip), and position it better.
&gt;You slide your dick back inside of her steaming, puffy, dog pussy, forcing a moan out of the two of you.
&gt;&quot;Go as r-rough as you want, Anon! I want it ALL!&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t want to disappoint her, and so you&#039;re happy to oblige.
&gt;Not taking the time to build up a rhythm, you immediately start pounding her, causing the bed to rock and creak.
&gt;Zoey certainly seems to enjoy it, yelling:
&gt;&quot;YES! OH, FUUUCK! BREED ME, ANON!&quot;
&gt;You pound at her plump hole, intent on filling her up.
&gt;There was no fucking way that you were ever going back to Human women after this.
&gt;Shit, you didn&#039;t even think you would even be able to go back to using your hand.
&gt;There was just no competing with Zoey.
 
&gt;Several minutes later, Zoey has already cum twice, and you begin to feel a familiar feeling beginning to creep up through your body.
&gt;Zoey is face down in the mattress, moaning and groaning as you pound away at her slippery cunt.
&gt;When you let her know you&#039;re about to cum, she immediately perks up, shouting:
&gt;&quot;INSIDE! I NEED IT INSIDE! PLEASE, ANON!&quot;
&gt;She starts thrusting her ass back at you to meet your thrusts, causing your cock to plunge into the deepest parts of her.
&gt;Her added efforts tip you over the edge, and you grab her ass, stuffing yourself as deep inside of her as you can.
&gt;Your eyes pop open wide, and you swear.
&gt;You have the most violent, most pleasurable orgasm you&#039;ve ever had.
&gt;Your cock explodes deep inside of her, the cum getting blasted straight into her waiting womb.
&gt;&quot;YES! OH GOD, YES ANON! GIVE IT ALL TO ME!&quot;
&gt;She gleefully yips as the last of your jizz shoots into her.
&gt;When the last of your cum is safely resting deep inside of Zoey, you slowly pull out of her, groaning.
&gt;Zoey flops forward onto her chest, a thin stream of drool hanging out of her mouth.
&gt;&quot;A-Anon... You... You did it...&quot;
&gt;She gets back on her hands, crawling over to you.
&gt;She grabs hold of you, forcing you under the blankets with her.
&gt;She holds you tight, one hand on your back, the other hand on the back of your head, gently pushing your face into the crook of her neck, deep into her floof.
&gt;The rest of her body rubs against you, rubbing her scent deep into your skin.
&gt;Zoey licks your ear and neck, and whispers in your ear:
&gt;&quot;We&#039;re mates now, Anon... I&#039;m all yours, and you&#039;re all mine... Forever...&quot;
&gt;You slide your arms over and under her, holding her close.
&gt;She lets out a content noise, her muzzle pressing into your hair, her nose lightly blowing warm air onto your hair and scalp.
&gt;&quot;Forever...&quot;
&gt;You gently stroke her back, soothing her to sleep.
&gt;Eventually you feel Zoey&#039;s grip on you relax, and she stops rubbing against you.
&gt;Yeah, she&#039;s asleep alright.
&gt;You quickly follow her, your eyes shutting, and sleep takes you.
 
&gt;You wake up first, light shining through the window onto you.
&gt;You can&#039;t bear to wake up Zoey, though. You&#039;re just too damn comfortable to let this end.
&gt;Your arms must have slipped off of her while you slept, and you quickly wrap them back around her, your fingers sinking into her soft fur.
&gt;Sadly though, this stirs her awake, and she lets out a whining yawn.
&gt;You can see one of her eyes slowly open, but when she sees you laying in her arms she&#039;s awake in an instant.
&gt;&quot;Anon!? Oh thank God! I was so worried that it was all a dream...&quot;
&gt;You assure you that it was all real, and she strokes your back.
&gt;&quot;I hope you realize that we&#039;re together now, Anon... Forever. I&#039;m NEVER letting you go...&quot;
&gt;You smile, telling her that if she&#039;s happy, you&#039;re happy.
&gt;You can hear her tail wag, swishing in-between the sheets and blankets.
&gt;But you tell her that she&#039;ll have to let go of you for just a moment. Then you&#039;ll return to her right away.
&gt;She gives you a confused and worried look.
&gt;&quot;W-what? Anon?&quot;
&gt;You slide out of her hold, causing her to let out a loud whine.
&gt;&quot;Nooo... Stay...&quot;
&gt;You smile, and walk over to the window.
&gt;You close the curtains, blocking out that damn sunshine.
&gt;Nature could fucking wait. You had all you needed in life laying in bed 5 feet away from you.
&gt;She slides the covers off of her as you walk back, and she spreads her arms and legs out for your return.
&gt;You lay back in bed next to her, sliding into her grasp.
&gt;&quot;Anon... Can you, uh... Pet me? Please?&quot;
&gt;You smile, saying that of course you&#039;ll pet her whenever she wants. All she needs to do is ask.
&gt;She shudders a bit as your hands get to work on her large pointed ears.
&gt;They&#039;re a bit cold, but you&#039;re all too happy to warm them up.
&gt;From the way Zoey is happily sighing, you think she doesn&#039;t mind it either.
&gt;This was the best morning you&#039;ve ever had in your life.
 
&gt;The rest of the week seemingly flies by, either spent exploring the wilderness with your new partner, or fucking each others brains out.
&gt;Sometimes both. Usually both.
&gt;No fucking way you were ever having sex in a canoe ever again, though.
&gt;It&#039;s not fun being suddenly dunked into ice cold water when the boat flips as you&#039;re balls deep in your doggy lover.
&gt;Other than that one unfortunate incident though, the rest of the week is spent in a state of almost constant bliss.
&gt;Sadly though, all good things come to an end sooner or later.
&gt;Currently, it was the afternoon, and after a late breakfast you and Zoey started packing away all of your belongings.
&gt;You both had work tomorrow, and so you had to get back to town.
&gt;The two of you had already cleaned up the living room, kitchen, and bathroom of all your belongings.
&gt;You&#039;re lazily cramming your belongings back into the suitcase, and you let out a disappointed sigh.
&gt;You knew that the week was going to end sooner or later, but it seems like it just flew by so quickly.
&gt;Zoey must sense your discontent, as she comes next to you, squatting next to you to plant a kiss on the back of your neck.
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry, Anon. It&#039;s not like you won&#039;t see me again.&quot;
&gt;&quot;In fact, I wanted to talk to ypu about that. How does dinner together sound after work tomorrow? At my place.&quot;
&gt;She looked at you with her eyes fully open, a hopeful look on her face.
&gt;You tell her that of course you would. You think you&#039;ll be spending A LOT more time with her now. Even more than you already did.
&gt;She gleefully claps her hands together, smiling.
&gt;&quot;Thank you, Anon! I promise I&#039;ll make you the best dinner you&#039;ve ever had!&quot;
&gt;Zoey puts her arm around you, resting her head on your shoulder.
&gt;&quot;Anon... I hope you know that I meant what I said when I told you that I loved you... That wasn&#039;t just the heat talking.&quot;
&gt;You zip up your suitcase, smiling.
&gt;You bring up one of your hands to gently pat her on the head, telling her that you love her too.
&gt;She lets out a satisfied huff, her tail thumping against the floor as you pet her.
&gt;&quot;Th-thank you, Anon...&quot;
&gt;It brought you great satisfaction to see how she practically melted in your hands when you started petting her.
&gt;She reluctantly pulls way from you, sighing.
&gt;&quot;Well, we can continue this later. For now let&#039;s just focus on getting our shit packed up.&quot;
&gt;You nod, standing up with your suitcase.
&gt;&quot;Okay, You load our luggage into the car, and I&#039;ll make sure we didn&#039;t miss anything.&quot;
&gt;Goddammit, she was still making you carry the heavy stuff.
&gt;You suppose that some things never change.
 
&gt;The trunk of Zoey&#039;s Jeep shuts with a muffled thump as you close it shut.
&gt;Zoey leans out of the open window, saying:
&gt;&quot;Come on, Anon! I know you like it out here, but I&#039;m not leaving you behind!&quot;
&gt;You tell her you&#039;ll be right there, as you gaze out at the cabin.
&gt;You were going to miss this place.
&gt;You sigh, turning around to climb into the Jeep.
&gt;It had been one of the best weeks of your life, and now you had to return to your monotonous job.
&gt;That&#039;s just the way things go, though.
&gt;You open the door to the Jeep, before planting yourself on the seat.
&gt;Zoey leans over to you with a smile, licking your cheek.
&gt;&quot;You know, I got my scent on you now. Gonna make sure NOBODY besides me tries to touch you.&quot;
&gt;She points a thumb at herself, a stern look on her face.
&gt;&quot;If anyone DOES try to though, you just tell me and I&#039;ll take care of it.&quot;
&gt;You chuckle, telling her that you&#039;ll be sure to do that.
&gt;&quot;Now buckle up. Or do I have to give you a ticket?&quot;
&gt;You buckle up, telling her that she isn&#039;t even a traffic cop.
&gt;&quot;Oooh, giving back-talk to a Cop? Do I have to handcuff you~?&quot;
&gt;You put up your hands in mock surrender, as she reaches over to buckle your seatbelt.
&gt;&quot;I gotta keep you safe, Anon. You&#039;re my mate now.&quot;
&gt;She licks your face one more time, before sitting up straight and sticking the key in the ignition, turning it.
&gt;As the car comes to life, you pat her gently on the leg.
&gt;You ask her if you would be able to come back to the cabin sometime together, and she just grins at you. That&#039;s the only answer you need.
&gt;As she pulls out onto the dirt road, and into the forest road, she pats you on the leg.
&gt;Her hand doesn&#039;t leave your thigh, and she keeps it there.
&gt;She gives it a gentle squeeze, telling you:
&gt;&quot;I love you, Anon.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll love you forever.&quot;
&gt;Her car pulls out onto the main road, and the two of you drive off into the mid-day sun.
