&gt;Be Anon
&gt;PFC Anon, actually
&gt;PFC Anon, 25th Infantry Division
&gt;You were just another grunt in the hot Vietnam jungle
&gt;it ain&#039;t me starts playing
&gt;When draft time came around you pulled the short straw, and now here you were
&gt;It fucking sucked and you miss your family
&gt;Everything is extremely hot and humid, like Satan&#039;s version of Florida
&gt;You are a member of a &quot;tunnel rat&quot; unit
&gt;You and your battle buddies get stuffed down dark holes full of angry VC and traps with just a pistol and a flashlighthy 
&gt;It&#039;s real dangerous work
&gt;Just last week you lost a man to a pit full of shit covered punji sticks
&gt;Last you heard of him he was getting pumped full of antibiotics after getting his leg amputated
&gt;You got some time off after that, which was nice
&gt;it&#039;s hard to care when you&#039;ve become so jaded
&gt;Now you&#039;re sitting in the back of a helicopter with your comrades
&gt;sympathy for the devil starts playing
&gt;Some other unit reported some tunnels in an area they had secured
&gt;Fucking pussies wouldn&#039;t clear it themselves so they radioed home and now it&#039;s your problem
&gt;The helicopter sets down in a clearing, and your fireteam leader yells over the noise of the spinning blades for you to disembark
&gt;The team spreads out around the helicopter as it takes off
&gt;&quot;Alright, get over here you all&quot; your leader shouts
&gt;Your comrades were everything BUT gentle
&gt;&quot;We&#039;ve got a short hike to the tunnels, so keep your boots on&quot;
&gt;&quot;Seven miles west, through enemy territory&quot;
&gt;What was the fucking helicopter for, then?
&gt;&quot;Oh, and you&#039;re taking point, Anon&quot;
&gt;Triplefuckzingshittits
&gt;Pointmen were always the first to step on the traps
&gt;fucking gay
&gt;You take your first few steps into the heavy green bush
&gt;Fortunately, the hike is uneventful, although you almost shat yourself and squealed like a girl when you stepped on a snake
&gt;More fuel for the guys to tease you about, great
&gt;You would have missed the other unit entirely if it wasn&#039;t for the fat boxy APC they had with them
&gt;After exchanging unenthusiastic greetings with them, you are your team are grouped around a small hole in the ground
&gt;&quot;You check this one, Anon. We got a few more over here&quot;
&gt;Time to get messy
&gt;You lay your rifle on the ground and take off your shirt
&gt;No need for modesty, it gets super hot out here
&gt;With your revolver in your right hand and a flashlight in your left, you descend into the cramped tunnel
&gt;You wiggle through the tunnel, stopping to check every inch of tunnel before you
&gt;You brain chooses this moment remember how some VC release venomous snakes into their tunnels
&gt;Best not to think about it
&gt;Not much later, and without any more snakes, you reach a large chamber you can squat down in
&gt;The room is stacked full of crates, and a quick peek through the a lid reveals the regular assortmenr of rusty weapons
&gt;Gonna need to crawl back and report it
&gt;Before you can take a single step, you hear all hell break loose outside
&gt;Some big explosions rock the tunnel, threatening to collapse
&gt;A machine gun opens up, firing for a good few seconds before there&#039;s a break
&gt;&quot;Anon! Get your ass back out here!&quot; someone shouts down
&gt;Don&#039;t need to hear it twice, you&#039;re out of there
&gt;Despite crawling as fast as you can, it still takes you a minute to reach the opening
&gt;As you poke your head out of the hole, you see things are not looking good
&gt;The APC was now a burning husk, and the last few green uniformed men you could see were retreating into the brush
&gt;In between you and them was a wall of very angry farmers
&gt;With guns
&gt;One of them turns their head, and your heart stops
&gt;&quot;Lính kẻ thù!&quot;
&gt;You&#039;ve heard enough escaped POW stories to know what they would do to you
&gt;No need to think, you leap out of the hole and sprint at thr closest treeline
&gt;You can hear some men in hot pursuit, but a healthy diet of C rations has kept your body in tip top shape, and the malnourished VC in the dust
&gt;Nah not really, you&#039;re panting like a dog
&gt;After what feels like years of lung burning sprinting you realize you&#039;ve lost them, and fall over against a tree, utterly spent
&gt;Popping open your canteen, you take stock of your surroundings
&gt;This is a swamplike area, with a murky, wide river
&gt;Time to take inventory
&gt;Water, check
&gt;Rations, check
&gt;Gun, ch- wait. Where&#039;s your gun?
&gt;Fuck, somehow you managed to lose your only firearm, and now you are knee deep in enemy territory
&gt;Worst of all, your socks are getting kind of wet
&gt;Sighing, you remove your socks
&gt;With absolutely no idea where you are, and the rapidly approaching night combined with your severe exhaustion, you can&#039;t help but drift off to sleep...



&gt;You feel something isn&#039;t right
&gt;And not just because you are hiding from crazy commie rice farmers
&gt;Like... something else is there
&gt;It&#039;s hard to describe, but you are awake now and you can&#039;t fall asleep again
&gt;You sit still, listening to the bugs ask each other to fuck or whatever those noises mean
&gt;The moonlight gleams off of the black river surface, giving you a nice look at the otherworldly pale disc
&gt;Then it breaks
&gt;Something... is standing up in the water
&gt;Is that a man? It&#039;s shaped like a human
&gt;No, it&#039;s much too large
&gt;The shape could easily dwarf any man in your company
&gt;Maybe you&#039;re hallucinating. That thing can&#039;t be real
&gt;You decide to hold completely still, and pray it hadn&#039;t noticed you
&gt;No luck
&gt;The creature has apparently reaced full height, and is now lumbering slowly towards you
&gt;A good estimate would be somewhere around 7 feet tall
&gt;You begin to panic
&gt;Being torn apart by a supernatural monster in the backcountry of a warzone was NOT your idea of an end to a life well lived
&gt;Stay calm, Anon! You&#039;re a soldier! Think back to your training!
&gt;The monster is about a car&#039;s length away from you now, and it stopped, as if to stare at you
&gt;Try to remember some of the basics of CQC
&gt;fail
&gt;Frantic with fear, you grab the largest stick in reach, and charge the thing, yelling and swinging like a coked up baseball player
&gt;With a single swipe, you&#039;re off your feet, and sail though the air right back into the tree you were leaning against
&gt;Was that crack your stick or your spine?
&gt;Ow, you kinda feel it now
&gt;Everything goes black



&gt;Slowly, your eyelids open
&gt;You are in a hut, made out of a mixture of clay and earth
&gt;Thankfully, the beast is nowhere in sight
&gt;You definitely have broken something, but not your spine
&gt;Moving to get up from your position on the floor zaps you with pain, but its better than waiting for that thing to come back
&gt;Biting your lip, you pull your self up to your feet
&gt;The hut is quite modest, with a sleeping bag, stool, and some boxes
&gt;Mounted above the doorway a Kalashnikov rifle is displayed
&gt;Tugging at it only succeeds in reigniting your pain, so you stop and step out of the hut
&gt;You nearly piss yourself
&gt;The monster, more clearly visible in the daylight, facing away from you
&gt;And... it&#039;s a female?
&gt;She was at least eight feet tall, and very muscular
&gt;She had a nice set of hips and thighs too
&gt;But, most noticeably, her body is covered by thick, shiny scales, creating an impressive layer of biological armor, although it seems to get a bit softer around her ass and
&gt;Her large head has the long and powerful face of an alligator
&gt;Wait, alligators only live back in the States, right? She must be a crocodile
&gt;The croc woman still hasn&#039;t noticed you, preoccupied with what looks like your equipment
&gt;She is trying to fit your combat helmet over her head, with no success
&gt;The poor helmet is simply too small for her, after a few moments she grunts and tosses it away in frustration
&gt;OK, that&#039;s it, time to go
&gt;Maybe you will be able to mark this place on a map so someone can drop napalm on this place
&gt;You turn to leave
&gt;&quot;Human!&quot;
&gt;You think your heart stopped beating
&gt;Turning around, you can see SHE IS LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU
&gt;She has nice tits but it&#039;s hard to get a boner when all your blood has turned cold with fear
&gt;&quot;You attacked me?&quot; she hisses
&gt;&quot;Uh, look I&#039;m sorry! I was just uh trying to get away from some people&quot; you whimper
&gt;&quot;I know what you are, soldier&quot;
&gt;Fucking great, the VC have a giant lizard on their team
&gt;Her face looks pretty angry, or maybe it&#039;s just the shape of her head?
&gt;Luckily, she calms herself after a moment
&gt;She sighs
&gt;&quot;I have not had company in a very long time&quot; she says
&gt;&quot;I forgave you for attacking me. You owe me&quot;
&gt;It&#039;s probably not a good time to point out how she broke a bone or two of yours
&gt;&quot;Alright, but I have to leave after&quot; you answer
&gt;She gestures back inside

&gt;What have you gotten yourself into?
&gt;Only like a day ago you were playing cards and shooting the piss at an army base
&gt;Now you&#039;re having tea time with a fucking lizard woman?
&gt;She offered you the stool, and sits crosslegged on the ground
&gt;She made you a hot drink of some sort in a firepit outside, and then just sat there staring at you
&gt;After a minute of this, you decide to break the ice
&gt;&quot;So, uh, what&#039;s your name?&quot; you stammer, spaghetti rations pouring out of your pockets
&gt;&quot;I have never had a name before. The locals call me thằn lằn với bộ ngực to. A bit too long for my taste.&quot;
&gt;She gives you a terrifying smile, with rows and rows of daggerlike teeth
&gt;&quot;Oh, well I&#039;m PFC Anon&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nice to meet you Anon. Care to tell me what you are up to all the way out here?&quot;
&gt;Is it a good idea to tell a hermit lizard lady about military operations? Is she actually with the VC?
&gt;&quot;I, uh, got lost in the heat of the moment. What do you think about the war?&quot; you inquire
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not a fighter, I don&#039;t interact with the natives. Whatever battles they are fighting are not my own&quot;
&gt;You raise an eyebrow and gesture to the gun on the wall
&gt;&quot;Oh that? That&#039;s just decoration. A trophy from some of the last people that attacked me. Aside from you of course. I&#039;m not even sure it still works, besides I have no idea how to use it.&quot;
&gt;You take a sip of the drink
&gt;Tastes pretty good for swamp water. Very herbal
&gt;&quot;Are there many of your kind around here?&quot; you ask
&gt;&quot;Nope. Just me. I like having the strongest overbite around, too&quot;
&gt;To prove her point, she opens her large jaws, and suddenly shuts them with a loud crack
&gt;You wince
&gt;&quot;Well uh, I should probably leave now. I&#039;ll be reported missing&quot; you say
&gt;The croc just huffs
&gt;&quot;Alright, but you&#039;re 13 kilometers from the nearest military camp I know of. Plus you got your brains rattled around a bit, and you have no weapons, you don&#039;t even have a shirt&quot;
&gt;Suddenly you feel very self conscious about some amazonian animal monster looking at you half naked
&gt;She doesn&#039;t seem to mind, and she leans forward, grinning savagely at you
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s alright Anon, you can stay for a bit, if you help me with something
&gt;Is this the part where she fucks you and then eats your head?
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re a soldier. I want you to show me how to use the gun. You do that for me, and I&#039;l show you the way back&quot; she states
&gt;Whew
&gt;&quot;Sure. It&#039;s not to hard, I&#039;ll just-&quot;
&gt;As you stand up, another splitting headache strikes, and you topple over, clutching your head
&gt;She kneels over you, but makes no move to touch you
&gt;&quot;I guess that is my fault, isn&#039;t it?&quot; she grumbles
&gt;She grabs you by the wrist and pulls you onto your feet, and leads you to the sleeping bag
&gt;&quot;Anon, you&#039;ve got enough on your plate for now. Rest&quot;
&gt;&quot;But...&quot;
&gt;&quot;Stay&quot; she commands, and walks right out of the tent
&gt;Well that&#039;s great
&gt;You&#039;ve been away from your unit for almost a day now, you were probably marked M.I.A.
&gt;Your fireteam leader must be pissed
&gt;Your headache is at full blast now, thinking is practically impossible
&gt;Aaaaauughhhh you would kill for some motrin
&gt;Your body finally takes pity on you, and you fall into darkness.

&gt;Waking up, you shake your head and realize it&#039;s the middle of the night
&gt;You must have been really out of it
&gt;It&#039;s super dark, can&#039;t see shit
&gt;You fish out your trusty lighter from your pants pocket and light it
&gt;Croc lady is fast asleep in the corner
&gt;She&#039;s curled up, almost like a dog, with her long meaty tail wrapped around her face
&gt;A bit of fresh air would probably help make you feel better, it&#039;s not like you would be able to fall back asleep again anyway
&gt;You step out of the hut, footsteps muffled by the sound of cicadas
&gt;The little gear you still had on you when you got lost was lying in a pile, right where she had left it
&gt;You spark your lighter and take a look
&gt;Your helmet, a cigarette carton, a few revolver speedloaders, grenades, spade, survival handbook, etc
&gt;Everything as it was, aside from your helmet, bent completely out of shape from her forceful attempt at wearing it earlier
&gt;That guide would probably be a good read right about now
&gt;You take it back inside to your sleeping bag and lie down
&gt;You idly page through the guide, not really paying attention to it
&gt;Most of the stuff you had already memorized
&gt;You just keep stealing glances at the exotic humanoid asleep a feet away from you
&gt;She&#039;s kind of cute actually, when she&#039;s not a large shape in the dark
&gt;Even if her jaw could crack your skull wide open

&gt;You wake up to the sound of gunshots
&gt;Shit! You had dozed off again and now you&#039;re being attacked
&gt;You scramble to your feet, and look around in a panic
&gt;Croc lady is nowhere to be seen
&gt;You sprint out the door, making a breal for it, to get stopped dead in your tracks
&gt;She&#039;s got her old rife out, and struggling to hold it correctly
&gt;In front of her is a crudely made wodden dummy, made of logs, with your heavilly dented helmet perched right on top
&gt;&quot;Morning Anon&quot; she says, noticing
&gt;&quot;I decided to get an early start. These things are quite unweildly for someone of my, ah, stature&quot;
&gt;&quot;You know, if I&#039;m going to teach you, I&#039;m going to need a name&quot; you say
&gt;&quot;Hmm, you come up with something. I don&#039;t mind&quot;
&gt;A quick thought flashes through your mind
&gt;&quot;How about Sierra?&quot;
&gt;Really? That&#039;s part of your fireteam&#039;s callsign, and she&#039;s not your fucking mascot
&gt;She gives you a very toothy grin
&gt;&quot;That will be adequate&quot;
&gt;Okay then
&gt;Sierra then shoves the rifle into your arms
&gt;&quot;Show me how it&#039;s done, Anon&quot;
&gt;Okay then
&gt;You&#039;re not the worst shot in the company, but you&#039;re no marksman, and this gun is quite unfamiliar to you
&gt;You&#039;ve gotta show her you&#039;re not completely useless, though
&gt;You lie down on your stomach, and line up the posts
&gt;You take a breath and hold it
&gt;BAM!
&gt;You missed completely
&gt;Way to go
&gt;As Sierra squints to if your shot landed on the dummy&#039;s body, you let out a few bursts, hitting the target straight on
&gt;Your old beaten helmet goes flying off and rolls down the bank and into the water
&gt;&quot;Burst fire. More shots down range means more chances of hitting your target, and controlled bursts allow you to maintain accuracy while firing. You don&#039;t need the precision of a sniper being an infantryman like me&quot; you lecture
&gt;Just some stuff you came up with on the fly
&gt;Sierra eats it up though, nodding and considering every word
&gt;You spend a few more minutes explaining basic marksmanship, alligning the sights, weapon operation, sight dialing to compensate for range
&gt;Eventually, you think it&#039;s time to give her another shot, literally
&gt;A quick search turns up your mangled mess of a helmet, and you put it back up top of the dummy
&gt;You hand her the gun, and instruct her to aim and fire
&gt;Sierra gingerly feeds her long clawed finger through the trigger guard, turns the safety off, and takes aim
&gt;CRACK!
&gt;That was not the sound of the gun firing, but the sound of the abused metal helmet exploding into shrapnel, scattering in all directions
&gt;Neither of you have time to duck, and a large sharp chunk goes straight into Sierra&#039;s stomach, knocking her flat
&gt;Oh FUCK
&gt;You race to her side and drop to your knees, expecting to see her in pain, or angry at the very least
&gt;Instead she is laughing like a madman
&gt;It&#039;s a bit concerning, as you could have very well been hurt too
&gt;There is no wound, that can&#039;t be
&gt;Are her scales really that hard?
&gt;&quot;These scales aren&#039;t just for show ya know&quot; she giggles
&gt;She playfully cracks her fist on her rock hard belly
&gt;&quot;A-are you really fucking buleltproof?&quot; you ask
&gt;&quot;Well I won&#039;t just sit there are let you shoot me, but it hurts a lot less to me than it would for you&quot; she says
&gt;Fair enough
&gt;&quot;How about we get you some food?&quot; she says
&gt;Come to think of it, you haven&#039;t eaten in long time
&gt;She gestures for you to wait, and carries the gun inside before returning with a crude looking spear and a net
&gt;She tosses the net to you, and leads you deeper into the swamp
&gt;After a while of uneventful wading through murky swamp water, you ask her what you&#039;re hunting for
&gt;&quot;Crocs, silly&quot;
&gt;But SHES a croc
&gt;Isn&#039;t that cannibalism?
&gt;This gets a heavy laugh from her
&gt;&quot;Not things like me, idiot. Proper chompy lizards. Would you eat a monkey if you had too?&quot;
&gt;Not really, no, but you keep that thought to yourself
&gt;Sierra stops abruptly, and looks around
&gt;&quot;Yes, this is a good spot&quot;she says
&gt;&quot;Now it&#039;s my turn to teach you something&quot;
&gt;Sierra lowers herself down into the water, until she is completely submerged and hidden
&gt;You feel a bit nervous, as she left you all alone in some swamp
&gt;There are mangroves sprouted all around you, offering many places for fish to hide
&gt;You still have the net, maybe you can use it
&gt;Before you can act, however, the water to your right explodes like someome threw a grenade in
&gt;Sierra threw an actual crocodile ten feet in the air wtf
&gt;She proceeds to tackle it while it is still stunned, and like a professional, she quickly sits on top and wraps her arms around it&#039;s jaws, preventing it from opening with her inhuman strength
&gt;The poor thing doesn&#039;t stand a chance, Sierra&#039;s full bodyweight pins it to the ground
&gt;She gives you a strained look
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t just stand there, Anon! Do something!&quot;
&gt;You pull your survival knife, and she lifts the actual croc&#039;s head up, exposing it&#039;s throat
&gt;A quick swipe, and a few moments later the crocodile stops moving, letting out it&#039;s last death spasms
&gt;Sierra rolls off the dead beast, and looks at you with pride
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m the apex predator around here, so don&#039;t get on my bad side!&quot; she smirks
&gt;You roll your eyes and start field dressing the dead croc

tbh its been a billion years since i last updated this and probably wont, since i dont really like how its turned out.
if you wanna continue it, go right ahead. i encourage it.</textarea>
