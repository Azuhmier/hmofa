&gt;5 months ago you ended up in a world of anthros
&gt;You weren&#039;t the only human of course, but you were still a rare sight
&gt;A restaurant in the city had hired you after a few weeks
&gt;They really admired your skill
&gt;And boy could you cook an amazing spaghetti bolognese
&gt;It didn&#039;t hurt that you didn&#039;t have fur to get in the food
&gt;The pay was enough for you to rent a decent apartment not too far from your work
&gt;And you still had a decent amount of money to do whatever with
&gt;Today is your first day off in a while and you were going to enjoy it

&gt;Nothing beats a cold glass of lemonade on a hot summer day
&gt;Luckily you had a little balcony with a view
&gt;You were just setting up a chair in the sun when you hear a knock at the door
&gt;A look through your peephole tells you who it is
&gt;A tall grizzly bear wearing slim fitting pants and shirt waits patiently on the other side
&gt;&quot;Oh hey Susan, come on in.&quot;
&gt;She squeezes in, barely shorter than the door frame
&gt;&quot;Can I get anything for you?&quot; you ask her as you open your fridge
&gt;&quot;Cream soda if you have it,&quot; she rumbles.
&gt;You chuckle
&gt;After the time she nearly threw a chair out the window, you make sure to keep some in your fridge
&gt;You toss her bottle and she pops the top off with a flick of her giant thumb
&gt;&quot;So what can I do for you&quot;

&gt;&quot;I was just wondering if I could use your balcony&quot;
&gt;Is that a blush you see
&gt;Her fur is brown enough that it&#039;s hard to tell
&gt;&quot;Sure I was just going out myself&quot; you gesture to the chair you were setting up
&gt;&quot;Thanks Anon&quot;
&gt;She grabs one of the folding chairs you have by the door on her way out
&gt;One flick and the chair is up
&gt;The chair sinks under her considerable weight as she flips out a pair of shades
&gt;She is almost pure muscle, you wonder how often she works out
&gt;You take your seat and take a sip of your lemonade
&gt;Your balcony gives you a view of the edge of the city and beyond
&gt;The roofs of suburban houses and rolling hills for miles
&gt;Days like these remind you why you like this place so much
&gt;Things hadn&#039;t always been this good though
&gt;Memories hit you

&gt;It was a couple days after you arrived
&gt;You were basically homeless
&gt;No money
&gt;No job
&gt;And no one wanted to hire a human
&gt;You were considered a freak, a fur-less disgrace
&gt;It was raining, you remember
&gt;With nothing but your jacket to stop the rain you were soaked
&gt;A pair of dogs walk by and you can hear them laughing at you
&gt;All you could do was glare at them
&gt;But that just made them laugh harder
&gt;Frustrated almost to the point of tears you sit down against the wall of the building
&gt;You feel a break in the rain and look up
&gt;There&#039;s an umbrella over you
&gt;and holding it is a bear

&gt;You sniffle
&gt;This is the first time someone has been kind to you since
&gt;well you aren&#039;t sure
&gt;She offers you a paw and you gladly take it
&gt;&quot;You look cold, let me get you something warm to eat&quot;
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s your name, human?&quot;
&gt;Her voice is deep, but oddly comforting
&gt;&quot;A-A-A-Anon&quot; It&#039;s hard to speak when you&#039;re shivering so much
&gt;&quot;My name is Susan,&quot; she continues &quot;It seems like you could use some help.&quot;
&gt;Making sure the umbrella stays over you, she walks you to her building
&gt;Stepping inside she shakes herself dry
&gt;As you walk to the elevator she strikes up a conversation with you
&gt;&quot;So, how long have you been here?&quot; She asks
&gt;The elevator doors open
&gt;&quot;Oh, about 4 or 5 days&quot; you respond as she hits the button for the 11th floor
&gt;As you take the elevator (this thing was slow) you talk about yourselves
&gt;Turns out she works as a news anchor for the local network
&gt;And while you don&#039;t have a job here, you used to work at EataBurger™
&gt;She tells you what it was like growing up in the city and not liking being cooped up
&gt;Whenever she got the chance, she&#039;d go outside for a walk or play with the neighbor&#039;s kids
&gt;You tell her about your more suburban upbringing
&gt;Video games and indoor activities were more of your kind of thing
&gt;Though you remember you joined a LARP group once
&gt;(You&#039;ll never tell anyone you did that. NEVER)
&gt;You continue to talk until the doors open on her floor

&gt;She pulls out a key ring and fumbles with the lock for a little bit
&gt;The door opens with a slight squeak as you enter
&gt;It&#039;s well furnished with everything you&#039;d expect, and then some
&gt;A leather couch faces a 40 inch tv on a stand
&gt;What is probably faux wood covers most of the floor
&gt;The exception is the bedroom which has soft looking carpeting
&gt;Some posters and paintings hang on the wall
&gt;She leads you into her sparkling kitchen and turns on her stove
&gt;Soup is simmering on the burner before you know it
&gt;&quot;Let me take that for you Anon; You must be cold&quot; She coaxes
&gt;Swapping your wet jacket for a warm blanket she makes sure you are comfortable
&gt;She hums a tune you don&#039;t know while hanging your jacket in the bathroom
&gt;The two of you chat a little while longer while the soup cooks
&gt;As she pours the soup into two bowls you realize what she&#039;s done
&gt;She got you out of the cold
&gt;Invited you into her house
&gt;And made food for you
&gt;A tear rolls down your cheek at that thought
&gt;&quot;Anon, don&#039;t cry please; I hate to see people cry.&quot; she protests
&gt;You can barely choke out a simple &quot;thank you&quot; through the lump in your throat

&gt;You spend the next couple of days in her guest bedroom at her request
&gt;A couple days rest and good food brings you back to normal
&gt;It isn&#039;t long before you feel ready to get back into the world
&gt;Susan surprises you by putting in a good word with a friend who works in a restaurant downtown
&gt;Before you know it you&#039;ve got an interview scheduled
&gt;You put on a smart looking outfit that Susan helped you buy (with the promise that you&#039;ll pay her back)
&gt;The interview goes great and you&#039;re hired on the spot
&gt;You start by washing dishes, but in a few weeks you&#039;re a full fledged chef
&gt;And that means you can afford your own place
&gt;Looking through the papers you find an ad for an apartment in the building
&gt;Though there are a lot of places you could go, you know that there&#039;s no place you&#039;d rather be
&gt;Had it not been for Susan&#039;s help, you might not have lasted your first week here
&gt;But now, you&#039;re the happiest you&#039;ve ever been

&gt;&quot;Hey Anon&quot;
&gt;Susan&#039;s voice brings you back to reality
&gt;&quot;Did you fall asleep?&quot; she looks a little worried
&gt;&quot;No, just reliving some memories.&quot; you say with a smile
&gt;&quot;Good ones I hope&quot;
&gt;&quot;They most certainly are&quot;
&gt;You raise your glass
&gt;&quot;To summer&quot;
&gt;&quot;To summer&quot; she agrees</textarea>
