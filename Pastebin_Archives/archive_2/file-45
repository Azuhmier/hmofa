        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;You are the survivor
&gt;Anon
&gt;It has been 3 years since you trapped Zahrah
&gt;That is how you met after all
&gt;You accidentally caught her in a snare you made
&gt;But now here she was holding your hand as you walked to the cabin
&gt;She was wearing a bright pick Hello kitty shirt that was stretched thin over her large breasts and white Underwear
&gt;You never could convince her to wear pants
&gt;Then again you hadn&#039;t tried very hard either
&gt;All 3 and a half feet of her loved you
&gt;And you loved her
&gt;Together through scavenging and trial and error you had modernized the cabin together
&gt;You had power, running water, heating and air conditioning
&gt;You were coming home from setting traps and a casting a few nets in a stream nearby
&gt;Salmon season
&gt;You look down at her and smile
&gt;You loved every inch of this wolverine
&gt;Even if there weren&#039;t many inches
&gt;she looks up and smiles
&gt;&quot;Whats up Anon?&quot; she says squeezing your hand gently with her paw
&gt;Her glasses glint with the light from the setting sun
&gt;&quot;Just thinking about how we met and how nice life is with you&quot; you say smiling
&gt;&quot;Getting soft on me now?&quot; she says with a playful tease 
&gt;&quot;Nah just...appreciating it all&quot;
&gt;&quot;This new life, the house...you&quot; you say glancing up 
&gt;You breathe in
&gt;The cool fall air blows gently carrying a smell of earth and leaves
&gt;She squeezes your hand tight
&gt;Its been great here since you came here but... I want to ask you something too&quot; she says
&gt;You look down at her
&gt;&quot;Whats up?&quot;
&gt;Her ears flicker gently
&gt;&quot;What you don&#039;t need to be embarrassed around me you know&quot; you say with a small laugh
&gt;&quot;Can I---can I get onto your shoulders? I want to see what its like to be...tall&quot; she says looking at her footpaws
&gt;You chuckle a bit
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s it? and here I thought you were going to ask me something hard, like kill a bear&quot;
&gt;She punches your leg
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m serious!&quot; she pouts
&gt;&quot;Fine that&#039;s easy&quot; you say as you kneel down
&gt;&quot;Climb up tiny&quot;
&gt;She climbs up on your back then wraps her thighs around your head
&gt;Extra thicc comes to mind
&gt;You wrap your hands around her thighs and stand up slowly
&gt;You stand for a bit to get accustomed to the weight
&gt;She doesn&#039;t weigh too much
&gt;You begin walking
&gt;You can feel her twisting and looking around
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s like a whole other world up here!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yea I guess&quot;
&gt;&quot;I CAN SEE FOREVER!&quot; she shouts out kicking her footpaws out a little
&gt;You laugh and walk the half mile back to the cabin while she laughs and enjoys the view


&gt;Its night
&gt;You have the cabin shut tight and Zahrah is making dinner, she&#039;s having a chunk of almost raw deer meat
&gt;You decided to change things up and have some fish you caught
&gt;You don&#039;t know what kind of fish it is, but whatever you&#039;ll eat it
&gt;And you have seasoning from scavenging
&gt;Lemon garlic salt specifically
&gt;She brings you a plate of the fish and you reach into the fridge and grab a Dr.Pepper™
&gt;You had found these in town and had always liked it
&gt;You open it up take a nice refreshing drink and then set it down on the table next to the couch
&gt;&quot;What movie do you want to watch tonight&quot; you ask
&gt;&quot;Uhm... What&#039;s that one where it rains food and the nerd saves the world?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Cloudy with a chance of meatballs?&quot; you ask as you riffle through the DVD stacks
&gt;&quot;Yea that one!&quot; she says with a happy bounce
&gt;You pop it into the DVD Player and turn on the TV
&gt;You had scavenged the TV and DVD player after you got power to the cabin
&gt;There was no cable or shows anymore but there were DVDs
&gt;Zahrah enjoyed Kid movies like this
&gt;You sit down and chow down on your food, as the opening credits roll and the movie starts
&gt;&quot;He reminds me of you&quot; Zahrah says as she chews her food
&gt;You look at the nerdy guy making his own theme music as he runs into his house
&gt;&quot;Seriously? him? Naw I&#039;m much cooler than that&quot; you say as you eat
&gt;&quot;Nah, that&#039;s you to a T&quot; she says kicking her legs and laughing
&gt;You reach over and flick her on the ear
&gt;&quot;Ow hey!&quot; 
&gt;She growls and Pounces at you
&gt;You catch her as she flies at you and start tickling her
&gt;&quot;NO NO NO NOT FAIR&quot; She Squeals as you tickle her sides and thighs
&gt;&quot;NO STOP OR ILL PISS MYSELF!&quot; 
&gt;With that you stop and let her go
&gt;She sits in your lap, panting slightly
&gt;She then turns around on you and whacks your nose softly
&gt;&quot;OW&quot;
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s for flicking my ear and tickling me&quot;
&gt;She then kisses you
&gt;&quot;And that&#039;s because i love you&quot;
&gt;You smile and kiss her again and put your hands on her hips
&gt;You feel her tongue push tentatively into your mouth 
&gt;You push it back with yours and rub your hands down her soft thighs
&gt;She breaks the kiss and raises her arms
&gt;You pull her shirt up and off her
&gt;You kiss again and cup her Orange sized breasts and squeeze them gently
&gt;She moans into your mouth and grinds against you
&gt;She then tries, and fails to pull your shirt off you
&gt;&quot;Goddam you and your lanky ass arms&quot;
&gt;You take off the shirt the rest of the way and she slides off your lap 
&gt;You reach over and pull her panties off 
&gt;You stand up and pull of your pants and underwear
&gt;She gently pushes you into a sitting position and crawls on to your lap
&gt;You slide your right hand down her body to her lower lips
&gt;You rub them gently and slowly before parting them 
&gt;She moans and places a paw to your cheek
&gt;&quot;Mmhmmm just like that Anon&quot; she whispers
&gt;You rub her clit softly and begin tracing small circles around it
&gt;She gasps and grabs your left and and brings it to her breast
&gt;You grope and squeeze it gently
&gt;&quot;Mmmmm fuck yea&quot; she moans
&gt;You push one finger into her and begin slowly fingering her
&gt;Her wetness is marvelous and tight
&gt;You push a second finger in and press your thumb to her clit
&gt;&quot;H-harder Anon- Do it harder&quot; she gasps 
&gt;You speed up and keep Kneading her wonder breast 
&gt;&gt;&quot;Ah ah AHHHH&quot; she cries 
&gt;Her legs slam shut on your hand and you feel her walls convulsing with pleasure
&gt;You wait a moment then pull your finger out of her
&gt;She grabs your arm and pulls your fingers to her mouth 
&gt;She licks them clean
&gt;&quot;Ready?&quot; you ask
&gt;&quot;Mhmmm give it to me Anon&quot; she says as she grinds your erection with her ass
&gt;You lift her by her waist slightly 
&gt;She reaches a paw down and stokes you a few times before positioning you against her soft wet lips
&gt;You lower her slowly
&gt;As you lower her she presses her head against your chest
&gt;You can already feel her shivering
&gt;Its making her walls tighten on your shaft
&gt;You lift her slightly and then lower her again
&gt;&quot;Yea Anon keep going&quot; she moans as she begins groping her own breasts
&gt;You keep going gradually speeding up 
&gt;She&#039;s moaning and gasping
&gt;You begin bucking into her for extra force as you get close
&gt;She shutters and you feel her walls clamp down on you as she orgasms on you
&gt;The extra tightness pushes you over the edge and you release into her wetness
&gt;You lean back on the couch and pant
&gt;She leans back and puts her head against your chest
&gt;&quot;I love you Anon&quot;
&gt;&quot;I Love you too Zahrah&quot;</textarea>
