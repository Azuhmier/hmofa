            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s nearly midnight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You, an amateur hiker, are wandering the woods for lack of anything better to do tonight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you walk, you soak in the calming sounds of the wilderness around you.  Crickets chirping... owls hooting... distant wolves howling at the moon... rhythmic chanting interspersed with bleating...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait.  What?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your mellow hike is interrupted by what sounds like some kind of twisted prayer echoing through the trees.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Curiosity gets the better of you, so you follow the sound to a nearby clearing.  You peek through the bushes...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What the fuck?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A crowd of hooded cultists circles a flat stone altar.  Though you can&#039;t see much, it seems that they&#039;re wearing... horns?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The largest of them suddenly stops and holds up a hand.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They turn and point at you, then speak in a low, mystical voice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come, o observer.  I feel your presence amongst us.  You cannot hide in the darkness.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well shit.  Guess you don&#039;t have a choice.  You slowly make your way down to them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once you get close, they stop walking and stare silently.  Some murmur to one another.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...what is it?  I think... it&#039;s a...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For some reason, you begin to suspect that the horns are actually... real.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The apparent leader approaches, their robe obscuring their entire body.  After a lengthy pause, they again speak.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Why hath you come here tonight, traveler?  Do you know what night it is...?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shake your head, and manage to respond.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I... was just hiking.  Sorry to disturb you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The leader stares silently, their hooded robe obscuring their face entirely...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Until they suddenly throw it off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To your shock, standing before you is a... goat woman?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She has a perfect hourglass figure; wide hips and a prodigious bust offset by a thin waist.  She wears nothing more than what seems to be ceremonial jewelry and a patient smile.  Her emerald green eyes glint in the moonlight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The wind blows her short grey fur playfully, as well as her long, drooping ears.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well, traveler, since you do not know the day, I shall enlighten you.  Tonight, the goddess Capra demands an offering.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You blink in shock a few times.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;O-offering?!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yes, an offering... of love.  The most... physical kind of love.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lightbulbs go off in your head.  She chuckles at your expression, then gestures dramatically.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Suddenly, all the other cultists strip, revealing that each one is a goat woman bearing various attractive figures.  Some are hourglasses like their leader.  Others are more bottom or top heavy.  Still more are lean and lithe, with muscular, athletic builds.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It is fortunate that you are here, o traveler, as it seems we are missing a vital element to tonight&#039;s ritual...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles as your heart sinks.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are the only male around.  The cultists eye you up expectantly, their bare bodies casting shadows upon you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait a minute.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why should you bail these women out? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Presumably, they knew this ritual was coming, so why didn&#039;t they just bring a man along?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Putting on your best poker face, you draw yourself up to your full height, then approach the leader.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stares, tail twitching with anticipation.  Her serene smile lingers on her face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You clear your throat authoritatively.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;No way.  You should have thought of that beforehand.  I&#039;m not getting involved.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stares silently, expression unreadable for a moment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her followers do the same, some idly stroking their slits as though priming themselves for you.  One cultist seems to get a bit TOO excited, letting out a cry of pleasure that bounces off the trees surrounding the altar.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually, the priestess speaks in the same serene tone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;&#039;Twas not a question, o traveler. You WILL aid us in this ritual, in our offering to Capra.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She steps forward, green eyes burning a hole in you despite her smile.  As she walks, her hips sway seductively; her impressive bust bounces in time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You slowly retreat from her advances, not wanting to participate in her ritual...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Only to back into one of her followers, who eagerly rests her furry breasts atop your head.  They&#039;re surprisingly... heavy.  But the fur is so very soft...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The cultist whispers in monotone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Your love will bring us prosperity, human.  Please, grant it to us freely and earnestly.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull away from the eerie goat woman, with her frowning and letting off a sad groan.  As you watch, she plunges a hand down to her nethers, apparently attempting to relieve her tension.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you look around, you slowly realize something:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re surrounded.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If you could find an opening to run, where are you even gonna go?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Apparently, nowhere.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a snap from the priestess, the circle of she-goats slowly tightens, each one advancing on you with a faint smile on her lips.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They each do their best to entice you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some bounce their breasts tantalizingly, the teats wobbling frantically in the moonlight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Others mime all sorts of lewd acts, some of which draw a blush to your cheeks just to imagine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still others decide to pair off, pulling their partner into lustful kisses.  You vaguely wonder if that alone would satisfy their ritual...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The priestess chuckles as she looks around at her followers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Look upon us, o traveler.  See what we can offer you?  I can sense that our beauty enticed you... why not embrace your desires?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...you&#039;d be lying if you said all the displays weren&#039;t getting to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A fact that isn&#039;t at all lost on the advancing horde.  They redouble their efforts, some of them succumbing to their lust and collapsing into frantically plunging their fingers into themselves.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s enough to have you popping an inopportune boner.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The priestess eyes your traitorous bulge with a self-satisfied smirk, her eyes twinkling.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ah, seems that your body knows what must be done. May your mind catch up soon, o foolish traveler.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She steps forwards, swaying her wide hips exaggeratedly and allowing her sizable chest to bounce freely.  In the moonlight, light pink nipples peek playfully through her fur.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her emerald eyes meet yours, burning with an intense desire despite her serene, ethereal attitude.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She runs a hand along her impressive curves, tracing a perfect hourglass.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;&#039;Tis a shame, truly, that a strapping, virile male like yourself would willingly deprive thyself of such potential blessings as these, o traveler...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She takes another step, and begins to slowly massage her own chest.  Her followers take note, the smaller-chested of them barely concealing their envy.  She chuckles and speaks again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I see your desire, o elusive traveler, burning behind your eyes. You wish very much to aid us, do you not? And yet, some foolish part of you denies this. Why? Why would you allow this divine opportunity to pass you by?  Succumb to your wishes, and allow us to grant you our adoration...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She takes one more step, her breasts bouncing once more, then motions for her followers to halt.  Most comply, though some are too preoccupied with pleasuring themselves to pay any mind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The priestess is now close enough to grab you, if she desired.  However, her composure suggests she wouldn&#039;t do such a thing.  That said...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re not entirely certain that she wouldn&#039;t do so if you continue to deny her advances.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She continues to stare into your eyes, again gently tracing the hourglass shape of her body with her fingertips.  She lets her fingers wander, eventually brushing them against a stiffening nipple.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You gulp anxiously, and finally work up the nerve to speak.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You have a point.  I can&#039;t deny that I want to... help. But, if we&#039;re doing this...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You suddenly tackle the priestess to the ground, prompting a stunned gasp from the watching cultists.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;However, she acts as if this was all part of her plan.  She coos happily, speaking words in a tongue you have never heard.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...we&#039;re doing it on my terms.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before she can respond, you begin thrusting into her rapidly.  The cultists begin to chant again as you realize that you are laying atop the stone altar.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The priestess remains remarkably serene, all things considered, but her followers are whipped into a masturbatory frenzy.  Beyond her ethereal detachment, you see something in her eyes...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Love.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bleats of joy fill the air as you rapidly pick up the pace.  The cultists intersperse their chanting with crys of ecstasy and cheers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The priestess speaks again, this time through panting.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;O beloved traveler.  Please, do as you wish with me.  For Capra.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You allow your hands to explore her body, to her apparent delight.  One hand travels beneath her, brushing against both her warm fur and the cold stone altar.  You eventually grasp her rear firmly, feeling her tail wag happily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The other hand snakes up to her prodigious bust, kneading her breasts deftly.  She maintains her detached composure, smiling and only occasionally letting a pant or moan crack her facade.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you continue, you feel your climax approaching rapidly.  You try to warn her, but cannot speak for your own arousal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She merely nods.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Do as you must, o generous traveler.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Suddenly, your mind is filled with emerald fireworks.  All you can feel is pleasure...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And above all else, love.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The priestess smiles once more as you unload within her.  Once you finish, you collapse into her awaiting arms.  She gently kisses you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Wonderful. O loving traveler, thy offering is appreciated...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You start to rise, but she doesn&#039;t let go.  You swear her green eyes glint.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...but alas, &#039;tis not enough. You have only provided one of many needed offerings.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Comprehension dawns upon you as she allows you to rise.

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;It&#039;s nearly midnight.
&gt;You, an amateur hiker, are wandering the woods for lack of anything better to do tonight.
&gt;As you walk, you soak in the calming sounds of the wilderness around you.  Crickets chirping... owls hooting... distant wolves howling at the moon... rhythmic chanting interspersed with bleating...
&gt;Wait.  What?
&gt;Your mellow hike is interrupted by what sounds like some kind of twisted prayer echoing through the trees.
&gt;Curiosity gets the better of you, so you follow the sound to a nearby clearing.  You peek through the bushes...
&gt;What the fuck?
&gt;A crowd of hooded cultists circles a flat stone altar.  Though you can&#039;t see much, it seems that they&#039;re wearing... horns?
&gt;The largest of them suddenly stops and holds up a hand.
&gt;They turn and point at you, then speak in a low, mystical voice.
&gt;&quot;Come, o observer.  I feel your presence amongst us.  You cannot hide in the darkness.&quot;
&gt;Well shit.  Guess you don&#039;t have a choice.  You slowly make your way down to them.
&gt;Once you get close, they stop walking and stare silently.  Some murmur to one another.
&gt;&quot;...what is it?  I think... it&#039;s a...&quot;
&gt;For some reason, you begin to suspect that the horns are actually... real.
&gt;The apparent leader approaches, their robe obscuring their entire body.  After a lengthy pause, they again speak.
&gt;&quot;Why hath you come here tonight, traveler?  Do you know what night it is...?&quot;
&gt;You shake your head, and manage to respond.
&gt;&quot;I... was just hiking.  Sorry to disturb you.&quot;
&gt;The leader stares silently, their hooded robe obscuring their face entirely...
&gt;Until they suddenly throw it off.
&gt;To your shock, standing before you is a... goat woman?
&gt;She has a perfect hourglass figure; wide hips and a prodigious bust offset by a thin waist.  She wears nothing more than what seems to be ceremonial jewelry and a patient smile.  Her emerald green eyes glint in the moonlight.
&gt;The wind blows her short grey fur playfully, as well as her long, drooping ears.
&gt;&quot;Well, traveler, since you do not know the day, I shall enlighten you.  Tonight, the goddess Capra demands an offering.&quot;
&gt;You blink in shock a few times.
&gt;&quot;O-offering?!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes, an offering... of love.  The most... physical kind of love.&quot;
&gt;Lightbulbs go off in your head.  She chuckles at your expression, then gestures dramatically.
&gt;Suddenly, all the other cultists strip, revealing that each one is a goat woman bearing various attractive figures.  Some are hourglasses like their leader.  Others are more bottom or top heavy.  Still more are lean and lithe, with muscular, athletic builds.
&gt;&quot;It is fortunate that you are here, o traveler, as it seems we are missing a vital element to tonight&#039;s ritual...&quot;
&gt;She smiles as your heart sinks.
&gt;You are the only male around.  The cultists eye you up expectantly, their bare bodies casting shadows upon you.

&gt;Wait a minute.
&gt;Why should you bail these women out? 
&gt;Presumably, they knew this ritual was coming, so why didn&#039;t they just bring a man along?
&gt;Putting on your best poker face, you draw yourself up to your full height, then approach the leader.
&gt;She stares, tail twitching with anticipation.  Her serene smile lingers on her face.
&gt;You clear your throat authoritatively.
&gt;&quot;No way.  You should have thought of that beforehand.  I&#039;m not getting involved.&quot;
&gt;She stares silently, expression unreadable for a moment.
&gt;Her followers do the same, some idly stroking their slits as though priming themselves for you.  One cultist seems to get a bit TOO excited, letting out a cry of pleasure that bounces off the trees surrounding the altar.
&gt;Eventually, the priestess speaks in the same serene tone.
&gt;&quot;&#039;Twas not a question, o traveler. You WILL aid us in this ritual, in our offering to Capra.&quot;
&gt;She steps forward, green eyes burning a hole in you despite her smile.  As she walks, her hips sway seductively; her impressive bust bounces in time.
&gt;You slowly retreat from her advances, not wanting to participate in her ritual...
&gt;Only to back into one of her followers, who eagerly rests her furry breasts atop your head.  They&#039;re surprisingly... heavy.  But the fur is so very soft...
&gt;The cultist whispers in monotone.
&gt;&quot;Your love will bring us prosperity, human.  Please, grant it to us freely and earnestly.&quot;
&gt;You pull away from the eerie goat woman, with her frowning and letting off a sad groan.  As you watch, she plunges a hand down to her nethers, apparently attempting to relieve her tension.
&gt;As you look around, you slowly realize something:
&gt;You&#039;re surrounded.
&gt;If you could find an opening to run, where are you even gonna go?

&gt;Apparently, nowhere.
&gt;With a snap from the priestess, the circle of she-goats slowly tightens, each one advancing on you with a faint smile on her lips.
&gt;They each do their best to entice you.
&gt;Some bounce their breasts tantalizingly, the teats wobbling frantically in the moonlight.
&gt;Others mime all sorts of lewd acts, some of which draw a blush to your cheeks just to imagine.
&gt;Still others decide to pair off, pulling their partner into lustful kisses.  You vaguely wonder if that alone would satisfy their ritual...
&gt;The priestess chuckles as she looks around at her followers.
&gt;&quot;Look upon us, o traveler.  See what we can offer you?  I can sense that our beauty enticed you... why not embrace your desires?&quot;
&gt;...you&#039;d be lying if you said all the displays weren&#039;t getting to you.
&gt;A fact that isn&#039;t at all lost on the advancing horde.  They redouble their efforts, some of them succumbing to their lust and collapsing into frantically plunging their fingers into themselves.
&gt;It&#039;s enough to have you popping an inopportune boner.
&gt;The priestess eyes your traitorous bulge with a self-satisfied smirk, her eyes twinkling.
&gt;&quot;Ah, seems that your body knows what must be done. May your mind catch up soon, o foolish traveler.&quot;
&gt;She steps forwards, swaying her wide hips exaggeratedly and allowing her sizable chest to bounce freely.  In the moonlight, light pink nipples peek playfully through her fur.
&gt;Her emerald eyes meet yours, burning with an intense desire despite her serene, ethereal attitude.
&gt;She runs a hand along her impressive curves, tracing a perfect hourglass.
&gt;&quot;&#039;Tis a shame, truly, that a strapping, virile male like yourself would willingly deprive thyself of such potential blessings as these, o traveler...&quot;
&gt;She takes another step, and begins to slowly massage her own chest.  Her followers take note, the smaller-chested of them barely concealing their envy.  She chuckles and speaks again.
&gt;&quot;I see your desire, o elusive traveler, burning behind your eyes. You wish very much to aid us, do you not? And yet, some foolish part of you denies this. Why? Why would you allow this divine opportunity to pass you by?  Succumb to your wishes, and allow us to grant you our adoration...&quot;

&gt;She takes one more step, her breasts bouncing once more, then motions for her followers to halt.  Most comply, though some are too preoccupied with pleasuring themselves to pay any mind.
&gt;The priestess is now close enough to grab you, if she desired.  However, her composure suggests she wouldn&#039;t do such a thing.  That said...
&gt;You&#039;re not entirely certain that she wouldn&#039;t do so if you continue to deny her advances.
&gt;She continues to stare into your eyes, again gently tracing the hourglass shape of her body with her fingertips.  She lets her fingers wander, eventually brushing them against a stiffening nipple.
&gt;You gulp anxiously, and finally work up the nerve to speak.
&gt;&quot;You have a point.  I can&#039;t deny that I want to... help. But, if we&#039;re doing this...&quot;
&gt;You suddenly tackle the priestess to the ground, prompting a stunned gasp from the watching cultists.
&gt;However, she acts as if this was all part of her plan.  She coos happily, speaking words in a tongue you have never heard.
&gt;&quot;...we&#039;re doing it on my terms.&quot;
&gt;Before she can respond, you begin thrusting into her rapidly.  The cultists begin to chant again as you realize that you are laying atop the stone altar.
&gt;The priestess remains remarkably serene, all things considered, but her followers are whipped into a masturbatory frenzy.  Beyond her ethereal detachment, you see something in her eyes...
&gt;Love.
&gt;Bleats of joy fill the air as you rapidly pick up the pace.  The cultists intersperse their chanting with crys of ecstasy and cheers.
&gt;The priestess speaks again, this time through panting.
&gt;&quot;O beloved traveler.  Please, do as you wish with me.  For Capra.&quot;
&gt;You allow your hands to explore her body, to her apparent delight.  One hand travels beneath her, brushing against both her warm fur and the cold stone altar.  You eventually grasp her rear firmly, feeling her tail wag happily.
&gt;The other hand snakes up to her prodigious bust, kneading her breasts deftly.  She maintains her detached composure, smiling and only occasionally letting a pant or moan crack her facade.
&gt;As you continue, you feel your climax approaching rapidly.  You try to warn her, but cannot speak for your own arousal.
&gt;She merely nods.
&gt;&quot;Do as you must, o generous traveler.&quot;
&gt;Suddenly, your mind is filled with emerald fireworks.  All you can feel is pleasure...
&gt;And above all else, love.
&gt;The priestess smiles once more as you unload within her.  Once you finish, you collapse into her awaiting arms.  She gently kisses you.
&gt;&quot;Wonderful. O loving traveler, thy offering is appreciated...&quot;
&gt;You start to rise, but she doesn&#039;t let go.  You swear her green eyes glint.
&gt;&quot;...but alas, &#039;tis not enough. You have only provided one of many needed offerings.&quot;
&gt;Comprehension dawns upon you as she allows you to rise.  You look around as the cultists begin to form a line...

&gt;One by one, you provide an offering to each and every member of the cult.
&gt;Some require very little stimulus to satisfy.  One particular woman practically dissolves the moment your hand touches her breasts.
&gt;Others are more high maintenance; a particularly large, strong one flips you onto your back before riding you into submission.  It&#039;s only when you finally release within her that she dismounts, collapsing in an exhausted heap.
&gt;Despite the sheer number of rounds, you never feel exhausted.  The priestess hovers nearby, serene smile never wavering.  She speaks words of love and encouragement each time you finish off a cultist.
&gt;&quot;Another appreciated offering, o beloved one.  Thy aid will be remembered for aeons.&quot;
&gt;More and more women approach, desire evident from their already-wet nethers.
&gt;One rather flexible one performs exotic contortions you&#039;ve only ever seen in the wildest of your dreams.  Eventually though, she allows you to penetrate her just as you reach your climax.
&gt;Indeed, no matter what preference they may have, each cultist refuses to allow you to cum anywhere but within her womanhood.
&gt;No matter if she uses her tongue, her breasts, or in one case even her hooves to bring you to the edge, each and every one insists on the same ending.
&gt;Eventually, you reach the final cultist.  Once you finally complete your work, you fall asleep nigh-instantly.

&gt;You awaken the next morning atop to the sound of birds singing.  You blink a few times, then run your hand along your soft, furred mattress.
&gt;Wait a minute.  Now you remember what happened last night.
&gt;You look down to see that you are lying atop a pile of easily 20 goat women.
&gt;Each one still shows signs of your &quot;contributions&quot; to their cause, leaking your seed from their satisfied slits.
&gt;The priestess lays directly beneath you, smiling lovingly as you rest atop her stomach.  Her emerald eyes glimmer happily.
&gt;She pulls you close and whispers.
&gt;&quot;Thank you, o beloved human. With your help, and Capra&#039;s blessing... we shall each bear the fruits of your labor.&quot;
&gt;Your blood goes cold as her words sink in.
&gt;She beams, eyes twinkling once more.
&gt;&quot;W-what do you mean?&quot;
&gt;She kisses your forehead with a chuckle.
&gt;&quot;Your children, o beloved human.&quot;
&gt;You splutter in shock.
&gt;&quot;B- how?  How?  You&#039;re goats, I&#039;m a human!  There-&quot;
&gt;...several questions come to mind.
&gt;&quot;There were 20 of you... how did I keep going?  How was I able to- to-&quot;
&gt;The priestess smiles once more.
&gt;&quot;To... grant each of us the gift of child?  &#039;&#039;Twas all Capra, my love.  All Capra&#039;s will.&quot;
&gt;&quot;But... how do you know that?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Is it not obvious, o beloved?&quot;
&gt;The world drops away beneath you.  You find yourself in a sea of emerald light, adrift with the priestess.
&gt;No.
&gt;With Capra.
&gt;She embraces you with earnest love.
&gt;&quot;Thank you, o follower.  Thank you.&quot;</textarea>
