        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;October 31st - Halloween
&gt;Athena is hyped
&gt;She went out with the girls to pick out matching costumes (you weren&#039;t invited)
&gt;Now you&#039;re in her messy bedroom, looking with disbelief at the costumes hanging on the edge of her wardrobe
&gt;Two costumes, both labelled &quot;Sexy Caveman Outfit&quot;
&gt;You look at Athena, who has a predatory grin on her face
&quot;We both know I&#039;m not wearing that.&quot;
&gt;She giggles, and advances on you
&gt;You try to dodge her paws grabbing at you, but in vain, as she soon has her strong arms wrapped around you in a bear hug
&gt;&quot;Wear it for me Anon, c&#039;mon. We won&#039;t have to go outside in it, but the girls are coming round later and they&#039;ll be disappointed if you don&#039;t...&quot;
&gt;You sigh deeply, knowing you can&#039;t say no now
&gt;Athena probably wouldn&#039;t force you, but you really don&#039;t want to disappoint a pack of hyena girls
&gt;Still, nothing worse than not letting her have her fun
&quot;But I don&#039;t wannaaaa!&quot; you whine
&gt;She giggles
&gt;&quot;I wasn&#039;t asking, Anon~&quot;
&gt;With incredible speed, she flings you onto the bed and all but tears your pants and underwear off
&gt;Ignoring your protests, she grabs one of the two costumes, and pushes the skimpy bottom half up and in place, cheekily laying her paws on your growing erection as she does so
&gt;&quot;There, that&#039;s not so bad, is it?&quot;
&gt;You pout at her, and silently allow her to take your shirt off
&gt;&quot;Oh, don&#039;t be such a baby, you&#039;re gonna look so cute in this!&quot;
&gt;She slips the top on, which just barely covers your nipples
&gt;If there&#039;s a bright side, it&#039;ll be how Athena looks in this thing - it&#039;s basically all strings
&gt;&quot;Hehe, you look adorable!&quot;
&gt;She holds both hands and hoists you up, then drags you towards the mirror on her wardrobe
&gt;You&#039;re hardly covered at all, and this skimpy, animal-print outfit makes you look silly
&gt;Your cock, which is now hard as a rock at getting manhandled by Athena, is poking out of the tiny panties
&gt;You don&#039;t really agree with her that you look good, but the smile on her face is worth it
&gt;&quot;Ooh, the girls are gonna love this!&quot;

&gt;You&#039;re not exactly thrilled to get paraded in front of the others in this outfit, but if it makes Athena happy then it&#039;s all good
&gt;And it&#039;s totally worth it, is what you think once you see her in her matching getup
&gt;The curves of her solid body are accented by the skimpy outfit
&gt;Virtually nothing is left to the imagination - just enough to make it very tantalising
&gt;Noticing you checking her out, she smiles and wiggles her ass for you
&gt;&quot;Like what you see, cutie?&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t need to respond, your face says it all
&gt;She chuckles and turns round, holding you close before kissing your nose softly
&gt;&quot;You don&#039;t have to do anything you don&#039;t want to. It&#039;s just kind of a turn-on to show you off.&quot;
&quot;I can&#039;t really argue with that.&quot;
&gt;She gives you a squeeze and another beautiful smile
&gt;&quot;God I love you&quot;
&quot;I love you too, Athena&quot;
&gt;You stay cuddled up to each other for a little while, before heading to the front room to wait for the others
&gt;It&#039;s not long before they start to arrive
&gt;Razor arrives first, dressed in a sexy cop outfit
&gt;Upon seeing you opening the door for her, she squees at you loudly
&gt;&quot;Ahhh! Athena he&#039;s so adorable!!&quot;
&gt;She pets your hair roughly and fist-bumps Athena
&gt;&quot;How&#039;d you get him to wear this?&quot;
&gt;Athena grins evilly back at her
&gt;&quot;Easy, I forced him.&quot;
&gt;Razor cackles as Athena pulls you in close for a hug
&gt;&quot;Am I the first one here? I bullied my dad into buying me a few sixpacks, here.&quot;
&gt;She comes in, lugging a reusable plastic bag filled with beer
&gt;&quot;Yeah, just the three of us for now, Rae.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sick.&quot;
&gt;She dumps herself on the couch, and pulls out three beers, one in one hand and two in the other
&gt;While cracking open one for herself one-handed, she tosses the other two to you and Athena
&gt;&quot;So, anyone bringing any boys, or is this gonna be another clam-fest?&quot;
&gt;Athena shrugs as she sits on the opposite side of the couch, leaving enough room for you to get in nice and snug next to her
&gt;&quot;Pepper might bring her boyfriend, and maybe Squeaks will bring that local boy. Cris tells me she tried to ask a human dude out but he was too scared or something.&quot;
&gt;Razor chuckles softly, and ruffles your hair
&gt;&quot;Not like your boyfe here, he&#039;s good as gold. Is that...?&quot;
&gt;Oh shit, she&#039;s looking downwards
&gt;Athena grins, and gently runs the claws on her left paw down your exposed cock, making you shiver in simultaneous embarrassment and arousal
&gt;&quot;Look but don&#039;t touch, Rae.&quot;
&gt;You let out a ragged moan, and Razor actually blushes
&gt;&quot;Fuck you bitch, you&#039;re making me jealous&quot;
&gt;Athena cackles and stops her groping, instead ruffling your hair and pulling you in close for a hug
&gt;Suddenly there&#039;s loud thumping coming from the door
&gt;&quot;That&#039;ll be the girls,&quot; Athena says
&gt;She turns to you, and gives you a wide grin
&gt;&quot;Hey, you should go let them in!&quot;
&gt;You give her your best &#039;are you serious&#039; look
&gt;She smiles at you and pulls you in close to whisper in your ear
&gt;&quot;Do it for me, darling&quot;
&gt;She kisses your ear and neck softly and ruffles your hair again
&gt;You can&#039;t say no to her, this is turning into a serious weakness
&quot;Alright, I&#039;ll go let them in.&quot;
&gt;Razor whoops, and Athena gives you a gentle smile
&gt;Only to slap your ass the instant you turn to go get the door
&gt;You turn back and shoot her a glare, which she meets with a cheeky look and a wink
&gt;Heading for the door, you walk like a man about to be executed, ready to let in the loud hyena pack that you can hear getting impatient through the thin walls</textarea>
