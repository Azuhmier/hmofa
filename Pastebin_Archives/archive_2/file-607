Final countdown for hyperspace entry. Ten... nine... eight...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grit your teeth and cinch your safety harness just that little bit tighter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is by no means your first hyperspace jump, but the feminine voice of the ship&#039;s computer calmly reciting the pre-jump checklist always gives you a sense of anxiety.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not that there was much to worry about.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The courier vessel&#039;s hull was an innocuous shape, directly copied from the hulls of literally millions of such courier vessels that plied the trade routes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But it was much more cramped within, to accommodate the extra engine power and armor that belied its true purpose.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is a hell of a valuable cargo you&#039;re carrying, the kind that shadowy agents of alien governments would kill for.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But once you&#039;re clear of the planetary systems and in hyperspace, its not as though they&#039;d be able to catch you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Three... two... one... initiating.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yeah, whoever programmed that computer couldn&#039;t pick a more interesting word than that, could they.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Out of habit you reflexively close your eyes as a powerful thrum builds throughout the hull, and the courier vessel&#039;s drives propel you beyond light, beyond reason, into hyperspace.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hyperspace insertion achieved. Calculated transit time is one hour and thirty-seven minutes.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once that transition between realities is achieved, the environment becomes much more tolerable.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You unclip yourself from the pilot&#039;s couch, the navigational computer will handle the hyperspace transit without any further intervention from you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And an hour and a half is plenty of time to take a dump and have some lunch.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;======&lt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The courier ship&#039;s small but serviceable galley actually has some fairly nice food, a perk of the armored courier business.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Given the cargoes you transport, they naturally expect a great deal more from you than to simply be an interstellar truck driver.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The company exclusively recruits combat veterans, and trains them to be very protective of said cargoes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A soft chime signals that the convection oven has completed warming your food, and you reach over from the small table to retrieve it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Roast turkey breast, gravy, seasoned bread stuffing, buttery mashed potatoes, string beans, and peas.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Happy Thanksgiving, in hyperspace.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, it&#039;s not as if you had a family to spend it with, so you were happy to take this pop-up run.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The bonus they promised you for successful delivery was a nice little incentive as well.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This may not be the easiest of jobs, but they sure do take good care of their couriers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And in hyperspace, there&#039;s very little to worry about.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or so you think until about midway through your meal, when the air around you suddenly takes on a sticky yellowish cast and you find yourself unable to move.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">/What the... inertial dampeners? In hyperspace?/</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re nowhere near your exit point yet, so this is concerning to say the least.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As is a split second later, when the lighting goes out and the hull makes a massive groaning sound.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even with the dampeners on you can still feel the terrific forces vying for control of you, and if not for the dampeners you would probably be a gooey red mess on the bulkhead by now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then suddenly the rough shaking is over and your hearing comes back, as evidenced by the cacophony of alarms.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The lighting is still out, but the red emergency lighting kicks in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You rush to the pilothouse, where the flickering displays indicate that the ship has dropped out of hyperspace, and the main drives are offline.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Critical systems on Auxiliary Power.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That&#039;ll be the computer with more bad news.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;From the chronometer, only 42 minutes had elapsed since you entered hyperspace, so you&#039;re approximately less than halfway there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You silence the alarms and drop into the pilot&#039;s chair, then set about trying to reset tripped breakers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Computer, report position.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Working. Unable to resolve position, local stellar bodies not recognized. Long-range sensors are off-line. Navigation computer off-line.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Shit. Computer, what happened?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Working. Flight log: Unknown energy field detected, activated inertial dampeners, energy field caused warp instability, emergency normal-space re-entry successful. Main drives are off-line.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Computer, time to restore?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Working. Unable to determine, multiple sensors off-line.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">/Energy field caused warp instability? Shit! A warp-breaker!/</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Warp-breakers were a weapon of war, that could yank a vessel traveling in hyperspace back into normal space.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They required a good deal of technical sophistication to use effectively.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They were also outlawed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some natural phenomenon couldn&#039;t be ruled out yet though...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Caution. Proximity alert.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Computer, identify.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Working. Artifact. Power source detected.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">/Another ship. So this is a hijacking./</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Computer, power weapons.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Unable to comply. Main drives are off-line.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Shit!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The ship had pretty powerful defensive weapons, but they relied on the main drives to power them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Proximity alert, contact imminent.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In the silence that follows you hear the unmistakeable sounds of docking clamps resonate through the hull.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">/Whoever they are they intend to board./</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Computer, distress signal.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A protective cover flips open and you smack the large red button it reveals.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The emergency beacon has its own power supply, but obviously you have no idea how close help might be.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Computer, lockdown. Repel boarders.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A larger panel at the back of the pilot house slides open, and you reach in and grab a plasma rifle, the biometric lock automatically releasing the weapon into your grasp.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have a choice now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can lock yourself in the armored pilothouse and hope you can hold out until help reaches you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or you can try to fight off the boarding party from the cargo hold, which also has the only way on or off the ship.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That assuming they can make it past the ship&#039;s physical defenses of course.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you have no idea what&#039;s working and what&#039;s not right now, so you opt to defend the hold, with falling back to the pilothouse as Plan B.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you set up in the hold&#039;s covered position, you cast a glance at the large black casket clamped to the deck, wondering again just what the cargo is that would warrant such a bold attack.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Outer airlock breach.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">/Dammit./</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Computer, silence. Command lockout, 724651.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Command authenticated.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That&#039;s it, you&#039;re now on your own until you unlock the computer with your ident code, or until help comes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A glaringly bright light momentarily seizes your attention, as whoever is in the airlock begins cutting their way into the ship.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reach for the control pad and extinguish the lighting in the hold, then train your rifle on the airlock.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The cargo hold is eerily illuminated by the flashing alarm indicators and the sparks from the cutting beam.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You close your eyes in an attempt to save your night vision from the cutter&#039;s flare, until the beam audibly stops.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You open your eyes in time to see the inner airlock hatch fall onto the deck, revealing six bipedal figures, each a little more than a meter high.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They don&#039;t seem to be wearing armor, but that&#039;s all you have time to see before they scatter out of the airlock and melt into the darkness just as you fire.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you search for a target, a chorus of high squeaky voices shouts, &quot;MUSTELA PUTORIUS FURO!!!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It seems to come from everywhere, and is followed by laughter, still denying you a clear target.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Guess what, sweetie...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You fire again, the plasma bolt throwing sparks as it impacts the armored bulkhead.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We can see better in the dark than you can!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You squeeze off one last shot before something heavy and painfully hard connects solidly with your head, sending you sprawling to the deck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I GOT HIM!!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your consciousness begins to fade.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;No, I got him.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The last thing you hear before everything goes black is, &quot;Dammit Jenna, I saw him first!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;======&lt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The first thing filtering into your slowly re-emerging consciousness is a throbbing headache.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hardly surprising.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re actually more surprised to find yourself regaining consciousness at all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You open your eyes, but the bright light immediately makes you regret it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You caught an impression of a sort of blue blur surrounded by a gray blur.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then you discover you can&#039;t move.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The reason for your enforced immobility seems to be that you are bound to a chair.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Correction.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bound naked to a chair.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That&#039;s not a good sign.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The events leading up to your sudden loss of consciousness come flooding back into your memory and jolt you further towards consciousness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feebly test your bonds, and discover that whoever tied you up did a pretty good job of it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wincing from the pain, you force your eyes to open once more, and try to make sense of the information they report to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Big gray blur, with a blue and black blur in the middle of it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Wow, you&#039;re actually waking up?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The voice sounds high-pitched and feminine, but also sounds like it&#039;s coming from the other end of a drainpipe.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The blue and black blur shifts slightly, and is now a blue, black, and cream-colored blur.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hey, give Doc a call, we&#039;ve got a survivor!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You blink a couple times, trying to clear your vision.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The blue blur gradually resolves into a bipedal form with stubby legs, covered in blue fur, with a cream-colored front, wearing a black tube top and shorts, and a leather tool belt carrying an absurd amount of tools.</div></li><li

leaves.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Doc calls over her shoulder as she walks away.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;When it reaches the other end, just push open that panel in the wall there for sanitary relief.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Thanks.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It can&#039;t possibly hurt

and turns to face you, her gaze sweeping coldly up and down your form.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It makes you self conscious enough to put a hand over your

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And without further comment she is gone as well.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Leaving you alone and naked on a strange ship.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, they didn&#039;t kill you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That&#039;s something.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You guess.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull the bottle from between the bars and open it, taking a small sip as you sink back down onto the chair.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Fine.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Being a prisoner is just about the most boring thing ever.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Having nothing to do except listen to your head complain, you explore your cell.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It takes all of two minutes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As Doc had promised, pressing on a squarish panel in the corner causes it to revolve, revealing a small, plain steel basin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Too small for you to take a dump in, but large enough for you to relieve the mounting pressure on your bladder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You revolve the panel again to put it away, and you can hear something rinse it out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There is a much larger panel on the other side of the cell, and a bit of fiddling later, you get it to fold down out of the wall and slot neatly into the top of the chair.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Doing so reveals a small bunk with a thin padding.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No sheets, of course, so you&#039;re still left with nothing to cover your nakedness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But, screw it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your head is still pissed off at whoever knocked you out, and complaining about it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you decide the best course of action is to lie down and have a nap.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Of course the bunk is too small for you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But hopefully your headache will have subsided somewhat by the time you wake up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your body agrees in principle, and sleep comes quickly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;======&lt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You awaken, you have no idea how much later, to the sound of giggling.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your headache is not as bad, so you look up to see what the source of it is.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You appear to have an audience.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some half-dozen or so furry faces are staring at you through the bars and giggling.</div></li><li class="li1"><div

wall.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;G&#039;wan, beat it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This prompts a chorus of disappointed groans and catcalls.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Nice butt!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sleeping is apparently no longer an option.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sit up, deciding to see if any of them will tell you more about your current situation than your last visitors did.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Who are you people anyhow?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh, a curious one!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s introduce ourselves to him! We&#039;re the crew of the Serpent&#039;s Adventure!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This gets a chorus of cheers from the assembled faces.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Our battle cry is &#039;Mustela Putorius Furo&#039;!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;MUSTELA PUTORIUS FURO!!!&quot; the assembled crowd choruses in response.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Says it all, really, doesn&#039;t it?&quot; the self-appointed spokeswoman caps off, looking rather pleased with herself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;It says &#039;ferret&#039;.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Instantly all the smiles melt away, leaving an awkward silence for a moment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Wow. Rude.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;What? That&#039;s what you are, aren&#039;t you? Ferrets?

You&#039;re going to meet The Captain.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a sigh, you hop down from the bunk and fold it back into the wall to give yourself some room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The bundle proves to be your uniform, though someone has gone over it and removed everything metallic, to include the belt buckle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;How about some privacy?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Romy draws her sidearm and points it at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;How about hurry the fuck up?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;======&lt;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Moments later, having dressed yourself at gunpoint, Romy lets you out of the cell and marches you down a series of passages.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pass through an airlock and arrive at a cavernous space.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You deduce that this is the hanger bay, since your courier vessel is sitting in the middle of it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You inspect what you can see quickly, noting that it doesn&#039;t appear to be seriously damaged.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Inside,&quot; Romy tells you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They&#039;ve lowered the cargo ramp, so you shrug and walk up, avoiding the hole they made when they cut their way into your ship.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One of the Tika, (must remember not to call them ferrets) wearing a long blue coat with gold trim, turns towards you at your approach.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So you&#039;re Anonymous. I&#039;m Captain Will.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You notice right away that she isn&#039;t wearing anything under the coat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Are all these crazy pirates female?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Short for Wilma?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I hate that name.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Duly noted.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You notice Zoe, the blue-furred Chief Engineer from earlier, examining the casket secured to the deck of your hold.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I wouldn&#039;t mess with that if I were you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Please, I know what I&#039;m doing.&quot; Zoe grunts, not bothering to look at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Okay, don&#039;t say I didn&#039;t warn you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You turn to leave, only to be immediately stopped by Romy and her pistol.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Warn us about what?&quot; The Captain asks.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hesitate, but Zoe&#039;s continued tinkering with the casket prompts you to act.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;That&#039;s a MK4 Secure Transport Container.

I&#039;d be killed too.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Fair point,&quot; The Captain concedes. &quot;How about you save us some bother and open it for us then?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I can&#039;t.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Captain sighs tiredly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I admire your dedication to duty, human. But I don&#039;t really have a lot of patience for it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In one smooth motion, the Captain draws a small pistol from somewhere you can&#039;t see and fires into the deck directly between your feet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You jump as sparks from the bolt&#039;s impact lightly scorch your feet, since Romy hadn&#039;t brought you your boots.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;WHOA-WHOA-WHOA! CALM DOWN!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Open it!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I literally can&#039;t! I don&#039;t have the key or the passcode, only the receiving entity has those!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a pause, the Captain gives a derisive snort.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Typical humans. They don&#039;t even trust their own kind. So where was this going?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Captain and Romy are both pointing guns at you now, so you really only have one card left to play.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;The navigational destination was Mytus VI, but that&#039;s as much as I know.

Come with me.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Captain turns and strides down the ramp, and Romy prompts you to follow by jabbing the muzzle of her pistol into your ribs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You proceed through the airlock into the ship, up a ladder and down another passage.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;May as well make conversation.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;So what kind of name is &#039;Serpent&#039;s Adventure&#039; anyhow?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We had a contest.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;And that name won?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It was the runner-up, but I refuse to name my ship &#039;Angry Bitch In Heat&#039;.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You proceed through a few more twists and turns until you arrive at a door which the Captain pushes open.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You find yourself in a largish cabin, with a bed, and a desk holding a computer terminal, which the Captain sits down in front of.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Time to seek guidance from the client.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;So you&#039;re not pirates, you&#039;re mercenaries.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Captain ignores you as she opens an application for a hyperspace comm-link.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Real-time conversations aren&#039;t really possible over the hideous distances between stars, but with specialized equipment, you can send short text messages via hyperspace data burst.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It has the added advantage of being a very secure line, since it&#039;s damn near impossible to intercept hyperspace data bursts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;When I say you don&#039;t owe your employer anything, I&#039;m not just trying to motivate you to cooperate.

I added some broth for flavor though, otherwise it&#039;s like eating wet cardboard.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sit and open the container, revealing a warm pile of mush topped with a plastic utensil of some kind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You give it a sniff.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Smells pretty good, actually.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re not lying.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m Andy, by the way,&quot; the newcomer announces, his voice getting slightly steadier, &quot;I&#039;m the ship&#039;s cook.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Anonymous.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You spoon some of the mush and chew it thoughtfully.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yeah, kinda like wet cardboard alright, but it does have a tolerably pleasant flavor to it, which you guess comes from the broth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Um, I don&#039;t mean to seem rude, but what are you?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You swallow and scoop up another bite.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Human.

&gt;&quot;Route plotted.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Final warning, please ensure that the cabin and its contents are secure.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Crew, please take your safety positions.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Supercharging complete, drives nominal. Final countdown for hyperspace entry. Ten... nine... eight...&quot;
&gt;You grit your teeth and cinch your safety harness just that little bit tighter.
&gt;This is by no means your first hyperspace jump, but the feminine voice of the ship&#039;s computer calmly reciting the pre-jump checklist always gives you a sense of anxiety.
&gt;Not that there was much to worry about.
&gt;The courier vessel&#039;s hull was an innocuous shape, directly copied from the hulls of literally millions of such courier vessels that plied the trade routes.
&gt;But it was much more cramped within, to accommodate the extra engine power and armor that belied its true purpose.
&gt;This is a hell of a valuable cargo you&#039;re carrying, the kind that shadowy agents of alien governments would kill for.
&gt;But once you&#039;re clear of the planetary systems and in hyperspace, its not as though they&#039;d be able to catch you.
&gt;&quot;Three... two... one... initiating.&quot;
&gt;Yeah, whoever programmed that computer couldn&#039;t pick a more interesting word than that, could they.
&gt;Out of habit you reflexively close your eyes as a powerful thrum builds throughout the hull, and the courier vessel&#039;s drives propel you beyond light, beyond reason, into hyperspace.
&gt;&quot;Hyperspace insertion achieved. Calculated transit time is one hour and thirty-seven minutes.&quot;
&gt;Once that transition between realities is achieved, the environment becomes much more tolerable.
&gt;You unclip yourself from the pilot&#039;s couch, the navigational computer will handle the hyperspace transit without any further intervention from you.
&gt;And an hour and a half is plenty of time to take a dump and have some lunch.
 
&gt;======&lt;
 
&gt;The courier ship&#039;s small but serviceable galley actually has some fairly nice food, a perk of the armored courier business.
&gt;Given the cargoes you transport, they naturally expect a great deal more from you than to simply be an interstellar truck driver.
&gt;The company exclusively recruits combat veterans, and trains them to be very protective of said cargoes.
&gt;A soft chime signals that the convection oven has completed warming your food, and you reach over from the small table to retrieve it.
&gt;Roast turkey breast, gravy, seasoned bread stuffing, buttery mashed potatoes, string beans, and peas.
&gt;Happy Thanksgiving, in hyperspace.
&gt;Well, it&#039;s not as if you had a family to spend it with, so you were happy to take this pop-up run.
&gt;The bonus they promised you for successful delivery was a nice little incentive as well.
&gt;This may not be the easiest of jobs, but they sure do take good care of their couriers.
&gt;And in hyperspace, there&#039;s very little to worry about.
&gt;Or so you think until about midway through your meal, when the air around you suddenly takes on a sticky yellowish cast and you find yourself unable to move.
/What the... inertial dampeners? In hyperspace?/
&gt;You&#039;re nowhere near your exit point yet, so this is concerning to say the least.
&gt;As is a split second later, when the lighting goes out and the hull makes a massive groaning sound.
&gt;Even with the dampeners on you can still feel the terrific forces vying for control of you, and if not for the dampeners you would probably be a gooey red mess on the bulkhead by now.
&gt;Then suddenly the rough shaking is over and your hearing comes back, as evidenced by the cacophony of alarms.
&gt;The lighting is still out, but the red emergency lighting kicks in.
&gt;You rush to the pilothouse, where the flickering displays indicate that the ship has dropped out of hyperspace, and the main drives are offline.
&gt;&quot;Critical systems on Auxiliary Power.&quot;
&gt;That&#039;ll be the computer with more bad news.
&gt;From the chronometer, only 42 minutes had elapsed since you entered hyperspace, so you&#039;re approximately less than halfway there.
&gt;You silence the alarms and drop into the pilot&#039;s chair, then set about trying to reset tripped breakers.
&quot;Computer, report position.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Working. Unable to resolve position, local stellar bodies not recognized. Long-range sensors are off-line. Navigation computer off-line.&quot;
&quot;Shit. Computer, what happened?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Working. Flight log: Unknown energy field detected, activated inertial dampeners, energy field caused warp instability, emergency normal-space re-entry successful. Main drives are off-line.&quot;
&quot;Computer, time to restore?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Working. Unable to determine, multiple sensors off-line.&quot;
/Energy field caused warp instability? Shit! A warp-breaker!/
&gt;Warp-breakers were a weapon of war, that could yank a vessel traveling in hyperspace back into normal space.
&gt;They required a good deal of technical sophistication to use effectively.
&gt;They were also outlawed.
&gt;Some natural phenomenon couldn&#039;t be ruled out yet though...
&gt;&quot;Caution. Proximity alert.&quot;
&quot;Computer, identify.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Working. Artifact. Power source detected.&quot;
/Another ship. So this is a hijacking./
&quot;Computer, power weapons.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Unable to comply. Main drives are off-line.&quot;
&quot;Shit!&quot;
&gt;The ship had pretty powerful defensive weapons, but they relied on the main drives to power them.
&gt;&quot;Proximity alert, contact imminent.&quot;
&gt;In the silence that follows you hear the unmistakeable sounds of docking clamps resonate through the hull.
/Whoever they are they intend to board./
&quot;Computer, distress signal.&quot;
&gt;A protective cover flips open and you smack the large red button it reveals.
&gt;The emergency beacon has its own power supply, but obviously you have no idea how close help might be.
&quot;Computer, lockdown. Repel boarders.&quot;
&gt;A larger panel at the back of the pilot house slides open, and you reach in and grab a plasma rifle, the biometric lock automatically releasing the weapon into your grasp.
&gt;You have a choice now.
&gt;You can lock yourself in the armored pilothouse and hope you can hold out until help reaches you.
&gt;Or you can try to fight off the boarding party from the cargo hold, which also has the only way on or off the ship.
&gt;That assuming they can make it past the ship&#039;s physical defenses of course.
&gt;But you have no idea what&#039;s working and what&#039;s not right now, so you opt to defend the hold, with falling back to the pilothouse as Plan B.
&gt;As you set up in the hold&#039;s covered position, you cast a glance at the large black casket clamped to the deck, wondering again just what the cargo is that would warrant such a bold attack.
&gt;&quot;Outer airlock breach.&quot;
/Dammit./
&quot;Computer, silence. Command lockout, 724651.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Command authenticated.&quot;
&gt;That&#039;s it, you&#039;re now on your own until you unlock the computer with your ident code, or until help comes.
&gt;A glaringly bright light momentarily seizes your attention, as whoever is in the airlock begins cutting their way into the ship.
&gt;You reach for the control pad and extinguish the lighting in the hold, then train your rifle on the airlock.
&gt;The cargo hold is eerily illuminated by the flashing alarm indicators and the sparks from the cutting beam.
&gt;You close your eyes in an attempt to save your night vision from the cutter&#039;s flare, until the beam audibly stops.
&gt;You open your eyes in time to see the inner airlock hatch fall onto the deck, revealing six bipedal figures, each a little more than a meter high.
&gt;They don&#039;t seem to be wearing armor, but that&#039;s all you have time to see before they scatter out of the airlock and melt into the darkness just as you fire.
&gt;As you search for a target, a chorus of high squeaky voices shouts, &quot;MUSTELA PUTORIUS FURO!!!&quot;
&gt;It seems to come from everywhere, and is followed by laughter, still denying you a clear target.
&gt;&quot;Guess what, sweetie...&quot;
&gt;You fire again, the plasma bolt throwing sparks as it impacts the armored bulkhead.
&gt;&quot;We can see better in the dark than you can!&quot;
&gt;You squeeze off one last shot before something heavy and painfully hard connects solidly with your head, sending you sprawling to the deck.
&gt;&quot;I GOT HIM!!&quot;
&gt;Your consciousness begins to fade.
&gt;&quot;No, I got him.&quot;
&gt;The last thing you hear before everything goes black is, &quot;Dammit Jenna, I saw him first!&quot;
 
&gt;======&lt;
 
&gt;The first thing filtering into your slowly re-emerging consciousness is a throbbing headache.
&gt;Hardly surprising.
&gt;You&#039;re actually more surprised to find yourself regaining consciousness at all.
&gt;You open your eyes, but the bright light immediately makes you regret it.
&gt;You caught an impression of a sort of blue blur surrounded by a gray blur.
&gt;Then you discover you can&#039;t move.
&gt;The reason for your enforced immobility seems to be that you are bound to a chair.
&gt;Correction.
&gt;Bound naked to a chair.
&gt;That&#039;s not a good sign.
&gt;The events leading up to your sudden loss of consciousness come flooding back into your memory and jolt you further towards consciousness.
&gt;You feebly test your bonds, and discover that whoever tied you up did a pretty good job of it.
&gt;Wincing from the pain, you force your eyes to open once more, and try to make sense of the information they report to you.
&gt;Big gray blur, with a blue and black blur in the middle of it.
&gt;&quot;Wow, you&#039;re actually waking up?&quot;
&gt;The voice sounds high-pitched and feminine, but also sounds like it&#039;s coming from the other end of a drainpipe.
&gt;The blue and black blur shifts slightly, and is now a blue, black, and cream-colored blur.
&gt;&quot;Hey, give Doc a call, we&#039;ve got a survivor!&quot;
&gt;You blink a couple times, trying to clear your vision.
&gt;The blue blur gradually resolves into a bipedal form with stubby legs, covered in blue fur, with a cream-colored front, wearing a black tube top and shorts, and a leather tool belt carrying an absurd amount of tools.
&gt;The creature&#039;s eyes have a black band around them, giving it a masked appearance, and vaguely triggering a distant memory.
&gt;It also seems to be smiling, so maybe it&#039;s not all bad news.
&gt;Correction. It&#039;s smiling at you from the other side of some very stout-looking metal bars.
&gt;A loudspeaker overhead comes alive with a feminine voice, &quot;Doc, you&#039;re needed in the brig.&quot;
&gt;&quot;So what have you got to say for yourself?&quot;
&quot;Wwwhhuurrr...&quot;
&gt;You swallow, but that doesn&#039;t seem to do much for your dry throat.
&quot;W-wher&#039;m I?&quot;
&gt;The furry blue creature&#039;s face clouds a bit.
&gt;&quot;I was hoping for something more imaginative than that. You&#039;re on our ship, in the brig.&quot;
&quot;Who are you?&quot;
&gt;The smile returns. &quot;I&#039;m Zoe- wait a minute, you&#039;re our prisoner. You&#039;re supposed to tell me who you are.&quot;
&quot;No, I mean, who are you people?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nope, you first. Name.&quot;
&gt;You hesitate, but you clearly aren&#039;t giving up much by telling them your name.
&quot;Anonymous.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Hah, a made-up name if I ever heard one,&quot; a new voice growls.
&gt;The voice&#039;s owner comes into view, a cigar clamped in her teeth and slightly taller than Zoe, covered with white fur and a holstered sidearm.
&gt;And nothing else.
&gt;You immediately deduce that the newcomer is female because she has a hell of a rack on her.
&quot;Yeah, my mom and dad made it up.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Watch your mouth or watch yourself bleed, Pinky.&quot;
&gt;Another newcomer, gray-furred but for a shock of red hair atop her head comes into view.
&gt;Also clearly female, she wears only a white coat, open at the front, with a few medical instruments stuffed into her pockets.
&gt;&quot;This the patient?&quot;
&gt;They&#039;re all female, you note.
&gt;And here you are, tied naked to a chair.
&gt;This is officially the most awkward workday you have ever had.
&gt;&quot;He just woke up, and Jenna did ring his bell pretty hard.&quot;
&gt;Zoe manipulates a control you can&#039;t see and some of the bars slide into the deck.
&gt;The gray one with the white coat looks expectantly at the others.
&gt;&quot;Well? You don&#039;t expect me to examine him like this, do you?&quot;
/Examine?/
&gt;The tall white one pulls out a wicked-looking curved knife and advances on you with it.
&gt;Your burst of fear turns out to be unfounded when she uses it to cut the ropes.
&gt;Whitey then retreat a bit, draws her sidearm and levels it at your head.
&gt;&quot;Behave or be toast, Pinky. Savvy?&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t need to be told twice.
&gt;&quot;Hi Anonymous, I&#039;m Doc. You&#039;ve met Zoe, and Miss Personality here is Romy. Can you stand?&quot;
&gt;Romy flicks the muzzle of her sidearm upwards a couple of times, gesturing for you to stand.
&gt;You attempt to do so, but the room immediately begins to spin.
&gt;Zoe and Doc both grab you, stopping you from falling onto your face.
&gt;&quot;Move it Zoe, you&#039;re fouling my line of fire!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Geez, Romy, lighten up, can&#039;t you?&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s my considered medical opinion that you can put your gun away Romy. He ain&#039;t about to start a fight in his current condition.&quot;
&gt;Romy growls, but holsters her weapon.
&gt;She keeps her eyes firmly fixed on you though.
&gt;&quot;You still with us Anonymous?&quot;
&gt;You straighten up as best you can.
&quot;Yeah&quot;.
&gt;&quot;Okay then. Ain&#039;t you a tall drink of water? I caution you that I ain&#039;t never seen whatever you are before, so I&#039;m just gonna hope that your guts are laid out in more or less the same place as ours are.&quot;
&gt;You jump slightly as a cold circle of metal presses to your chest.
&gt;&quot;Yep, there&#039;s the heart. So far so good then.&quot;
&gt;Doc listens to your lungs as well, pronouncing them clear.
&gt;The loudspeaker overhead blares again.
&gt;&quot;Chief Engineer, you&#039;re needed in Engine Room Two.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oops,&quot; Zoe says apologetically, &quot;that&#039;s me. Can you get along without me Doc?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Go on, scoot. I&#039;ve got this.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Okay.&quot; Zoe releases her hold on you and scampers out of the cell and down the passageway.
&gt;&quot;Well, Sunshine, now that we&#039;re alone together...&quot;
&gt;You yelp as you feel a slim paw grasp your junk.
&quot;Uh, Doc, do you really have to--&quot;
&gt;&quot;Trust me, I&#039;m a doctor,&quot; She purrs at you. &quot;Turn your head and cough.&quot;
&gt;Blushing furiously, you comply.
&gt;&quot;Normal, healthy reaction. And on a personal note, nice package.&quot;
&gt;Doc turns you loose and pats your butt.
&gt;&quot;He&#039;ll live, but he probably won&#039;t enjoy it much for a while.&quot;
&gt;Doc exits the cell and Romy presses that unseen control again, causing the bars to slide closed.
&quot;Can I have some water?&quot;
&gt;Doc and Romy exchange a look.
&gt;&quot;Couldn&#039;t hurt.&quot;
&gt;Romy retrieves a bottle from somewhere and shoves it between the bars as Doc leaves.
&gt;Doc calls over her shoulder as she walks away.
&gt;&quot;When it reaches the other end, just push open that panel in the wall there for sanitary relief.&quot;
&quot;Thanks.&quot;
&gt;It can&#039;t possibly hurt to be polite in your current situation.
&quot;And, uh, could I have my clothes back please?&quot;
&gt;Romy stops and turns to face you, her gaze sweeping coldly up and down your form.
&gt;It makes you self conscious enough to put a hand over your privates.
&gt;Romy returns her gaze to your face and smirks at you.
&gt;&quot;No.&quot;
&gt;And without further comment she is gone as well.
&gt;Leaving you alone and naked on a strange ship.
&gt;Well, they didn&#039;t kill you.
&gt;That&#039;s something.
&gt;You guess.
&gt;You pull the bottle from between the bars and open it, taking a small sip as you sink back down onto the chair.
&quot;Fine.&quot;
&gt;Being a prisoner is just about the most boring thing ever.
&gt;Having nothing to do except listen to your head complain, you explore your cell.
&gt;It takes all of two minutes.
&gt;As Doc had promised, pressing on a squarish panel in the corner causes it to revolve, revealing a small, plain steel basin.
&gt;Too small for you to take a dump in, but large enough for you to relieve the mounting pressure on your bladder.
&gt;You revolve the panel again to put it away, and you can hear something rinse it out.
&gt;There is a much larger panel on the other side of the cell, and a bit of fiddling later, you get it to fold down out of the wall and slot neatly into the top of the chair.
&gt;Doing so reveals a small bunk with a thin padding.
&gt;No sheets, of course, so you&#039;re still left with nothing to cover your nakedness.
&gt;But, screw it.
&gt;Your head is still pissed off at whoever knocked you out, and complaining about it.
&gt;So you decide the best course of action is to lie down and have a nap.
&gt;Of course the bunk is too small for you.
&gt;But hopefully your headache will have subsided somewhat by the time you wake up.
&gt;Your body agrees in principle, and sleep comes quickly.
 
&gt;======&lt;
 
&gt;You awaken, you have no idea how much later, to the sound of giggling.
&gt;Your headache is not as bad, so you look up to see what the source of it is.
&gt;You appear to have an audience.
&gt;Some half-dozen or so furry faces are staring at you through the bars and giggling.
&gt;You also appear to have morning wood.
/Really?/
&gt;With a grunt, you turn and face the wall.
&quot;G&#039;wan, beat it.&quot;
&gt;This prompts a chorus of disappointed groans and catcalls.
&gt;&quot;Nice butt!&quot;
&gt;Sleeping is apparently no longer an option.
&gt;You sit up, deciding to see if any of them will tell you more about your current situation than your last visitors did.
&quot;Who are you people anyhow?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh, a curious one!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s introduce ourselves to him! We&#039;re the crew of the Serpent&#039;s Adventure!&quot;
&gt;This gets a chorus of cheers from the assembled faces.
&gt;&quot;Our battle cry is &#039;Mustela Putorius Furo&#039;!&quot;
&gt;&quot;MUSTELA PUTORIUS FURO!!!&quot; the assembled crowd choruses in response.
&gt;&quot;Says it all, really, doesn&#039;t it?&quot; the self-appointed spokeswoman caps off, looking rather pleased with herself.
&quot;It says &#039;ferret&#039;.&quot;
&gt;Instantly all the smiles melt away, leaving an awkward silence for a moment.
&gt;&quot;Wow. Rude.&quot;
&quot;What? That&#039;s what you are, aren&#039;t you? Ferrets? That&#039;s what you look like to me, anyhow.&quot;
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s a ferret?&quot; a lone voice asks.
&gt;&quot;We call ourselves the Tika,&quot; the spokeswoman tells you with evident pride.
&gt;&quot;I told you he was an espo,&quot; another voice says.
&gt;This causes you to bristle, since &quot;espo&quot; is slang for &quot;Security Police&quot;, the law-enforcement branch of the Corporate Sector Authority, and it&#039;s one of the kinder things they&#039;re called.
&quot;Fuck you in the neck, I ain&#039;t no brown-shirt bully-boy.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You talk like one. They call us ferrets too. It&#039;s insulting.&quot;
&gt;You hadn&#039;t realized you were being offensive, but you&#039;re not in any mood to debate the point or apologize.
&quot;Duly noted.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t you all have duties to attend to?&quot; A loud voice proclaims, causing the assembled gawkers to jump.
&gt;&quot;Yes ma&#039;am!&quot;
&gt;Your audience clears out with inhuman speed, revealing Romy with a fresh cigar in her teeth and carrying a small bundle.
&gt;Romy shoves the bundle through the bars at you.
&gt;&quot;Make yourself decent, Pinky. You&#039;re going to meet The Captain.&quot;
&gt;With a sigh, you hop down from the bunk and fold it back into the wall to give yourself some room.
&gt;The bundle proves to be your uniform, though someone has gone over it and removed everything metallic, to include the belt buckle.
&quot;How about some privacy?&quot;
&gt;Romy draws her sidearm and points it at you.
&gt;&quot;How about hurry the fuck up?&quot;
 
&gt;======&lt;
 
&gt;Moments later, having dressed yourself at gunpoint, Romy lets you out of the cell and marches you down a series of passages.
&gt;You pass through an airlock and arrive at a cavernous space.
&gt;You deduce that this is the hanger bay, since your courier vessel is sitting in the middle of it.
&gt;You inspect what you can see quickly, noting that it doesn&#039;t appear to be seriously damaged.
&gt;&quot;Inside,&quot; Romy tells you.
&gt;They&#039;ve lowered the cargo ramp, so you shrug and walk up, avoiding the hole they made when they cut their way into your ship.
&gt;One of the Tika, (must remember not to call them ferrets) wearing a long blue coat with gold trim, turns towards you at your approach.
&gt;&quot;So you&#039;re Anonymous. I&#039;m Captain Will.&quot;
&gt;You notice right away that she isn&#039;t wearing anything under the coat.
&gt;Are all these crazy pirates female?
&quot;Short for Wilma?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I hate that name.&quot;
&quot;Duly noted.&quot;
&gt;You notice Zoe, the blue-furred Chief Engineer from earlier, examining the casket secured to the deck of your hold.
&quot;I wouldn&#039;t mess with that if I were you.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Please, I know what I&#039;m doing.&quot; Zoe grunts, not bothering to look at you.
&quot;Okay, don&#039;t say I didn&#039;t warn you.&quot;
&gt;You turn to leave, only to be immediately stopped by Romy and her pistol.
&gt;&quot;Warn us about what?&quot; The Captain asks.
&gt;You hesitate, but Zoe&#039;s continued tinkering with the casket prompts you to act.
&quot;That&#039;s a MK4 Secure Transport Container. It&#039;s equipped with a demolition charge that will kill everyone here if you don&#039;t unlock it properly.&quot;
&gt;To your relief, Zoe immediately ceases her tinkering.
&gt;&quot;Why would you tell us something like that?&quot; Romy growls suspiciously.
&quot;Duh, I&#039;m standing right here. I&#039;d be killed too.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Fair point,&quot; The Captain concedes. &quot;How about you save us some bother and open it for us then?&quot;
&quot;I can&#039;t.&quot;
&gt;The Captain sighs tiredly.
&gt;&quot;I admire your dedication to duty, human. But I don&#039;t really have a lot of patience for it.&quot;
&gt;In one smooth motion, the Captain draws a small pistol from somewhere you can&#039;t see and fires into the deck directly between your feet.
&gt;You jump as sparks from the bolt&#039;s impact lightly scorch your feet, since Romy hadn&#039;t brought you your boots.
&quot;WHOA-WHOA-WHOA! CALM DOWN!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Open it!&quot;
&quot;I literally can&#039;t! I don&#039;t have the key or the passcode, only the receiving entity has those!&quot;
&gt;After a pause, the Captain gives a derisive snort.
&gt;&quot;Typical humans. They don&#039;t even trust their own kind. So where was this going?&quot;
&gt;The Captain and Romy are both pointing guns at you now, so you really only have one card left to play.
&quot;The navigational destination was Mytus VI, but that&#039;s as much as I know. Details are on the manifest in the computer, but it went into lockdown when you guys attacked my ship.&quot;
&gt;You have the code to unlock the computer, of course, but they don&#039;t need to know that.
&gt;All the same, the Captain seems to sense that you&#039;re withholding something.
&gt;&quot;We could torture him,&quot; Romy suggests, with a disturbing amount of enthusiasm.
&gt;The Captain scowls briefly at her, before returning her attention to you.
&gt;&quot;You know, you really don&#039;t owe your employer anything.&quot;
&quot;You&#039;re pointing guns at me. They sign my paycheck. Do the math.&quot;
&gt;A dangerous moment passes.
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re right,&quot; the Captain says suddenly, putting away her pistol. &quot;But you&#039;re missing the big picture. Come with me.&quot;
&gt;The Captain turns and strides down the ramp, and Romy prompts you to follow by jabbing the muzzle of her pistol into your ribs.
&gt;You proceed through the airlock into the ship, up a ladder and down another passage.
&gt;May as well make conversation.
&quot;So what kind of name is &#039;Serpent&#039;s Adventure&#039; anyhow?&quot;
&gt;&quot;We had a contest.&quot;
&quot;And that name won?&quot;
&gt;&quot;It was the runner-up, but I refuse to name my ship &#039;Angry Bitch In Heat&#039;.&quot;
&gt;You proceed through a few more twists and turns until you arrive at a door which the Captain pushes open.
&gt;You find yourself in a largish cabin, with a bed, and a desk holding a computer terminal, which the Captain sits down in front of.
&gt;&quot;Time to seek guidance from the client.&quot;
&quot;So you&#039;re not pirates, you&#039;re mercenaries.&quot;
&gt;The Captain ignores you as she opens an application for a hyperspace comm-link.
&gt;Real-time conversations aren&#039;t really possible over the hideous distances between stars, but with specialized equipment, you can send short text messages via hyperspace data burst.
&gt;It has the added advantage of being a very secure line, since it&#039;s damn near impossible to intercept hyperspace data bursts.
&gt;&quot;When I say you don&#039;t owe your employer anything, I&#039;m not just trying to motivate you to cooperate. Watch and learn.&quot;
&gt;The Captain taps on the keyboard, and you watch the text scroll across the screen.
&gt;WE HAVE THE PACKAGE AND ARE READY TO DELIVER.
&gt;There is a lag as the data burst is sent.
&quot;So who&#039;s your client?&quot;
&gt;Romy pokes you with her gun, but surprisingly the Captain answers your question.
&gt;&quot;We don&#039;t know, but the comm-link relay is the Jaophus system, if that means anything to you.&quot;
&gt;It does.
&gt;Jaophus IV is where you live and work, and where this disastrous courier run was dispatched from.
&gt;Jaophus IV is also the only world in the system with a hyperspace comm relay.
&gt;You feel no need to tell her that though.
&gt;The terminal emits a short beep, and a response appears on the screen.
&gt;EXCELLENT. AND THE PILOT?
&gt;The Captain&#039;s fingers dance over her keyboard again.
&gt;KILLED IN THE EXCHANGE OF FIRE, AS YOU REQUESTED.
&gt;Your eyebrows rise in surprise.
&quot;I don&#039;t feel very dead.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I can fix that,&quot; Romy growls in your ear.
&gt;&quot;Waste not, want not,&quot; the Captain admonishes you both.
&gt;Beep.
&gt;GOOD. A PITY TO LOSE HIM BUT I ALWAYS SAY GOOD BUSINESS IS WHERE YOU FIND IT.
&gt;An icy feeling descends in the pit of your stomach.
&gt;The Captain taps at her keyboard.
&gt;USUAL DELIVERY?
/That bastard. That son-of-a-bitching BASTARD!/
&gt;Beep.
&gt;OF COURSE. BONUS AS AGREED.
&gt;The Captain closes the comm-link application and turns to look at you.
&gt;&quot;Something wrong, Anonymous?&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s right.
&gt;You don&#039;t owe that fat, chain-smoking faggot a goddam thing.
&quot;The guy you&#039;re talking to sounds a hell of a lot like my boss.&quot;
&gt;You grit your teeth.
&quot;I can confirm that he does, in fact, always say that.&quot;
&gt;That line about good business is common enough, but the way that lard-bottomed asshole used it bordered on obsession.
&gt;&quot;Why don&#039;t you go back to your cell and think it over. Better think fast though, time is of the essence.&quot;
 
&gt;======&lt;
 
&gt;As Romy conducts you back to the detention area (at gunpoint, naturally, this is Romy we&#039;re talking about), your mind races.
&gt;On the face of it, it seems as though your boss sold you out to these pirates.
&gt;You can&#039;t entirely discount the possibility that the hyperspace conversation was arranged for your benefit.
&gt;But it certainly seems like something that soulless, bloodsucking fuck would do.
&gt;That bastard would fuck a snake if there was any profit to be had from it, and if he could get it to hold still long enough.
&gt;And there was the use of that signature phrase about good business, too.
&gt;Your thoughts are interrupted by a slim paw squeezing your ass.
&gt;You yelp at the unexpected contact, and turn to see Doc leering lasciviously at you over her shoulder as she walks down the passage in the other direction.
&gt;That red hair atop the lab coat is unmistakeable.
&gt;&quot;Feeling better Anonymous? Drop in sometime for a more thorough examination.&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t feel that much better, in light of recent revelations.
&gt;A prod in your ribs from a gun muzzle refocuses your attention on the task at hand.
&gt;&quot;Keep moving. Plenty of time for that later.&quot;
&gt;You really want to ask Romy what she means by that, but you wisely keep your questions to yourself.
&gt;Romy has no chill, after all.
&gt;Your mind gets back to speed almost immediately.
&gt;So your boss probably sold you out.
&gt;What are you going to do about it?
&gt;And just what the hell is your cargo anyhow?
&gt;The shipping manifest was pretty vague, but they don&#039;t just ship anything in a MK4.
&gt;The more you think about your circumstances, the fishier they begin to smell.
&gt;And it&#039;s not as if you really trusted Transfer Service, or the Corporate Sector Authority, or particularly that land-whale of a boss.
&gt;The question is, can you trust these ferrets?
&gt;Tika.
&gt;Musn&#039;t insult the gun-toting pirates, after all.
&gt;&quot;Home sweet home,&quot; Romy says, operating the control to open your cell.
&quot;Be it ever so humble.&quot;
&gt;Romy pushes you in and shuts the bars.
&gt;&quot;Get used to it, Pinky. You&#039;re going to be our guest for a while.&quot;
&quot;Only because someone got very lucky with a warp breaker. You never would have caught me otherwise.&quot;
&gt;Romy had been about to leave, but she stiffened at your first comment and returned to the bars of your cell.
&gt;You are only slightly relieved to note that she had holstered her sidearm.
&gt;&quot;Say that again to my face, Pinky.&quot;
&quot;People don&#039;t just pull armored hyperspace couriers over and hijack them. So someone got really lucky w-URK!&quot;
&gt;Romy&#039;s paw shoots between the bars and grabs you by the throat, then yanks you towards her.
&gt;Your headache gets worse as your head connects solidly with the bars.
&gt;&quot;Good gunners don&#039;t need luck, savvy?&quot; Romy hisses in your face, &quot;Good gunners got skills, and I&#039;m the best there is!&quot;
&gt;With that assertion she shoves you roughly away from the bars and stalks away, muttering darkly to herself.
&gt;You groan and pick yourself up.
&gt;It had cost you some intensification of your headache, but you consider it a fair trade for what Romy just pridefully told you.
&gt;There was no way they could have intercepted you with a warp breaker without knowing your track in advance.
&gt;So someone told them you would be coming.
&gt;Someone with complete knowledge of your route.
/If I ever meet that fat bastard again, I&#039;m going to boil him down for soap. Slowly./
&gt;Your vengeful thoughts are interrupted by a bubbling rumble from your midsection.
&gt;Yeah. You haven&#039;t eaten anything since your ship was hijacked.
&gt;So now your head and your stomach were complaining.
&quot;I wonder if they have room service.&quot;
&gt;You chuckle drily at your humorous observation, probably the only comfort you can expect from it.
&gt;&quot;Ahem,&quot; a small, polite voice drifts in from the bars.
&gt;So your audience is returning already.
&gt;Good thing you have your clothes on this time.
&gt;You&#039;re still facing the wall, rubbing the fresh bruise on your noggin, and you&#039;re not feeling very polite at the moment.
&quot;Whaddaya want...&quot;
&gt;&quot;I, uh, I just thought you might be hungry,&quot; the voice says timidly.
&gt;Suddenly you&#039;re feeling more polite.
&gt;You turn and see a slightly smaller, brown-furred Tika, wearing a plain gray apron and holding a container of some kind.
&quot;I am, actually.&quot;
&gt;The newcomer smiles nervously and turns the container on its side, and slides it neatly between the bars.
&gt;You notice that there isn&#039;t much behind the apron. Is this a male Tika?
&gt;You decide to see what a smile gets you as you take the proffered container.
&quot;Thanks. What&#039;s on the menu?&quot;
&gt;The newcomer&#039;s smile broadens slightly in response to yours.
&gt;&quot;Well, not much I&#039;m afraid. I added some broth for flavor though, otherwise it&#039;s like eating wet cardboard.&quot;
&gt;You sit and open the container, revealing a warm pile of mush topped with a plastic utensil of some kind.
&gt;You give it a sniff.
&quot;Smells pretty good, actually.&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re not lying.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m Andy, by the way,&quot; the newcomer announces, his voice getting slightly steadier, &quot;I&#039;m the ship&#039;s cook.&quot;
&quot;Anonymous.&quot;
&gt;You spoon some of the mush and chew it thoughtfully.
&gt;Yeah, kinda like wet cardboard alright, but it does have a tolerably pleasant flavor to it, which you guess comes from the broth.
&gt;&quot;Um, I don&#039;t mean to seem rude, but what are you?&quot;
&gt;You swallow and scoop up another bite.
&quot;Human. Haven&#039;t you met us before?&quot;
&gt;&quot;No, I haven&#039;t. This is my first trip away from home, actually.&quot;
&quot;Really?&quot;
&gt;He nods.
&quot;So what made you decide to be a pirate?&quot;
&gt;Andy actually blushes at this question, and fidgets nervously before answering.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not a pirate, I&#039;m a cook. There aren&#039;t many good jobs for males on Tikala though.&quot;
&gt;He fidgets some more before continuing.
&gt;&quot;Any job in space has to be more interesting than being stuck planetside all the time though, right? I mean, isn&#039;t that why you became an espo?&quot;
&gt;This again. You manage to keep your cool though, since Andy fed you.
&quot;I&#039;m not Security Police. I work for a private company.&quot;
&gt;You chuckle ruefully at your words.
&quot;Worked, actually. In light of recent events, I guess I&#039;ve been fired. And even if I wasn&#039;t, I quit.&quot;
&gt;You scoop up the last of the food that Andy brought you, then put the utensil backside the container before closing it and passing it back through the bars.
&quot;Thanks for the food, and I mean that sincerely.&quot;
&gt;Andy brightens at your praise.
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re welcome!&quot; He moves to take the container, but you hold on to it.
&quot;Hey Andy, could you do me another favor?&quot;
&gt;Andy searches your face uncertainly.
&gt;&quot;Maybe...&quot;
&quot;Could you give a message to the Captain for me?&quot;
&gt;Andy arches an eyebrow in surprise and his pupils dilate slightly.
&gt;&quot;Maybe....&quot;
&quot;Tell the Captain I&#039;m ready to make a deal.&quot;
&gt;You release the container, and Andy&#039;s smile seems to grow a bit.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll do my best.&quot;
&quot;Thanks.&quot;
&gt;Andy grins at you one last time before taking his container and scampering up the passageway.
/I have no idea what your plan is, you fat fuck./
/But whatever it is, I&#039;m going to do whatever I can to fuck it up, starting now./</textarea>
