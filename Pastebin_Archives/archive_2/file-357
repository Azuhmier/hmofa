        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Brahmin
&gt;Be Anon, survivor of the vault 100 experiment
&gt;Think of a battle royale game, and that was it
&gt;What a shitshow that was, at least you knew how to handle a bunch of weapons
&gt;You&#039;ve been wandering the wastes for a few years, meeting people along the way most good...
&gt;Some trying to shank you for your loot
&gt;You&#039;ve tried to get a travel buddy but the people you met either gave you the creeps or flat out didn&#039;t like you for &quot;Being a pampered vault baby&quot;
&gt;You&#039;ve turned to the lowest you could go, a slave
&gt;After coughing up enough caps to a shady bartender you get the location of a big slaver
&gt;You travel to the location, passing by traders, raiders, and settlers
&gt;All of them having a mish-mash of Human and Anthro residents
&gt;You swear you saw some guy with a Deathclaw walking off to some NCR camp
&gt;Before you know it, you&#039;re at the location marked on the map
&gt;Some shack in the middle of nowhere, remembering the instructions the bartender gave you
&gt;You knock on the metal part of the door twice and the wooden parts of it 4 times
&gt;You stand there for a few seconds before you hear somewhere undoing the lock of the door
&gt;It swings open, barely missing you revealing a rather tall man with scars all over his face, giving you an angry glare
&gt;You grimace inwardly and say a specific phrase the Bartender told you
&gt;&quot;Anthony, you never told me you had friends over.&quot;
&gt;His glare softens and moves to let you in, keeping his stare fixated on you
&gt;Once you&#039;re inside he closes the door and locks it again, walking over to the rug splayed on the floor
&gt;Pulling it away, it reveals a hatch door
&gt;You think how cliche it was, those cheesy spy movies you watched before you left the vault always did that
&gt;Shrugging it off, you see the man pulling open the hatch and walking down the stairs that were under it
&gt;You shuffle towards him and run down the stairs to pick up the pace
&gt;You follow him for a minute before the slim corridor opens up into a large room
&gt;Filled with Human and Anthros alike
&gt;Coyotes, Geckos, Brahmin... Cazadors? HOW?
&gt;They all shrink away as the man walks past, holding his hands behind his back ignoring them all
&gt;You shiver, regretting this visit slightly
&gt;He stops at the end of the cages turning around and looking at you
&gt;&quot;Go on, make your pick.&quot;
&gt;The suddenness of him talking after not making a sound just a minute ago catches you off guard
&gt;You simply nod and look around
&gt;ChristOnABike.mpeg
&gt;You look at the droves of slaves until you stop on a Brahmin Anthro
&gt;She&#039;s bickering with her second head about something you can&#039;t hear
&gt;You wave the man over and point to the Brahmin when he reaches you
&gt;&quot;Oh, her? Alright that&#039;ll be 150 caps.&quot;
&gt;150? For a slave? What a steal
&gt;You look at your pip-boy and time seemingly freezes in place
&gt;WeirdFeelingButOkay.mpeg
&gt;Handing him 150 caps he turns to the cage and slams a fist onto it, making the Brahmin woman jump
&gt;&quot;You got a new owner, packmule.&quot;
&gt;She quickly walks to the gate, keeping her gaze on the floor with both heads
&gt;The man unlocks the door and hands you a rope and a controller with 2 buttons on it, red and green
&gt;&quot;Red is to shock the slave, hold it down to set off the explosives, Green is to remove the collar.&quot; he explains in a dismissive tone
&gt;You stare at the controller, you control another beings life. Well you controlled others with bullets and shrapnel but you&#039;ll ignore those
&gt;You look back to the man who was walking towards the stairs before a tugging on your armor&#039;s sleeve catches your attention
&gt;It&#039;s the Brahmin, she&#039;s fidgeting with a horn with her other hand
&gt;&quot;Er, Mister thank you for buying us, we won&#039;t cause much trouble...&quot;
&gt;You give one of her heads a pat, she shrinks back slightly at it, to your surprise
&gt;A loud AHEM gets you to speed-walk to the stairs with your new slave
&gt;The man leads you outside, waiting for the Bovine to leave with you
&gt;He waves and flatly states
&gt;&quot;Stay safe, come back later&quot; he ends with a chuckle
&gt;You give a nervous chuckle back and pick up the pace when leaving
&gt;Feeling you&#039;re far away enough you set up camp
&gt;Looking at the Brahmin woman staring at the fire
&gt;She looked absolutely starved, ribs poking out, skin pressing on bone
&gt;Despite all this, she had a respectable bust, but why the fuck were you looking at that 
&gt;Her body in contrast to feral Brahmin had thin fur, with patches missing revealing the pink leathery skin underneath
&gt;Barely anything covering her, scraps of rags were all that were left
&gt;Noticing this she looks at you, a confused expression appearing on her
&gt;&quot;What are you looking at, do we have something on us?&quot;
&gt;You quickly shake your head
&gt;&quot;No... no. Just, gonna ask what do you eat?&quot;
&gt;She puts a hand to her left head, thinking about the question
&gt;&quot;Uh, we used to eat Agave fruit and plantlife in general.&quot;
&gt;You look down at your pip-boy, time feeling like it froze up again you scroll through your Aid items
&gt;Finding a few bits and pieces of fruits and herbs
&gt;Bringing them out from the void that is Robco&#039;s engineering you present them to her
&gt;Both heads stare at you for a second, raising a finger in protest then dropping it
&gt;She takes the items and gives an appreciative nod with both heads
&gt;It&#039;s been a few minutes and she&#039;s still munching on the plant life while you&#039;re awkwardly sitting around staring at her
&gt;You clear your throat and try to break the ice or at least break this weird tension
&gt;&quot;So... tell me about yourself, uh...&quot;
&gt;The right head answers your question on their name
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m Steph, and my sister&#039;s name is Annie. But you can call us whatever you&#039;d like, master.&quot;
&gt;You visibly cringe when she says master, it always rubbed you the wrong way
&gt;&quot;Look, don&#039;t call me master first off call me by my name, Anon. Secondly-&quot; You snap at them
&gt;She shrinks back slightly at the sudden change of tone from you
&gt;AwFuckICantBelieveYouveDoneThis.png
&gt;You immediately change your tone, not wanting to scare these poor girls even more than they probably already were
&gt;&quot;Secondly, i&#039;m sorry. I&#039;ve been a bit.. stressed for the past few weeks, I just want you to know you aren&#039;t going to be treated like some labrat.&quot;
&gt;You knew how it was to be one, ugh
&gt;Before you could get out your last sentence a yawn escapes you
&gt;Looking down at your Pip-boy, you check the time, the same time stopping feeling not being there anymore
&gt;Aw, you liked that feeling
&gt;... It was like 2 am
&gt;Guess this adventure took longer than expected
&gt;You stand up and stretch, popping a few bones in response
&gt;You hear a disgusted, &quot;Ew&quot; from both of the Brahmin woman&#039;s heads
&gt;Oh right, the slave that you bought
&gt;Where the hell was she gonna sleep?
&gt;You look around for anything that could make good padding as a makeshift bed
&gt;Nothing in sight, you look to the woman staring at the fire with both heads again
&gt;You clear your throat to catch her attention
&gt;&quot;Hey, you can sleep on the cot in the tent, i&#039;ve got my armor for padding.&quot;
&gt;She looks at you with a confused look plastered on both faces
&gt;Annie speaks up
&gt;&quot;A-are you sure? We can just sleep outs-&quot;
&gt;You cut her off by grabbing her hand and pulling her towards the tent
&gt;Even in her malnourished state, she was pretty strong slightly holding you back from dragging her at full speed
&gt;Well she was a bovine, a mutated one at that, they were well known for being quite strong
&gt;Pulling her in the tent, you present the bedroll sitting in it
&gt;She fidgets a bit, looking around then stopping on you Annie mutters out again
&gt;&quot;Are you really sure? We can just go outsi-&quot;
&gt;Cutting her off again you wave your hand 
&gt;&quot;Nonsense, i&#039;m sure about it. I&#039;ve done this before... Uh many many times before.&quot;
&gt;She looks back at the cot then both heads sigh apprehensively
&gt;&quot;If you&#039;re sure ma-... Anon.&quot;
&gt;You give her a pat on both heads and a smile
&gt;&quot;Good, wake me up if you need anything, I mean ANYTHING.&quot;
&gt;With that being said, you exit the tent
&gt;Walking up to a large boulder, you pull out your battle-rifle, holding it tight
&gt;With a sigh, your eyes become heavier as you struggle to keep them open
&gt;Soon, you&#039;re in an incomprehensible dream
&gt;A mish mash of your past memories and other random bits and pieces
&gt;Though one sound jumps out at you more prominently than any other
&gt;It was extremely muffled, but you can help but try to find it
&gt;Until you&#039;re shaken awake
&gt;&quot;Hrng, Wha- huh?&quot;
&gt;A muddled black figure stands over you
&gt;You freak out slightly and instinctively grab the weapon next to you, pointing it at the figure
&gt;It backs up with hands raised as your vision clears
&gt;It&#039;s... the Steph and Annie, lowering your weapon you groan
&gt;&quot;Sorry... sorry, just instincts I didn&#039;t mean to point it at you.&quot;
&gt;Steph gulps a lump in her throat and lowers her hands, the body of the two quivering slightly
&gt;You place both hands on your temples, sighing
&gt;The thought is interrupted by your stomach grumbling
&gt;Right, you didn&#039;t eat yesterday
&gt;Lifting your Pip-boy up you scroll through the Aid tab
&gt;Old Spam, Sugar bombs... Eugh this stuff is way past the expiration date, and irradiated to boot
&gt;Why did you even carry those around... oh wait, use in a dire situation
&gt;Mentally facepalming you scroll down a bit farther until you see raw meat from animals you&#039;ve killed on your journey
&gt;Thankfully, this Robco (TM) void of a Pip-boy &quot;backpack&quot; doesn&#039;t let stuff spoil
&gt;Pulling out a chunk of Bighorner meat you look back up to Steph and Annie sitting at the ashes of the past fire
&gt;You should ask her why she&#039;s so fascinated by fire, but not right now, right now is food time
&gt;Quickly looking through your Pip-boy again you pull out extra dried leaves and logs along with a skillet
&gt;When you pulled put the skillet you feel like you hear the faint sound of a Bostonian yelling out something
&gt;Need a Dias pencer here or something?
&gt;Shrugging the noise off you walk to the campfire with the supplies in arms
&gt;Dropping the kindling into the pit you set it aflame and prop the skillet over it
&gt;You slide the chunk of meat into the skillet, hearing that satisfying sizzle that you&#039;ll never get tired of hearing
&gt;Figuring this may take awhile you sit next to your Bovine &quot;slave&quot;
&gt;Sitting next to her and looking you get a better look at the her thin coat of fur
&gt;Brown and white, like an Ayrshire if you remember correctly
&gt;Steph noticing you turns her head to look at you
&gt;&quot;Yes mast-Uh... Anon, do you need something?&quot;
&gt;You try to summon a question on the spot, only to fail and mutter out giberish
&gt;&quot;Heghehg&quot;
&gt;You mentally facepalm again, she was giving you a concerned look
&gt;&quot;Uhm, Anon are you okay? Do we need to administer one of the healing needles?&quot;
&gt;You shake your head and finally think of a question
&gt;&quot;Steph, Annie, do you need more to eat... you look like skeletons.&quot;
&gt;Voluptuous ones, heheh
&gt;Oh god, skeletons with tits are gonna be stuck in your head for awhile now
&gt;Fuck.holoimage
&gt;Both heads look down at their body, looking at their thin and probably fragile figure
&gt;Annie speaks instead of Steph who was still looking at their body
&gt;&quot;I suppose we do, but we won&#039;t eat too much of your food reserv-&quot;
&gt;You wave your hand dismissively 
&gt;&quot;Oh hush, you aren&#039;t going to mess up my food reserve.&quot;
&gt;On the topic of food, a heavenly smell wafts through your nose
&gt;Ah, your steaks are done
&gt;Abruptly stopping the conversation you stand up and speed walk to the skillet and give it a good few shakes
&gt;You place it on a rather conveniently placed rock that was perfect at sitting height to eat on
&gt;Pulling out two knives you get to work on cutting the meat
&gt;You go to town on it, savoring each bite of flavor
&gt;Unbeknownst to you, your &quot;slaves&quot; were staring at you, mouths slightly agape
&gt;You let out a loud belch and sigh out in contentment
&gt;Looking to the Bovine woman, they&#039;re back to staring at the fire
&gt;No better time than now, you guess
&gt;Packing up the skillet and knives you saunter over to her and take a seat next to her
&gt;Annie looks over to you then back to the fire, letting her head drop onto your shoulder
&gt;OhOkaylol
&gt;&quot;Hey, you two. You&#039;re always staring at the fire whenever I see you, why so interested?&quot;
&gt;Annie sighs but keeps her head resting on your shoulder
&gt;Steph takes lead of the answer, replying in a rather melancholic tone
&gt;&quot;We could have just been meat, nothing more than food for things to eat. Instead, were here, owned by a wanderer who swears he&#039;ll help, but we aren&#039;t even sure of it, even if it is genuine.&quot;
&gt;After finishing the sentence she lets her head fall to her hands, rubbing her eyes and forehead
&gt;You realize you just ate something that is the closest related to her in the wasteland
&gt;Gah, you feel like shit now
&gt;You sigh inwardly and stand up offering a hand to her
&gt;&quot;Come on, we&#039;ve got to go, sun&#039;s bright today.&quot;
&gt;She eyes you carefully before placing a hand in yours
&gt;Pulling her up you quickly take down the ramshackled camp, putting it gods know where
&gt;Looking down at your Pip-boy you stare at the map for a few minutes, marking a trading post you were told of then lowering your pip-boy
&gt;Steph and Annie were staring off in the distance talking to each other in hushed tones 
&gt;Clearing your throat they both stop their conversation and look at you</textarea>
