        <textarea class="textarea">The sound was almost rhythmic in it&#039;s uniformity. Something sinking into the dirt, and the splattering of clay as it deposited the dirt elsewhere. 
As it continued across the desert, a few passing lights illuminated the scene. A shape, hunched in the dull red twilight as a well kept shovel moved dirt with patience and care.
A large glossy box sat nearby in the dirt, with a smaller travel suitcase next to that.
The hole he dug was sizable, and he was now working on deepening it.
As the neon from the distant diner flickered off, the shape looked up, then to a watch on his wrist. He took a long drink from a silver flask and sat on his large box, looking briefly at it as he stroked it&#039;s surface before the sound of movement caused him to jerk up. His left hand subtly vanished under his large leather coat that was fair too large but successful in hiding his body.
The movement came from a small group from the diner who slowed as they were spotted. The figure panted quietly behind his gas mask.
&quot;You okay dude? Weather&#039;s pretty hot for an old guy to be burying treasure&quot; the dingo snorted, ear cocked and head tilted. The cat next to the dingo was straining to look around the figure at his belongings before she gasped, ears flattening &quot;what the fuck, is that a-&quot;
&quot;DON&#039;T GOT NO TREASURE, NOTHING HERE FOR YOU MOVE ON.&quot; 
His voice muffled through the mask so he yelled to make himself heard. The larger wolf snorted &quot;relax man, it was just a joke, we just wanted to see if you needed-&quot; the cat grabbed her friends, pulling them away, earning confused growls. &quot;That&#039;s a goddamn coffin! What the fuck?&quot; She spoke, the two looking back as the sun slowly rose over the red mountains.
The man had not moved, perched on his dark olive colored coffin like a ghoul. &quot;Hey, why do you have that coffin?&quot; &quot;Come on! We gotta call the cops!&quot; 
With a swiftness, the three froze as the figure held out a long shotgun from his duster. &quot;NO COPS&quot;
The wolf snarled, baring her teeth, moving to shield her friends. The figure shifted, behind his mask glancing at his watch. &quot;I&#039;m behind schedule,  you, big girl you can help me by digging&quot; &quot;Fuck you&quot; but a lowering of the gun made her slowly move and pick up a shovel, digging. &quot;You two, by the coffin, move&quot; and the two obeyed, all fluffed and fury.

&quot;It&#039;s not what&#039;s in the box, it&#039;s what&#039;s  going in the box&quot; the man sighed, lowering the gun slightly. &quot;I&#039;m sorry, but the cops can&#039;t come until I&#039;m finished here&quot;
The wolf grunted and tossed some dirt on his shoes &quot;and you can&#039;t have witnesses?&quot; 
The man sighed,  shaking his head. &quot;Truth is, I&#039;m not here to hurt anybody, but I won&#039;t let you kind folks ruin my plans&quot; &quot;sure, and the shotgun is for snakes and lizards&quot; the cat hissed.
