        <textarea class="textarea">Of aliens and competition - light gyaku ntr

&gt;It&#039;s been almost a year since the world fell to the aliens
&gt;Well, we call them aliens, but more accurately they&#039;re some kind of mutation caused by some strange alien genetic code that is highly adaptive and aggressive
&gt;It happened so fast - first just a single town had reports of a strange event and then a communications blackout before shortly returning to normal
&gt;but then the politicians and other seats of power in the surrounding areas started acting strangely, with unilateral votes for strange policies and priorities
&gt;we might have stood a chance if any of those men had reported their wives missing
&gt;but who has time for that when you&#039;re in the thrall of an empath anthro woman willing to fuck like rabbits (assuming they aren&#039;t one)
---------------
&gt;Lola, a sweet girl I assume was once a squirrel of some kind, begs me to reconsider as she leads me to the gates
&gt;&quot;please, would it really be so bad? You don&#039;t understand what they&#039;re going to-&quot;
&gt;I silence her with a glare
&gt;&quot;I won&#039;t change my mind. Let&#039;s just get this over with.&quot;
&gt;I feel a twinge of regret as a tear rolls down her face. Defeated, she points to where I&#039;m to stand and backs away before a gate drops to seal me in
&gt;I swallow my heart and steel myself. This is an arena of some kind for sure. I&#039;ll have to fight to survive.
&gt;the gates before me open and I&#039;m blinded by pulsing neon and deafened by blaring fanfare
&gt;A feminine voice with a very pronounced impediment fills the auditorium
&gt;&quot;WELLLLLLLCOME LADIESSSSSSS AND GENTLEMEN TO THE MAIN EVENT OF TONIGHT&#039;SSSSSSS ESSsTRUSSS CARNIVAL CSSSSSELEBRATION!&quot;
&gt;&quot;WE&#039;VE BEEN SSSSAVING THISSS ONE SSSSSINCE THE GREAT TRANSSSITION! THAT&#039;S AN ENTIRE YEAR OF PATIENCE JUST FOR THE SSSSAKE OF YOU GOOD FOLKSS&quot;
&gt;I&#039;m met with cheers and catcalls as I stumble out into the arena. As my eyes adjust to the light I notice that while the stands are as expected the equipment and terrain certainly don&#039;t seem like they&#039;re for a fight
&gt;&quot;THISSSS CUTIE WASSSS FOUND GUILTY OF CRIMESSSS AGAINSSST THE SSSSSSTATE AND CONTINUED FRATERNIZZZZZATION WITH A PRE-EVENT FEMALE! THIS FEMALE!&quot;
&gt;wait, what!? It can&#039;t be!
&gt;The crowd boos and jeers as a hole opens in the floor of the arena, and a platform emerged. And there&#039;s my wife, frightened but unharmed, strapped upright on a metal table.
&gt;&quot;AND NOW OUR CHOSEN MATCH FOR THE PRISONER, THE ONE YOU ALL KNOW IS READY TO PROVE HER AND OUR ULTIMATE SSSSSSSUPERIORITY! THE RISING SSSSSTAR FOUND ON &quot;SSSSSO YOU THINK YOU CAN MATE,&quot; BONNIE &#039;BUNNY&#039; MAY!
-------------
&gt;explosions draw everyone&#039;s attention to the other side of the arena as rock music interspersed with moans blares
&gt;An hourglass - well, plus bunny ears - figure appears in the doorway then leaps high into the air before gracefully landing closer to the center of the arena
&gt;the bunny girl, around 5&#039;5&quot; at most with grey and white coloring and long white hair began to dance for the crowd like a stripper, shaking her ass and showing off just how flexible she could be
&gt;guess I&#039;ll be fighting for my life with an erection
&gt;she finishes and gives me a wink, then walks over to my wife. I can see them saying something when the announcer&#039;s voice returns
&gt;&quot;ALLLLLRIGHT LADIESSSS AND GENTLEMEN, YOU ALL KNOW THE RULES: NO FORCED ENTRY, NO FULL BLOWN CONTROL, AND NO COERCION BY THREATS. EMPATHIC AND BIOLOGICAL METHODS ARE ALLOWED. BOTH PRISONERS WILL BE SET FREE IF THE MAN CAN RESIST FOR 45 MINUTES. IF NOT THEIR FATE WILL BE DECIDED BY THE EXECUTIONET, BONNIE&quot;
&gt;wait...what? Those rules don&#039;t make any sense
&gt;&quot;READY, AAAND!&quot;
&gt;no time to think now
&gt;I tense up, ready to defend myself
&gt;&quot;BEGIN!&quot;
&gt;Before I can blink Bonnie is already gone from her starting position and has broken straight through my guard
&gt;she knocks my arms aside and grabs my head
&gt;I&#039;ve seen enough muay thai to know I&#039;m about to die
&gt;I close my eyes and brace for a knee
&gt;she yanks my head down towards her
&gt;and shoves her tongue in my mouth, moaning loudly
&gt;what the fuck!?
-----------------
&gt;&quot;A SSSSTRONG MOVE OUT OF THE GATE, WILL OUR CHALLENGER RECOVER!?&quot;
&gt;my head is swimming as my mouth is being probed by my executioner
&gt;I guess fear and arousal are pretty similar because holy shit am I hard
&gt;recovering from the shock I push against Bonnie and stumble back
&gt;she gives a playful smile and licks her lips as I try to regain my composure...but something&#039;s wrong
&gt;I can&#039;t...my mind...thinking is getting harder
&gt;and is bonnie getting hotter?
&gt;that kiss was so ni-
&gt;&quot;FIGHT IT, FIGHT IT PLEASE!&quot;
&gt;the cries of my wife bring me back to my senses
&gt;I don&#039;t know what that was but this sick game is going too far
&gt;Bonnie puts on a fake pout before crouching down, preparing to strike. I&#039;ve got to be ready for this one.
-----------------
&gt;she rushes at me like before
&gt;I go to stop her from reaching in like before
&gt;and instead take the full force of a flying peach to the face
&gt;I land with her ass smothering my face, her legs pinning my arms, and her hands already exploring my crotch
&gt;&quot;Mmmm, have you got a nice big carrot for me, smart guy?&quot;
&gt;She lets out a squeel as she tears off my pants and the crowd roars, then she begins to stroke and lick with literally award-winning technique
--------------
&gt;wave after wave of pleasure assaults me as bonnie slurps away and grinds her now soaked and pungent crotch in my face
&gt;that smell again...so good...
&gt;I can&#039;t think straight again
&gt;as if on cue Bonnie stops sucking and lifts her ass up before turning to me
&gt;&quot;Mmmm, are you ready for the finale yet baby&quot;
&gt;I can only moan in weak protest as a response
&gt;Bonnie flips around kissing me deeply and grinding her lips on my cock
&gt;&quot;Tell me you want it. You have to. You want to. You need it. You know you do.&quot;
&gt;her words bounce around my head more than my own thoughts
&gt;wait, are they my thoughts?
&gt;She&#039;s so hot...I want her...I need her
&gt;I grip her ass and thrust upwards, giving in to whatever the fuck is going on
&gt;she screams in pleasure and hugs me tight as we fuck in front if everyone
&gt;with every thrust I feel less guilt and more love
&gt;with every gasp I feel my cares slipping away, and that crying voice in the back of hearing just seems to drift away as I fall into bliss
&gt;&quot;AND THAT&#039;SSSSS THE GAME FOLKSSSSS, BONNIE HAS BROKEN RECORDS AND HEARTS TONIGHT, AND ASSSS THE VICTOR WILL NOW DECIDE THE FATE OF THE CONDEMNED!&quot;
&gt;Bonnie, tongue lolling out of her mouth as she continues to ride, gives two quick hand signals
&gt;&quot;WELL NOT MUCH OF A SSSSSSURPRISE THERE FOLKSSS, OUR CHAMPION WILL BE TAKING HER NEW LOVE HOME AS HER SSSSSSANCTIONED MATE, AND THE PRE WILL BE BURNED AT THE SSSSSSTAKE! EVERYBODY GRAB YOUR TORCHESSSS AND HEAD TO THE SSSSSSACRIFICE PIT!&quot;
&gt;I&#039;m vaguely aware of the arena emptying out as I pull Bonnie down with her back against my chest biting her neck as I prepare to cum deep inside her
&gt;we embrace afterwards and she impatiently strokes me and whispers &quot;you love me...&quot; over and over while my little soldier recovers
&gt;I do, I can&#039;t deny that
&gt;but still, it feels like I&#039;m forgetting something...
