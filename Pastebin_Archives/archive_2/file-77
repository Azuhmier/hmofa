You were low on food, and you had to return to your job.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were going to spend one last night in the forest, then you were going to head back to civilization to resume your monotonous existence.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was almost nightfall, and you were just finishing your dinner.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;M.R.E. spaghetti, your least favorite menu item.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You throw the plastic waste from the packaging away into small bag you had brought with you for trash.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking back at your tent, you sigh.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To get into it she had torn a huge hole into it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She had kept you warm when she had slept alongside you, but when you slept alone last night, it was almost unbearably cold.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She had broken your sleeping bag&#039;s zipper, so you couldn&#039;t even fully close it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That&#039;s what you get for camping in the middle of fall, you suppose.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You step into your tent through the gaping hole the Wolfess had left, and you sit down on the sleeping bag.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take off your shoes, but keep all your other clothing on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Unless you wanted to freeze your ass off, you had to sleep fully dressed in your jeans, socks, shirt, and jacket.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It might not be the most comfortable, but you would be headed back home tomorrow and you would be able to sleep back in your own bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lived by yourself in a cheap apartment on the edge of town.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You weren&#039;t in contact with any of your family, as they had kind of disowned you after you had a drunken incident involving a snowblower, the family cat, and a gallon of gasoline a few years ago. Fun times.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn&#039;t have any real friends, just the other janitorial staff you worked with at a local office.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had taken what little vacation time you had to go on this camping trip deep in the woods.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was said that Tribal Anthros were occasionally spotted in these woods, but you ignored the warnings.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were kind of glad that you did, as if you had went to some other campground then you would have never met the Wolfess.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh, and lay back on your sleeping bag, closing it as much as you can.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shut your eyes and try to sleep before it gets too cold.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That night, you wake up in your tent all cold and shivering.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You gasp from the sudden shock of cold, and you can see your breath as you exhale.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Damn, it had to be maybe 20 degrees outside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was windy out, and it was blowing directly into your tent from the huge hole the Wolfess had slashed into it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, shit. You guess you can&#039;t just ignore the cold tonight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reach over and turn on a small electric lantern.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grab the lantern, throw your shoes on, and head outside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If you didn&#039;t want to freeze to death tonight, you had to find a way to make it so the wind wasn&#039;t blowing into your tent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn&#039;t want to risk trying to turn it. If you took the stakes that were holding the tent out, then the whole damn thing could blow away.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You step outside the tent and HOLY SHIT is it cold out!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You cross your arms and rub them together, trying in vain to warm yourself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A scary thought crosses your mind:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had informed your coworkers you were taking some days off, but you didn&#039;t tell anyone where you were going.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If you froze to death out here, nobody would ever find your corpse.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shaking your head to dispel the bad thoughts, you examine your tent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was a really small dome tent. You had gotten it for $20 at a local sporting goods shop awhile back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could really see where the $20 had went. The thing was really cheap looking, and didn&#039;t even have a rain shield.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You looked around your campsite for something to lean against the hole, but there was nothing but pinecones and dead leaves.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You really wish that Wolfess was here. She had slept alongside you after she had torn the hole, and even though you were in your underwear, you had still kept really warm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sadly, you didn&#039;t think she was coming back anytime soon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You go over to the fire, and try to start it up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No luck. It had rained a bit yesterday, and all the wood and kindling was wet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were going to die in the fucking woods all because you wanted some time off of your unfulfilling job.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Dammit, /out/ hadn&#039;t prepared you for something like this!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stand back up next to the dead fire, wondering what you&#039;re going to do.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your toes and fingers are starting to feel numb, and your jacket isn&#039;t keeping any heat in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Suddenly, you hear some noises from the bushes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Please please please be the Wolfess.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You see a figure emerge from the darkness, and it&#039;s a bit hard to make it out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you can&#039;t mistake that silhouette. It&#039;s a canine for sure!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It walks over to you and the light from the lantern falls upon it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Two things register in your mind as you look at it&#039;s face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One. Yeah, that&#039;s a tribal canine all right.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Two. Oh shit, this one is NOT your Wolfess.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking at the Wolf, he was clearly male.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;His fur was a light brown color, and he wore no chest wrap.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He wore roughly made fur shorts, along with a leather belt to hold them up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;On the belt he only carried a stone hatchet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He stood a couple feet away from you, looking you dead in the eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re too scared to move. What is he going to do? Punish you for being in his tribe&#039;s territory?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe the Wolfess was only trying to have some fun with you before you had to be killed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had a knife with you, but it was back in your tent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you turn to look at the tent, the Wolf suddenly charges you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You drop the lantern as he grabs you and slings you over his shoulder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He looks over his shoulder at you, and mumbles something to you in his incomprehensible language.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He starts to walk at a brisk pace through the woods, in the direction of where the Wolfess went when you last saw her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shit, where is he taking you!?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get one last glimpse at your camp, but eventually you can no longer see the light from the lantern you had dropped.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The trip through the forest is a bumpy one.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had stopped struggling after awhile; the cold sapping your strength.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When the Wolf had felt you go limp, he stopped to make sure you were okay.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When he saw you were still awake, he gave a strange smile at you, and then proceeded to run.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were bouncing on his shoulder, and it was hurting your ribs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear a howl in the distance, and he stops.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He pulls you off of his shoulder, and sets you down on your feet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking in the direction of the howl, you can see lights.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s probably fires from his tribe.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to pull away from the Wolf, terrified of what you think is about to happen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He isn&#039;t having any of it though, and grabs you firmly by the arm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He points a clawed finger at you, and says something to you in his language.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t know what he&#039;s saying, but it&#039;s clearly meant to chastise you for trying to run.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He starts walking, and yanks you along after him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re terrified, and have forgotten all about the cold that&#039;s currently eating at your bones.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After five minutes of walking towards the distant lights, you approach the edge of the Village.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Wolf leads you through the village.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s larger than you thought it would be. It seems that they all live in rounded square huts made of pelts stretched over a wooden frame. In many huts, smoke is pouring out of a raised hole in the center of the roofs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There are some campfires outside burning too, with wolves holding spears sitting around them. They&#039;re likely guards or warriors protecting the tribe members while they sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you are led through the village, you can see multiple Wolves poke their heads out of their huts to get a look at you. Many of them have probably never even seen a human before, and here one was walking through their village.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are led to the largest hut in the middle of the village.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The wolf ushers you inside the door, and you reluctantly enter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re instantly warmed by the heat of a small fire burning in the center of the hut. It&#039;s sitting in a small pit, and has a flat stone laying over it. On the stone is a small ceramic cup full of some strange liquid.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Inside, an old Wolf is sitting cross-legged. His fur is is black, but grayed around his muzzle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He&#039;s wearing fur trousers, and a deerskin shawl around his shoulders. A decorative headdress adorns his head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He smiles at you, and gestures to a mat near him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking behind you, you can the the brown Wolf is standing outside the door, watching you. Likely to make sure you don&#039;t make a run for it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There&#039;s no way you would ever make it out of the village.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Resigning yourself to your fate, you walk over to the mat and sit on it, facing the old Wolf.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To your great surprise, the old Wolf greets you in your own language.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hello, Human.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I am the Elder of this village. My name is Segenam. Yours?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re stunned by the introduction, but you manage to stammer out a greeting, telling him your name.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;My greetings to you, Anon. It has been many, many moons since a Human has been in this Village.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We are the Twin Paw Clan. We have lived here for countless generations.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I was told by the fisher-woman Kanti that you had constructed a hut on our land.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stammer out an apology, and tell him you didn&#039;t mean to offend him or his tribe.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell him that if he let you go just this once, you promise they would never see you again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He raises an eyebrow upon hearing this, and tells you:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hmmm? Oh, you are nervous. There is no need for that. We will not harm you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh in relief. That&#039;s one burden off of your shoulders.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He continues:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Kanti has bonded with you. She tells me you have knowledge of fire-making, and you willingly bonded with her.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Kanti must be the Wolfess you met a couple days ago. You ask him what he meant by &quot;bonding&quot;, and he responds:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ehh... Being together. You rested in her embrace. You bathed her. Both of these are traditional courting rituals.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He gives a small smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;She tells me she enjoys your scent, as well.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I extend to you an invitation to join my Tribe. I understand that this may be a sudden choice, but you must choose now.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shit, things were moving really fast here. First he tells you that he isn&#039;t going to kill you, then he tells you that the Wolfess wants to be your wife or something, and now he&#039;s invited you to join the tribe...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He continues:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;If you accept, you will be treated as one of our own. You will be expected to contribute to the Tribe, and participate in our rituals.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask him why he wants you to join the Tribe, and he reponds, shaking his grey muzzle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Not me. Kanti wishes for you to join us. She wants you to be her life-mate.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Damn, the Wolfess really does want to be your wife.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon, you must choose. I am old, and I wish to sleep soon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh man, he&#039;s really putting you on the spot here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take a few seconds to contemplate your choices.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can either go back to monotonous life, work as an underpaid janitor, and go home to an empty bed every day until you die....</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or you can join the Tribe, and actually contribute to your community. And every night you would come home to a warm Wolfess to cuddle you until you fall asleep...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yeah, this an easy choice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell him you&#039;ll stay with the Tribe, and he smiles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Good. Kanti will be happy, and it will be nice to have the knowledge of a Human with us.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Speaking of Humans, you ask him how he knows English.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;When I came of age, I left the Tribe and lived among your people for several years. After awhile, I returned.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;My knowledge of the outside world made me a valuable member of the tribe, and when I reached the proper age, I was made Elder of the Tribe.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Of course, your knowledge makes you valuable as well. We occasionally go out to trade with your peoples. We trade furs and meat for medicines and other trinkets.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You would be a good interpreter for these transactions. I am old, and I find myself unable to make the long journey to the trading post on the edge of our border.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I will teach you our language. That way you can tell members of your species what we wish to trade for.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s nice to hear you won&#039;t be a burden on the Tribe.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Now. We must complete the Ritual to induct you into the Tribe.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod, and tell him you&#039;re ready.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Very good, Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Segenam motions for you to come closer, and the two of you sit near the fire.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He calls out the Wolf standing by the door who brought you here, and he stands over the two of you. Watching.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;He will bear witness to the ritual. It is necessary.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Segenam reaches behind him, and grasps a gnarled old stick.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He waves it around your body, his eyes closed, chanting some strange words in his native tongue.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He takes hold of your arm, and holds it over the cup of liquid sitting over the heated stone on the fire.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hold still.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He rakes the stick across your palm, drawing some blood.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He holds your hand over the cup, and allows some drops of your blood to fall into the cup of liquid.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He lets go, and you hold your hand. The cut is small, and should heal easily on its own.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon. Now you must drink.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He hands you the cup.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I would not recommend smelling it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take his advice, breathing through your mouth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You bring the cup to your mouth, and take a big gulp.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You regret it immediately.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s the vilest shit you&#039;ve ever tasted in your whole life.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You cough and sputter, and the Elder gives a knowing chuckle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Heheheh! Not the most delectable of teas, isn&#039;t it?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It is not supposed to be. It is the essence of the forest, and is used in inducting members into the Tribe.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Segenam says something to the Wolf behind you, and he nods.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Wolf leaves the tent, and walks off.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;That was Matwau. He has witnessed your union into the Tribe.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He gives a wide grin at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Welcome to the Twin Paw Clan.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Matwau is going back to your camp to retrieve your belongings.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;For now though, I will show you to your new mate&#039;s tent. She has been working hard to make her hut suitable for you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The old Wolf stands up with a grunt, and gestures for you to follow him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Segenam leads you to a hut near the edge of the village.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;This is the hut, Anon. Go on in and greet your Mate. She has missed you terribly. I will be going to sleep now.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask him how you&#039;ll communicate with her, and he answers:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You will be living with her. You can try and teach her some English. She has always been a quick learner.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That&#039;s not really what you meant, but he dismisses you with a wave of the hand, and he walks back to his hut.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You swallow, then head inside the hut.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As soon as you enter the hut, you&#039;re tackled by a dark gray wall of fluff.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lay there pinned, and a familiar muzzle buries itself into your shoulder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sniffs at you, and lets out a happy yip.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She practically bathes you face with her tongue, spreading her thin, sticky saliva all over your face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You greet her, and she lets out another happy yip.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gets off of you, sitting on her knees.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking at her, she has a happy grin on her face a mile wide. Her tail is wagging faster than you knew was possible.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She brings you close, hugging you against her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sighs happily when you wrap your arms around her, getting a whiff of her familiar scent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you let go of each other, you get a look at the hut.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The hut looks similar to how the Elder&#039;s hut looked, but smaller.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There&#039;s a small fire with a flat cooking stone over it, heating the space to a comfortable temperature.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In one corner is several sacks of what you assume to be either food or various other supplies.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In another corner is a wooden container with a primitive fishing pole sitting on it. This must be where she stores her fishing supplies.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;On the other side of the hut sits a pile of pelts, along with a sack that appears to be stuffed with feathers. This must be the bed. It looks big enough for the two of you to sleep comfortably together.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Speaking of which...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Kanti gently ushers you over to the pelts, and the two of you lay down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She removes her tribal clothing, and huffs when she sees you still fully dressed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You remove your clothing, stripping everything off and laying it on the ground.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Kanti seems satisfied, and she pulls you close, snuggling you tight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pulls a large pelt over the two of you, and you relax into her embrace.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her arms are wrapped around you, and your head is pushed deep into the floof of her neck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She lifts one of her digitigrade legs and sets it down over you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your body is enveloped by her warmth and fur, and her scent fills your nose.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t think you&#039;ll be cold ever again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After awhile, your can hear Kanti softly breathing. She&#039;s asleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wrap your arms around her sleeping form, and drift off peacefully to sleep.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	EPILOGUE</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	TWO YEARS LATER</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Be Anon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were the only human member of the Twin Paw Clan.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After you had left Human civilization, you had taken to your new role in the Tribe.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whenever the Tribe left to trade with Humans, you were there to make sure everything went smoothly, and that both parties left satisfied.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you weren&#039;t doing that, you spent the day fishing with your mate Kanti.

        <textarea class="textarea">Night With a Wolfess
(Sequel to Day with a Wolfess)

&gt;Be Anon.
&gt;You out were out deep innawoods, having yourself a nice mini-vacation.
&gt;Or you had been, up until a couple days ago.
&gt;A couple nights ago, you had woken up to find a large Wolfess in your tent.
&gt;At first you had thought she was going to bite your head off, but instead she had just pulled you into her soft embrace and cuddled with you all night.
&gt;She then had spent the next morning and afternoon with you, but had abruptly departed.
&gt;She had left you a couple mementos, but hadn&#039;t returned.
&gt;You had waited all of yesterday for her to return, but she never showed up.
&gt;Sadly, you couldn&#039;t wait for her any longer. You were low on food, and you had to return to your job.
&gt;You were going to spend one last night in the forest, then you were going to head back to civilization to resume your monotonous existence.

&gt;It was almost nightfall, and you were just finishing your dinner.
&gt;M.R.E. spaghetti, your least favorite menu item.
&gt;You throw the plastic waste from the packaging away into small bag you had brought with you for trash.
&gt;Looking back at your tent, you sigh.
&gt;To get into it she had torn a huge hole into it.
&gt;She had kept you warm when she had slept alongside you, but when you slept alone last night, it was almost unbearably cold.
&gt;She had broken your sleeping bag&#039;s zipper, so you couldn&#039;t even fully close it.
&gt;That&#039;s what you get for camping in the middle of fall, you suppose.

&gt;You step into your tent through the gaping hole the Wolfess had left, and you sit down on the sleeping bag.
&gt;You take off your shoes, but keep all your other clothing on.
&gt;Unless you wanted to freeze your ass off, you had to sleep fully dressed in your jeans, socks, shirt, and jacket.
&gt;It might not be the most comfortable, but you would be headed back home tomorrow and you would be able to sleep back in your own bed.
&gt;You lived by yourself in a cheap apartment on the edge of town.
&gt;You weren&#039;t in contact with any of your family, as they had kind of disowned you after you had a drunken incident involving a snowblower, the family cat, and a gallon of gasoline a few years ago. Fun times.
&gt;You didn&#039;t have any real friends, just the other janitorial staff you worked with at a local office.
&gt;You had taken what little vacation time you had to go on this camping trip deep in the woods.
&gt;It was said that Tribal Anthros were occasionally spotted in these woods, but you ignored the warnings.
&gt;You were kind of glad that you did, as if you had went to some other campground then you would have never met the Wolfess.
&gt;You sigh, and lay back on your sleeping bag, closing it as much as you can.
&gt;You shut your eyes and try to sleep before it gets too cold.

&gt;That night, you wake up in your tent all cold and shivering.
&gt;You gasp from the sudden shock of cold, and you can see your breath as you exhale.
&gt;Damn, it had to be maybe 20 degrees outside.
&gt;It was windy out, and it was blowing directly into your tent from the huge hole the Wolfess had slashed into it.
&gt;Well, shit. You guess you can&#039;t just ignore the cold tonight.
&gt;You reach over and turn on a small electric lantern.
&gt;You grab the lantern, throw your shoes on, and head outside.
&gt;If you didn&#039;t want to freeze to death tonight, you had to find a way to make it so the wind wasn&#039;t blowing into your tent.
&gt;You didn&#039;t want to risk trying to turn it. If you took the stakes that were holding the tent out, then the whole damn thing could blow away.
&gt;You step outside the tent and HOLY SHIT is it cold out!
&gt;You cross your arms and rub them together, trying in vain to warm yourself.
&gt;A scary thought crosses your mind:
&gt;You had informed your coworkers you were taking some days off, but you didn&#039;t tell anyone where you were going.
&gt;If you froze to death out here, nobody would ever find your corpse.

&gt;Shaking your head to dispel the bad thoughts, you examine your tent.
&gt;It was a really small dome tent. You had gotten it for $20 at a local sporting goods shop awhile back.
&gt;You could really see where the $20 had went. The thing was really cheap looking, and didn&#039;t even have a rain shield.
&gt;You looked around your campsite for something to lean against the hole, but there was nothing but pinecones and dead leaves.
&gt;You really wish that Wolfess was here. She had slept alongside you after she had torn the hole, and even though you were in your underwear, you had still kept really warm.
&gt;Sadly, you didn&#039;t think she was coming back anytime soon.
&gt;You go over to the fire, and try to start it up.
&gt;No luck. It had rained a bit yesterday, and all the wood and kindling was wet.
&gt;You were going to die in the fucking woods all because you wanted some time off of your unfulfilling job.
&gt;Dammit, /out/ hadn&#039;t prepared you for something like this!

&gt;You stand back up next to the dead fire, wondering what you&#039;re going to do.
&gt;Your toes and fingers are starting to feel numb, and your jacket isn&#039;t keeping any heat in.
&gt;Suddenly, you hear some noises from the bushes.
&gt;Please please please be the Wolfess.
&gt;You see a figure emerge from the darkness, and it&#039;s a bit hard to make it out.
&gt;But you can&#039;t mistake that silhouette. It&#039;s a canine for sure!
&gt;It walks over to you and the light from the lantern falls upon it.
&gt;Two things register in your mind as you look at it&#039;s face.
&gt;One. Yeah, that&#039;s a tribal canine all right.
&gt;Two. Oh shit, this one is NOT your Wolfess.

&gt;Looking at the Wolf, he was clearly male.
&gt;His fur was a light brown color, and he wore no chest wrap.
&gt;He wore roughly made fur shorts, along with a leather belt to hold them up.
&gt;On the belt he only carried a stone hatchet.
&gt;He stood a couple feet away from you, looking you dead in the eyes.
&gt;You&#039;re too scared to move. What is he going to do? Punish you for being in his tribe&#039;s territory?
&gt;Maybe the Wolfess was only trying to have some fun with you before you had to be killed.
&gt;You had a knife with you, but it was back in your tent.
&gt;When you turn to look at the tent, the Wolf suddenly charges you.
&gt;You drop the lantern as he grabs you and slings you over his shoulder.
&gt;He looks over his shoulder at you, and mumbles something to you in his incomprehensible language.
&gt;He starts to walk at a brisk pace through the woods, in the direction of where the Wolfess went when you last saw her.
&gt;Shit, where is he taking you!?
&gt;You get one last glimpse at your camp, but eventually you can no longer see the light from the lantern you had dropped.

&gt;The trip through the forest is a bumpy one.
&gt;You had stopped struggling after awhile; the cold sapping your strength.
&gt;When the Wolf had felt you go limp, he stopped to make sure you were okay.
&gt;When he saw you were still awake, he gave a strange smile at you, and then proceeded to run.
&gt;You were bouncing on his shoulder, and it was hurting your ribs.
&gt;You hear a howl in the distance, and he stops.
&gt;He pulls you off of his shoulder, and sets you down on your feet.
&gt;Looking in the direction of the howl, you can see lights.
&gt;It&#039;s probably fires from his tribe.
&gt;You try to pull away from the Wolf, terrified of what you think is about to happen.
&gt;He isn&#039;t having any of it though, and grabs you firmly by the arm.
&gt;He points a clawed finger at you, and says something to you in his language.
&gt;You don&#039;t know what he&#039;s saying, but it&#039;s clearly meant to chastise you for trying to run.
&gt;He starts walking, and yanks you along after him.
&gt;You&#039;re terrified, and have forgotten all about the cold that&#039;s currently eating at your bones.
&gt;After five minutes of walking towards the distant lights, you approach the edge of the Village.

&gt;The Wolf leads you through the village.
&gt;It&#039;s larger than you thought it would be. It seems that they all live in rounded square huts made of pelts stretched over a wooden frame. In many huts, smoke is pouring out of a raised hole in the center of the roofs.
&gt;There are some campfires outside burning too, with wolves holding spears sitting around them. They&#039;re likely guards or warriors protecting the tribe members while they sleep.
&gt;As you are led through the village, you can see multiple Wolves poke their heads out of their huts to get a look at you. Many of them have probably never even seen a human before, and here one was walking through their village.
&gt;You are led to the largest hut in the middle of the village.
&gt;The wolf ushers you inside the door, and you reluctantly enter.
&gt;You&#039;re instantly warmed by the heat of a small fire burning in the center of the hut. It&#039;s sitting in a small pit, and has a flat stone laying over it. On the stone is a small ceramic cup full of some strange liquid.
&gt;Inside, an old Wolf is sitting cross-legged. His fur is is black, but grayed around his muzzle.
&gt;He&#039;s wearing fur trousers, and a deerskin shawl around his shoulders. A decorative headdress adorns his head.
&gt;He smiles at you, and gestures to a mat near him.
&gt;Looking behind you, you can the the brown Wolf is standing outside the door, watching you. Likely to make sure you don&#039;t make a run for it.
&gt;There&#039;s no way you would ever make it out of the village.
&gt;Resigning yourself to your fate, you walk over to the mat and sit on it, facing the old Wolf.

&gt;To your great surprise, the old Wolf greets you in your own language.
&gt;&quot;Hello, Human.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I am the Elder of this village. My name is Segenam. Yours?&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re stunned by the introduction, but you manage to stammer out a greeting, telling him your name.
&gt;&quot;My greetings to you, Anon. It has been many, many moons since a Human has been in this Village.&quot;
&gt;&quot;We are the Twin Paw Clan. We have lived here for countless generations.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I was told by the fisher-woman Kanti that you had constructed a hut on our land.&quot;
&gt;You stammer out an apology, and tell him you didn&#039;t mean to offend him or his tribe.
&gt;You tell him that if he let you go just this once, you promise they would never see you again.
&gt;He raises an eyebrow upon hearing this, and tells you:
&gt;&quot;Hmmm? Oh, you are nervous. There is no need for that. We will not harm you.&quot;
&gt;You sigh in relief. That&#039;s one burden off of your shoulders.
&gt;He continues:
&gt;&quot;Kanti has bonded with you. She tells me you have knowledge of fire-making, and you willingly bonded with her.&quot;
&gt;Kanti must be the Wolfess you met a couple days ago. You ask him what he meant by &quot;bonding&quot;, and he responds:
&gt;&quot;Ehh... Being together. You rested in her embrace. You bathed her. Both of these are traditional courting rituals.&quot;
&gt;He gives a small smile.
&quot;She tells me she enjoys your scent, as well.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I extend to you an invitation to join my Tribe. I understand that this may be a sudden choice, but you must choose now.&quot;
&gt;Shit, things were moving really fast here. First he tells you that he isn&#039;t going to kill you, then he tells you that the Wolfess wants to be your wife or something, and now he&#039;s invited you to join the tribe...
&gt;He continues:
&gt;&quot;If you accept, you will be treated as one of our own. You will be expected to contribute to the Tribe, and participate in our rituals.&quot;
&gt;You ask him why he wants you to join the Tribe, and he reponds, shaking his grey muzzle.
&gt;&quot;Not me. Kanti wishes for you to join us. She wants you to be her life-mate.&quot;
&gt;Damn, the Wolfess really does want to be your wife.
&gt;&quot;Anon, you must choose. I am old, and I wish to sleep soon.&quot;
&gt;Oh man, he&#039;s really putting you on the spot here.
&gt;You take a few seconds to contemplate your choices.
&gt;You can either go back to monotonous life, work as an underpaid janitor, and go home to an empty bed every day until you die....
&gt;Or you can join the Tribe, and actually contribute to your community. And every night you would come home to a warm Wolfess to cuddle you until you fall asleep...
&gt;Yeah, this an easy choice.

&gt;You tell him you&#039;ll stay with the Tribe, and he smiles.
&gt;&quot;Good. Kanti will be happy, and it will be nice to have the knowledge of a Human with us.&quot;
&gt;Speaking of Humans, you ask him how he knows English.
&gt;&quot;When I came of age, I left the Tribe and lived among your people for several years. After awhile, I returned.&quot;
&gt;&quot;My knowledge of the outside world made me a valuable member of the tribe, and when I reached the proper age, I was made Elder of the Tribe.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Of course, your knowledge makes you valuable as well. We occasionally go out to trade with your peoples. We trade furs and meat for medicines and other trinkets.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You would be a good interpreter for these transactions. I am old, and I find myself unable to make the long journey to the trading post on the edge of our border.&quot;
&quot;I will teach you our language. That way you can tell members of your species what we wish to trade for.&quot;
&gt;It&#039;s nice to hear you won&#039;t be a burden on the Tribe.
&gt;&quot;Now. We must complete the Ritual to induct you into the Tribe.&quot;
&gt;You nod, and tell him you&#039;re ready.
&gt;&quot;Very good, Anon.&quot;

&gt;Segenam motions for you to come closer, and the two of you sit near the fire.
&gt;He calls out the Wolf standing by the door who brought you here, and he stands over the two of you. Watching.
&gt;&quot;He will bear witness to the ritual. It is necessary.&quot;
&gt;Segenam reaches behind him, and grasps a gnarled old stick.
&gt;He waves it around your body, his eyes closed, chanting some strange words in his native tongue.
&gt;He takes hold of your arm, and holds it over the cup of liquid sitting over the heated stone on the fire.
&gt;&quot;Hold still.&quot;
&gt;He rakes the stick across your palm, drawing some blood.
&gt;Ow.
&gt;He holds your hand over the cup, and allows some drops of your blood to fall into the cup of liquid.
&gt;He lets go, and you hold your hand. The cut is small, and should heal easily on its own.
&gt;&quot;Anon. Now you must drink.&quot;
&gt;He hands you the cup.
&gt;&quot;I would not recommend smelling it.&quot;
&gt;You take his advice, breathing through your mouth.
&gt;You bring the cup to your mouth, and take a big gulp.
&gt;You regret it immediately.
&gt;It&#039;s the vilest shit you&#039;ve ever tasted in your whole life.
&gt;You cough and sputter, and the Elder gives a knowing chuckle.
&gt;&quot;Heheheh! Not the most delectable of teas, isn&#039;t it?&quot;
&gt;&quot;It is not supposed to be. It is the essence of the forest, and is used in inducting members into the Tribe.&quot;
&gt;Segenam says something to the Wolf behind you, and he nods.
&gt;The Wolf leaves the tent, and walks off.
&gt;&quot;That was Matwau. He has witnessed your union into the Tribe.&quot;
&gt;He gives a wide grin at you.
&gt;&quot;Welcome to the Twin Paw Clan.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Matwau is going back to your camp to retrieve your belongings.&quot;
&gt;&quot;For now though, I will show you to your new mate&#039;s tent. She has been working hard to make her hut suitable for you.&quot;
&gt;The old Wolf stands up with a grunt, and gestures for you to follow him.

&gt;Segenam leads you to a hut near the edge of the village.
&gt;&quot;This is the hut, Anon. Go on in and greet your Mate. She has missed you terribly. I will be going to sleep now.&quot;
&gt;You ask him how you&#039;ll communicate with her, and he answers:
&gt;&quot;You will be living with her. You can try and teach her some English. She has always been a quick learner.&quot;
&gt;That&#039;s not really what you meant, but he dismisses you with a wave of the hand, and he walks back to his hut.
&gt;You swallow, then head inside the hut.
&gt;As soon as you enter the hut, you&#039;re tackled by a dark gray wall of fluff.
&gt;You lay there pinned, and a familiar muzzle buries itself into your shoulder.
&gt;She sniffs at you, and lets out a happy yip.
&gt;She practically bathes you face with her tongue, spreading her thin, sticky saliva all over your face.
&gt;You greet her, and she lets out another happy yip.
&gt;She gets off of you, sitting on her knees.
&gt;Looking at her, she has a happy grin on her face a mile wide. Her tail is wagging faster than you knew was possible.
&gt;She brings you close, hugging you against her.
&gt;She sighs happily when you wrap your arms around her, getting a whiff of her familiar scent.

&gt;When you let go of each other, you get a look at the hut.
&gt;The hut looks similar to how the Elder&#039;s hut looked, but smaller.
&gt;There&#039;s a small fire with a flat cooking stone over it, heating the space to a comfortable temperature.
&gt;In one corner is several sacks of what you assume to be either food or various other supplies.
&gt;In another corner is a wooden container with a primitive fishing pole sitting on it. This must be where she stores her fishing supplies.
&gt;On the other side of the hut sits a pile of pelts, along with a sack that appears to be stuffed with feathers. This must be the bed. It looks big enough for the two of you to sleep comfortably together.
&gt;Speaking of which...
&gt;Kanti gently ushers you over to the pelts, and the two of you lay down.
&gt;She removes her tribal clothing, and huffs when she sees you still fully dressed.
&gt;You remove your clothing, stripping everything off and laying it on the ground.
&gt;Kanti seems satisfied, and she pulls you close, snuggling you tight.
&gt;She pulls a large pelt over the two of you, and you relax into her embrace.
&gt;Her arms are wrapped around you, and your head is pushed deep into the floof of her neck.
&gt;She lifts one of her digitigrade legs and sets it down over you.
&gt;Your body is enveloped by her warmth and fur, and her scent fills your nose.
&gt;You don&#039;t think you&#039;ll be cold ever again.
&gt;After awhile, your can hear Kanti softly breathing. She&#039;s asleep.
&gt;You wrap your arms around her sleeping form, and drift off peacefully to sleep.

	EPILOGUE
	TWO YEARS LATER
&gt;Be Anon.
&gt;You were the only human member of the Twin Paw Clan.
&gt;After you had left Human civilization, you had taken to your new role in the Tribe.
&gt;Whenever the Tribe left to trade with Humans, you were there to make sure everything went smoothly, and that both parties left satisfied.
&gt;When you weren&#039;t doing that, you spent the day fishing with your mate Kanti. Every day you would return to the village with baskets brimming with fish.
&gt;You had learned through the men at the trading post that while there had been an initial search for you after you seemingly disappeared, it had been called off after a couple weeks.
&gt;You didn&#039;t care. The only people you cared about now was Kanti and the Tribe.

&gt;It was a warm summer day.
&gt;You were sitting next to the riverbank with your wolfess wife Kanti.
&gt;The clothes you were wearing were well suited for your new Tribal life.
&gt;Some trousers stitched together from a pelt along with a leather belt to keep it up, a pair of moccasins, and a thin cotton tunic your wife had woven just for you.
&gt;Although you spoke her language now, she preferred to try and speak to you in the English you had taught her.
&gt;She said it gave her a better understanding of you, and she liked the way it rolled off of her tongue.
&gt;It was noon, and the two of you were about to eat the food you had brought with you for lunch.
&gt;Some deer pemmican, nuts and berries from the bushes around you, and even a bit of tea from a jar.
&gt;Your wife spoke up:
&gt;&quot;Anon? I have something to tell you.&quot;
&gt;You look up from your meal, and ask her what she has to say.
&gt;&quot;I am with child.&quot;
&gt;You choke on your food, and spit out a wad of pemmican onto the ground next to you.
&gt;You&#039;re pretty sure you had heard of humans managing to get Anthros pregnant, but it was rare.
&gt;Kanti has a horrified look on her face seeing how you reacted, but you quickly calm her down saying that you were just surprised.
&gt;You lean over and give her a hug, patting her belly.
&gt;Now that you really looked, you could see it was a bit more rounded than usual.
&gt;Her tail starts to wag furiously, and there are tears in her eyes.
&gt;She hugs you back, squeezing you tight.
&gt;&quot;We will raise them strong... They will carry on our names.&quot;
&gt;You smiled.
&gt;You would never be cold ever again.
