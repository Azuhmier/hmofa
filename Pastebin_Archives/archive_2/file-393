        <div class="source" style=" ">
            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This drive had become so routine to you </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Almost every day you traveled this long stretch of highway</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The miles simply blending into the background as your vehicle made its way. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whisps of snow swirled around in the wake of the truck </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While this winter storm was no major hurdle for you you had seen a few abandoned cars along the highway</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Most of them buried in a snowbank and left until a tow truck could make its way out to them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But their lights were out and marked with the proper flags so you paid them no mind. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had lived out here in the Midwest most of your life so these storms had never held much agency over your routine</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had learned how to drive through these decades ago</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So even as you felt a strong gust of wind shift the truck roughly to the side you kept calm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Only adding a touch of a turn of the wheel to keep yourself between the lines</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It seemed like this storm might soon turn into a blizzard. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looked over her cellphone with increased trepidation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The signal falling between nothing and a single bar</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While the car had done its job and prevented her from injuring herself in the admittedly not so violent crash it still left her in a perilous predicament</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With every exhale she saw her own breath fog up in front of her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her scaled hands looking over the insides of the vehicle</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Trying again to crank the vehicle over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The only result being that she drained the already dying battery a few more volts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And if this situation continued she was going to need every single drop of power that little battery could give her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She had been here for the better part of two hours</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was lucky this was going to be her day off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At least she wast worried about being late to work</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But over the snow covered hood of her car she watched as the cars sped by</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Their drivers oblivious to her perilous situation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But as they drove on down the highway she could feel the creeping cold slithering it way into her car</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Into her body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So as she looked up to the dash of her car she began to dial her phone again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hoping to get through to someone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The needle on her car just barely above the red bar that would signify the death of her battery, and the lifesaving heater that currently just barely clung to life</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Midwest wasn&#039;t supposed to be this bad</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As a girl that grew up in Louisiana she had never dealt with Nebraska winters</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She had always assumed the rumors to be the overblown tall tales of ancient elderly folks that had let their imaginations run wild</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But they had been right after all</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The sow began to pile up over her windshield</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Dusting the car in the pure white danger she had now come to know so well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her phone kept ringing the signal fading in and out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Of all the places to have a damn dead spot why here?!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shouted to herself as it went silent again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She huffed watching the could of foggy breath float in the car again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She felt a nasty shiver rock her body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She felt slower already</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Looking up to the thermometer in the car her heart only sunk</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;52 degrees</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looked forwards and cranked the heater up higher</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hoping that the dying battery would hold out for a little longer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She saw the lights of a plow truck drive by in the other direction</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Throwing up a wall of grayish snow onto the roadside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Piling up even more snow onto her already chilling car</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a now shivering hand she reached up to the steering wheel and made sure her hazard lights were on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;From behind the car all one would see from the road was a pair of flashing amber lights</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The rest of the white car covered with snow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The gator tried the key just once more</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The vain hope that this time the car would turn over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Keeping her warm even though she knew the danger of doing so</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But this time all she heard was a click</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The battery that only just clung to its fleeting charge didn&#039;t even have enough to turn the engine over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She felt a cold spot form in the pit of her gut</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She could hear the whirring little fan in her car start to quiet down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The amount of heat being pumped into the cabin trickling to a whisper</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She held her hands in front of the vent</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Trying to soak up whatever meager amount of heat they would give her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her hands shook in front of them </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She could only feel a slightly warm breeze that would soon run out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She went through her options in her mind</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She could get out of her car and try to flag someone down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but she would have maybe 2 minuets before the cold got to her even through her jacket and pants</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And she would have to sacrifice what little warmth was left int he car as soon as she opened the door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The only realistic option was too stay where she was and keep trying her cellphone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So she sat there in the relative silence of her vehicle</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The only noise aside from her breathing was the dull ringing of her phone, and the rushing frigid wind outside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She watched as the signal on her phone&#039;s screen switched between zero and one bar</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She watched as the wiggling phone symbol eventual set back down and turned red</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The only sound emanating from the device was a steady three bleeps</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Another phone call that no one would hear. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looked through the rapidly covering windows</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The snow slowly obscuring her vision as the blizzard hammered on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She let out a shaky sigh again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Watching as the cloud of her breath slowly wafted in front of her face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She felt her toes and fingers start to go numb</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The feeling of biting cold being replaced with a terrifying numbness</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She tried to rub her scaled hands together to regain some warmth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But try as she might she was never able to claw back that feeling in her hands</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looked down at her phone watching with widened eyes as the battery indicator flashed red</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That was her only lifeline</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And now that too was going to die off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And if she didn&#039;t make this next call connect she would as well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even if she did would anyone make it out here in time?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She considered in a desperate though if she could make a small fire in the back seat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The cold starting to addle her mind</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;every though seemed to flow like cold molasses </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her jaw chattering interrupting her thoughts again and again </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The more she tried to think of a solution the more frustrated she became</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every minuet becoming angrier and angrier</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a few moments stewing in her own frustration she let out a shout </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pounding on the steering wheel</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her body no longer felt cold strangely </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The numbing cold that had been creeping through her was now being replaced by a spreading uncomfortable warmth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As the uncomfortable warmth started to spread from her hands and feet She began to loosen her jacket</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her mind no longer focusing on the ever dropping temperature inside the car</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her mind now completely focused on how strangely warm it was getting in here now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ignoring how with every pant a cloud of vapor dispersed into the car around her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With increasing frustration she began to shed more and more of her clothing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The implications of anyone finding her like this was not even a possibility in her mind anymore</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The only thought that forced her way into her mind was her drive to cool down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her jacket and then her shoes were quickly shed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Throwing them into the back seat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every moment that went by she began to feel warmer and warmer. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like she was now baking under a heat lamp. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She began to pant</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every gasping breath creating another cloud in front of her as she wiggled out of her pants </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shedding her shirt not too long afterwards</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her green scales on her arms contrasting against her smoother brighter yellow scales on her chest and belly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Only a black sports bra and matching compression shorts were left on her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yet the heat never subsided. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She lay back in her chair</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The energy leaving her body </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She suddenly felt a powerful urge to sleep</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her body ached like she had just run a marathon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her arms and legs ached</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And she only barely registered the bright white lights of a vehicle pulling up behind her in the snow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you drove on through the snow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You flicked the small stalk next tot he wheel </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The turn signal blinking in a steady beat as you began to turn off the highway and pull onto an off ramp</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But something caught your eye </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A twin set of tracks dug into the side of the ramp</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Normally you would have supposed it was a pair of snowmobiles that had gone and taken a joyride in the deeper snow that always piled up in drifts near here</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But an unknown force drove you to investigate further</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div

</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The frigid wind almost drove the breath from your lungs as you pulled your heavy jacket up closer around your face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Stepping quickly around the front of your car and looking down into the slight embankment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You saw a car half buried in the snow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Its hazards still on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You almost turned around and went back to your truck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But a quick flash of motion caught your eye</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There was no way anyone would still be in there right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But as you scanned the area around the sides of the car you saw no tracks leading back up the small hill</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A pang of concern washed over you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Figuring you may as well give the car a look over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Worst case scenario in your mind was that you&#039;d be a little colder than normal when you climbed back in the cab</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But as you trudged down the hill you tried to peer in through the windows to no avail</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The glass covered in a few inches of snow and ice</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But there was a faint shape inside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decided to swipe your hand over the driver&#039;s window</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your gloved hand pushing away the snow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What you saw made a cold lump form in your gut</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There in the driver&#039;s seat sat a green skinned anthro</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You saw a few of them in the inner city but had never seen one this far out that wasn&#039;t a more feral type</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like the Native Americans of old they most kept to themselves</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But as you took in the scene you realized why this one hadn&#039;t attempted to escape their car</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This wasn&#039;t a deer or even a wolf</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But some kind of lizard</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her green scales covering most of her body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then another realization hit you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was almost naked</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All but her underwear strewn across the car</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pulled on the door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wanting to check to see if she was just sleeping or if she was okay </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But when the door pulled open you watched as a dusting of cold snow fell across her arm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She didn&#039;t react</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You leaned in and jostled her body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was unresponsive.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every instinct that had been hammered into you during your high school years was suddenly in the forefront of your mind</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That stupid lifeguard class you had taken for an extra P.E. credit was suddenly very much worth it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reached into the vehicle and put your ear against her chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At the very least she was still breathing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If she was breathing you knew she had a heartbeat </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So with that established you reached across her bare midsection and pressed the seat belt release</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a metallic click you felt the tension on the belt release</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The strap pulling itself back into its ratcheting case </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were over come for a moment by a period of bashfulness</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was almost naked!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What if she woke up while you were carrying her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When if she though you had stripped her naked</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a shake of your head you pushed those thoughts out of your mind</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pushing your arms up and under her knees and behind her back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you were surprised has when you pulled her up and out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A large muscular tail followed her out of the vehicle. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were by no means a weak man</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But her full weight hit you as you took your first step up the hill</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was a much bigger girl than you had taken her for</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you knew each second she spent in the cold was a second that brought her ever closer to permanent damage</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you trudged on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One step after the other</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Trying to keep a good pace up the hill and not slip</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Dropping her in the snow was most certainly a thing that could not happen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But with each step you were closer to your goal</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her tail drug in the snow between your legs. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But as the seconds went on and the winter storm buffeted you you began to pant</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your muscles began to burn as the strain got to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The difficulty of moving in the snow in thick clothes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Added to the wight of the lizard girl that you held gingerly in your arms</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Each step brought a new wave of strain to your body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But slowly your headlights came back into view</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Each step you took became a challenge</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Between the wind trying to blow you off balance and the odd weight you held in your arms </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you pressed on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;eventually reaching the passenger door to your truck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;shifting her in your arms you reached out with a gloved hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wrapping your fingers solidly around the handle and you yanked hard</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The door opening with a metallic creek </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This old bird may not be the shiniest thing in the parking lot at work</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But damn if she wasn&#039;t reliable</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And its heater was a fucking beast.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pushed open the door all the way and set the girl down gently on the bench seat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Folding her tail between her legs as naturally as you could assume </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But with with a heavy sigh you shut the door behind her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jogging to the front of the truck and throwing open the door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Throwing your own freezing body inside and slamming the door shut behind you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your hand lept to the heater control as you instinctively cranked the heater up as high as it would go</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Cranking the fan up only a short few seconds later.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you heard the heater fan in your truck ramp up you looked over at the lizard girl for the first time since you saw her in her car. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her green scales betrayed just how cold she probably was</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The iridescent scales not losing their color regardless of just how cold she probably was</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you eyes roamed over her form you came down from the adrenaline high that had fueled you back up the hill</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just how laid bare she was</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Save for the compression shorts and sports bras she was completely nude</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You blushed slightly as the vehicle became just slightly warmer inside your jacket</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could practically hear your own pulse in your ears</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you had to push past your bashfulness </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had to make sure she was going to be okay</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While you were no herpetologist you knew reptiles didn&#039;t react very well to extreme cold, Save for a few frog species you had learned about in passing. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You put both hands back on the steering wheel and looked back down the hill to where her clothes were</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Splayed about inside her car</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could be a selfish bastard and let her wake up with nothing on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you were going to have to go back for them either way</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you looked over at the handle to the driver&#039;s door and braced yourself for the burst of cold you were about to experience. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But as you were about to pull on the handle you heard the shuffle of scale against the cloth seat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your head whipped over as you caught the last of her motion</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her tail curling up and resting against the seat as she slumped over to her side</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her head landing in your lap</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You bit your bottom lip as you fought the urge to simply enjoy the slightly perverted moment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But if a big lizard girl woke up in a stranger&#039;s truck half naked</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She might be tempted to put those reptilian teeth to good use</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You held both hands up in the air still in a slight shock as to what had just happened to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her auburn hair was played across her face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So despite your better judgement you brought a gentle hand down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Brushing it back out of her face </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you looked over her unconscious form</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You couldn&#039;t help but linger for a few seconds </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For an anthro...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she was actually pretty cute</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you had imagined reptile anthros many years ago you had imagined rough faced sharp fanged beasts </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But her&#039;s was smoother</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like a gecko or anole. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shook your head as you focused again on what you had to do to avoid her beating the living shit out of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So ever so gently you hooked a hand under her head </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Gently lifting it as you slid out from under it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Letting it rest on the cushioned seat as you opened the cab door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The frigid wind blasting you as you stepped outside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You looked down to your still tires as small drifts of snow began to build up around them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But with one last thought you had a thought</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could handle the cold</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And she had just nearly frozen to death</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So quickly you stripped out of your Carhartt jacket</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Draping it over her body as you closed the cab door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Either ignoring or not noticing her shifting as you closed the door and headed back down the hill</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She felt a chilling numbness wash over her whole body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Much different than the overwhelming heat that she had felt before</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Was she dead?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Was this a dream?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She felt a soft weight cover her as her body greedily absorbed the life giving warmth </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pulled her legs up close to her chest </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Curling up into a ball</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her mind wasn&#039;t cloudy anymore</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She remembered where she was last</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Stuck in a snowbank with nobody coming to save her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She let out a small wimper as the weight of that situation hit her like a brick wall</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She didn&#039;t want to die yet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She had so much she needed to do. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She muttered to herself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t want to die.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Please save me.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Too terrified to open her eyes, and see her salvation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You trudged through the snow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The wind seemed to cut right down to your bones</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you had a job to do damnit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You you pushed on down the hill</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your eyes squinted to shield them from the billowing gusts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The car you had found her in only just poking out of the growing drifts of snow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you eventually reached it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Trying to open the door caused a few inches of snow to fall in through the door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And onto your head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Fuck this winter shit...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Muttering angrily to yourself wasn&#039;t going to get you back in your nice warm truck anytime soon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you delved into her car</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pulling garments from all over the car</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her pants from the foot well, and her shirt and sweater from the passenger seat. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As the wind picked up again you abandoned her shoes and socks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Figuring she would be happy with not being half naked</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You slammed shut the door with your foot as you began to trudge back up the hill</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Each footfall and a very selfish part of you wanted to just throw down her crap and retreat to your truck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But mamma didn&#039;t raise to bitch </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you kept going</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Almost slipping and falling right on your ass as you sprinted around the truck towards the driver&#039;s door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you pulled open he door you saw she had moved again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And she was crying?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was curled up into a ball and just begging an unseen figure</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She didn&#039;t even notice you as you sat down in the seat next to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You looked around in an awkward panic</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you had never been very good at comforting people</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hadn&#039;t ever really been put in a position like this</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you reached an unsure hand down to her head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Petting her gently</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hey... Its okay.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She flinched hard when you touched her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Recoiling away from your touch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I didn&#039;t get to tell them I loved them.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She said between sobs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your eyes widened at that </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You retreated back to yourself </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pulling your hand back away from her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sat there in silence for a good few seconds as she laid next to you still scared out of her mind </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;thoughts raced through your mind as you tried to figure out just what you were going to do</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What could you do?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Get up and out of the truck and sit in the freezing cold?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you eliminated options you turned back to look down at her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She needed to know someone was here for her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To know she was safe with you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you did the only thing you could think to do</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your bashful nature be damned </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hooked two arms under her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hauling her shivering form up to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pulled her up into a hug</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your arm wrapped around her while the other held the back of her head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Shhh.

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;This drive had become so routine to you 
&gt;Almost every day you traveled this long stretch of highway
&gt;The miles simply blending into the background as your vehicle made its way. 
&gt;Whisps of snow swirled around in the wake of the truck 
&gt;While this winter storm was no major hurdle for you you had seen a few abandoned cars along the highway
&gt;Most of them buried in a snowbank and left until a tow truck could make its way out to them
&gt;But their lights were out and marked with the proper flags so you paid them no mind. 
&gt;You had lived out here in the Midwest most of your life so these storms had never held much agency over your routine
&gt;You had learned how to drive through these decades ago
&gt;So even as you felt a strong gust of wind shift the truck roughly to the side you kept calm
&gt;Only adding a touch of a turn of the wheel to keep yourself between the lines
&gt;It seemed like this storm might soon turn into a blizzard. 

&gt;She looked over her cellphone with increased trepidation
&gt;The signal falling between nothing and a single bar
&gt;While the car had done its job and prevented her from injuring herself in the admittedly not so violent crash it still left her in a perilous predicament
&gt;With every exhale she saw her own breath fog up in front of her
&gt;Her scaled hands looking over the insides of the vehicle
&gt;Trying again to crank the vehicle over
&gt;The only result being that she drained the already dying battery a few more volts
&gt;And if this situation continued she was going to need every single drop of power that little battery could give her
&gt;She had been here for the better part of two hours
&gt;She was lucky this was going to be her day off
&gt;At least she wast worried about being late to work
&gt;But over the snow covered hood of her car she watched as the cars sped by
&gt;Their drivers oblivious to her perilous situation

&gt;But as they drove on down the highway she could feel the creeping cold slithering it way into her car
&gt;Into her body
&gt;So as she looked up to the dash of her car she began to dial her phone again
&gt;Hoping to get through to someone
&gt;The needle on her car just barely above the red bar that would signify the death of her battery, and the lifesaving heater that currently just barely clung to life
&gt;The Midwest wasn&#039;t supposed to be this bad
&gt;As a girl that grew up in Louisiana she had never dealt with Nebraska winters
&gt;She had always assumed the rumors to be the overblown tall tales of ancient elderly folks that had let their imaginations run wild
&gt;But they had been right after all
&gt;The sow began to pile up over her windshield
&gt;Dusting the car in the pure white danger she had now come to know so well
&gt;Her phone kept ringing the signal fading in and out
&gt;&quot;Of all the places to have a damn dead spot why here?!&quot;
&gt;She shouted to herself as it went silent again
&gt;She huffed watching the could of foggy breath float in the car again
&gt;She felt a nasty shiver rock her body
&gt;She felt slower already
&gt;Looking up to the thermometer in the car her heart only sunk
&gt;52 degrees
&gt;She looked forwards and cranked the heater up higher
&gt;Hoping that the dying battery would hold out for a little longer
&gt;She saw the lights of a plow truck drive by in the other direction
&gt;Throwing up a wall of grayish snow onto the roadside
&gt;Piling up even more snow onto her already chilling car
&gt;With a now shivering hand she reached up to the steering wheel and made sure her hazard lights were on
&gt;From behind the car all one would see from the road was a pair of flashing amber lights
&gt;The rest of the white car covered with snow
&gt;The gator tried the key just once more
&gt;The vain hope that this time the car would turn over
&gt;Keeping her warm even though she knew the danger of doing so
&gt;But this time all she heard was a click

&gt;The battery that only just clung to its fleeting charge didn&#039;t even have enough to turn the engine over
&gt;She felt a cold spot form in the pit of her gut
&gt;She could hear the whirring little fan in her car start to quiet down
&gt;The amount of heat being pumped into the cabin trickling to a whisper
&gt;She held her hands in front of the vent
&gt;Trying to soak up whatever meager amount of heat they would give her
&gt;Her hands shook in front of them 
&gt;She could only feel a slightly warm breeze that would soon run out
&gt;She went through her options in her mind
&gt;She could get out of her car and try to flag someone down
&gt;but she would have maybe 2 minuets before the cold got to her even through her jacket and pants
&gt;And she would have to sacrifice what little warmth was left int he car as soon as she opened the door
&gt;The only realistic option was too stay where she was and keep trying her cellphone

&gt;So she sat there in the relative silence of her vehicle
&gt;The only noise aside from her breathing was the dull ringing of her phone, and the rushing frigid wind outside
&gt;She watched as the signal on her phone&#039;s screen switched between zero and one bar
&gt;She watched as the wiggling phone symbol eventual set back down and turned red
&gt;The only sound emanating from the device was a steady three bleeps
&gt;Another phone call that no one would hear. 
&gt;She looked through the rapidly covering windows
&gt;The snow slowly obscuring her vision as the blizzard hammered on
&gt;She let out a shaky sigh again. 
&gt;Watching as the cloud of her breath slowly wafted in front of her face
&gt;She felt her toes and fingers start to go numb
&gt;The feeling of biting cold being replaced with a terrifying numbness
&gt;She tried to rub her scaled hands together to regain some warmth
&gt;But try as she might she was never able to claw back that feeling in her hands
&gt;She looked down at her phone watching with widened eyes as the battery indicator flashed red
&gt;That was her only lifeline
&gt;And now that too was going to die off
&gt;And if she didn&#039;t make this next call connect she would as well
&gt;Even if she did would anyone make it out here in time?
&gt;She considered in a desperate though if she could make a small fire in the back seat
&gt;The cold starting to addle her mind
&gt;every though seemed to flow like cold molasses 
&gt;Her jaw chattering interrupting her thoughts again and again 
&gt;The more she tried to think of a solution the more frustrated she became
&gt;Every minuet becoming angrier and angrier
&gt;After a few moments stewing in her own frustration she let out a shout 
&gt;Pounding on the steering wheel
&gt;Her body no longer felt cold strangely 
&gt;The numbing cold that had been creeping through her was now being replaced by a spreading uncomfortable warmth

&gt;As the uncomfortable warmth started to spread from her hands and feet She began to loosen her jacket
&gt;Her mind no longer focusing on the ever dropping temperature inside the car
&gt;Her mind now completely focused on how strangely warm it was getting in here now
&gt;Ignoring how with every pant a cloud of vapor dispersed into the car around her. 
&gt;With increasing frustration she began to shed more and more of her clothing
&gt;The implications of anyone finding her like this was not even a possibility in her mind anymore
&gt;The only thought that forced her way into her mind was her drive to cool down
&gt;Her jacket and then her shoes were quickly shed. 
&gt;Throwing them into the back seat
&gt;Every moment that went by she began to feel warmer and warmer. 
&gt;Like she was now baking under a heat lamp. 
&gt;She began to pant
&gt;Every gasping breath creating another cloud in front of her as she wiggled out of her pants 
&gt;Shedding her shirt not too long afterwards
&gt;Her green scales on her arms contrasting against her smoother brighter yellow scales on her chest and belly
&gt;Only a black sports bra and matching compression shorts were left on her
&gt;Yet the heat never subsided. 
&gt;She lay back in her chair
&gt;The energy leaving her body 
&gt;She suddenly felt a powerful urge to sleep
&gt;Her body ached like she had just run a marathon
&gt;Her arms and legs ached
&gt;And she only barely registered the bright white lights of a vehicle pulling up behind her in the snow

&gt;As you drove on through the snow
&gt;You flicked the small stalk next tot he wheel 
&gt;The turn signal blinking in a steady beat as you began to turn off the highway and pull onto an off ramp
&gt;But something caught your eye 
&gt;A twin set of tracks dug into the side of the ramp
&gt;Normally you would have supposed it was a pair of snowmobiles that had gone and taken a joyride in the deeper snow that always piled up in drifts near here
&gt;But an unknown force drove you to investigate further

&gt;You pulled the truck over to the side of the road and threw it into park
&gt;Pressing the hazard lights and opening up the door 
&gt;The frigid wind almost drove the breath from your lungs as you pulled your heavy jacket up closer around your face
&gt;Stepping quickly around the front of your car and looking down into the slight embankment
&gt;You saw a car half buried in the snow
&gt;Its hazards still on
&gt;You almost turned around and went back to your truck
&gt;But a quick flash of motion caught your eye
&gt;There was no way anyone would still be in there right?
&gt;But as you scanned the area around the sides of the car you saw no tracks leading back up the small hill
&gt;A pang of concern washed over you
&gt;Figuring you may as well give the car a look over
&gt;Worst case scenario in your mind was that you&#039;d be a little colder than normal when you climbed back in the cab
&gt;But as you trudged down the hill you tried to peer in through the windows to no avail
&gt;The glass covered in a few inches of snow and ice
&gt;But there was a faint shape inside
&gt;You decided to swipe your hand over the driver&#039;s window
&gt;Your gloved hand pushing away the snow
&gt;What you saw made a cold lump form in your gut
&gt;There in the driver&#039;s seat sat a green skinned anthro
&gt;You saw a few of them in the inner city but had never seen one this far out that wasn&#039;t a more feral type
&gt;Like the Native Americans of old they most kept to themselves
&gt;But as you took in the scene you realized why this one hadn&#039;t attempted to escape their car
&gt;This wasn&#039;t a deer or even a wolf
&gt;But some kind of lizard
&gt;Her green scales covering most of her body
&gt;Then another realization hit you
&gt;She was almost naked
&gt;All but her underwear strewn across the car
&gt;You pulled on the door
&gt;Wanting to check to see if she was just sleeping or if she was okay 
&gt;But when the door pulled open you watched as a dusting of cold snow fell across her arm
&gt;She didn&#039;t react
&gt;You leaned in and jostled her body
&gt;She was unresponsive.

&gt;Every instinct that had been hammered into you during your high school years was suddenly in the forefront of your mind
&gt;That stupid lifeguard class you had taken for an extra P.E. credit was suddenly very much worth it. 
&gt;You reached into the vehicle and put your ear against her chest
&gt;At the very least she was still breathing
&gt;If she was breathing you knew she had a heartbeat 
&gt;So with that established you reached across her bare midsection and pressed the seat belt release
&gt;With a metallic click you felt the tension on the belt release
&gt;The strap pulling itself back into its ratcheting case 
&gt;You were over come for a moment by a period of bashfulness
&gt;She was almost naked!
&gt;What if she woke up while you were carrying her
&gt;When if she though you had stripped her naked
&gt;With a shake of your head you pushed those thoughts out of your mind
&gt;Pushing your arms up and under her knees and behind her back
&gt;But you were surprised has when you pulled her up and out
&gt;A large muscular tail followed her out of the vehicle. 
&gt;You were by no means a weak man
&gt;But her full weight hit you as you took your first step up the hill
&gt;She was a much bigger girl than you had taken her for
&gt;But you knew each second she spent in the cold was a second that brought her ever closer to permanent damage
&gt;So you trudged on
&gt;One step after the other
&gt;Trying to keep a good pace up the hill and not slip
&gt;Dropping her in the snow was most certainly a thing that could not happen
&gt;But with each step you were closer to your goal
&gt;Her tail drug in the snow between your legs. 
&gt;But as the seconds went on and the winter storm buffeted you you began to pant
&gt;Your muscles began to burn as the strain got to you
&gt;The difficulty of moving in the snow in thick clothes
&gt;Added to the wight of the lizard girl that you held gingerly in your arms
&gt;Each step brought a new wave of strain to your body
&gt;But slowly your headlights came back into view

&gt;Each step you took became a challenge
&gt;Between the wind trying to blow you off balance and the odd weight you held in your arms 
&gt;But you pressed on
&gt;eventually reaching the passenger door to your truck
&gt;shifting her in your arms you reached out with a gloved hand
&gt;Wrapping your fingers solidly around the handle and you yanked hard
&gt;The door opening with a metallic creek 
&gt;This old bird may not be the shiniest thing in the parking lot at work
&gt;But damn if she wasn&#039;t reliable
&gt;And its heater was a fucking beast.
&gt;You pushed open the door all the way and set the girl down gently on the bench seat
&gt;Folding her tail between her legs as naturally as you could assume 
&gt;But with with a heavy sigh you shut the door behind her
&gt;Jogging to the front of the truck and throwing open the door
&gt;Throwing your own freezing body inside and slamming the door shut behind you
&gt;Your hand lept to the heater control as you instinctively cranked the heater up as high as it would go
&gt;Cranking the fan up only a short few seconds later.


&gt;As you heard the heater fan in your truck ramp up you looked over at the lizard girl for the first time since you saw her in her car. 
&gt;Her green scales betrayed just how cold she probably was
&gt;The iridescent scales not losing their color regardless of just how cold she probably was
&gt;As you eyes roamed over her form you came down from the adrenaline high that had fueled you back up the hill
&gt;Just how laid bare she was
&gt;Save for the compression shorts and sports bras she was completely nude
&gt;You blushed slightly as the vehicle became just slightly warmer inside your jacket
&gt;You could practically hear your own pulse in your ears
&gt;But you had to push past your bashfulness 
&gt;You had to make sure she was going to be okay
&gt;While you were no herpetologist you knew reptiles didn&#039;t react very well to extreme cold, Save for a few frog species you had learned about in passing. 
&gt;You put both hands back on the steering wheel and looked back down the hill to where her clothes were
&gt;Splayed about inside her car
&gt;You could be a selfish bastard and let her wake up with nothing on
&gt;But you were going to have to go back for them either way
&gt;So you looked over at the handle to the driver&#039;s door and braced yourself for the burst of cold you were about to experience. 
&gt;But as you were about to pull on the handle you heard the shuffle of scale against the cloth seat
&gt;Your head whipped over as you caught the last of her motion
&gt;Her tail curling up and resting against the seat as she slumped over to her side
&gt;Her head landing in your lap
&gt;You bit your bottom lip as you fought the urge to simply enjoy the slightly perverted moment
&gt;But if a big lizard girl woke up in a stranger&#039;s truck half naked
&gt;She might be tempted to put those reptilian teeth to good use

&gt;You held both hands up in the air still in a slight shock as to what had just happened to you
&gt;Her auburn hair was played across her face
&gt;So despite your better judgement you brought a gentle hand down
&gt;Brushing it back out of her face 
&gt;As you looked over her unconscious form
&gt;You couldn&#039;t help but linger for a few seconds 
&gt;For an anthro...
&gt;she was actually pretty cute
&gt;When you had imagined reptile anthros many years ago you had imagined rough faced sharp fanged beasts 
&gt;But her&#039;s was smoother
&gt;Like a gecko or anole. 
&gt;You shook your head as you focused again on what you had to do to avoid her beating the living shit out of you
&gt;So ever so gently you hooked a hand under her head 
&gt;Gently lifting it as you slid out from under it
&gt;Letting it rest on the cushioned seat as you opened the cab door
&gt;The frigid wind blasting you as you stepped outside
&gt;You looked down to your still tires as small drifts of snow began to build up around them
&gt;But with one last thought you had a thought
&gt;You could handle the cold
&gt;And she had just nearly frozen to death
&gt;So quickly you stripped out of your Carhartt jacket
&gt;Draping it over her body as you closed the cab door
&gt;Either ignoring or not noticing her shifting as you closed the door and headed back down the hill

&gt;She felt a chilling numbness wash over her whole body
&gt;Much different than the overwhelming heat that she had felt before
&gt;Was she dead?
&gt;Was this a dream?
&gt;She felt a soft weight cover her as her body greedily absorbed the life giving warmth 
&gt;She pulled her legs up close to her chest 
&gt;Curling up into a ball
&gt;Her mind wasn&#039;t cloudy anymore
&gt;She remembered where she was last
&gt;Stuck in a snowbank with nobody coming to save her
&gt;She let out a small wimper as the weight of that situation hit her like a brick wall
&gt;She didn&#039;t want to die yet.
&gt;She had so much she needed to do. 
&gt;She muttered to herself
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t want to die.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Please save me.&quot;
&gt;Too terrified to open her eyes, and see her salvation

&gt;You trudged through the snow
&gt;The wind seemed to cut right down to your bones
&gt;But you had a job to do damnit
&gt;You you pushed on down the hill
&gt;Your eyes squinted to shield them from the billowing gusts
&gt;The car you had found her in only just poking out of the growing drifts of snow
&gt;But you eventually reached it
&gt;Trying to open the door caused a few inches of snow to fall in through the door
&gt;And onto your head
&quot;Fuck this winter shit...&quot;
&gt;Muttering angrily to yourself wasn&#039;t going to get you back in your nice warm truck anytime soon
&gt;So you delved into her car
&gt;Pulling garments from all over the car
&gt;Her pants from the foot well, and her shirt and sweater from the passenger seat. 
&gt;As the wind picked up again you abandoned her shoes and socks
&gt;Figuring she would be happy with not being half naked
&gt;You slammed shut the door with your foot as you began to trudge back up the hill
&gt;Each footfall and a very selfish part of you wanted to just throw down her crap and retreat to your truck
&gt;But mamma didn&#039;t raise to bitch 
&gt;So you kept going
&gt;Almost slipping and falling right on your ass as you sprinted around the truck towards the driver&#039;s door
&gt;As you pulled open he door you saw she had moved again
&gt;And she was crying?
&gt;She was curled up into a ball and just begging an unseen figure
&gt;She didn&#039;t even notice you as you sat down in the seat next to her
&gt;You looked around in an awkward panic
&gt;you had never been very good at comforting people
&gt;You hadn&#039;t ever really been put in a position like this
&gt;So you reached an unsure hand down to her head
&gt;Petting her gently
&quot;Hey... Its okay.&quot;
&gt;She flinched hard when you touched her
&gt;Recoiling away from your touch
&gt;&quot;I didn&#039;t get to tell them I loved them.&quot;
&gt;She said between sobs
&gt;Your eyes widened at that 
&gt;You retreated back to yourself 
&gt;Pulling your hand back away from her

&gt;You sat there in silence for a good few seconds as she laid next to you still scared out of her mind 
&gt;thoughts raced through your mind as you tried to figure out just what you were going to do
&gt;What could you do?
&gt;Get up and out of the truck and sit in the freezing cold?
&gt;As you eliminated options you turned back to look down at her
&gt;She needed to know someone was here for her
&gt;To know she was safe with you
&gt;So you did the only thing you could think to do
&gt;Your bashful nature be damned 
&gt;You hooked two arms under her
&gt;Hauling her shivering form up to you
&gt;You pulled her up into a hug
&gt;Your arm wrapped around her while the other held the back of her head
&quot;Shhh. Its okay... You&#039;re safe. I got you&quot;
&gt;While you fully expected her to recoil away from you again
&gt;She grabbed two big handfuls of your shirt and gripped you tight
&gt;You could feel her tears soaking through your shirt as you patted her back 
&gt;Her sobs slowly subsided 
&gt;Replaced by a still silence intermittently interrupted by strong gust

&gt;She felt something pull her up
&gt;Its strong arms pulling her into an embrace
&gt;Any other time she would have backhanded someone that did that to her without her permission
&gt;But right now she needed this
&gt;She wanted to feel safe
&gt;It didn&#039;t matter to her who held her
&gt;All that mattered right now is that she was at least out of danger
&gt;She felt his warm body and absentmindedly pulled herself in closer
&gt;She eventually squeaked out a small reply
&gt;the first coherent words in a long time to her
&gt;&quot;Thank you...&quot;
&gt;She continued to hold onto her savior for dear life 
&gt;Still terrified to open her eyes lest when she open them the illusion of safety would be blown away
&gt;So she stayed there
&gt;Eventually pulling her tail up and resting it on the lap of that warm body she clung to
&gt;His soft hands gliding over her scaled back
&gt;She tried again and again to sum up the courage to open up her eyes 
&gt;But every time she fell back into the blind comfort of a warm body and a soft coat</textarea>
