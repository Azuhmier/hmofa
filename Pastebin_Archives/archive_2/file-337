            RAW Paste Data        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">Crash course
&gt;You whined, tucking your legs to your chest.
&gt;Why god? Just why? What did you ever do?
&gt;Jane, your best friend, put you in the worst situation ever. Worse then an entire firing squad.
&gt;She stumbled upon your preference for humans and set you up for a date with some boy…
&gt;Most girls would be excited for such a thing, thankful even… but you…
&gt;This will just end bad.
&gt;You hum though, thinking about it.
&gt;Maybe he’s into Anthro’s? Maybe he likes armadillos? Maybe he plays games and likes movies instead of a run in the park?
&gt;Uncurling and standing up, you turned to your mirror.
&gt;Giving a winning smile, you looked at yourself.
&gt;Black bra holding your DD breasts up, plump and squeezy.~
&gt;Tong, sexy and matching colour. And…
&gt;You turned, smiling still, but faltering.
&gt;A good size and huggable armadillo girl! Not in too bad of shape at all!
&gt;…
&gt;A plump girl!
&gt;You can feel the falter more, sucking your belly in.
&gt;Thicc?
&gt;…
&gt;You looked away form the reflection, whining again and feeling your tail between your legs.
&gt;This is going to be a disaster!
&gt;You hear your phone, looking to your bed.
&gt;Damnit Jane…
&gt;You look at your texts, seeing the messages of encouragement and reminders for the date.
&gt;Sighing, you ball up again, just wanting to get away form the world.
&gt;… Maybe it could be okay, it can’t just to try…
&gt;Come on… it could be as good as those double ninja drops form the last raid.
&gt;Sitting again, you grab the jeans on the ground.
&gt;it can’t be too bad… Jane probably told you what he was getting into!
&gt;YEAH! He probably knows what you are like and look like!
&gt;This won’t be so bad~
&gt;You get your hoddie and go out of your room, going up the stairs.
&gt;Living with your parents at 25 is not bad right?
&gt;You were in school for graphic design and paid rent… kinda.
&gt;No! focus on the date! The date with… with…
&gt;Uhhh…
&gt;UHHH.
&gt;You rip your phone from your pocket as you ride the bus, going back through your texts
&gt;Name… name…
&gt;HA memes.
&gt;FUCK NO. FOCUS.
&gt;Namenamenamename?
&gt;Looking up, you gasp.
&gt;You’re at the mall already? How?
&gt;”Hey.”
&gt;You feel like you went streaking outside after a bath in the middle of winter, turning.
&gt;A human man stands in front of you and… he’s…
&gt;OH GOD HE’S HOT
&gt;He’s shaven… but he must grown a beard like wolverine!
&gt;…Oh shit! He was waiting here for you!
&gt;Fuckfuckfuckfuck.
&gt;”Nora, right?”
&gt;You inhale slightly, squeaking.
“U-uhh, yes? A-and you are… uhh.”
&gt;FUCK.
&gt;He smiles, looking you over
&gt;”Anon. Nice to meet you.”
&gt;… maybe this will be okay?
------------
&gt;Maybe you should visit /diy/ and learn how to tie a noose!
&gt;You pouted, unable to ball up any tighter.
&gt;”NORA! Supper! Pizza with pineapple!”
“Okay mom! Thanks!”
&gt;gowaypls.
&gt;You super fucked up the date.
&gt;You stuttered, you slipped and fell, you hardly gave him any attention….
&gt;Sniffing, you swallow the lump in your throat.
&gt;You just want to die.
&gt;The phone goes off again, making your dread the messages.
&gt;You just want out of here…
&gt;Today is Wednesday…
&gt;Opening up, you peak out, looking to your computer.
&gt;…Maybe a raid will help… for now.
&gt;You reached out, turning on the tower and closing back up.
&gt;Pizza too… mmm~ pineapple.
&gt;Unballing again, you move to the door and go upstairs, getting a plate and pizza.
“Thanks mom.”
&gt;”You’re welcome. You went out today! Did you have fun?
&gt;Shit.
“U-uuhh, yeah, totally. I’m… gonna… yeah.”
&gt;You dart back downstairs, hearing your father and stopping.
&gt;”This girl…”
&gt;”Oh she’s fine. She’s enjoying her time away from school.”
&gt;”Yeah… but she can do a little more outside.”
&gt;Outside sucks though… there are no dragons.
&gt;Going all the way down and sitting at your desk, you smile, opening up the game.
&gt;It’s seconds before you join a bunch on ran-dumbs and get on the god of lies raid.
&gt;You sighed still, the pizza not helping.
&gt;You super fucked up… he was a hot guy too.
&gt;Handsome, offered to pay for food, said he drove for a living.
&gt;Uber is pretty good pay…
&gt;HA, get shirked brawler.
&gt;You smiled at the chat, seeing “Troll ninja.”
&gt;Your smile goes as you get hit with a crit, the squad wiping as they take agro.
&gt;Sighing again, you wait a moment for the healer.
“Come on… just LV3 and…”
&gt;You gasp, seeing the other area with the boss shine brightly.
&gt;LOL
&gt;EPIC FAIL
&gt;sorryguis
&gt;Healer fail
“HE JUST LV3’ED ON THE OTHER PLATFROM! AHHHHH!”
&gt;Fucking Final Fantasy.
&gt;You sighed, grabbing your phone on instinct and flinching.
&gt;…Right, you super fucked up.
&gt;Opening your phone, you read the messages… what?
&gt;’Good going girl! He loves you!’
&gt;you look at the sent picture, seeing that Anon wrote to Jane about you.
&gt;’Yeah, super shy… but she’s cute, good looking. Maybe once I get past her skittish attitude, she’ll open up more.’
&gt;…
&gt;AGUYLIKESYOU!
&gt;You ball up, squeeing as you fall out of the chair and roll a little bit.
&gt;Texting Jane, you grin as you ask what to do.
&gt;’Don’t worry, he wants to hand out again. He also said he want’s so show something off to you before you two go out for a late night!’
&gt;You cover your face, smiling.
&gt;He wants a second date! He must like you!
&gt;Maybe he will kiss you!
&gt;You never got a kiss before… or a second date…
&gt;AND HE’S A HUMAN!
&gt;You had a hotspot for humans… anthros were… ew.
&gt;Dogs, cats… just ew. Some were hot, but not your kind of thing… Their dicks were even worse.
&gt;Humans were just nice and smooth, no bad things to annoy or hurt in the moment.
&gt;…You were a /bred/ addict… and with good reason.
&gt;… maybe Anon has a smooth chest?
&gt;Maybe one with hair?~
&gt;looking at your phone again, you see more messages.
&gt;You smile, saying yes to Jane giving your number to him.
&gt;…Oh god, what if her really likes you? Like, wants to have sex?
&gt;no, no… oh god, he might…
&gt;He might look and see that you’re not so good under the clothes…
&gt;No! happy things! Guys wants a second date! You are having fun raiding!
&gt;Looking up, you growl, seeing you lost connection for inactivity.
----------
&gt;You couldn’t help but beam, being dropped off at the college by the bus.
&gt;Okay, maybe you were also scared shitless to even text Anon whenever you looked at a message from him, but still!
&gt;Things were looking better! And not one thing could bring you down!
&gt;You rounded the corner to your locker your smile plummeting into an open mouth gasp of shock.
&gt;Your locker is… oh no.
OH NO! NONONONONNONO!
&gt;You ripped at the papers, seeing what they said.
&gt;Human fucker, Breed bitch freak, mega- oh no fuck that one.
&gt;You tore it all down, even the pictures of you and…
&gt;HOW? HOW DID THESE GET HERE?!
&gt;A too good for the world laugh fills the air before you get shoved into the steel locker, dropping everything and your books.
&gt;”Oops, sorry ya freak.”
&gt;You grunt, feeling a lump in your throat as you look up.
&gt;The black mare flashes a knowing grin, tail flicking you in the face before she walks away.
&gt;You want to scream at Ashley… but…
&gt;You whine instead, crumpling up before a pair of shoes are at your side.
&gt;Looking up, Jane is there, the lioness frowning as she helps you up.
&gt;”You okay? I tried to stop her, but…
“…This is supposed to be college, not highschool…”
&gt;”We both know Ashley is just a bitch, through and through. I’m sorry, you know that she’s got those knuckles, and even then…”
&gt;You nodded, feeling queasy at the thought of the two horses, Ashley and Tom.
&gt;Lovers through and through, ready to break noses and push people around at any moment.
&gt;How either of them were not kicked out of here was beyond you, save for the fact that the odds are that the fight happens outside of the campus.
“H-how did she?”
&gt;”She spotted you in public, told me everything when I tried to confront her.”
&gt;You nod, frowning and wanting to cry.
&gt;”Hey, girl… it’s okay.”
&gt;Jane smiles, patting your head.
&gt;”Anon’s wanting to talk again, he said he was right about breaking through that shell of yours.”
&gt;You smile, nodding.
“Yeah… thank you again… it’s just so…”
&gt;Stressfullembarasssingamazingstupidawsomefu-
&gt;”There ya go. Just think, your next date will be great! Tomorrow, right?~”
&gt;You smile more, face burning slightly.
&gt;”Come on Nora, let’s get going. Fuck Ashley.”
&gt;Yeah, fuckin’ bitch.
&gt;School thankfully goes so quickly that you barely think of any of it, getting off the bus and getting home
&gt;Opening the door, immediately you get called out.
&gt;”Nora!”
&gt;You tense up, peeking around the corner.
&gt;You took all the dished from your room back up… didn’t leave any downloads running… sure as hell knew your mother wouldn’t find any of your… “items”.
“Y-yes?”
&gt;Your mother smiles, waving as she cooks.
&gt;”No trouble! Quit looking so nervous! We are going on a little fun trip tomorrow, so I figure I could get a notice in.~”
&gt;Your heart plummets, your mother’s expression changing with yours.
&gt;”Nora…”
“I… u-um… had some plans with friends….”
&gt;Your mother sighs, nodding.
&gt;”You are an adult now… but remember, your father’s birthday tomorrow would be a good way to get him to ease up on you. We are going on a little fun outing to watch a race.”
&gt;You groan, smacking your head.
&gt;You forgot… again…
&gt;Not that you really cared… but your father was odd… every time you joined in on outside stuff of family thing he got less… wordy with the things you liked.
&gt;It’s not exactly fair that you can’t say anything back whenever he sees you and sighs, complaining about you playing games…
“Okay…”
&gt;Your mother smiles, nodding.
&gt;”I’m sorry, Nora.”
“It’s fine…”
&gt;No.
&gt;It’s not.
&gt;You sigh, listening to your mother talk about the event before going to your room and closing the door.
&gt;You growled, throwing your books before flopping on the bed.
&gt;Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
&gt;You whine… getting things together and texting Anon.
&gt;Damn it all…
&gt;You swap messages, booting up your computer as you explain and answer things to him.
&gt;The next message puzzles you, making you hum.
“Go to the race… this works out perfectly… what?”
&gt;Works out perfectly…
&gt;Oh! Maybe he looked up the event and lives close! He cold get you from the race!
&gt;Typing up “okay”, you pause before you press send, biting your lip and humming.
&gt;but… your parents…
&gt;You gasp as you accidently press send, your fate sealed.
&gt;tensing up, you groan, hanging over your bed.
&gt;Fuck your life sometimes…
----------
&gt;You hummed, looking at the gathering crowds.
&gt;School was done in a flash leaving you to join your mother and father at this race…
&gt;A rally apparently, off-road-ish racing…
&gt;So…. Boring RocketLeague where cars go around a few times instead of playing soccer.
&gt;…Okay… it was kind of cool… just not you.
&gt;You could hear engines revving, your father smiling.
&gt;He had an odd obsession with cars, even more with racing.
&gt;You honestly just don’t get it.
&gt;All of you had arrived early, getting food and seated way before anything started.
&gt;Your mother just humored your father, mostly, as he blabbered about cars.
&gt;Not that you care, it’s just noise to you.
&gt;…You know what? This isn’t so bad. The air is nice, the food is good, and it’s kinda fun to watch the cars once they get going.
&gt;”Ohhhh.~ Hey there, Nora! Fancy meeting you here!”
&gt;And ruined…
&gt;You winced, looking up to see Ashley.
&gt;The mare grineed, patting you on the head.
&gt;”Oh, is that one of your friends?”
“n-“
&gt;”Oh yeah! Damn near besties! Pardon the language, just a habit. Right, Friendo?”
&gt;She punches you, pretty hard, making you nod.
&gt;”U-uhhh yeah.”
&gt;Ashley sits right next to you, sneering our of your parents view.
&gt;”Human fucking cunt.” She whispers.
&gt;God damnit…
&gt;You turn away, just trying to focus on the cars.
&gt;Thankfully, she leaves you alone, her boyfriend coming along and the two of them getting close.
&gt;HOW the hell does no one notice his hands in her pants?
&gt;…Damnit… why can’t that be you?
&gt;Maybe Anon would… Ohhh.~
&gt;You can feel your face heat up, smiling at the thought.
&gt;You’d almost want him to do bad things to you, even if a little forcefully...
&gt;”GO!”
&gt;You jump, watching the cars take off and leave dirt in the air.
&gt;Looking to the screen, you watch, smiling.
&gt;”Comeon 85! You sexy beast! Win!” Ashley yells.
&gt;You watch the giant screen, listening to the cheers and boos.
&gt;Ashley aside… whit is kinda fun. Not super fun, but fun!
&gt;And better yet! Anon still is somewhere.~
&gt;What is he doing right now?
&gt;You wander and ponder, thinking of Anon and only pausing when you feel a certain moistness and fire in your legs.
&gt;You are so dirty… guy you just met and you can’t help but think of how you want him to do anything to you.
&gt;It would be so amazing though, like a doujin~
&gt;…God, you need to bust out the dildo again.
&gt;”GOoooo!”
&gt;”Come on!”
&gt;You look up, seeing the cars in the home stretch.
&gt;One tears through, well ahead of the rest.
&gt;”YES!” Ashley yells.
&gt;You flinch back, watching her jump up ad down.
&gt;The car spins in victory, doing dohnuts before the driver gets out, waving with his helmet on.
&gt;He dashes to another man, the other man turning.
&gt;”Our winner is asking someone in seat 85-B to come on down!”
&gt;Oh, cool.
&gt;”OH god damnit!”
&gt;You look, seing Ashly scowl as she looks as her seat.
&gt;86-B…
&gt;Oh fuck!
&gt;You look to your seat, seeing 85-B.
&gt;It’s you!?
&gt;”Go on, sweetie!”
&gt;You look around, seeing the crowd all look at you and cheer.
&gt;It’s super odd, all the others clearing a path for you to make your way to the field.
&gt;Sure enough, you get there and approach the announcer, seeing the driver next to him.
“U-uh. Hey?”
&gt;The announcer looks to the driver, smiling.
&gt;The driver rips his helmet off, reavealing..!
“Anon?!”
&gt;”Hey there Nora.~ surprise.”
&gt;He grabs you, pulling you into a kiss.
&gt;You freeze up, eyes wide.
&gt;First: why? Second:
&gt;OHMUHGAWDHEIKISSINYOUTHISISLIKETHETIMEINUYASHAANDKIGO-
&gt;You can hear the crowd cheer as you close your eyes, feeling like fireworks are going off or something.
&gt;Anon breaks the kiss, turning and waving at the crowd.
&gt;”I know it’s super sudden and a little much… but you’re surprised, right? Wave!”
&gt;You look around, seeing yourself on the screen and waving with a smile.
&gt;This is so embarrassing… you are too fat for this…
&gt;Why can’t you stop smiling?
&gt;You look around, at the cars, the crowd, the screen.
&gt;You spot a zoom in of the crowd, catching your parents and their shock.
&gt;”Lucky girl!~ your own little trophy?”
&gt;”Jusy maybe!”Anon says into the microphone.
&gt;You catch Ashley, the mare scowling angrly.
&gt;Best. Day. Ever. …of all time.</textarea>
