        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;It was so wrong yet felt so right
&gt;This creature from a distant land is copulating with me like any other normal Nord woman
&gt;her exotic beauty, her femmine demeanor, her  mysterious aura all wrapped in soft golden fur
&gt; I should be on edge, having a thief have me completely vulnerable to anything, but I&#039;m not
&gt;I enjoy the moment of this new found pleasure
&gt;I always saw her hanging round the inns, hiding in the shadows, stalking wealthy citizens
&gt;Each time I would stop her before doing anything she&#039;s regret
&gt;She&#039;d act all innocent like a child and stare with her bright yellow sclera, her kitten like purring and flicking her tail under my chin in fain attempts to seduce me so I&#039;d look the other way, or now I think back was I wrong about her intentions?.



&gt;She wasn&#039;t allowed near the cities most saw her kind as thief&#039;s and ostracized to the other rims of the city sleeping in tatty mammoth tents
&gt;I saw her in trouble with some locals there yelling screaming at her with pitch torches accusing her of stealing, see was scared nothing she would say would calm the mob down
&gt;I rush over and break it up
&gt;The Khajiit wraps her arms around me
&gt;As much as I wanted to hold her as well I was on duty
&gt;I calm down the crowd and get the detail on what&#039;s happened
&gt;a thief stole some jewellery from a house and now there turning on the usual suspects
&gt;She said she was walking down the street then this mob formed around her
&gt;the crowd might get violent with the Khajiit not protected by a guard so I brought her with me on my investigation
&gt;I search high and low, finding nothing when I spot something glimmering in the distance of a silhouette I yell out to the figure to stop but it dashes away
&gt;I chase after the figure, my armour clanking in cricket chirped filled night I loose sight of them
&gt;I feel nervous and claustrophobic the inky black night surrounding me
&gt;At least the Khajiit is close so I feel more at ease
&gt;Suddenly the Khajiit&#039;s ears pinch back her eyes turn to black slits-something is close
&gt;Seeing her reaction I draw my mace it&#039;s not the most stealthiest weapon but clubbing bandits doesn&#039;t take finesse
&gt;Before I can judge where it&#039;s coming from
I&#039;m dragged into the shadows my hand covered by a warm furry paw
&gt;She hold me close to her chest, my chest is pounding out of fear and excitement
&gt;I&#039;ve never been this close to someone before that wasn&#039;t involving there body dropping to the floor after
&gt;&quot;Stay still. Armour make too much noise&quot;
She spoke like the Khajiit but it wasn&#039;t raspy like the others she must have been born and raised here by humans
&gt;We both wait patiently for a noise, but nothing happens, even though there&#039;s something lurking in the shadows close I enjoyed being so close to this warm soft Khajiit, It must be due to the situation I&#039;m acting like I want more intimacy with this must be the adrenaline
&gt;I can&#039;t stay here all night, so I jump out the shadows hoping to make the miscreant jump and make a noise but nothing-silence.

                      __________________

&gt;The Khajiit slowly creeps out as well, still on edge her dagger drawn but still nothing
&gt;Sure of whatever was hiding had scarped into the night I sheath my mace back in defeated
&gt;I walk out of the alleyway when suddenly the sound of boots and metal clank above me The figure was waiting not in the shadows but up above it strikes down a blur of red and black attire crash down
&gt;I back up with a moment to spare, the Khajiit snarls and charges The stranger before me, an argonian, and judging by the red and black clothing he must be apart of the dark brotherhood.

&gt;He swipes his blade at my neck but I dodge by a hairline there wouldn&#039;t be enough time to draw my mace as it&#039;s to heavy for such a quick response needed
&gt;I give a quick jab at his throat he stumbles back he lunges for my chest but the Khajiit stops him and catches his arm cutting his arm he was lunging with, it works
&gt;It makes him angry he&#039;s about to go for the Khajiit
&gt;I take this opportunity and kick him with my steel boot before he has a chance to attack
&gt;It sends him to the floor, I take the chance to wield my mace I ready my mace I swing it hard onto his lizard skull, it cracks like a roaring fire his blood spats onto my daedric
Mace, his body flop lifelessly to the ground
His head cushioned by his blood like wine
&gt;I search the corpse and his satchel I find the stolen jewelry, it&#039;s a blue jem on a silver necklace I have no pockets on me so I tossed it towards the Khajiit to catch
&gt;She catches it, she&#039;s taken off guard not by me throwing it but me trusting her not to just run away into the night.
&gt;&quot;Human guard trust Khajiit? Why?&quot; I put back my mace it&#039;s blood still dripping
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry, you saved my life, how could I not trust you&quot;
&gt;She breaks into a grin, We walk back to the orginal crime scene
&gt;The Khajiit&#039;s tail has coiled around my arm
&gt;Is this intentional?, I shouldn&#039;t feel flustered, let&#039;s just return the necklace
&gt;I arrive back to the mob, who still haven&#039;t calmed down, apon seeing the Khajiit with the necklace they get the wrong impression and start running over
&gt;In a panic, I draw my mace, ready for anything
 &gt;&quot;No good cat!, We knew it was you&quot; an angry Inn keeper snapped at her
&gt;&quot;filthy thief&#039;s da&#039; lotta ya&quot; one man huffed
&gt;Seeing the poor girl wince in unjustified shaming I step in agitated
&gt;&quot;All right, that&#039;s enough!, She didn&#039;t do anything, and if anybody tries anything they&#039;ll have to go through me!&quot;
&gt;The mob quite down I take this opportunity to just hand the stupid necklace back to an ungrateful mother
&gt;Ha!, &#039;bout time, I was waiting-&quot;
&gt;She stops her rant to nosly peer round to my back noticing the Khajiit&#039;s tail still wrapped round my arm
&gt;&quot;Oh my god&#039;s, that creature is acting like it&#039;s partner!
&gt;The crowd start to have an inaudible chatter with a few gasps for good measure
&gt;&quot;Filthy cat your kind don&#039;t belong with ours it&#039;s unatural&quot;
&gt;Then I get a ears full as well
&gt;&quot;it&#039;s disgusting! how could you let that disgusting creature go near you, acting like a couple it&#039;s so-&quot;
&gt;The Khajiit is almost in tears, it makes me mad, judging me and her after she saved my life it was time I spoke, well, shout.
&gt;&quot;Enough! Go back home! I got your Fucking necklace back, so be a little thankful! And what I do or who I choose to love is nobodies business!, Now disperse or be sent as an offer to Molag Bal!&quot;
&gt;The crowd too scared to reply disperse one by one giving us disapproving glares
&gt;Me and the Khajiit are alone standing in the empty marketplace, she turns to me holding my hand
&gt;&quot;Thank you for that. It warms my heart like the warm sands to have human defend Khajiit&#039;s honour&quot;
&gt;she breaks into a warm smile and faint purring fill the air
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s no problem, you where innocent, and they wanted blood, plus you saved my ass back there, can&#039;t believe they thought we were partners...I mean, not that I care what they think&quot; I feel flustered again, I let out a tired yawn
&gt;&quot;Well, I&#039;m exhausted I&#039;m going to bed, you got a place to stay?&quot; The Khajiit just looks glum and points around me
&gt;&quot;I sleep on ground. No warm bed for Natalia.&quot;
&gt;It comes to me I&#039;m just hearing her name for the first time
&gt;&quot;Natalia? That your name? Seems unusual for your kind&quot;
&gt;It sounded better in my head
&gt;She nods politely
&gt;&quot;My name comes from my human mother, I was found at empty camp as kitten, she took care of me&quot;
&gt;&quot;May I ask, what is your name&quot; Natalia asks
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m mostly know by Dragon born but people stopped treating me special once everything was safe again, so it&#039;s now it&#039;s like a nickname&quot;
&gt;&quot;Dragon born, it suits you, very strong sounding, like you&quot;
&gt;There&#039;s a awkward slience, from what I want to say and her waiting for me to say it, eventually I break the ice
&gt;&quot;Err, listen Natalia, if you wanted you could stay with m-&quot;
&gt;She links my arm with her&#039;s tight it feels good having her so close
&gt;&quot;Natalia say go faster, these colds nights do not make for a happy Khajiit&quot; she grumbles.
                    
                       _________________


&gt;And with that, we walk to the Inn I&#039;m staying at, luckily everyone has gone to bed so we just sneak to my room
&gt;Even though It wasn&#039;t big I still gave her a tour, I show her the wooden chair, As I change into my normal clothes in the other room
&gt;I come back into the main room Natisha is wolfing down the fruits on the table, she must have been starving she notices me back in the room and starts to act like she&#039;s looking round the room pretending to be really interested in four barren walls.
&gt;I pour out a glass of wine and some for Natisha too, I take a long gulp, just what was needed after a stressful day after the feline had drank the wine I had given her all in one go, she looks down to the floor sheepishly,
&gt;&quot;I forgot to thank you, for saving my life&quot;
She softly says under her breath, I put my hand on her shoulder for reasurance
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s fine, you saved mine too, who knows what would have happened if you weren&#039;t there&quot;
&gt;She looks up smilling at me, but it doesn&#039;t last, she looks lost on thought, frowning all the while
&gt;&quot;But the way they acted to us... being so close they thought we...&quot;
She rubs her head on my arm her face turns sour and jumps out of the chair
&gt;&quot;Khajiit can&#039;t be with human, Khajiit must be with her own kind&quot; she says with no directed anger in her voice
&gt;Her words hurt, I think deep down I know why, I didn&#039;t want to acknowledge it and pretend I didn&#039;t feel it but, I think I have fallen for this kind, tender, creature I rush over and wrap my hands round her waist
&gt;&quot;Who says so!, Why can&#039;t we!, I-I want to be with you Natisha and I don&#039;t care who knows&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s flustered and caught of guard by my sudden confession
&gt;&quot;But Dragon born! what about the people! they&#039;ll never accept us!&quot; She leans in closer and places her head on my chest, I cradeld her head in tighter she starts to weep softly and feel a rush of sadness too.


&gt;&quot;To damm what the world thinks! Even if it&#039;s us against the world I won&#039;t stop loving you&quot; she picks her head up and looks to me with her tear filled eye&#039;s.
&gt;&quot;Oh Dragon born, Why did I have to feel this way for you&quot; are heads meet in the middle, her soft furry forehead pressed against mine she slowly and gently leans into kiss my lips, it was divine, since I don&#039;t pull away it gives her confidence to continue.


                       ________________


&gt;She starts slow then gets quicker and quicker untill we&#039;re locked in tongue&#039;s are arms are like an octopus grabbing and groping all over, it was intense and passionate, I break the kiss and bring her over to the bed, I lie down and throw my clothes across the floor, Natisha undressing in front of me showing of her curves and plump features
&gt;She crawls onto the bed like stalking prey and works her way up until she&#039;s laying on top of me we kiss with firey passion and lust,
&gt;She breaks the kiss first, and pushes her self up using my chest as support, she straddles her hips down to my crotch her arms next to my head supporting her we stay like this for a few moments,
&gt;I put my hand on her soft fluffy cheek and rub behind her ear &quot;it&#039;s ok, I&#039;m ready&quot; she closes her eyes and purrs loud, and snuggles her head into my hand
&gt;&quot;I want to feel you Dragon born, like lovers&quot;
&gt;With that we connect, she lets out a cute moan, her warmth gripping me tightly feels like I&#039;ve died and gone to sovngarde she moves up and down using my legs to keep her steady, in this moment I take in her beauty.
&gt;So here I am; copulating with an exotic beauty from a distance land, I didn&#039;t plan to meet someone, just be a long wolf till the end of my days, let alone be with a different kind, even though it&#039;s not heard of before I couldn&#039;t care who or what the gods think,
I love her and she loves me, I&#039;ll fight any king or God who would keep us apart or bring harm to her. I&#039;m close, &quot;Natalia! I&#039;m going to-&quot; she stops me with a kiss as my seed enters her womb, she pulls back from the kiss and lays ontop, her head placed on near mine. &quot;I love you human.You love Khajiit too?&quot; I hold her close and role her to her side as we pull over the quilt to keep warm, her soothing purring fill the musky air,
I give her a final kiss before we drift off to sleep &quot;forever and ever&quot; I whisper to the dozy feline.


              ______________________



&gt;I wake up to the morning sun peering through a glass tinted window, Natisha still fast asleep next to me, I just stare with infatuation at her peaceful slumbering face, watching her slowly breathe in and out, she wakes from her slumber stretching out with a content yawn her claws and teeth on display before she turns to me.
&gt;&quot;Good morning~&quot; she rubs her nose against my cheek and daintly purrs, I want to stay like this forever but it can&#039;t last,
&gt;I put on my armour and grab my mace, I want to do some more exploring around skyrim since the weather seems so nice today, would Natalia come with me? She&#039;s shown she can handel herself so why not.
&gt;Natalia is getting dressed on the side of the bed facing the window, her back facing me, her tail flicking and swishing away playfully
&gt;Once she&#039;s finished I sit next to her on the bed and go to kiss her cheek, she leans her face into my lips as her tail coils around my neck
&gt;&quot;You make Khajiit feel like kitten again~&quot; she buries her head into my neck, but stops 
Her face gone blank
&gt;&quot;Wait!, what about the town people&#039;s? What will they do when they find out will they be mad? will they attack  us-&quot; I put my finger on her lips to stop her hectic worrying
&gt;&quot;It doesn&#039;t matter Natalia, all that matters is that we have eachother&quot; I rub behind her ear to soothe her worried mind, she clams back down, with that purring noise I have grown to love.
&gt;&quot;Your right, we must not care what the world thinks, so long as we have eachother&quot;
&gt;She hands me her hand, I grip it tightly as she gets off the bed and walk to my room&#039;s door to head out to walk downstairs and into the bright crisps morning
We walk slowly down the stairs like walking down a ceremonial isle, some guests of the inn look, probably thinking I have caught her thieving  but most are still hungover and don&#039;t care, it felt like forever walking to the exit.


            _____________________



&gt;We finally get to the exit, she couldn&#039;t be closer to me if she was hiding in my armour, her tail coils around my arm, I love it when she does that, we walk for a bit, it must be too early for most of town citizens
&gt;&quot;Say, Natisha, I was wondering if you&#039;d like to go exploring with me today&quot; she hugs me tight with excitement
&gt;&quot;Yes! Natisha will walk to the ends of the earth with you, plus I love the adventure too&quot; I peck her cheek with elated joy
&gt;&quot;I was hoping you&#039;d say that&quot; I feel like I could take on the world I couldn&#039;t be more happy than this not even sovngarde can compete with this, but then reality comes crashing down apon us.
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s the the Dragon Born! With that cat lady again!&quot; Here it comes, the dreaded disapproval of the people I helped save from bandits to dragons, and yet they won&#039;t be happy for me.
&gt;&quot;Filthy cat! You don&#039;t have any right to be with him&quot;
I dread to look over to Natisha, heart broken and afraid, but she&#039;s stronger than I thought she was, she brings me in for a long kiss, by standers in awe at the sight,
&gt;&quot;Dragon Born how could you! Are we human women not enough!&quot;
The lips and tounge I love more than anything in this world was right, she didn&#039;t care what they said, she even had a mischievous grin on her as well looking over at the human women, I break the kiss as we reach the big metal doors of the city, behind the world at our feet,
&gt;&quot;I love you Natisha&quot; 
&gt;&quot;I love you too&quot;
With that, we open the big loud doors and make our own journey and adventure with nothing to hide from anybody, Just us against the world, and we liked it like that, it wouldn&#039;t be fair otherwise.


                     _________________


&gt;Many months had passed since we left the big cities and towns, I built a house for us in the woods, with a farm and stable, although not working I was still a Thane across skyrim so my pockets were very lined. We married as soon as we left, our love officially blessed, it was a magical day, Natisha was so happy. I join her in the living room reading a book next to the warm fire, keeping warm,
&gt;&quot; Hope you&#039;re keeping warm Darling&quot; I peck her cheek before sitting down next to her, &quot;Have to keep warm for the both of you&quot; Natisha was carrying kittens and was heavily pregnant with my children
&gt;&quot;Of course, love~, There waiting patiently for you see them grow up big and strong like there father&quot; she kisses my forehead as I snuggled up to her, ready to sleep after a long hard day
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m so glad I met you Natisha&quot; I yawn out as my eyelids start to feel heavy
&gt;&quot;Me to my perfect human husband&quot; she cooes while running her soft fingers through my hair
&gt;&quot;Just think; If I never framed that argonian we&#039;d had never met~&quot;
