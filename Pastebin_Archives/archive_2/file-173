When you said &#039;let&#039;s go for coffee&#039; I didn&#039;t think that you meant... Y&#039;know... Coffee.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Let me clarify something.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You and this guy have been friends for a long time and just started dating.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why not, right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You know each other well enough... Or so you thought...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What else could I mean?&quot; He asks. &quot;Anyway, I heard that this place is really anthro friendly because of the Right and Left thing, I thought that a little extra research could avoid some racist idiot.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;That&#039;s very thoughtful. Thank you.&quot; You reply to his sweetness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re sitting down now, coat off and going over the menu.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They have thirty different kinds of coffee, at least.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not only that, they have pastries, danishes, cakes, bunts, cookies and every other manner of things to go with coffee.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This place was like a sex shop combined with a porn studio and a strip-club all in one.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For you at least.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your guy is just browsing the menu, humming and hawing, chatting lightly with you while he makes remarks about this heat-inducing beverage.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually, a waitress comes by.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hi there! Welcome to Coffee Pawz. What can I get you today?&quot; The bubbly black jackal asks while flipping open a notebook.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You boyfriend looks at you, expecting you to go first.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What a mentalgan.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You, on the other hand, have your heart hammering in your chest and the spaghetti is practically on the ceiling at this point.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;N-N-No... It&#039;s- *Ahem* It&#039;s fine... Y-You order first.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He&#039;s concerned. &quot;Hey, is everything alright? You seem... off...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hehehe... No. I&#039;m fine. Just... Just go ahead and order.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well. Alright.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The waitress turns and looks expectantly at him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What&#039;s a strong coffee with lots of flavor?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles a wolfish grin. &quot;Well, sir, we have lots of coffees here and we can even combine blends, if you like. I prefer the Cuban. It&#039;s really strong and has a boldness to it like no other.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She&#039;s drank that?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You imagine how strong that would be for you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ve only had one scoop of light roast the only time that you had it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your thighs rub together as you imagine the heat the Cuban coffee would mimic.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He looks impressed. &quot;That good, eh?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Oh yes sir. I drink it every day.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;PAHHHHHH!!!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whatdidyousaynigger.webm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You cannot believe what you just heard.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This little jackal must be wet all the time with that coffee.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You imagine the heat that she&#039;s feeling right now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You imagine how wet she must be.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;How much her pussy must be tingling with the need to be filled.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You realize how wet you currently are.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Suddenly, you realize a different scent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hidden under the coffee and sugar and pastry, there&#039;s something else... Something... Primal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s the scent of a pack of bitches in heat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Something else. Your boyfriend is the only male here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Almost all the other patrons, the ten or so that there are, are canines and are all female.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look over and see the hostess, the one that greeted you, chatting with a barista while they are both sipping mugs of steaming sex.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can do nothing but gush your wetness as you imagine what must be happening to their bodies.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The heat from the coffee warming their bellies as the heat from their vaginas driving them mad.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You imagine what they&#039;re like in bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With them being in constant heat, they must fuck like it too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pounding, thrusting, bed-shaking FUCKING.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Miss?” The jackal asks you with a small smile. “Are you ready to order?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your heart drops and rests nicely beside the stone in your stomach.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pray to your autism that you don’t make a total ass out of yourself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”U-Um… What’s a… A coffee without t-too strong… That isn’t very strong?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The waitress is all too happy to assist.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Coming around to the back of your chair, she presses her breasts into the back of your head and begins pointing out things on the menu.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re only half-listening.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She REEKS of heat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Of sopping-wet pussy and the want of a big, long dick to stuff herself with.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s intoxicating to you as you begin to feel your heart race and your pulse in your neck.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t even know if you NEED a coffee at this point.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Never the less you decide to order.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You say, before you can catch yourself, “I’ll have a Cuban, too.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Niggerwhat.gif</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Great!” The jackal said coming around to the side of the table again. “Any pastries or nibbles that I can get for you? Everything is made in-house.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”They make everything here?” You ask in a small voice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The jackal is growing very concerned. “Are you alright darling? You seem kind of flushed. Why don’t I get you a water, alright?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod meekly, not quite looking her in the eye.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not with how horny she is still fresh in your mind.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You boyfriend asks. “Is it racist if I ask if canines can have chocolate? Sorry but I know that regular dogs can’t and I wasn’t sure.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The waitress smiles. “That’s not a problem at all sir. It’s wonderful to see someone who is so caring about anthros, especially in this day and age. It’s not a problem at all for canines like us to eat chocolate. There are some individuals that are allergic to it and we have a substitute for them. Were you thinking of getting something with chocolate on or in it?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your boy orders for you both. “A slice of chocolate coffee cake and a couple of pastries, please.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s scribbling on the pad. “Any preference on the kind?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Surprise me.” He says with a confidence that makes your heart jump and your walls pulse.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”No problem, sir. I’ll get you both some water and then your coffees in a sec.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She spins and walks over to the coffee-bar.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now, the part that you were dreading.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Talking to the guy you were on a date with, without exploding the spaghetti like an Italian terrorist.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thankfully, you can’t really get into any serious conversation as the water gets there.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pick up the water and down it almost in one gulp before handing it back to the jackal and saying “More please!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She is mildly confused. “Umm... Yes miss… Your coffees should be ready in a moment.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After she walks away, your boyfriend begins suggesting things to do.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;“We could go to a movie or maybe laser tag or out for dinner after some window-shopping? I dunno. What do you want to do?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reply with the most autistic thing that you can think of. “We could spend the day and night at my place.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What even in the fuck?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Are you high?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For honest and serious, what the fuck?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe all the roasting coffee is having an effect on you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re certainly wet enough.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe you’re not high but how are you this horney?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You haven’t even had any coffee yet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You begin to dread what will happen once you take that first sip and descend into mindless heat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your guy, thankfully, is not the brightest crayon in the box. “Oh. So, like a movie? I can cook for you but you’d need to show me where everything is.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thankfully, the spaghetti is not quite at critical mass yet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sadly, the only repreve you will get is when the covfefe gets to the table.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That also means that you’ll have to drink it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe even eat some of the treats.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why are you getting excited?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is a nightmare.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re trapped in a date at a sex parlour that anything you touch will send you into immediate and uncontrollable lust for anything with (or without) a dick.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your pussy gushed juice onto your thighs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your legs quivered.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh shit… </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The coffee is set in front of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The scent is staggering.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ritch and full-bodied roasted beans.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s inky and black and smells delicious.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You see the human across from you smile at the waitress and smile as he sips from the black coffee.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then he looks at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Aren’t you going to try any? It’s quite good.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Jackal is standing over your table with a grin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”It is quite good miss.” She grins even wider. “Try a pastry with a sip. That always gets me going in the morning.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”M-Morning?” You ask.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That damn jackal’s smile grows wider. “Yes miss. Every morning, I have a nice big cup. I’m useless without it.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The human across from you pipes up. “Oh, yeah. I know that feeling. I love coffee. Ever try an espresso?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Once. I tried it but I couldn’t finish it. I was a puddle on the floor before the cup was done.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was that strong?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Anyway” He says, partially rescuing you. “I’m sure you’re busy so I won’t keep you.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Not at all sir. If there’s anything else that you need just wave me over and I’ll be right there.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She spun and walked over to another table.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The scent of her heat crashed into your nose like a tsunami.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your nose seems to be much more sensitive.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He picks up his mug and gestures to yours.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wrap your hands around the mug, feeling the warmth and dreading it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The smell of the roast assails your schnoz and you can feel your body wanting to be bred.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shutter as you bring the coffee close to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He holds out his mug across the table and smiles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You want that smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You want to sit on that smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lock your legs behind that head and make him drink you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Snap out of it girl.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You clink your mug with his and force a smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He smiles even wider. “Smells good, doesn’t it?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Spaghetti almost reaching critical mass. “S-Sure it does. Mmmmmm. Coffee…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He takes a sip and smiles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Oh that’s fucking good. Try it.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Moment of truth here.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Dont fuck it up.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hold your pussy in until you can get home.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull the mug up to your lips.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Here we go.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Down the hatch and into the worst heat that you’ll ever have.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take a sip.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel the warmth of the drink rolling down you throat as you condemn yourself to the heat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The flavor explodes in your mouth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can taste the soil that it was grown in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The hot Cuban sun.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The water that showered it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The years and years that it’s taken to get a simple drink to the level that it is.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The ritch bitterness all over, the sweet touch at the tip of your tounge and the pepper at the back of your throat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shiver at the explosive and exciting taste of the beverage.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Mmmm. That’s really good. That’s incredible!” You say, excited and amazed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He laughs. “You act like you’ve never had coffee before.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Only the once.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Just one time?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”That’s a shame. We need do this again. I can’t have my girl being left out of something as fun as coffee.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You laugh.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A genuine laugh.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re relaxed and you take a nice big gulp of your steamy drink.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You chat with your boyfriend for a while, draining your first mug.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And then another.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You eat some coffee cake and it’s more delicious than anything that you’ve ever tasted.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are halfway down your third cup.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All that&#039;s left of the snacks is crumbs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He wait patiently for you to finish.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You do and he waves the jackal over.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When the bill comes he offers to pay but you tell him. “I’ll bite you in the wrist if you don’t let me pay half.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He relents.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Total comes to $21.50 or $3.00USD</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get up to leave. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Coats on and out the door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He jingles his keys in his hands.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Hey,” He says, “How about a drive? I’ll bring you to my place or yours and I can make good on that dinner?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smile wolfishly. “Sounds great. I took public anyway. I like to walk.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sigh and smile. “Something about ancestral memory and all that.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He walks you over to a 2015 Audi.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t know what model.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He opens the door and you slide into a comfy leather seat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sit and a shock of electricity shoots through your spine as your ass hits the seat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It has begun.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can feel the coals that were gently fanning in your belly growing stronger and more robust.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He gets in the drivers side.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The fire explodes like a oil tanker dropped its load on the embers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It rolls through your body like an ocean of fire.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Up from your belly to your chest and out to the tips of your fingers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your legs start to quiver as the boiling warmth shoots into your heels.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then, as if it’s alive, the fire pulls back from all parts of your body and slams itself into your pussy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You gasp, nearly cuming from the sensation of the mild pressure of your sitting on the leather.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He starts the car.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You mumble to yourself. “Please, quickly.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Hmm?” He asks.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Oh, nothing. Let’s get to my place.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Sure.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He starts driving.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Less than five minutes pass but in those five minutes the heat has gone from urgent to unbearable.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your cunny keeps squeasing on it’s own and the musk you’re putting out is absurd.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s no doubt that you’ve soaked your panties.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re sure there’s a wet spot on the seat now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You arrive at your apartment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now the fun can begin!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nearly pull him up the stairs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He’s struggling to keep up with you as you drag him into the lobby.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Over to the elevators you go and you begin jamming the keypad so fast your finger hurts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Hey?” He asks. “What’s going on? You’re acting kind of weird.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Nope. Needy yes. Weird no. Where’s the fucking elevator!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He nods slowly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You know that you don’t owe me anything, right? I took you out and, if you want it to be, that can be it.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You round on him and let out a predatory growl.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You are going nowhere. We are going up to my apartment if I have to drag you there by what’s left of your lower half if you try and run.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He smiles that big goofy grin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Wow. You must really want me to cook for you, huh. I feel like rumors of me have been greatly exaggerated.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you can reply the elevator dings and opens.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A cute but huge draft anthro exits the elevator.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s wearing a bright yellow sun-dress and straw hat that match perfectly with her rust-red colored fur.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her name is Isabel and she makes fucking good lasagna.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As she steps out of the slow-ass machine she smiles at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Oh, hi! It’s been a while since I’ve seen you entertain. Who’s this?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“It’s my boyfriend.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That came out rather harshly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’d feel bad if your world wasn’t consumed with the need for cock.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sniffs the air.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”That smell… Oh… OH! That’s you?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yes Isabel, that’s me…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles and looks at your male in tow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Good luck.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She flashes a winning grin and saunters out the front door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He turns to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Good luck? What did she mean good luck? Also, yeah, I don’t know if it’s something to do with the building but it’s kind of musty in here.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Oh is it?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Please don’t suspect…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Yeah. I’m not sure why I didn’t notice it before.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Well the building is kind of old. That’s why I can afford the rent so cheap.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had gotten into the elevator by now and had hit your floor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re on the way up to deal with this mind-numbing heat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then again…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The source of relief is right next to you...</div></li></ol>        </div>

&gt;Be Wolfess anthro.
&gt;Late December, right near Christmas.
&gt;Be invited to date at coffee shop.
&gt;Think it&#039;s a joke.
&gt;No one would be that bold or lewd to suggest having THAT drink on the first date.
&gt;Sure enough, it&#039;s a cofefe parlour.
&gt;&quot;Coffee Pawz&quot; reads a wooden sign hanging over the entry.
&gt;There are stylised pictures of anthros on the sign as well as stylised pictures on the door in very bright, welcoming colours.
&gt;You feel giddy and scared and... Excited?
&gt;Your phones vibrates and you pull it out and check the screen.
&gt;It&#039;s your boyfriend.
&gt;*I can see you. Come on in. I&#039;ve got a table.*
&gt;Your head whips around scanning the inside of the shop.
&gt;You spot him, casually sitting at a wooden table made of a rich dark wood.
&gt;Fuck.
&gt;Back where you come from, coffee was a ceremonial drink, used as an aphrodisiac and to consummate marriage.
&gt;This must be a front or a joke, right?
&gt;Surely he was pulling you along and would come out any second, right?
&gt;lolno.
&gt;He waves you in.
&gt;You go.
&gt;You open the door and are immediately struck by the rich scent of roasting and roasted coffee, the sweet touch of sugar and the warm glow of hazelnut.
&gt;There are several tables dotted around, a coffee-bar and four lounging areas with overstuffed armchairs and low tables.
&gt;The scent is enough to rile you up.
&gt;You remember drinking coffee for the first time.
&gt;You felt like you were in heat but ten times worse.
&gt;Just smelling this place and the memory of that day... It was enough for you to make you bite your lip.
&gt;You&#039;re welcomed by wolf anthro, almost the same as you but, while your fur was jet-black, hers was a russet-red colour with a hint of white.
&gt;She takes a sip from a mug at her table.
&gt;&quot;Hello miss. Welcome to Coffee Pawz.&quot;
&gt;You nearly faint at the sight.
&gt;Glancing into her mug you can see the inky-black, rich, dark coffee.
&gt;You struggle to make noise after seeing what she just did.
&gt;Eventually, you do. &quot;I-I&#039;m here to see m-my boyfriend.&quot;


&gt;She smiles at your struggle.
&gt;&quot;Not a problem miss. His name and species?&quot;
&gt;You reply, still not fully thinking straight. &quot;He&#039;s a human.&quot;
&gt;She nods and takes another sip of the steaming brew. I only have one today. Reservation for two?&quot;
&gt;You nod yes.
&gt;&quot;Follow me please. I&#039;ll get you set up right away.&quot;
&gt;You walk closely behind her, intoxicated by her.
&gt;How could she be drinking coffee so casually?
&gt;So freely?
&gt;She must be feeling some of the effects.
&gt;How many cups has she had today?
&gt;How often does she drink it?
&gt;She must be wet all the time.
&gt;Feeling that tingle and the warmth all over.
&gt;Before you know it, you&#039;re at the table.
&gt;&quot;Hey gorgeous.&quot; You boyfriend beams at you.
&gt;&quot;Hey. When you said &#039;let&#039;s go for coffee&#039; I didn&#039;t think that you meant... Y&#039;know... Coffee.&quot;
&gt;Let me clarify something.
&gt;You and this guy have been friends for a long time and just started dating.
&gt;Why not, right?
&gt;You know each other well enough... Or so you thought...
&gt;&quot;What else could I mean?&quot; He asks. &quot;Anyway, I heard that this place is really anthro friendly because of the Right and Left thing, I thought that a little extra research could avoid some racist idiot.&quot;
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s very thoughtful. Thank you.&quot; You reply to his sweetness.
&gt;You&#039;re sitting down now, coat off and going over the menu.
&gt;They have thirty different kinds of coffee, at least.
&gt;Not only that, they have pastries, danishes, cakes, bunts, cookies and every other manner of things to go with coffee.
&gt;This place was like a sex shop combined with a porn studio and a strip-club all in one.
&gt;For you at least.
&gt;Your guy is just browsing the menu, humming and hawing, chatting lightly with you while he makes remarks about this heat-inducing beverage.


&gt;Eventually, a waitress comes by.
&gt;&quot;Hi there! Welcome to Coffee Pawz. What can I get you today?&quot; The bubbly black jackal asks while flipping open a notebook.
&gt;You boyfriend looks at you, expecting you to go first.
&gt;What a mentalgan.
&gt;You, on the other hand, have your heart hammering in your chest and the spaghetti is practically on the ceiling at this point.
&gt;&quot;N-N-No... It&#039;s- *Ahem* It&#039;s fine... Y-You order first.&quot;
&gt;He&#039;s concerned. &quot;Hey, is everything alright? You seem... off...&quot;
&gt;&quot;Hehehe... No. I&#039;m fine. Just... Just go ahead and order.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well. Alright.&quot;
&gt;The waitress turns and looks expectantly at him.
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s a strong coffee with lots of flavor?&quot;
&gt;She smiles a wolfish grin. &quot;Well, sir, we have lots of coffees here and we can even combine blends, if you like. I prefer the Cuban. It&#039;s really strong and has a boldness to it like no other.&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s drank that?
&gt;You imagine how strong that would be for you.
&gt;You&#039;ve only had one scoop of light roast the only time that you had it.
&gt;Your thighs rub together as you imagine the heat the Cuban coffee would mimic.
&gt;He looks impressed. &quot;That good, eh?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh yes sir. I drink it every day.&quot;
&gt;PAHHHHHH!!!
&gt;Whatdidyousaynigger.webm
&gt;You cannot believe what you just heard.
&gt;This little jackal must be wet all the time with that coffee.
&gt;You imagine the heat that she&#039;s feeling right now.
&gt;You imagine how wet she must be.
&gt;How much her pussy must be tingling with the need to be filled.
&gt;You realize how wet you currently are.
&gt;Suddenly, you realize a different scent.
&gt;Hidden under the coffee and sugar and pastry, there&#039;s something else... Something... Primal.
&gt;It&#039;s the scent of a pack of bitches in heat.
&gt;Something else. Your boyfriend is the only male here.
&gt;Almost all the other patrons, the ten or so that there are, are canines and are all female.
&gt;You look over and see the hostess, the one that greeted you, chatting with a barista while they are both sipping mugs of steaming sex.

&gt;You can do nothing but gush your wetness as you imagine what must be happening to their bodies.
&gt;The heat from the coffee warming their bellies as the heat from their vaginas driving them mad.
&gt;You imagine what they&#039;re like in bed.
&gt;With them being in constant heat, they must fuck like it too.
&gt;Pounding, thrusting, bed-shaking FUCKING.
&gt;”Miss?” The jackal asks you with a small smile. “Are you ready to order?”
&gt;Your heart drops and rests nicely beside the stone in your stomach.
&gt;You pray to your autism that you don’t make a total ass out of yourself.
&gt;”U-Um… What’s a… A coffee without t-too strong… That isn’t very strong?”
&gt;The waitress is all too happy to assist.
&gt;Coming around to the back of your chair, she presses her breasts into the back of your head and begins pointing out things on the menu.
&gt;You’re only half-listening.
&gt;She REEKS of heat.
&gt;Of sopping-wet pussy and the want of a big, long dick to stuff herself with.
&gt;It’s intoxicating to you as you begin to feel your heart race and your pulse in your neck.
&gt;You don’t even know if you NEED a coffee at this point.
&gt;Never the less you decide to order.
&gt;You say, before you can catch yourself, “I’ll have a Cuban, too.”
&gt;Niggerwhat.gif
&gt;”Great!” The jackal said coming around to the side of the table again. “Any pastries or nibbles that I can get for you? Everything is made in-house.”
&gt;”They make everything here?” You ask in a small voice.
&gt;The jackal is growing very concerned. “Are you alright darling? You seem kind of flushed. Why don’t I get you a water, alright?”
&gt;You nod meekly, not quite looking her in the eye.
&gt;Not with how horny she is still fresh in your mind.

&gt;You boyfriend asks. “Is it racist if I ask if canines can have chocolate? Sorry but I know that regular dogs can’t and I wasn’t sure.”
&gt;The waitress smiles. “That’s not a problem at all sir. It’s wonderful to see someone who is so caring about anthros, especially in this day and age. It’s not a problem at all for canines like us to eat chocolate. There are some individuals that are allergic to it and we have a substitute for them. Were you thinking of getting something with chocolate on or in it?”
&gt;Your boy orders for you both. “A slice of chocolate coffee cake and a couple of pastries, please.”
&gt;She’s scribbling on the pad. “Any preference on the kind?”
&gt;”Surprise me.” He says with a confidence that makes your heart jump and your walls pulse.
&gt;”No problem, sir. I’ll get you both some water and then your coffees in a sec.”
&gt;She spins and walks over to the coffee-bar.
&gt;Now, the part that you were dreading.
&gt;Talking to the guy you were on a date with, without exploding the spaghetti like an Italian terrorist.

&gt;Thankfully, you can’t really get into any serious conversation as the water gets there.
&gt;You pick up the water and down it almost in one gulp before handing it back to the jackal and saying “More please!”
&gt;She is mildly confused. “Umm... Yes miss… Your coffees should be ready in a moment.”
&gt;After she walks away, your boyfriend begins suggesting things to do.
&gt;“We could go to a movie or maybe laser tag or out for dinner after some window-shopping? I dunno. What do you want to do?”
&gt;You reply with the most autistic thing that you can think of. “We could spend the day and night at my place.”
&gt;What even in the fuck?
&gt;Are you high?
&gt;For honest and serious, what the fuck?
&gt;Maybe all the roasting coffee is having an effect on you.
&gt;You’re certainly wet enough.
&gt;Maybe you’re not high but how are you this horney?
&gt;You haven’t even had any coffee yet.
&gt;You begin to dread what will happen once you take that first sip and descend into mindless heat.
&gt;Your guy, thankfully, is not the brightest crayon in the box. “Oh. So, like a movie? I can cook for you but you’d need to show me where everything is.”
&gt;Thankfully, the spaghetti is not quite at critical mass yet.
&gt;Sadly, the only repreve you will get is when the covfefe gets to the table.
&gt;That also means that you’ll have to drink it.
&gt;Maybe even eat some of the treats.
&gt;Why are you getting excited?
&gt;This is a nightmare.
&gt;You’re trapped in a date at a sex parlour that anything you touch will send you into immediate and uncontrollable lust for anything with (or without) a dick.
&gt;Your pussy gushed juice onto your thighs.
&gt;Your legs quivered.
&gt;Oh shit… 
&gt;The coffee is set in front of you.

&gt;The scent is staggering.
&gt;Ritch and full-bodied roasted beans.
&gt;It’s inky and black and smells delicious.
&gt;You see the human across from you smile at the waitress and smile as he sips from the black coffee.
&gt;Then he looks at you.
&gt;”Aren’t you going to try any? It’s quite good.”
&gt;The Jackal is standing over your table with a grin.
&gt;”It is quite good miss.” She grins even wider. “Try a pastry with a sip. That always gets me going in the morning.”

&gt;”M-Morning?” You ask.
&gt;That damn jackal’s smile grows wider. “Yes miss. Every morning, I have a nice big cup. I’m useless without it.”
&gt;The human across from you pipes up. “Oh, yeah. I know that feeling. I love coffee. Ever try an espresso?”
&gt;”Once. I tried it but I couldn’t finish it. I was a puddle on the floor before the cup was done.”
&gt;It was that strong?
&gt;”Anyway” He says, partially rescuing you. “I’m sure you’re busy so I won’t keep you.”
&gt;”Not at all sir. If there’s anything else that you need just wave me over and I’ll be right there.”
&gt;She spun and walked over to another table.
&gt;The scent of her heat crashed into your nose like a tsunami.
&gt;Your nose seems to be much more sensitive.
&gt;He picks up his mug and gestures to yours.
&gt;You wrap your hands around the mug, feeling the warmth and dreading it.
&gt;The smell of the roast assails your schnoz and you can feel your body wanting to be bred.
&gt;You shutter as you bring the coffee close to you.
&gt;He holds out his mug across the table and smiles.
&gt;You want that smile.
&gt;You want to sit on that smile.
&gt;Lock your legs behind that head and make him drink you.
&gt;Snap out of it girl.
&gt;You clink your mug with his and force a smile.
&gt;He smiles even wider. “Smells good, doesn’t it?”
&gt;You nod.
&gt;Spaghetti almost reaching critical mass. “S-Sure it does. Mmmmmm. Coffee…”
&gt;He takes a sip and smiles.
&gt;”Oh that’s fucking good. Try it.”
&gt;Moment of truth here.
&gt;Dont fuck it up.
&gt;Hold your pussy in until you can get home.
&gt;You pull the mug up to your lips.
&gt;Here we go.
&gt;Down the hatch and into the worst heat that you’ll ever have.
&gt;You take a sip.

&gt;You feel the warmth of the drink rolling down you throat as you condemn yourself to the heat.
&gt;The flavor explodes in your mouth.
&gt;You can taste the soil that it was grown in.
&gt;The hot Cuban sun.
&gt;The water that showered it.
&gt;The years and years that it’s taken to get a simple drink to the level that it is.
&gt;The ritch bitterness all over, the sweet touch at the tip of your tounge and the pepper at the back of your throat.
&gt;You shiver at the explosive and exciting taste of the beverage.
&gt;”Mmmm. That’s really good. That’s incredible!” You say, excited and amazed.
&gt;He laughs. “You act like you’ve never had coffee before.”
&gt;”Only the once.”
&gt;”Just one time?”
&gt;You nod.
&gt;”That’s a shame. We need do this again. I can’t have my girl being left out of something as fun as coffee.”
&gt;You laugh.
&gt;A genuine laugh.
&gt;You’re relaxed and you take a nice big gulp of your steamy drink.
&gt;You chat with your boyfriend for a while, draining your first mug.
&gt;And then another.
&gt;You eat some coffee cake and it’s more delicious than anything that you’ve ever tasted.
&gt;You are halfway down your third cup.
&gt;All that&#039;s left of the snacks is crumbs.
&gt;He wait patiently for you to finish.
&gt;You do and he waves the jackal over.
&gt;When the bill comes he offers to pay but you tell him. “I’ll bite you in the wrist if you don’t let me pay half.”
&gt;He relents.
&gt;Total comes to $21.50 or $3.00USD
&gt;You get up to leave. 
&gt;Coats on and out the door.
&gt;He jingles his keys in his hands.
&gt;”Hey,” He says, “How about a drive? I’ll bring you to my place or yours and I can make good on that dinner?”
&gt;You smile wolfishly. “Sounds great. I took public anyway. I like to walk.”
&gt;You sigh and smile. “Something about ancestral memory and all that.”

&gt;He walks you over to a 2015 Audi.
&gt;You don’t know what model.
&gt;He opens the door and you slide into a comfy leather seat.
&gt;You sit and a shock of electricity shoots through your spine as your ass hits the seat.
&gt;It has begun.
&gt;You can feel the coals that were gently fanning in your belly growing stronger and more robust.
&gt;He gets in the drivers side.
&gt;The fire explodes like a oil tanker dropped its load on the embers.
&gt;It rolls through your body like an ocean of fire.
&gt;Up from your belly to your chest and out to the tips of your fingers.
&gt;Your legs start to quiver as the boiling warmth shoots into your heels.
&gt;Then, as if it’s alive, the fire pulls back from all parts of your body and slams itself into your pussy.
&gt;You gasp, nearly cuming from the sensation of the mild pressure of your sitting on the leather.
&gt;He starts the car.
You mumble to yourself. “Please, quickly.”
&gt;”Hmm?” He asks.
“Oh, nothing. Let’s get to my place.”
&gt;”Sure.”
&gt;He starts driving.
&gt;Less than five minutes pass but in those five minutes the heat has gone from urgent to unbearable.
&gt;Your cunny keeps squeasing on it’s own and the musk you’re putting out is absurd.
&gt;There’s no doubt that you’ve soaked your panties.
&gt;You’re sure there’s a wet spot on the seat now.
&gt;You arrive at your apartment.
&gt;Yes.
&gt;Now the fun can begin!

&gt;You nearly pull him up the stairs.
&gt;He’s struggling to keep up with you as you drag him into the lobby.
&gt;Over to the elevators you go and you begin jamming the keypad so fast your finger hurts.
&gt;”Hey?” He asks. “What’s going on? You’re acting kind of weird.”
“Nope. Needy yes. Weird no. Where’s the fucking elevator!”
&gt;He nods slowly.
&gt;”You know that you don’t owe me anything, right? I took you out and, if you want it to be, that can be it.”
&gt;You round on him and let out a predatory growl.
“You are going nowhere. We are going up to my apartment if I have to drag you there by what’s left of your lower half if you try and run.”
&gt;He smiles that big goofy grin.
&gt;”Wow. You must really want me to cook for you, huh. I feel like rumors of me have been greatly exaggerated.”
&gt;Before you can reply the elevator dings and opens.
&gt;A cute but huge draft anthro exits the elevator.
&gt;She’s wearing a bright yellow sun-dress and straw hat that match perfectly with her rust-red colored fur.
&gt;Her name is Isabel and she makes fucking good lasagna.
&gt;As she steps out of the slow-ass machine she smiles at you.
&gt;”Oh, hi! It’s been a while since I’ve seen you entertain. Who’s this?”
“It’s my boyfriend.”
&gt;That came out rather harshly.
&gt;You’d feel bad if your world wasn’t consumed with the need for cock.
&gt;She sniffs the air.
&gt;”That smell… Oh… OH! That’s you?”
“Yes Isabel, that’s me…”
&gt;She smiles and looks at your male in tow.
&gt;”Good luck.”
&gt;She flashes a winning grin and saunters out the front door.
&gt;He turns to you.
&gt;”Good luck? What did she mean good luck? Also, yeah, I don’t know if it’s something to do with the building but it’s kind of musty in here.”
“Oh is it?”
&gt;Please don’t suspect…
&gt;”Yeah. I’m not sure why I didn’t notice it before.”
“Well the building is kind of old. That’s why I can afford the rent so cheap.”
&gt;You had gotten into the elevator by now and had hit your floor.
&gt;You’re on the way up to deal with this mind-numbing heat.
&gt;Then again…
&gt;The source of relief is right next to you...</textarea>
