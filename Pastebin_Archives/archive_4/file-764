&gt;be anon, anthropologist on assignment
&gt;studying feline anthro tribes in the south american rainforest to write a thesis, get a professorship, and settle down with your sweetheart
&gt;It&#039;s about 8 months in and you&#039;ve been fully accepted by the tribe
&gt;at first they were wary, but as you showed yourself more and more often and learned more of the language they warmed up to you
&gt;you just have one important ceremony to witness before you leave: their coming of age ceremony
&gt;Thankfully you&#039;ve been invited to said ceremony for the girl you&#039;ve dubbed &quot;Goldie&quot;
&gt;shorter than most of the tribe, Goldie only came to about 4&#039;8&quot;, though she was surprisingly heavy as a result of her tight musculature. As with the others here, there was not an ounce of fat on the girl.
&gt;you called her Goldie because, while she shared the brown and white pattern of the rest of the tribe, by some strange quirk her coat was far glossier than the others. This made her shine beautifully in the rare moments the sun broke through the forest canopy.
&gt;she had been the one to wake you on this, the morning of the ritual. She could tell how much you loved observing the ceremonies and was always eager to involve you in their feasts and traditions
&gt;she led you to the ceremonial hut, a large structure of leaves, wood, and mud with a single curtained entrance. Inside the whole tribe was already present, seated in a semicircle around the structure with the chief sitting opposite the entrance
&gt;looking for hints about the ceremony to come you observe the setup for it in the center of the audience: there is a wooden circle you&#039;ve seen used as something of a stage before, and in front of it facing away from the entrance is what appears to be a heavily decorated ceremonial chair
&gt;The chief and Goldie exchange a few words that you understand to essentially mean &quot;are you ready?&quot; and &quot;Yes,&quot; and then &quot;you may proceed&quot; or was it &quot;you have my permission?&quot; The subtleties always threw you.
--------------------
&gt;Goldie takes your hand and leads you to the decorated chair. 
&gt;You suppose that makes you the guest of honor on top of simply being allowed to observe the ceremony, not bad
&gt;That must have been the chief&#039;s doing, a nice send-off for the stranger they had taken in
&gt;as Goldie walks towards the makeshift stage she is approached by attendants carrying a beautiful and...skimpy garment I&#039;ve never seen before, and she changes into it with practiced ease
&gt;attendants also approach you, taking your normal cloths and replacing them with a vest and headdress that seemed to match Goldie&#039;s
&gt;uhhh...souvenirs?
&gt;before you can give it any more thought cheers ring up from the audience, and you look up to see Goldie dancing and praying
&gt;The dance is mesmerizing, akin to belly dancing mixed with Salsa, with Goldie sashaying around delicately one moment only to gyrate and thrust the next, all while staring directly at you
&gt;As she finishes her dance you notice her gaze move down for an instant, followed by a strong blush - your little man is standing at full attention
&gt;the chief stands and says a few words. You catch something about &quot;new&quot; or &quot;not done before,&quot; and &quot;proud,&quot; and then he motions to the attendants
&gt;they bring out a large wooden bowl filled with a murky liquid you&#039;ve not seen before and stand directly between you and Goldie
&gt;They offer the bowl to Goldie who laps up a good amount
&gt;they then offer the bowl to you - not wishing to anger anyone after such long success you take a large swig and swallow hard
&gt;you immediately regret that as the burning sensation fills your throat
&gt;the world tilts and shifts for a moment, you become flush, and suddenly colors and sensations seem more vivid
&gt;like the golden sheen of your favorite Puma as she draws closer and closer, bringing her face right up to yours
&gt;you can feel the vibrations of her purring like a jackhammer as she brings the soft fur on her forehead to your lips, giving you a bunt
----------------------------
&gt;you can feel the warmth and love emanating from every inch of her body as she buries her face in your neck
&gt;and you feel immense pleasure aa she slowly traces her paw down your chest before wrapping it around your cock
&gt;that shouldn&#039;t be right but your mind is spinning and you can&#039;t quite remember why
&gt;You&#039;re vaguely aware of hoots and hollers as Goldie brings her face down to your throbbing erection, sniffing it wildly before plunging it as deep as she can in her mouth
&gt;if you still had the capacity for rational thought you might be impressed by her technique as she swirls the non-barbed underside of her tongue around and around
&gt;without warning you cum deep in her mouth, instinctively grabbing her head as you do
&gt;collapsing backwards you see Goldie stand up, swallow, and display her empty mouth for you
&gt;&quot;at least that&#039;s over&quot; you think to yourself
&gt;until you notice Goldie turning around and draping herself over you, with your still massive erection poking out between her thighs
&gt;fucking tribal drugs
&gt;abandoning any thought of protest or escape, you shudder as Goldie brings your cock to her lips and then uses her whole body to shove you inside
&gt;you don&#039;t know if it&#039;s the drugs or Goldie, but this is the best you&#039;ve ever felt
&gt;grunting and sweating and rutting like mindless animals, you cum inside her over and over again, losing all track of time, and slowly fading into unconsciousness as the drugs finally leave your system
&gt;In the morning you wake to find yourself in Goldie&#039;s hut and bed instead of your own
&gt;A very satisfied Goldie notices you rouse from your sleep and cheerfully says one of the phrases you actually know quite well:
