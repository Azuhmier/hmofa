&gt;&quot;Come on Anon, only five more, you can do it, five more, push it&quot;
&gt;Only five more, thats what she already said ten times ago
&gt;You try in vain to push the heavy weights of you chest one mor time and fail
&gt;Only two seconds of your struggle later the barbell is lifted from you
&gt;Eirin is looking down on you, almost effortlessly holding the pole in one hand
&gt;&quot;Not bad, you nearly got 20 this time. Tomorrow we will ad some more weight&quot;
&gt;You lay on the bench in the fitness studio and try to keep breathing, as your chest and arm muscles burn
&gt;Eirin has already cleaned up, placed the weight back on the rack and is doing push ups
&gt;You always thought bears were supposed to be lazy, fat and soft
&gt;Eirin has destroyed that prejudice
&gt;You met her when you tried to lift a crate of water up the stairs when the elevator was broken
&gt;While you struggled with your load she simply grabbed the crate and carried it with one hand
&gt;You were suprised and agreed to let her coach your new fitness training
&gt;That was a mistake, she is a powerhouse, completely inexhaustible
&gt;There has been a time where you never saw a fitness studio from the inside
&gt;Now you spend 2 hours in it every day, 6 days a week
&gt;Your baby fat has molten away and muscles are starting to form but it will still take some time
&gt;Eirin meanwhile is sporting a sixpack that is clearly visible, even through her fur
&gt;Her biceps is neraly a big as your head and her legs turn the pedals of the exercise bike for nearly an hour against resistance 10
&gt;You can&#039;t even move them at this level
&gt;Eirin has finished her 20 ppush ups and grabs your arm
&gt;&quot;Come on Anon, lets go to the rowing machine next, this time we will only do 5 kilometers&quot;
&gt;Help!

2 hours later

&gt;You are so tired that Eirin has to nearly carry you back to your apartment
&gt;Once you are back you simply fall into your bed
&gt;Tomorrow is a new day and Eirin is going to drag you back
&gt;For some reason she is still enduring you with the patience of an angel
&gt;Now you need sleep and you already know that you are going to regret it
&gt;The muscle ache are terrible but the protein shakes are worse
&gt;They always taste like someone poured flour into stale water and filterd it with an old sock
&gt;With your last thought being about socks you drift off to sleep
End of Chapter 1

Chapter 2: Get /fit
&gt;AHHHHHHHH
&gt;Every single muscle in your body is burning
&gt;It feels like satan himself is using you as a personal sauna
&gt;There is no way you can continue like this
&gt;You drag yourself into the shower and turn on the water
&gt;While you enjoy the massage from the water there is a single thought in your mind
&gt;There has to be a better way to train, a way that will not destroy you
&gt;A simple way would be to simply tell Eirin that you have to stop, but that would not only be rude but also wrong
&gt;You really have to train you body, to much junkfood and not enough sport have paid their toll on you 
&gt;You sit down in front of your computer (Oh god, bending your knees was a mistake) and open Google
&gt;Soon you find an image board with lots of fitness tips
&gt;You never heard of &quot;Pawchan&quot; before but the /fit board sounds awesome

2 months later

&gt;&quot;Wow, Anon. You really made a lot of progress with your abdominals&quot;
&gt;Eirin is similing down on you while you finish your last repetition
&gt;&quot;Thanks, I found some really good guidance on the internet&quot;
&gt;Eirin is raising her eyebrow
&gt;&quot;Really ? Nice one. So, what did you change ?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Actually pretty simple. I simply stopped masturbating&quot;
&gt;Eirin is nearly choking on her water
&gt;&quot;What ?&quot;
&gt;You send her a smirk
&gt;&quot;Just kidding, I stopped eating fast food and started a protein diet&quot;
&gt;Eirin is still coughing while you put the first weight on the barbell

3 months later

&gt;Winter is aproching fast and you spend more and more time in the gym
&gt;You even paid for the sauna
&gt;For some reason Eirin has stopped her daily training, only appearing once or twice a week
&gt;She also changed her normally very tight shirt for a loose sweater
&gt;As you come home one friday you haven&#039;t seen her the whole week 
&gt;You decide to knock on her door, maybe she is ill
&gt;She helped you, now you can help her
&gt;You wipe the snow from your coat and walk up the stairs to her door
&gt;As you knock you can hear a mixture of sounds behind it
&gt;Suddenly the door is ripped open and you are nearly smothered by an insane amount of brown fur
&gt;An incredibla fat male bear is standing in front of you and you have no idea how he even got through the staircase
&gt;&quot;Hey...is Eirin here ?&quot;
&gt;He is turning his head around and shouts back into the flat
&gt;&quot;Sis, theres a human here for you&quot;
&gt;Nice
&gt;For a moment you can peek past his belly and see two other bears sitting around the table
&gt;Both are nearly as fat as the one in front of you
&gt;Eirin is walking in from the kitchen, carrying a tablet full of food and is staring at you
&gt;She is wearing a simple jogging suit and you can see her belly rolls
&gt;It looks like she gained nearly 30 kilos
&gt;For a moment you are speechless before the realisation hits you like a freight train
&gt;You completely forgot about hibernation
End of Chapter 2

Chaper 3 of Buff Bear: Sleep
&gt;&quot;So...one month ?
&gt;Eirin is nodding slowly, her fat rolls jiggling with the movement
&gt;&quot;Yes, even though there are medicaments against it and enough food, we still have to sleep&quot;
&gt;You are both standing on the balcony of her flat, watching the sunset
&gt;Eirin is slowly sipping on a cup of warm milk while you are searching for words
&gt;&quot;I heared about the hibernation but i never thought that you would do it&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh, me not ? Why ?&quot;
&gt;You feel like you walked into a trap here
&gt;&quot;Well..because you are all buff and strong and not... you know&quot;
&gt;&quot;Fat ?&quot;
&gt;Thats not what you wanted to say but now...
&gt;&quot;Yes...?&quot;
&gt;Eirin is looking away from you and puts down her cup before she reaches into her mouth
&gt;She is rummaging around in it a while before she pulls it out again
&gt;You can see the false teeth in her hand as she showes them to you
&gt;&quot;What ..?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I lost them when I was 16, shortly after the hibernation&quot;
&gt;You have to shwallow hard before you can respond
&gt;&quot;What happened ?&quot;
&gt;For a moment there is silence before Eirin starts talking, tears are starting to form in her eyes
&gt;You can hear it in her voice
&gt;&quot;My grandmother died during hibernation, cardiac arrest because of steatosis. My Grandfather found her when he woke up but she was already dead for a week&quot;
&gt;You simply listen
&gt;&quot;For weeks after it I was terrified, I ate nearly one kilo of honey per day to deal with the sadness&quot;
&gt;&quot;After some time my teeth started to hurt and i gained nearly 30 kilos&quot;
&gt;You place your hand on her back as she starts to cry harder&quot;
&gt;&quot;I lost nearly my entire top row of my teeth&quot;
&gt;You speak up to calm her down
&gt;&quot;Hey, thats not bad. I never really noticed and...&quot;
&gt;Eirin is interrupting you
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t care about the teeth. But you know what the worst thing was ?&quot;
&gt;You shake your head
&gt;&quot;Nobody was suprised. Everyone just accepted it, even my gluttony. Because thats what bears are supposed to do, eat, sleep and die during sleep after eating to much&quot;
&gt;She is crying hard now, forcing her words out between sobs
&gt;&quot;I didn&#039;t want to end like this, so I started to train hard after I lost my teeth. I can lose this extra fat in nearly 2 months after the hibernation now&quot;
&gt;Her sobs stop and she goes quiet for a while
&gt;&quot;But I am still scared. And I can&#039;t change it. I have to sleep&quot;
&gt;You feel bad for her, really bad
&gt;&quot;Hey Eirin, you know...I don&#039;t have to sleep all the time. I cant take care of you&quot;
&gt;For a moment she is silent again, before a literal bear hug engulfs you

2 weeks later

&gt;You walk back into Eirins living room and sit down on the sofa, next to the slowly breathing mountain of brown fluff
&gt;Eirin has been sleeping for nearly one week now
&gt;You never left her side
&gt;You even got your boss to approve your plan for telework on your computer
&gt;Leaning back into the sofa there is a deep silence in the room
&gt;Well, three more weeks of peace before she is dragging you back to the studio
&gt;You can&#039;t wait
