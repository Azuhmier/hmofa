        <div class="source" style=" ">
            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">	Life could not possibly be better for you at this moment. You just found out you’ve got the next couple of days off work, you’re huddled up on the couch with the love of your life and to cap it all off, you’ve got all the fixings for a great date night right in front of you. Snacks of all kinds as far as the eye can see, one of your favorite fighting games playing on the TV screen in front of you and most importantly, your girlfriend flashing you a content smile as she rests her feathered head in the crook of your arm. Her meek, yet gentle voice shakes you out of your happiness induced stupor and you can feel her head feathers tickle at your bare skin as she shifts into a more comfortable position.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“So, are you ready to lose again?” she asks, wearing the absolute most smug grin she can possibly give you on her face. “Don’t think I’ve forgotten about last time we played Gladiator Gauntlet: Leather &amp; Steel.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You can’t help but feel a bit flustered at her words, knowing full well how good she is at fighting games. “Hey, I’ve been practicing here and there when you’re at work. Just because I’ve only beaten you a couple of times doesn’t mean your luck isn’t about to change, featherbutt.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Oh yeah?” she asks, exuding pure confidence as she speaks. “Why don’t we make things interesting then? Just for tonight.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You hum, rubbing your fingers on your chin as you feign contemplation. You wait until she’s let her guard down to strike, planting a kiss on the side of her snout.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Hey!” she says, gently poking you in the ribs with a clawed finger before breaking into a giggling fit, pushing your face away to prevent you from going in for a second kiss. “Y-you can’t just-”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I can’t just what?” you ask, interrupting her joking reprimand. “I vaguely remember a *certain* raptor not minding at all when I was stealing kisses yesterday.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She buries her head in the crook of your arm, though you know her well enough to realize she’s just trying to hide her blushing, flustered expression away from your prying eyes. “T-that’s d-different and you know it.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“So I’m not allowed to steal kisses from my little featherbutt now?” you say, sporting a mock pout as you hold her closer to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Y-you can d-do that if you win,” she mutters, her face only now slightly peeking out from its resting place in your arm.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“What’s that?” you ask, grinning as you gently run your hand through her head feathers. You’d feel a slight pang of guilt for the teasing if you didn’t already know full well how much she enjoys it. “You’re going to have to speak up, cuddlebug.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The slight blush shining through her dark scales only deepens at your words, though you can tell she’s doing her best to keep eye contact with you as she speaks. “If you… beat me, then I’ll do anything you want. If I win then y-you have to do anything I want.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You’ve never known her to be bold enough to make bets like that, even with you, so you ask something for clarification. “Anything, anything?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She stays silent, though her near frantic nodding as she covers her embarrassment under a scaled hand is more than enough clarification for you. You find the embarrassment endearing in a way, though you’re not sure this is a bet you can win. “And what makes you so sure I’ll actually take that bet.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She mulls it over for a bit, shifting against you as she once again readjusts in order to find the most comfortable position, finally speaking up once she does. “You only have to win once, but I have to win three rounds in a row.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The odds are a bit closer in your favor on those terms, though you decide to propose something that’ll put the odds slightly further in your favor. “Alright, but you can’t play your main, deal?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She grumbles for a bit, clearly not wanting to give up her main advantage on you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You dirty cheeseball,” she groans and mutters, involuntarily letting out a bark as she continues to mull it over. “Fineeeee, I won’t play Van.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She leans forward a bit to grab a handful of beef jerky straight from the bag, tossing a few strips into her toothy mouth before turning her attention to you. “Wan’ some?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">While you’ve always been careful to count calories and mind what you take in for fear of undoing your progress at the gym, you quickly decide having an enjoyable night with your girlfriend is far more important. “Yeah sure, pass it here,” you say, looking forward to treating yourself for a change.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Nuh uh,” she laughs, shaking her head as she reaches a hand up near your lips. “Open up, loverboy.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You laugh and decide to play along, opening your mouth to let her feed you the jerky. She reaches forward to place it in your mouth and you snap your jaw shut only to bite down on a whole lot of nothing. The only thing you can hear is the sound of giggling coming from the raptor huddled up against you. You decide to get your revenge on her in one of the only ways you know how. Carefully you wrap a hand around her side while she’s too busy laughing at her own joke and you wait for the perfect time to strike, digging your fingers into her side and tickling with all your might. Sheer surprise is apparent in her eyes and the giggling quickly grows louder and more uncontrolled as you continue, one of her clawed hands reaching down to try and stop you. But your attack doesn’t stop there, and you tilt your head down to surprise her with a kiss on her sensitive neck as she protests your sudden actions.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Anon, please-” she says, the giggling now turning to loud laughter as you continue to plant kisses down the side of her neck and snout. “S-stooop…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her cool scales have always felt nice against your bare skin and the pleasant sensation is no different when kissing her. You can’t help but grin when you feel your kissing cause a slight shudder to run throughout her entire body. Satisfied with your efforts, you finally let up the assault. “Are you going to pass me the jerky now?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She looks almost flushed when you finally let up, and you can see her nostrils flare as she recovers from her bout of intense laughter. She only flashes you a smile before saying, “S-shit, if you’re going to do that every time then I might never pass it again.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She follows through on her promise and feeds you the jerky before reaching down to grab the two controllers, handing you one as she settles in to play. “So, are you ready to get smacked down, *again*?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Just you wait,” you laugh, settling in and picking a character. “All the practice I’ve been doing is going to blow you away.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“We’ll just see about that,” she says, a wide smirk on her face. She locks in the character you hate to play against the most and the wind is immediately knocked out of your sails. “I’m not only good at one character, remember?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Oh- come on,” you groan in protest, temptation to once again tease the raptor rising up within you as you see her choice of character. “It might as well be your main with how often you play them.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“All I’m hearing is excuses Anon,” she smiles a toothy grin as she playfully pokes a finger to your chest. “I mean… if you just want to surrender to save your pride then now’s your chance.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Fat chance,” you say, sporting the most confident grin you can muster. “I think you’re just scared I might actually take a round off you, featherbutt. Move over some, it’s not a fair match if you’re just going to lay on my arm the entire time.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Spoilsport,” she mutters, sticking her tongue out at you before sitting up and settling in beside you, making sure to lean into you. “The more excuses you make the sweeter it’s going to be when I win.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You’re trying your best to not show it but you’re actually looking forward to the possibility of winning. There’s something you’d been meaning to try with her, though with your work schedule being busy as it has been lately, you hadn’t gotten as much time to fool around with her as you would’ve liked. “You talk a really big game for someone in smooching distance, you know that?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“S-shut up and play, you dork,” she says, playfully elbowing your side before leaning into you slightly. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You can’t help but smile at her reaction, a slight blush shining from underneath her scaled cheeks. Even if it puts you at a slight disadvantage, you can live with her contentedly resting against you. You take pride in being able to fluster her as often and with as much effectiveness as you do.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The first round kicks off and you begin to realize just how much trouble your mouth has gotten you into. Even with the extensive amount of practice you’ve done in your spare time, she reads just about every combination of moves you even so much as think about doing. You briefly think about teasing her some more to gain a quick advantage on the raptor, though you quickly decide against it for fear you’ll never live it down.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“So, what happened to that big game you were talking, Anon?” she laughs, though it very nearly turns into a joyful trill. She puts a hand over her mouth as the sounds burst free from her, clearly embarrassed by the sudden outburst.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“What was that?” you ask, teasing her a bit for the noise even though it’s adorable enough to make your heart ache. “I think you’re taking this game too serious, featherbutt.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It’s a dirty trick, but between her embarrassment and your relentless teasing, there’s no better opportunity to fire back with a combo of your own, draining your entire special bar in an attempt to bring her character down. She quickly recovers from her momentary bout of embarrassment, or at least long enough to block the majority of your super. Your plan of coming back from an absurdly low life total was in shambles with that move blocked. The only trick up your sleeve you have left is to let her wail on you just long enough for your super bar to refill. You’d picked your character with the intent of being able to come back from almost certain defeat. For every point of damage you’d taken throughout the round, the heal would become that much more powerful. When it’s down to the wire, you retreat to the very edge of the screen and pop the ability, recovering to almost half health in one well executed combo. Your girlfriend doesn’t seem too pleased about victory being snatched from her claws and you can hear the complaints start to fly when you finally start laying into her character.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Oh, you fucking… absolute goddamn ball of cheese!” she says, bumping your arm slightly in a futile attempt to interrupt the combo that would finish the round.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Hey, you never specified what fighters I could play,” you say, a smirk tugging at the corners of your mouth. “Billy is one hundred percent fair game if you’re going to pull out Wolff like you haven’t played him a thousand times online.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Just because Mhuchee is too scared of Billy mains filling up the forums with their tears, doesn’t mean his supers are anywhere close to being balanced,” she says, pouting as much as one can with a snout.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Who’s making excuses now?” you chuckle, leaning over to quickly steal a kiss on the top of her snout. “If you’re as good at this game as you say you are then you should have no problems beating him, right?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Not if you don’t let me play my main,” she grumbles, near muttering the words under her breath. “Well, you won. What do you want me to do?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As much as you feel like taking the easy victory just to tease her about it throughout the rest of the night, her pouty expression has you thinking about giving the poor raptor a second chance. Besides, it’d make your next victory that much sweeter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Tell you what, I’ll give you a second chance on one condition,” you say, and the girl next to you perks up at the prospect of going again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her excited expression quickly turns to a wary one the second you mention a condition. “I’m not against going again, but what’s the condition?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It’s almost difficult to hold back your grin as the gears in your head slowly start to turn. “If you win then the bet is the same, but I’ll give you a second chance on the condition you sit on my lap while we play.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She looks to you with an expression of disbelief. “Really? You have to be shittin’ me, Anon.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her expression falls away to reveal a toothy, almost mischievous grin. “You know, if you wanted that from the start, all you had to do was ask. No need to make a second bet or anything.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You can feel your cheeks start to burn at her reading of your motives, and you can’t help but lightly rub at the back of your neck with a free hand. “Probably should’ve asked for something a little more out there, huh?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Not at all,” she says, tapping a scaled finger to your nose. “I think it’s sweet that you consider something like that worth betting on.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">If you thought you were embarrassed before, her sweet words of praise, practically honeyed with affection only made the blush that was surely showing on your cheeks burn that much brighter. “What can I say? I love my little featherbutt.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her toothy grin only grows wider, a renewed confidence seemingly surging through her upon hearing your little declaration of love. “Don’t think for even a second that I’m going to let you sweet talk me into another victory, loverboy.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You can’t help but smile at a reaction so typical of her that you could’ve seen it coming a mile away. “Wouldn’t dream of it.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Despite the new energy flowing through her, you can still make out the barest hint of a blush shining through her scales. “Love ya’ too, you dorky feather fucker.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Your grin only widens at the mention of a nickname she’d given you early into your relationship. It was crazy to think about sometimes, but you’d been going at it strong for nearly a year now, and you’ve enjoyed every second of it. “Alright, though don’t complain when I beat you again.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She leans into you once more, playfully nudging your side with an elbow. “Fat chance. That first loss was just because you caught me before my warmup. Now scoot over and make some room for me on your lap.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You briefly let go of the controller and she gracefully scoots onto your lap, miraculously avoiding the tangle of limbs and feathers that seemed to be so common in your relationship. Once the raptor finally finds a comfortable spot to settle down into, you decide to start the match. As much as you would’ve liked that to be the case in the following round, she took the round decisively. Now that she knew what your strategy was from the get go, it was decidedly less effective than the time you’d caught her off guard. Though it’s not exactly clear if it’s intentional or not, you begin to suspect some foul play from your featherbutt. Every time you started to gain the upper hand on her, she’d feign needing to readjust herself, more or less grinding herself against your groin in small circles. It happened for just long enough to rouse Anon Jr’s attention, which in turn only served to distract you from the prize match at hand. While normally you’d be able to keep yourself in check, it’d been a long while since the two of you had found time to be… intimate. Your busy schedules didn’t make it easy to find time but when the stars aligned, the two of you found it difficult to stay off each other. Her smug, yet casual tone ringing out is enough to shake you out of your more primal thoughts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“So how’d that Billy strat work out for you this time, dork?” she asks, the smugness and self assurance coming from her nearly palpable. “Doesn’t work so well when I play someone who can actually counter your bullshit, does it?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You go to respond but once again you’re met with another set of wiggles from the raptor laying back against you, now craning her head upwards to meet your gaze. “Well? Are you going to say something or did the loss really leave you that speechless?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The only sound that comes from you at first is something akin to a muffled grunt as you try and fail to suppress your arousal from her incessant teasing. Had it been up to you, you would’ve called the bet off right then and there and gone straight to planting kisses all over her nearly shining scales. But you knew her and yourself damn well, the two of you being far too prideful to leave the winner of a bit up in the air like that. You had to play on, but if she was going to be a tease, two could play at that game. “Don’t you worry your pretty little lead, I can play more than just Billy, you know.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I swear to god if you pull out another meta fighter like Lee or Mycles,” she groans, rolling her eyes at you. “I’m going to have to pull out my main to even have a chance to beat your button mashing.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You feign a bit of ignorance as to how strong those fighters are and choose to poke at the confidence she’d had when you initially agreed to take the bet. “What happened to the featherbutt that said she was going to sweep me not thirty minutes ago? Don’t tell me you’re suddenly chickening out just because we’re tied now.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“In your dreams, loverboy,” she says, lightly tickling your nose with a claw. “You wish I was nice enough after beating you once.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Easy to say when you’re not playing fair,” you mutter, though still loudly enough for her to hear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The quickly widening grin plastered to her muzzle was enough to dispel any and all doubt you had about her grinding and wiggling being intentional. “Playing unfair? I’m not sure what exactly you mean, Anon.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">If she was going to play innocent you were more than willing to follow along and do the same. By this point Anon Jr. was at full mast and there was not a chance in hell she couldn’t feel it pressing against her ass. Teasing her right back, you tense your pelvic floor muscles so your dick presses even tighter against her jean shorts. You would’ve given a lot to see the expression on her face as she nearly jumps out of your lap at the act. Despite that, she quickly redoubles on her efforts to drive you mad, pressing down even more as the next round kicks off. You picked a different character this time in hopes that the changeup in strategy alone would be enough to take a round off her. However, despite a strong start you find yourself having no such luck as you quickly lose whatever semblance of an advantage you had against her when you eat a couple of well placed combos from her. She was a better player than you’d give her credit for, but she’d practically grown up on these kinds of games whereas you were mostly a casual player, though you could still play circles around your close friends. Her little practiced movements were starting to have quite the effect on your conversation as much as you hated to admit it. Your condition for playing another set of matches had backfired more than spectacularly, thought it wasn’t to say Anon Jr. wasn’t enjoying the newfound attention. Through the fog of arousal currently clouding your thoughts, two good ideas began to shine through. One of these was dependent on you actually winning the bet, so the other was geared towards allowing you to win said bet. She’d made it abundantly clear playing dirty wasn’t off the table, and you were going to take full advantage of that. This round was all but lost, but taking a second consecutive loss played perfectly into your plan, raising her hopes of winning hopefully causing her to drop her guard. Sure enough, the moment she secures the round she looks up to you with the most self assured, smug grin plastered on her muzzle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You decide to feign worry about possibly losing the bet as to make her believe her victory is all but assured. “You knew what I was trying to do the second I picked T.J, didn’t you?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She taps a finger to the bottom of her muzzle, her smugness barely contained. “You’re not the only person that’s tried to do that, Anon. Maybe if you weren’t such a meta slave, I wouldn’t see your strategies coming a mile away.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Don’t get so cocky yet, you still have to take the next round before you actually win, featherbutt,” you retort, using your free arm to hold the raptor closer to you. “I still have a few tricks up my sleeve, you know.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“And here I thought you were just going to try and cheese me with Billy again, Anon,” she says, briefly settling into the crook of your arm. “Just full of surprises today, aren’t you?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Oh, so it’s only cheese when you lose to it, huh? I see how it is now,” you smile, playing the part in hopes everything would fall into place for your devilish little plan.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The two of you rest against each other for a little while, the close contact momentarily letting you forget that you’re presently still poking into her. She feeds a couple more strips of beef jerky before handing you the controller you’d set down on her lap. You hope she doesn’t notice this next bit as it’s instrumental to pulling your plan off; keeping your hands and controller resting on the front of her jean shorts. You pick a different character this time, one perfectly suited to what you were planning, Mills. A leather armor clad tank with a steel shield to complete the ensemble, he was perfect if you wanted to soak a lot of damage and still come out on top. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The match starts as usual, and the moment you take a hit, you can’t help but grin, the controller responding in kind thanks to the built-in haptic feedback. But a single hit wasn’t nearly enough to generate the kind of vibration you’d need to get a reaction from the girl sitting in your lap. With the lead you currently have you think you could take the round normally, but this way would make victory all the sweeter. You drop your guard during a crucial moment, stealthily pressing the controller into her shorts a bit more as she picks up on your mistake. She capitalizes on what she thinks is a lapse in judgement, taking the opportunity to pepper your character with a series of punches and kicks that only serve to kickstart the rumbling from your controller. You can’t see her expression with the way you’re positioned, but you can tell the vibration is having some effect on her, her nostrils flaring as she huffs. She tries to wiggle away from the controller but the way your hands and arms rest on top and around her, she can do little to stop the teasing and continue to hit you at the same time. She takes a quick second to look behind her and you do your best to feign ignorance, hiding your grin as you focus on the match. You take that opportunity to whittle her character down some more, bringing her that much closer to defeat. Despite her initial reaction she doesn’t hesitate to punish you with another combo whenever you slip up, the controller working it’s magic once again, shattering her usual level of concentration. Not too long after an all too familiar sound rings out through all the fighting game noises coming from the TV. You can feel her shudder for a moment, letting out a muffled squawk that she clearly tried, but failed to suppress. You don’t hesitate for a moment to strike while she’s basically out of the game, unleashing the super you’d been holding onto for most of the match, finishing off the game decisively with an unblocked shield bash. Once she’s finally recovered from her losing battle with you controller she looks back to you, brow furrowed in slight annoyance, thought from the blush shining through it’s apparent that your plan had worked better than you could’ve ever hoped it would.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You cheating little b-bastard,” she mutters, her voice seemingly still a bit shaken from the stimulation. “That… doesn’t count.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Cheating? I’m not sure what you mean,” you say, feigning the same ignorance she’d treated you to not fifteen minutes ago. “Why wouldn’t it count? I beat you fair and square with one of your favorite characters.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You had your controller pressed up against my crotch the whole round, you dick!” she says, taking your controller and setting it down beside her. “I’d like to see you try and play a fighting game while I’m playing with your dick, you ass.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I don’t know…” you grin, still pretending you don’t know what she was up to. “You seemed to be doing a pretty good job doing that the last two rounds. Just paying the favor forward, you know.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I- you… that doesn- you’re the one who asked me to sit on your lap, you fuckin’ dweeb!” she protests, clearly flustered by your calling out of her behavior. “That’s not even close to what you just did!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I asked you to sit on my lap because it’d be more comfortable for the both of us, featherbutt,” you say, still very much enjoying the exchange now that you’ve turned things on her. “That doesn’t mean I wanted a lapdance while playing the game.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“B-but, you-” she huffs, her nostrils flaring a bit like they always do when she’s frustrated. “Fine, you win, Anon. I’m sorry for… you know, doing that to try and get an edge.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You can tell her apology is genuine, but you can’t help but take the opportunity to take the teasing a tiny bit further, craning your head down slightly to whisper something into her ear, “Hey, I didn’t say it wasn’t hot.” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">If her blush could get any brighter she’d be the color of a ripe tomato, doing her best to cover her flustered expression with a free claw. “God, you’re embarrassing sometimes, you perv.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Your grin could not possibly get any wider at how she’s reacting to your teasing. “Only because you made me this way, featherbutt. I accept your apology though.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Oh, fuck off,” she says, a smile now plastered to her muzzle. “You were this much of a dweeb even before we started dating.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Maybe a little, though you definitely didn’t help me stop being one,” you smile, reminiscing a bit on your first few dates. “You mind if I get up for a second? That soda went right through me.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yeah, shit, sorry, forgot I was sitting in your lap,” she says, quickly shuffling off your lap onto the empty couch beside you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Somehow I doubt Anon Jr. was letting you forget that,” you chuckle, readjusting your sweatpants ever so slightly as you get up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Ass,” she says, flicking her tongue out at you as you shuffle past towards the bathroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You take a quick detour into your shared bedroom to retrieve something you’d ordered a couple of weeks back, keeping it stashed away under a pile of clothing in the closet. You can’t help but grin a bit upon finding it, slipping it into your pocket before heading to the bathroom to do your business. Feeling refreshed, you take a deep breath to steady your nerves a bit, hoping she’ll like the surprise gift. While you’d vaguely discuss the topic with her every so often, actually taking a step towards making it happen was a different ballgame entirely. Hell, even you were inexperienced on the matter, but you were at least confident you could push her buttons in all of the right ways. You decide to head back to the living room before she wonders where you got off to, tapping your pocket just to make sure you hadn’t forgotten the gift. She’s cozied up against the armrest, seemingly content to just sit and relax in the spot you’d warmed up for her. Even though she was looking down at her phone, she immediately senses your presence in the room, looking up at you with a warm smile plastered on her muzzle. It’s enough to get the butterflies in your stomach fluttering, though you do your best to keep your cool as you settle down next to her on the couch. She quickly shifts from her side of the couch to lay on top of you, resting her head against the crook of your neck. The feathers tickle at the exposed skin of your neck, and for a brief moment you’re content with just getting lost in her sunset colored eyes. The contented chirps she makes are enough to make your heart ache on their own, though the kiss she quickly steals from you gets your heart racing that much more. You steal one right back and for a moment you’ve completely forgotten about the gift you still have yet to give her. While it pains you to interrupt a moment as tender as this one, you quickly make the decision to ask the question.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Sorry, but I just remembered there was something I wanted to give you,” you say, almost nervous at the prospect of doing something as innocent as giving a gift. “I wanted it to be a surprise, would you mind closing your eyes?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She looks a tiny bit skeptical at your awkward phrasing, but you can see the anticipation building in her movements. “Yeah sure I can, but a gift? You didn’t have to get me anything Anon, and our anniversary isn’t even for another month and I…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You interrupt her near frantic speaking space by putting a finger to the front of her snout, and she looks to you with an unamused expression. “Don’t worry about the gift, featherbutt. I just felt like getting you something you’d been talking about for a while.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Her curiosity is seemingly piqued at the words, and she seems to be almost lost in thought as to what it could be. Unsurprising, considering the lengths you’d undergone during Christmastime to keep her from guessing what her present was. Sometimes she was too much of a clever girl for her own good, though that wasn’t to say you didn’t love that about her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“So, what is this gift?” she asks, running a clawed finger underneath your shirt collar. “Must be something nice if you’re going through all this trouble.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I guess you could say that, sure,” you grin, wanting to tease her a bit more. “You’re not going to get anything more out of me until you close your eyes.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You’re no fun sometimes,” she says, tapping your nose with a clawed finger. “I swear to god if you’re pranking me again I’m going to….”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You’re going to what?” you ask, still grinning at the raptor resting against you, waiting on her to close her eyes before you proceed with your plan. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I’ll get my revenge somehow,” she says, sticking her tongue out at you before closing her eyes. “Besides, you haven’t even told me what you want me to do for the stupid bet we made.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I’ll tell you in a bit, don’t worry about it,” you say, making sure her eyes are fully closed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You carefully reach your free hand down and into your pocket to retrieve the gift, being careful not to give away the surprise before you could slip it onto her. You wrap the leash a single time around your palm, putting the lead in your free hand. Carefully, you inch the lead towards the choker around her neck, using your thumb to open up the clasp on it. You then carefully slip it into place onto the ring jutting out from her choker. She seemingly notices the slight disturbance and you can see her eyes begin to open. Even though you were sure she’d react positively to the gift, you were still as nervous as you when the two of you first met. You just hoped she still found your idiocy endearing, especially when you see her start to realize there’s something amiss with her choker.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Hey, what the-” she starts, seemingly upset before she looks at the leash wrapped around your palm, finally putting two and two together.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She doesn’t say anything for a bit, now staring back between the lead attached to her choker and the length of leather wrapped taut around your hand. You’re sweating bullets as she hasn’t said a word, but confirmation comes through in the way of a blush shining through her scaled cheeks. You let out the breath you’d been holding for what felt like the last minute, relieved at the positive reception.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“So… do you like it?” You smile, the grin on your face starting to widen in anticipation of what’s to come. “Don’t know if it’s the right type or color but I figured you’d like it regardless.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I, uh-” she says, making an involuntary noise that you can only liken to some sort of quack. “I-I don’t really know what to say, Anon.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The wind is taken out of your sails a bit, but this was an outcome you’d been considering when you initially planned this out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Hey, look, don’t worry about it,” you say, reaching up toward her neck to take the lead off. “If it’s too much I can just take it back to the store or-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She reaches up, putting her hand over yours, stopping you in your tracks and causing you to redirect your attention to her. You can only meet her gaze, listening intently as she starts to speak again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“No, d-don’t,” she says, blushing brighter than you’ve ever seen from her before. “I like it.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You feel relief at her words though you’re not exactly how to proceed from here, never having delved into this kink of hers beyond talking about it in passing. While you wanted nothing more than to pull her into a kiss, you remembered an important detail, and that was to set up a safeword with her before you proceeded. After all, the two of you never having done something like this, you felt it was the responsible thing to do in case you stepped over her comfort zone. She seems to have had the same idea you did a few moments ago, craning her neck up to kiss you. As much as it pains you to do so, you stop her by putting a finger to her lips, and she looks to you with a puzzled expression.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Sorry, featherbutt, just, uh… realized we forgot to do something first,” you say, bringing your finger off her lips. “Should’ve probably asked you about a safeword or something last time we talked about this stuff.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“S-shit, you’re right,” she says, not quite to meet your gaze out of what feels like embarrassment. “How about… power?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You can’t help but raise an eyebrow at the choice, though you’re certainly not complaining about the quickness with which she came up with it. “Power it is, then. Just say the word if I’m going too far or if I-”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She stops your near rambling tone with a quick kiss to the lips, and you’re content to hold the kiss until she finally pulls away from you, nearly out of breath. “Don’t worry about that, Anon. I trust you. I trust you more than I’ve ever trusted anyone before.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You can’t help but smile at her kind words, your heart fluttering at the high praise. “Alright, I’m just… kind of afraid I’ll do it wrong or something.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Anon,” she states, trying to get more of your already undivided attention as your gazes lock. “Just have fun with it, it’s my first time doing… well, anything like this.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Mine too,” you nod, her words giving you the reassurance you need to continue. “Guess I’ll just….”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You want to say something else, but the words die in your throat once you realize it’s better to show rather than tell. Bringing your free hand up, you bring two fingers to the underside of her muzzle, and you can feel her shudder slightly at the sudden contact. With an awkward set of movements, you use your fingers to tilt her head up towards yours. You pinch your fingers to take a careful, yet firm grasp of her muzzle, pulling her back into another kiss. Your lips crash together, and you decide to take the initiative to be a bit more forceful than you’re accustomed to. Bodies pressing against one another as the two of you shift around, you’re careful to not allow her or yourself to fall off the sofa. You’re not quite certain if you’re doing things correctly but soon enough you find yourself on top of her, your tongue prodding against her sharp teeth as if seeking permission to explore further. French kissing was no easy ordeal with how easily her teeth could cut just about anything to ribbons, but the opposite arrangement was almost unfeasible with how lengthy her tongue is. Seconds later, she opens up, allowing your tongue to mingle with hers. Tongues interlocked and with the two of you quickly running out of breath, you finally decide to put the collar wrapped around your hand to good use. Wrapping the leash around your hand two more times, you give it a firm tug, pulling her upright as you do. You quickly feel proof that you’re doing an alright job, one of her free hands suddenly finding itself on the back of your head, tugging your hair slightly as she too, pulls you even deeper into the kiss. The lack of air has you feeling a bit lightheaded, but you persevere, feeling reinvigorated when a muted rumble reverberates from her. You’d shared more passionate moments with her than you could count, but this took the cake in terms of your shared enthusiasm. She’s the first to pull away for breath, a thin string of spittle connecting the two of you as you each pant for breath. Combined with her expression, you can feel Anon Jr. reviving from his all too brief slumber, a slight twitch serving to announce it’s presence to her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Well- that was….” she pauses, still clearly out of breath from the kissing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Good?” you ask, taking the opportunity to finish her thoughts as the two of you stare into each other’s eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She rolls her eyes ever so slightly, now having recovered her breath. “I was going to say different, but yeah, a good different. Maybe you could try tug-”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You kind of guess where she’s going with her sentence and instead decide to take the initiative, taking the raptor underneath you by surprise. A quick tug on the collar takes her by surprise, your lips quickly finding themselves against hers as you lean into her, pressing her deeper into the cushions. All the while, you snake a free hand around her side, slowly gliding across her shirt until it’s cupping the bottom of her breasts. You can feel her squirm slightly once she feels your warm hand, her slight sensitivity in that area being something you normally loved taking advantage of in the bedroom. As you continue to kiss, you decide to shake things up a bit, tugging slightly on the collar until her head is craned up and off the couch, moving your other hand up a bit more as you do. You take a handful of the scaled, yet pliable flesh, not quite being able to engulf it all with a single hand. Squeezing firmly, but not enough to cause discomfort provokes a reaction from her you weren’t quite expecting. You didn’t even think she could reach that far down, feeling a clawed hand on both your ass and back in what feels like an instant. She pulls you against her, grinding her clothed body against yours once there’s barely enough distance between you two. The close contact and warmth of her groin against yours feels good, almost way too good. Having abstained from doing anything with her for nearly a week without taking care of yourself was definitely taking its toll, and quickly. You can’t help but let out a muffled grunt as she pulls you even closer. To let some of the pressure off yourself you decide to repay the favor in kind, redoubling your efforts to stimulate her by repeatedly running your thumb over her nipple, kneading her breast with even more urgency. You hoped the effort would have the effect of loosening her grip some and lo and behold, you can feel her hand slip almost entirely off your sweatpants. The muffled moan she lets out as you continue your slow, almost methodical kneading fills you with confidence that you’re doing an excellent job. Unfortunately, your lungs can only do so much, and once again you find yourself parting ways to catch your breath again. Her flushed expression combined with her heavy panting has you straining the already cramped fabric of your boxers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Like that?” you ask, a wide grin tugging at the corners of your mouth when you take in the effect you’d had on her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Haah… yeah, I-” she says, still panting slightly, a small smile on her muzzle. “Almost… exactly like what I had in mind, actually. Should’ve done this ages ago if I knew you were going to be like… that.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">As much as you would’ve liked to continue kissing her, you felt an odd sense of urgency with your manhood threatening to poke a hole straight through your sweatpants. You have a plan, but you’re not entirely sure about being able to pull off the execution. Figuring you might as well go for broke, you lean down to whisper something into her sensitive ear, but not before tugging on the collar once more, giving you free access to her scaled neck. You lean down even closer and trail kisses all the way from the nape of her neck to her ears. Being careful to not ruin the moment by not taking into the account her sensitive hearing, you whisper out something in the most seductive tone you can muster.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I need you to do something for me now,” you say, hoping she’d understand the implication behind the suave, yet commanding tone.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She nods rapidly, and you can’t help but take a little bit of pride in having reduced the normally cocky, almost stoic raptor into a flustered, blushy mess.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You’re not sure if you’re being too gentle, but you slowly bring her off the couch by firmly tugging on the collar until she’s in a seated position. She seems to be happily awaiting your next order, her gaze occasionally straying from yours to appreciate the prominent bulge in your pants that you were making absolutely no effort to hide from her. The sudden flaring of her nostrils told you that even if she hadn’t already seen or felt it, she would’ve certainly picked up on your arousal by now. Her strong sense of smell had landed you in hot water when you first started dating Thera, having lost the battle to keep your libido in check when the two of you first got cuddly. It was something you admittedly had always wanted to turn on her, her comments about the clothing she ‘borrowed’ from you having given you certain… ideas from time to time. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Your thoughts are quickly interrupted by her soft voice ringing out, “So, what do you want me to do now… handler?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">For a moment you’re not entirely sure you heard your girlfriend correctly, nearly double taking at the words. While you hadn’t known this was something you were into, her words alone were enough to make you throb against the inside of your sweats, and she clearly took notice of this, letting a small grin briefly break through. You take a deep breath as you contemplate what to say and do next, not wanting to ruin the mood by doing something dumb. You remain wordless, tugging on the collar towards the front of the couch, Thera quickly following along, moving exactly where you’re directing her. You keep giving firm tugs until she’s off the couch, standing directly in front of you. Both her clawed hands are in front of her jean shorts, overlapping each other as she diligently waits for your next move. The intense blush shining through her scaled cheeks is enough to tell you this is an embarrassing yet thrilling experience to her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Alright,” you say loudly, hoping to get her undivided attention before you speak again. “On your knees, raptor.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You can’t help but cringe a bit at the words that just came out of your mouth, though clearly your girlfriend has no problem with it, though she’s seemingly waiting on something. Shit, right, you forgot to tug on the collar. Tugging firmly, she quickly drops down onto her knees in front of you and you open your legs just enough to accommodate her presence. A singular tug forward puts her at eye level with your groin, close enough to where even an errant twitch could have your clothed length make contact with her muzzle.You can see her nostrils flare, her eyes briefly shutting as she gets what you think is a whiff of your scent. The sight is enough to make you grunt, and soon enough you can feel one of her hands rubbing the inside of your clothed thigh. While it’s even close to direct stimulation, combined with the lusty expression she’s wearing, it’s got you wanting to hurry things along even more. She’s seemingly forgotten that you’re taking charge, getting daring and running a clawed finger slowly along your bulge. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">While some part of you would like nothing more than to let her take charge, you quickly realize that’s the exact opposite of what she wants you to do. You decide to see where she’s going with it, almost positive she’s planning on doing something. Using both hands, she reaches for the hem of your sweatpants, and you lift yourself off the couch to help the process of getting them off along. She once again runs a clawed finger delicately from the tip of your clothed bulge to the base, the speed at which she does it almost agonizing to bear. All the while she looks up to you, meeting your gaze as she licks her lower lip. While the teasing is certainly enjoyable, you’re not just going to let her forget who’s in charge here. With a grunt and a slight tug on the collar, you quickly send a message telling her to hurry things along. What happens next though, you would’ve never expected, not coming from someone as timid as her in the bedroom. In a single swift, yet seemingly calculated movement, she uses her claw to tear a gash straight down the middle of your boxers. The fabric no longer constraining it, your sizable and painfully erect manhood springs out at her, the raptor flinching back to avoid getting hit in the nose. You tug at the collar a bit to bring her muzzle close, the contrast between the cool air and her warm breath causing your dick to twitch. You can see her nostrils flare slightly in reaction, your tip beading with precum as she continues to indirectly stimulate you. As much as you wanted to let her continue her little game, you quickly decide some scolding is in order. In fact, there was something else you’d wanted to work into the roleplay, and what she just did was the perfect way to introduce it. You fish the item from your pocket, giving the collar a slight upwards tug as you hold it out in the air in front of her. Her gaze immediately locks onto the toy you’re dangling by the tips of your fingers. To anyone not well versed in the variety of sex toys available for this kind of play, it looked fairly unassuming, a hard, black piece of plastic that vaguely resembles the letter D. The humor isn’t lost on you considering it’s made to… well, facilitate your giving of the D. Thera however, knows exactly what you’re holding in your hand, considering she’d been the one to teach you what a ring gag was weeks ago, having shown you some material of one in action. It hadn’t been cheap to find a material that would be able to hold up to her sharp teeth and impressive bite force, but you could find nearly anything on the internet with some effort.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You know what this is?” you ask, dangling the gag right in front of her eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She’s seemingly content to continue playing innocent, shaking her head no despite the flare of her nostrils as she continues to gaze intently at the toy. For someone who’d never done anything like this before she sure knew how to play the part. If anything, it was putting even more pressure to perform, struggling to come up with the words you wanted to say next. After some quick thinking back to things you’d said before, you finally come up with a solid followup to your question.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“This,” you state, putting emphasis on the word with a very slight tug to the collar. “Is for raptors who can’t be trusted not to misbehave with their handler.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The emphasis you put on the word handler seemed to have it’s intended effect, as you can her thighs briefly shift, rubbing against one another. Her free hand still lingers around the front of her jean shorts, and you make a mental note to rectify that in a bit. You continue trying to come up with more things to say, really trying to hammer the handler angle she seemed to appreciate so much.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You know what I do to raptors that insist on misbehaving?” you ask, craning your head downwards to be just above hers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Once again she shakes her head no, the hand rubbing against your inner thigh slowly inching towards your groin. Even though the situation is arousing enough, the light, almost tickling sensation of her claws running against your exposed skin is more than enough to keep Anon Jr. at full attention as you continue to improvise.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Sometimes, they keep pushing the limits and well….” you say, grasping the base of your dick with a free hand before giving it a slight jostle. “I’m forced to use my baton to get things back under control.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You’d be lying if you said allowing those words to leave your mouth hadn’t hurt you on a spiritual level. It was the best thing you could come up with under the circumstances, though Thera seemingly found it humorous instead of mood killing, which you were grateful for. You decide to press on instead of letting it stop you once the raptor finishes struggling to stifle her laughter. Both of you finally getting back into character, you decide to continue, an idea popping into your head about how to continue.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Oh, is punishment just a joke to you then?” you ask, giving the collar a firm tug forward until her muzzle is resting against one side of your length.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">The contrast of cool scales and a few feathers against the smooth skin of your dick is enough to provoke another errant twitch, one you’re absolutely sure she felt against her face. You decide to up the ante, taking hold of your dick and resting it along the top of her snout, her nostrils now pressed tight against your sack. For a while she does nothing but allow it to happen, though you can faintly hear the sounds of denim rubbing against itself, enough to tell you you’re doing a good job.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Don’t be shy now,” you say, the faint sounds of chirps and slight sniffing now filling an otherwise silent living room. “Best you get acquainted with the instrument that’ll be doing all the punishing.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Another small tug to the collar is all it takes for her to become a more active participant in all this, groaning when you finally that all too familiar tongue lick alongside the bottom of your orbs. It’s been so long since you did anything you’d almost forgotten exactly how long, warm and silky her tongue is compared to her cool, bumpy scales. The sheer level of control she had with her tongue was nothing short of impressive, her tongue slowly dragging over every exposed inch of your sack it could reach, leaving them slick with her saliva. While it wasn’t direct stimulation, her tongue work was more than enough to satisfy, leaving your dick twitching, globs of precum drooling down onto the top of her muzzle. If that wasn’t enough, you could feel the licking intensify as she takes long drags of your scent straight from the source. You rest your free hand on the back of her head, pushing down ever so slightly as you gently rub the scales and feathers within the reach of your thumb and index finger. She seems to appreciate the care and affection despite her position, and the quickly intensifying movements of her tongue are proof enough of that. As much as you like what she’s doing, the dangerous combination of your abstinence from doing anything with her alongside her knowing exactly how to ‘attack’ you best, you’re not going to last much longer at this pace. But rather than just cut things short or have an anticlimactic finish, you decide to instead continue playing things up to delay your little death instead. Using your leash wrapped hand, you gently pull her head away from your crotch, taking some time to admire how exactly you’d affected the raptor. Her soft panting and the way her tongue sticks out from her slightly ajar mouth, the flare of her nostrils as she finally gets some fresh air, the way one of her hands has conveniently slipped partway into her shorts all come together to make for a truly arousing sight. If those things alone weren’t making it hard enough for you to calm yourself down, the lust drunk expression you could plainly see in her sunset colored eyes was the cherry on top.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Once you’re done drinking in the sights before you, you take the rubber ring gag back into your hand, your confidence at an all time high after seeing the state you left her in after pulling away.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“That’s enough familiarizing yourself for now,” you say, dangling the gag in front of her once more. “That was just a little taste of what I have in store for you.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You can’t help but grin a bit at the unintentional wordplay, the dirty talk getting a bit less painful to say with each iteration. It was thrilling to take such a dominant position, and you’d be lying if you said it didn’t feel good, especially with someone so eagerly willing to take the opposite role.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Keep that... thing away from me,” she hisses, baring the slightest hint of her sharp teeth as she does. “Come anywhere near me with that again and I’ll bite it off.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You can’t help but cringe a bit at the thought, though you’re well aware she’s only playing her part up for your sake. At the very least, she’s given you an easy avenue with which to respond, grinning once the idea pops into your head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">A sharp tug of the collar brings her closer to the gag dangling above her and your grin only widens as you go to speak. “Funny you mention that, actually. That’s exactly what this little device was made to prevent.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She feigns innocence, a confused expression spreading throughout her features. “W-what do you mean?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Don’t worry,” you laugh, playing into the little game of cat and mouse you have going. “Open your mouth wide and I’ll show you exactly what I mean.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She doesn’t follow the order, intentionally, you suspect, so you decide to wrap the leash once more around your palm, giving it another firm tug after doing so. Still, she doesn’t budge, barely flinching at the tug of the leash. You decide to take things a bit further, using your wrapped hand to lift her muzzle slightly, forcing her to meet your gaze. Her stoic and expression of slight anger looks to be close to the real thing, but there was something you couldn’t explain about it that told you it wasn’t genuine.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You decide to bark the order out again, unwilling to back down to insubordination after getting to this point. “Open. Up.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She jerks her muzzle away ever so slightly, but just enough to loosen your grip on her snout. You take hold of it once again, using your fingers to gently start to pry it open. The first thing you see as you pull and prod at the scaled flesh are her sharp, pearly teeth, very clearly belonging in the mouth of the predator submitting before you. You decide that you aren’t going to get your way like this, and you decide to sweeten the pot for her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“If you’re to fight me the whole- ngh, way,” you say as she jerks away once more. “Then you’re not going to get the reward I know you love so much.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Sure enough, her stoic demeanor starts to wear away, her mouth slowly opening to you as you press the flat of your thumb to it. She allows it passage, your digit quickly becoming acquainted with the warmth you’d felt on your groin not ten minutes ago. You press on, not satisfied until the entirety of your thumb comes to rest on her exceedingly long tongue, her ajar mouth giving you a pretty clear view to avoid bumping into those razor sharp teeth of hers. What she does next, you certainly weren’t expecting, and you can’t help but watch in an odd mix of awe and arousal as her tongue slowly comes to wrap itself around your intruding finger. You take it as a sign of things to come and even still, you continue to observe as she continues her near expert tongue work, merely using your thumb as a stand in for her coveted prize. After giving you what you could only call an impressive display of her talents, she slowly begins to pull away, leaving you with a saliva coated digit and a now painfully hard erection. She keeps her mouth open, and you use your free hand to keep her head steady as you move to put the ring gag in place. After a tiny bit of struggling, poking and prodding, you finally get the hard piece of rubber into place, very clearly keeping her snout propped open. Blowjobs had always been a point of contention and much care throughout the course of your relationship, always doing your best to satisfy your mutual oral fixations without any trips to the hospital in the process. Needless to say, you were excited at the prospect of taking some of that pressure off, allowing you both to just relax and get lost in whatever acts came to mind. Satisfied with the placement, you lean back into the couch a bit, tugging her forward using the leash so as to not let her forget you were calling the shots. She leans into it, allowing herself to be brought forward, her head and body now resting entirely between your legs. Using your free hand you take hold of your long since neglected manhood, giving it a set of slow, careful strokes meant to stoke her arousal further. As you go through the motions, you notice her arm moving ever so slightly and you quickly connect the dots. Thera was trying to get off while she thought you were distracted by the prospect of giving her a show. You weren’t going to allow for that to happen, at least, not by her own hand. Taking the matter into your own hands, you reach down with your wrapped hand to gently push her arm out of the way, leaning in all the while.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You can’t but grin down at the girl as you slowly wag your finger in front of her eyes. “Nuh uh. Misbehaving raptors aren’t allowed to do that.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She looks to you with an almost desperate, lust filled expression as she slowly fishes her scaled hand from her jean shorts. You only got a faint glimpse of her fingers, but even you could see the slight sheen to them, instantly telling you exactly where they’d been. Still trapped in your loose grip, your dick twitched at the sight, longing for some much needed attention from her. Leash now almost entirely wrapped around your hand, you bring her forward, carefully aligning yourself with her open mouth. The radiating warmth is enough to make your length jump again, and you’re not entirely confident about how long you’ll last once the two of you actually get going. But that was a problem for future you, letting out a mix of a grunt and moan when you feel her warm, wet tongue make contact with the entire underside of your dick in an instant. Just resting it on her tongue has you dripping precum like a leaky faucet, your girlfriend&#039;s eyes glazing over even more once the taste hits her tongue. You’re not entirely sure if that’s what reinvigorated her, but you instinctively buck forward deeper into her muzzle when her tongue starts to wrap itself around your dick, the feeling akin to a velvet fist getting you off. As much as you’d like to relax into the sofa, you quickly decide to sit upright, putting both hands on her head as she gets into the groove. Slowly, you feed more and more into her muzzle, only stopping when your cockhead bumps into that rubber ring. Shifting her head using both hands, you carefully maneuver your length through the ring’s arc before continuing to push her head down. You were careful to not push her limits too far, never having done this before. However, she showed absolutely no signs of discomfort, seemingly content with wringing out your dick with her tongue. Her little muffled warbles, chirps and moans as she carefully tends to you only add to the warm, confined pleasure you’re feeling right now. So much so that you slowly start feeding your remaining inches into her muzzle. As a result of the ring gag propping her mouth open, your combined fluids start to pool and slowly drip from the sides of her muzzle. It’s almost unreasonably hot, and you decide to encourage and reward her behavior, the sloppy oral combined with her expression something you don’t ever want to stop experiencing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“God, that’s- nmf, so fucking good,” you say, using your fingers to gently massage her sensitive scales as you press her head deeper into your groin. “I bet you’re- ngh, enjoying this, aren’t you?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You continue to push her head down onto yourself, letting out another muffled moan once your length is entirely nestled in her snout. Her nostrils now press tight against your pubic bone, you quickly realize you should probably ease up a bit to let her catch her breath. Despite the lack of air, her tongue work doesn’t slow for even a second, even the slowest of licks aiding in sending you careening towards release. You contemplate pulling back once more to get your bearings but she seems to have other plans, knowing full well how close you are to release by your twitching combined with the noises that continue to slip from your mouth. Not only that, but you’re being stimulated on two fronts, the tip of her tongue now starting to lather your smooth sack as you hold her head in place, drawing back slowly before thrusting all the way back in. You’re amazed by how dextrous her tongue is, her tongue somehow managing to pull back the skin surrounding the tip without the aid of it’s tip. If you thought you were feeling good before, the pleasure you begin to feel as she focuses her efforts on your head could have you believing you’d died and gone to heaven. Her continued eye contact with you as she continues to masterfully work your length without any suction involved only helps add to the experience. You’re not sure how much longer you can last under the circumstances, and you’re grateful when you suddenly feel her tongue ease off your jewels, feeling it graze the underside of your dick as she pulls it back into her mouth. You continue your thrusting, slowly tightening your grip on her head as you do. That relief is short lived when you feel the long, thin tip of her tongue starts to worm it’s way underneath your foreskin, lingering around the head. You quickly realize she has no plans to make things easy on you, swirling her deft tongue around your head at what you can only call an agonizing pace. She slowly starts to pick up the pace with her swirling and you hold her head in place as you continue to climb towards an explosive peak. You figure you at least owe her the common courtesy of a warning given you’re not exactly giving her much choice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Fuck, Thera, I-” you say, berating yourself for letting her name slip in the roleplay. “I-I’m going to fuckin- mph, cum.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You absolutely can’t take it any longer, letting yourself finally fall from the edge you’d been teetering on for the last hour. It feels as if your very soul is leaving your body, two weeks worth of frustration starting to leave your body. She’s seemingly taken by surprise as the first few thick, pearly ropes of seed splash against her tongue, some of it quickly dripping down the sides of her maw, lost to the floor below. Despite this, her tongue continues to wring you for everything you’re worth, cumming the hardest you have in months. An idea pops into your head as you continue to coat every available inch of space with fresh spunk. You continue to grunt as you ride out your orgasm, your dick spasming uncontrollably within it’s rubber confine as you continue to spill forth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Keep it- ngh, all in your mouth,” you say, rubbing gently at her scales as you keep her in place. “Don’t. Swallow.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It was a lot to ask for considering the sheer volume you were putting out, but you could feel your orgasm start to wane, slowly loosening your grip on her muzzle as the power behind your ropes started to peter out. Gently extracting yourself from her maw, you notice your quickly softening dick is now absolutely drenched in a mix of your warm fluids. You quickly realize you’ve left the poor girl holding a mouthful of your semen with standing orders to not swallow. The thought alone draws one more errant twitch you as you begin to tilt her snout upwards, the ring gag still in place.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Open up,” you say, gently tapping your fingers against the underside of her muzzle so you can get a good look.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You can feel yourself start to harden again when you get a good look at the cloudy, alabaster pool now forming at the back of her throat. The mess you’d made of her certainly didn’t help the view be any less arousing, rivulets of fluids still dripping down the sides of her mouth, almost certainly making their way down to stain her top and jean shorts. You never thought you’d find the idea of ‘staining’ her with your seed as appealing as you’re finding it right now, but here you are.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You like your reward, girl?” you say, and you can’t help but to immediately recoil slightly at your words, not very experienced with this vein of dirty talk. “Now swallow it.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You reach forward and dislodge the ring gag from her mouth, making sure to have your hand clear of her teeth before she clamps down. She closes her mouth, and you can briefly see a slight lump in her throat as she makes an audible swallowing noise. While you certainly believe she swallowed it all, you can’t help but play into her kink a bit more.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Open up,” you say, tapping on the underside of her muzzle once more. “Show me you swallowed it all, I don’t want you wasting any more of it.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Right away... handler,” she nods, her words coming staggered as she starts to catch her breath again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">She tilts her head up and opens as wide as she possibly can, not a single trace of your cum left. She’d done an excellent job, especially at playing the part, which you figure deserves some words of praise.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Good job,” you say, and you can feel her lean into your hand as you continue gently rubbing at her scales. “See how nice things can be when you listen to your handler?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Some part of you is starting to believe it’s never going to be any easier to say this stuff, so you might as well let loose and have some fun with it. After all, it doesn’t seem like your girlfriend has any problem with it short of the laughter earlier, so at the very least you don’t seem to be saying anything that’s making the experience actively worse for her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yeah…” she says, slowly nodding in agreement. “So what now… handler?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Admittedly you didn’t think this far ahead when you’d planned this whole thing but even you could see things had heated up. Moving things to your bedroom seemed like the reasonable thing to do, but you weren’t exactly sure how to go about doing that. You looked down at the waiting raptor, now being able to get a better look at just how much of a mess you’d made of her clothes, darkened spots signifying all the places your combined fluids had dripped down onto. Not that you minded, but the blowjob had been sloppy, leaving your groin in a similar state of disaster. A cloudy mix of her saliva and your cum dripped down your half hard shaft, slowly coming to pool at the base of your dick. The sight was beyond arousing, and a devilish idea was slowly beginning to take root as you took it all in. Despite how lost you were in your thoughts, her gaze was still locked onto you as she waited for you to give her some kind of direction. You give a small tug on her collar for effect when you finally figure out what you’re going to say.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“We’re going to take this to the… testing chamber before we continue,” you say, quickly coming up with a different way to refer to your bedroom. “But first… I need you to clean me off. We’ll both be in a world of trouble if management finds out how my uniform got stained.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">You tug her forward with the collar to drive home your point, your dick slowly stiffening at the prospect of getting a tongue bath from the raptor kneeling before you. Your free hand quickly rises to the occasion, slowly moving to retake its resting place on the back of her head. Carefully, you slowly start maneuvering her head until her nose comes to rest dead center in your sac. You hold her there for a moment, Anon Jr. quickly reviving at the thought of her only being able to breathe in concentrated doses of your scent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Not in a million years could you have imagined yourself being in this situation. It was pretty much everything you’d hoped it’d be when you first brought up the idea to Anon. The fact that he’d taken you completely by surprise with it made it all the better. Sure, the dirty talk and the roleplaying wasn’t perfect but he was doing a damn good job of setting your loins on fire with some of the stuff he’s said. It’d been hard to refrain from getting yourself off throughout all of this, and his comment about moving things to the bedroom had you anxious at the prospect of finally getting some release. Him telling you to clean the mess the two of you made off his cock certainly didn’t help lessen your arousal in the slightest. He tugs at the collar again and you can’t help but rub your thighs together, desperate for the slightest bit of stimulation. You can feel the dampness on your scales, your panties absolutely drenched in your sticky fluids. Some part of you hoped there wouldn’t be a visible stain on the outside of your jean shorts when you finally got off your knees, already blushing at the thought of him seeing just how worked up you are. You curse under your breath when you feel his hand on the back of your head again, a shudder running through your entire body as she starts rubbing your scales with the soft touch you love so much. While you’re doing your best to muffle any embarrassing noises, you can’t help but let out a chirp in surprise when he starts to slowly push your head towards his groin. As if it wasn’t bad enough already, the only thing you can smell as you start to approach is his cum mixing in with his already overpowering enough masculine scent. The sight of his messy, half hard length stiffening and extending out towards you combined with that has you nearly twitching for release, rubbing your thighs against one another out of desperation. It wasn’t entirely unexpected considering what he’d done before but he continues to push your head down, the light tugging on the collar nearly enough to make your head spin with desire. He continues doing this until your nose is firmly planted in his sack, something you’re not entirely used to him doing. That wasn’t to say you weren’t enjoying the little game he was playing, your thoughts growing cloudy as he practically forces you to take long drags of his scent. Not that you’d tell him, but it certainly wasn’t helping the fire raging down below by any means, leaning into the hand gently rubbing your scales as he continues to hold you in place. You quickly realize part of your tongue unconsciously slipped out of your muzzle, and you decide to take the opportunity to participate more actively in an effort to help move things along. The second your tongue makes contact with the underside of his balls, you can feel his length throb against the top of your muzzle, and you have to fight the urge to avoid going for a second round with him. Instead you focus on ‘cleaning’ every inch of the smooth skin you can reach with your long, thin tongue. Every groan, grunt or muffled moan he makes only serves to stoke your fire, unspoken confirmation and motivation to continue with what you’re doing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;That&#039;s enough polishing the equipment,&quot; he says, and you can&#039;t help but let out some air through your nostrils at his cheesy dirty talk. &quot;It should be clean enough for... testing purposes in the lab later.&quot;</div></li></ol>        </div>

            RAW Paste Data        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">	Life could not possibly be better for you at this moment. You just found out you’ve got the next couple of days off work, you’re huddled up on the couch with the love of your life and to cap it all off, you’ve got all the fixings for a great date night right in front of you. Snacks of all kinds as far as the eye can see, one of your favorite fighting games playing on the TV screen in front of you and most importantly, your girlfriend flashing you a content smile as she rests her feathered head in the crook of your arm. Her meek, yet gentle voice shakes you out of your happiness induced stupor and you can feel her head feathers tickle at your bare skin as she shifts into a more comfortable position.

“So, are you ready to lose again?” she asks, wearing the absolute most smug grin she can possibly give you on her face. “Don’t think I’ve forgotten about last time we played Gladiator Gauntlet: Leather &amp; Steel.”

You can’t help but feel a bit flustered at her words, knowing full well how good she is at fighting games. “Hey, I’ve been practicing here and there when you’re at work. Just because I’ve only beaten you a couple of times doesn’t mean your luck isn’t about to change, featherbutt.”

“Oh yeah?” she asks, exuding pure confidence as she speaks. “Why don’t we make things interesting then? Just for tonight.”

You hum, rubbing your fingers on your chin as you feign contemplation. You wait until she’s let her guard down to strike, planting a kiss on the side of her snout.

“Hey!” she says, gently poking you in the ribs with a clawed finger before breaking into a giggling fit, pushing your face away to prevent you from going in for a second kiss. “Y-you can’t just-”

“I can’t just what?” you ask, interrupting her joking reprimand. “I vaguely remember a *certain* raptor not minding at all when I was stealing kisses yesterday.”

She buries her head in the crook of your arm, though you know her well enough to realize she’s just trying to hide her blushing, flustered expression away from your prying eyes. “T-that’s d-different and you know it.”

“So I’m not allowed to steal kisses from my little featherbutt now?” you say, sporting a mock pout as you hold her closer to you.

“Y-you can d-do that if you win,” she mutters, her face only now slightly peeking out from its resting place in your arm.

“What’s that?” you ask, grinning as you gently run your hand through her head feathers. You’d feel a slight pang of guilt for the teasing if you didn’t already know full well how much she enjoys it. “You’re going to have to speak up, cuddlebug.”

The slight blush shining through her dark scales only deepens at your words, though you can tell she’s doing her best to keep eye contact with you as she speaks. “If you… beat me, then I’ll do anything you want. If I win then y-you have to do anything I want.”

You’ve never known her to be bold enough to make bets like that, even with you, so you ask something for clarification. “Anything, anything?”

She stays silent, though her near frantic nodding as she covers her embarrassment under a scaled hand is more than enough clarification for you. You find the embarrassment endearing in a way, though you’re not sure this is a bet you can win. “And what makes you so sure I’ll actually take that bet.”

She mulls it over for a bit, shifting against you as she once again readjusts in order to find the most comfortable position, finally speaking up once she does. “You only have to win once, but I have to win three rounds in a row.”

The odds are a bit closer in your favor on those terms, though you decide to propose something that’ll put the odds slightly further in your favor. “Alright, but you can’t play your main, deal?”

She grumbles for a bit, clearly not wanting to give up her main advantage on you. 

“You dirty cheeseball,” she groans and mutters, involuntarily letting out a bark as she continues to mull it over. “Fineeeee, I won’t play Van.”

She leans forward a bit to grab a handful of beef jerky straight from the bag, tossing a few strips into her toothy mouth before turning her attention to you. “Wan’ some?”

While you’ve always been careful to count calories and mind what you take in for fear of undoing your progress at the gym, you quickly decide having an enjoyable night with your girlfriend is far more important. “Yeah sure, pass it here,” you say, looking forward to treating yourself for a change.

“Nuh uh,” she laughs, shaking her head as she reaches a hand up near your lips. “Open up, loverboy.”

You laugh and decide to play along, opening your mouth to let her feed you the jerky. She reaches forward to place it in your mouth and you snap your jaw shut only to bite down on a whole lot of nothing. The only thing you can hear is the sound of giggling coming from the raptor huddled up against you. You decide to get your revenge on her in one of the only ways you know how. Carefully you wrap a hand around her side while she’s too busy laughing at her own joke and you wait for the perfect time to strike, digging your fingers into her side and tickling with all your might. Sheer surprise is apparent in her eyes and the giggling quickly grows louder and more uncontrolled as you continue, one of her clawed hands reaching down to try and stop you. But your attack doesn’t stop there, and you tilt your head down to surprise her with a kiss on her sensitive neck as she protests your sudden actions.

“Anon, please-” she says, the giggling now turning to loud laughter as you continue to plant kisses down the side of her neck and snout. “S-stooop…”

Her cool scales have always felt nice against your bare skin and the pleasant sensation is no different when kissing her. You can’t help but grin when you feel your kissing cause a slight shudder to run throughout her entire body. Satisfied with your efforts, you finally let up the assault. “Are you going to pass me the jerky now?”

She looks almost flushed when you finally let up, and you can see her nostrils flare as she recovers from her bout of intense laughter. She only flashes you a smile before saying, “S-shit, if you’re going to do that every time then I might never pass it again.”

She follows through on her promise and feeds you the jerky before reaching down to grab the two controllers, handing you one as she settles in to play. “So, are you ready to get smacked down, *again*?

“Just you wait,” you laugh, settling in and picking a character. “All the practice I’ve been doing is going to blow you away.”

“We’ll just see about that,” she says, a wide smirk on her face. She locks in the character you hate to play against the most and the wind is immediately knocked out of your sails. “I’m not only good at one character, remember?”

“Oh- come on,” you groan in protest, temptation to once again tease the raptor rising up within you as you see her choice of character. “It might as well be your main with how often you play them.”

“All I’m hearing is excuses Anon,” she smiles a toothy grin as she playfully pokes a finger to your chest. “I mean… if you just want to surrender to save your pride then now’s your chance.”

“Fat chance,” you say, sporting the most confident grin you can muster. “I think you’re just scared I might actually take a round off you, featherbutt. Move over some, it’s not a fair match if you’re just going to lay on my arm the entire time.”

“Spoilsport,” she mutters, sticking her tongue out at you before sitting up and settling in beside you, making sure to lean into you. “The more excuses you make the sweeter it’s going to be when I win.”

You’re trying your best to not show it but you’re actually looking forward to the possibility of winning. There’s something you’d been meaning to try with her, though with your work schedule being busy as it has been lately, you hadn’t gotten as much time to fool around with her as you would’ve liked. “You talk a really big game for someone in smooching distance, you know that?”

“S-shut up and play, you dork,” she says, playfully elbowing your side before leaning into you slightly. 

You can’t help but smile at her reaction, a slight blush shining from underneath her scaled cheeks. Even if it puts you at a slight disadvantage, you can live with her contentedly resting against you. You take pride in being able to fluster her as often and with as much effectiveness as you do.

The first round kicks off and you begin to realize just how much trouble your mouth has gotten you into. Even with the extensive amount of practice you’ve done in your spare time, she reads just about every combination of moves you even so much as think about doing. You briefly think about teasing her some more to gain a quick advantage on the raptor, though you quickly decide against it for fear you’ll never live it down.

“So, what happened to that big game you were talking, Anon?” she laughs, though it very nearly turns into a joyful trill. She puts a hand over her mouth as the sounds burst free from her, clearly embarrassed by the sudden outburst.

“What was that?” you ask, teasing her a bit for the noise even though it’s adorable enough to make your heart ache. “I think you’re taking this game too serious, featherbutt.”

It’s a dirty trick, but between her embarrassment and your relentless teasing, there’s no better opportunity to fire back with a combo of your own, draining your entire special bar in an attempt to bring her character down. She quickly recovers from her momentary bout of embarrassment, or at least long enough to block the majority of your super. Your plan of coming back from an absurdly low life total was in shambles with that move blocked. The only trick up your sleeve you have left is to let her wail on you just long enough for your super bar to refill. You’d picked your character with the intent of being able to come back from almost certain defeat. For every point of damage you’d taken throughout the round, the heal would become that much more powerful. When it’s down to the wire, you retreat to the very edge of the screen and pop the ability, recovering to almost half health in one well executed combo. Your girlfriend doesn’t seem too pleased about victory being snatched from her claws and you can hear the complaints start to fly when you finally start laying into her character.

“Oh, you fucking… absolute goddamn ball of cheese!” she says, bumping your arm slightly in a futile attempt to interrupt the combo that would finish the round.

“Hey, you never specified what fighters I could play,” you say, a smirk tugging at the corners of your mouth. “Billy is one hundred percent fair game if you’re going to pull out Wolff like you haven’t played him a thousand times online.”

“Just because Mhuchee is too scared of Billy mains filling up the forums with their tears, doesn’t mean his supers are anywhere close to being balanced,” she says, pouting as much as one can with a snout.

“Who’s making excuses now?” you chuckle, leaning over to quickly steal a kiss on the top of her snout. “If you’re as good at this game as you say you are then you should have no problems beating him, right?”

“Not if you don’t let me play my main,” she grumbles, near muttering the words under her breath. “Well, you won. What do you want me to do?”

As much as you feel like taking the easy victory just to tease her about it throughout the rest of the night, her pouty expression has you thinking about giving the poor raptor a second chance. Besides, it’d make your next victory that much sweeter.

“Tell you what, I’ll give you a second chance on one condition,” you say, and the girl next to you perks up at the prospect of going again.

Her excited expression quickly turns to a wary one the second you mention a condition. “I’m not against going again, but what’s the condition?”

It’s almost difficult to hold back your grin as the gears in your head slowly start to turn. “If you win then the bet is the same, but I’ll give you a second chance on the condition you sit on my lap while we play.”

She looks to you with an expression of disbelief. “Really? You have to be shittin’ me, Anon.”

Her expression falls away to reveal a toothy, almost mischievous grin. “You know, if you wanted that from the start, all you had to do was ask. No need to make a second bet or anything.”

You can feel your cheeks start to burn at her reading of your motives, and you can’t help but lightly rub at the back of your neck with a free hand. “Probably should’ve asked for something a little more out there, huh?”

“Not at all,” she says, tapping a scaled finger to your nose. “I think it’s sweet that you consider something like that worth betting on.”

If you thought you were embarrassed before, her sweet words of praise, practically honeyed with affection only made the blush that was surely showing on your cheeks burn that much brighter. “What can I say? I love my little featherbutt.”

Her toothy grin only grows wider, a renewed confidence seemingly surging through her upon hearing your little declaration of love. “Don’t think for even a second that I’m going to let you sweet talk me into another victory, loverboy.”

You can’t help but smile at a reaction so typical of her that you could’ve seen it coming a mile away. “Wouldn’t dream of it.”

Despite the new energy flowing through her, you can still make out the barest hint of a blush shining through her scales. “Love ya’ too, you dorky feather fucker.”

Your grin only widens at the mention of a nickname she’d given you early into your relationship. It was crazy to think about sometimes, but you’d been going at it strong for nearly a year now, and you’ve enjoyed every second of it. “Alright, though don’t complain when I beat you again.”

She leans into you once more, playfully nudging your side with an elbow. “Fat chance. That first loss was just because you caught me before my warmup. Now scoot over and make some room for me on your lap.”

You briefly let go of the controller and she gracefully scoots onto your lap, miraculously avoiding the tangle of limbs and feathers that seemed to be so common in your relationship. Once the raptor finally finds a comfortable spot to settle down into, you decide to start the match. As much as you would’ve liked that to be the case in the following round, she took the round decisively. Now that she knew what your strategy was from the get go, it was decidedly less effective than the time you’d caught her off guard. Though it’s not exactly clear if it’s intentional or not, you begin to suspect some foul play from your featherbutt. Every time you started to gain the upper hand on her, she’d feign needing to readjust herself, more or less grinding herself against your groin in small circles. It happened for just long enough to rouse Anon Jr’s attention, which in turn only served to distract you from the prize match at hand. While normally you’d be able to keep yourself in check, it’d been a long while since the two of you had found time to be… intimate. Your busy schedules didn’t make it easy to find time but when the stars aligned, the two of you found it difficult to stay off each other. Her smug, yet casual tone ringing out is enough to shake you out of your more primal thoughts.

“So how’d that Billy strat work out for you this time, dork?” she asks, the smugness and self assurance coming from her nearly palpable. “Doesn’t work so well when I play someone who can actually counter your bullshit, does it?”

You go to respond but once again you’re met with another set of wiggles from the raptor laying back against you, now craning her head upwards to meet your gaze. “Well? Are you going to say something or did the loss really leave you that speechless?”

The only sound that comes from you at first is something akin to a muffled grunt as you try and fail to suppress your arousal from her incessant teasing. Had it been up to you, you would’ve called the bet off right then and there and gone straight to planting kisses all over her nearly shining scales. But you knew her and yourself damn well, the two of you being far too prideful to leave the winner of a bit up in the air like that. You had to play on, but if she was going to be a tease, two could play at that game. “Don’t you worry your pretty little lead, I can play more than just Billy, you know.”

“I swear to god if you pull out another meta fighter like Lee or Mycles,” she groans, rolling her eyes at you. “I’m going to have to pull out my main to even have a chance to beat your button mashing.”

You feign a bit of ignorance as to how strong those fighters are and choose to poke at the confidence she’d had when you initially agreed to take the bet. “What happened to the featherbutt that said she was going to sweep me not thirty minutes ago? Don’t tell me you’re suddenly chickening out just because we’re tied now.”

“In your dreams, loverboy,” she says, lightly tickling your nose with a claw. “You wish I was nice enough after beating you once.”

“Easy to say when you’re not playing fair,” you mutter, though still loudly enough for her to hear.

The quickly widening grin plastered to her muzzle was enough to dispel any and all doubt you had about her grinding and wiggling being intentional. “Playing unfair? I’m not sure what exactly you mean, Anon.”

If she was going to play innocent you were more than willing to follow along and do the same. By this point Anon Jr. was at full mast and there was not a chance in hell she couldn’t feel it pressing against her ass. Teasing her right back, you tense your pelvic floor muscles so your dick presses even tighter against her jean shorts. You would’ve given a lot to see the expression on her face as she nearly jumps out of your lap at the act. Despite that, she quickly redoubles on her efforts to drive you mad, pressing down even more as the next round kicks off. You picked a different character this time in hopes that the changeup in strategy alone would be enough to take a round off her. However, despite a strong start you find yourself having no such luck as you quickly lose whatever semblance of an advantage you had against her when you eat a couple of well placed combos from her. She was a better player than you’d give her credit for, but she’d practically grown up on these kinds of games whereas you were mostly a casual player, though you could still play circles around your close friends. Her little practiced movements were starting to have quite the effect on your conversation as much as you hated to admit it. Your condition for playing another set of matches had backfired more than spectacularly, thought it wasn’t to say Anon Jr. wasn’t enjoying the newfound attention. Through the fog of arousal currently clouding your thoughts, two good ideas began to shine through. One of these was dependent on you actually winning the bet, so the other was geared towards allowing you to win said bet. She’d made it abundantly clear playing dirty wasn’t off the table, and you were going to take full advantage of that. This round was all but lost, but taking a second consecutive loss played perfectly into your plan, raising her hopes of winning hopefully causing her to drop her guard. Sure enough, the moment she secures the round she looks up to you with the most self assured, smug grin plastered on her muzzle.

You decide to feign worry about possibly losing the bet as to make her believe her victory is all but assured. “You knew what I was trying to do the second I picked T.J, didn’t you?”

She taps a finger to the bottom of her muzzle, her smugness barely contained. “You’re not the only person that’s tried to do that, Anon. Maybe if you weren’t such a meta slave, I wouldn’t see your strategies coming a mile away.”

“Don’t get so cocky yet, you still have to take the next round before you actually win, featherbutt,” you retort, using your free arm to hold the raptor closer to you. “I still have a few tricks up my sleeve, you know.”

“And here I thought you were just going to try and cheese me with Billy again, Anon,” she says, briefly settling into the crook of your arm. “Just full of surprises today, aren’t you?”

“Oh, so it’s only cheese when you lose to it, huh? I see how it is now,” you smile, playing the part in hopes everything would fall into place for your devilish little plan.

The two of you rest against each other for a little while, the close contact momentarily letting you forget that you’re presently still poking into her. She feeds a couple more strips of beef jerky before handing you the controller you’d set down on her lap. You hope she doesn’t notice this next bit as it’s instrumental to pulling your plan off; keeping your hands and controller resting on the front of her jean shorts. You pick a different character this time, one perfectly suited to what you were planning, Mills. A leather armor clad tank with a steel shield to complete the ensemble, he was perfect if you wanted to soak a lot of damage and still come out on top. 

The match starts as usual, and the moment you take a hit, you can’t help but grin, the controller responding in kind thanks to the built-in haptic feedback. But a single hit wasn’t nearly enough to generate the kind of vibration you’d need to get a reaction from the girl sitting in your lap. With the lead you currently have you think you could take the round normally, but this way would make victory all the sweeter. You drop your guard during a crucial moment, stealthily pressing the controller into her shorts a bit more as she picks up on your mistake. She capitalizes on what she thinks is a lapse in judgement, taking the opportunity to pepper your character with a series of punches and kicks that only serve to kickstart the rumbling from your controller. You can’t see her expression with the way you’re positioned, but you can tell the vibration is having some effect on her, her nostrils flaring as she huffs. She tries to wiggle away from the controller but the way your hands and arms rest on top and around her, she can do little to stop the teasing and continue to hit you at the same time. She takes a quick second to look behind her and you do your best to feign ignorance, hiding your grin as you focus on the match. You take that opportunity to whittle her character down some more, bringing her that much closer to defeat. Despite her initial reaction she doesn’t hesitate to punish you with another combo whenever you slip up, the controller working it’s magic once again, shattering her usual level of concentration. Not too long after an all too familiar sound rings out through all the fighting game noises coming from the TV. You can feel her shudder for a moment, letting out a muffled squawk that she clearly tried, but failed to suppress. You don’t hesitate for a moment to strike while she’s basically out of the game, unleashing the super you’d been holding onto for most of the match, finishing off the game decisively with an unblocked shield bash. Once she’s finally recovered from her losing battle with you controller she looks back to you, brow furrowed in slight annoyance, thought from the blush shining through it’s apparent that your plan had worked better than you could’ve ever hoped it would.

“You cheating little b-bastard,” she mutters, her voice seemingly still a bit shaken from the stimulation. “That… doesn’t count.”

“Cheating? I’m not sure what you mean,” you say, feigning the same ignorance she’d treated you to not fifteen minutes ago. “Why wouldn’t it count? I beat you fair and square with one of your favorite characters.”

“You had your controller pressed up against my crotch the whole round, you dick!” she says, taking your controller and setting it down beside her. “I’d like to see you try and play a fighting game while I’m playing with your dick, you ass.”

“I don’t know…” you grin, still pretending you don’t know what she was up to. “You seemed to be doing a pretty good job doing that the last two rounds. Just paying the favor forward, you know.”

“I- you… that doesn- you’re the one who asked me to sit on your lap, you fuckin’ dweeb!” she protests, clearly flustered by your calling out of her behavior. “That’s not even close to what you just did!”

“I asked you to sit on my lap because it’d be more comfortable for the both of us, featherbutt,” you say, still very much enjoying the exchange now that you’ve turned things on her. “That doesn’t mean I wanted a lapdance while playing the game.”

“B-but, you-” she huffs, her nostrils flaring a bit like they always do when she’s frustrated. “Fine, you win, Anon. I’m sorry for… you know, doing that to try and get an edge.”

You can tell her apology is genuine, but you can’t help but take the opportunity to take the teasing a tiny bit further, craning your head down slightly to whisper something into her ear, “Hey, I didn’t say it wasn’t hot.” 

If her blush could get any brighter she’d be the color of a ripe tomato, doing her best to cover her flustered expression with a free claw. “God, you’re embarrassing sometimes, you perv.”

Your grin could not possibly get any wider at how she’s reacting to your teasing. “Only because you made me this way, featherbutt. I accept your apology though.”

“Oh, fuck off,” she says, a smile now plastered to her muzzle. “You were this much of a dweeb even before we started dating.”

“Maybe a little, though you definitely didn’t help me stop being one,” you smile, reminiscing a bit on your first few dates. “You mind if I get up for a second? That soda went right through me.”

“Yeah, shit, sorry, forgot I was sitting in your lap,” she says, quickly shuffling off your lap onto the empty couch beside you.

“Somehow I doubt Anon Jr. was letting you forget that,” you chuckle, readjusting your sweatpants ever so slightly as you get up. 

“Ass,” she says, flicking her tongue out at you as you shuffle past towards the bathroom.

You take a quick detour into your shared bedroom to retrieve something you’d ordered a couple of weeks back, keeping it stashed away under a pile of clothing in the closet. You can’t help but grin a bit upon finding it, slipping it into your pocket before heading to the bathroom to do your business. Feeling refreshed, you take a deep breath to steady your nerves a bit, hoping she’ll like the surprise gift. While you’d vaguely discuss the topic with her every so often, actually taking a step towards making it happen was a different ballgame entirely. Hell, even you were inexperienced on the matter, but you were at least confident you could push her buttons in all of the right ways. You decide to head back to the living room before she wonders where you got off to, tapping your pocket just to make sure you hadn’t forgotten the gift. She’s cozied up against the armrest, seemingly content to just sit and relax in the spot you’d warmed up for her. Even though she was looking down at her phone, she immediately senses your presence in the room, looking up at you with a warm smile plastered on her muzzle. It’s enough to get the butterflies in your stomach fluttering, though you do your best to keep your cool as you settle down next to her on the couch. She quickly shifts from her side of the couch to lay on top of you, resting her head against the crook of your neck. The feathers tickle at the exposed skin of your neck, and for a brief moment you’re content with just getting lost in her sunset colored eyes. The contented chirps she makes are enough to make your heart ache on their own, though the kiss she quickly steals from you gets your heart racing that much more. You steal one right back and for a moment you’ve completely forgotten about the gift you still have yet to give her. While it pains you to interrupt a moment as tender as this one, you quickly make the decision to ask the question.

“Sorry, but I just remembered there was something I wanted to give you,” you say, almost nervous at the prospect of doing something as innocent as giving a gift. “I wanted it to be a surprise, would you mind closing your eyes?”

She looks a tiny bit skeptical at your awkward phrasing, but you can see the anticipation building in her movements. “Yeah sure I can, but a gift? You didn’t have to get me anything Anon, and our anniversary isn’t even for another month and I…”

You interrupt her near frantic speaking space by putting a finger to the front of her snout, and she looks to you with an unamused expression. “Don’t worry about the gift, featherbutt. I just felt like getting you something you’d been talking about for a while.”

Her curiosity is seemingly piqued at the words, and she seems to be almost lost in thought as to what it could be. Unsurprising, considering the lengths you’d undergone during Christmastime to keep her from guessing what her present was. Sometimes she was too much of a clever girl for her own good, though that wasn’t to say you didn’t love that about her.

“So, what is this gift?” she asks, running a clawed finger underneath your shirt collar. “Must be something nice if you’re going through all this trouble.”

“I guess you could say that, sure,” you grin, wanting to tease her a bit more. “You’re not going to get anything more out of me until you close your eyes.”

“You’re no fun sometimes,” she says, tapping your nose with a clawed finger. “I swear to god if you’re pranking me again I’m going to….”

“You’re going to what?” you ask, still grinning at the raptor resting against you, waiting on her to close her eyes before you proceed with your plan. 

“I’ll get my revenge somehow,” she says, sticking her tongue out at you before closing her eyes. “Besides, you haven’t even told me what you want me to do for the stupid bet we made.”

“I’ll tell you in a bit, don’t worry about it,” you say, making sure her eyes are fully closed.

You carefully reach your free hand down and into your pocket to retrieve the gift, being careful not to give away the surprise before you could slip it onto her. You wrap the leash a single time around your palm, putting the lead in your free hand. Carefully, you inch the lead towards the choker around her neck, using your thumb to open up the clasp on it. You then carefully slip it into place onto the ring jutting out from her choker. She seemingly notices the slight disturbance and you can see her eyes begin to open. Even though you were sure she’d react positively to the gift, you were still as nervous as you when the two of you first met. You just hoped she still found your idiocy endearing, especially when you see her start to realize there’s something amiss with her choker.

“Hey, what the-” she starts, seemingly upset before she looks at the leash wrapped around your palm, finally putting two and two together.

She doesn’t say anything for a bit, now staring back between the lead attached to her choker and the length of leather wrapped taut around your hand. You’re sweating bullets as she hasn’t said a word, but confirmation comes through in the way of a blush shining through her scaled cheeks. You let out the breath you’d been holding for what felt like the last minute, relieved at the positive reception.

“So… do you like it?” You smile, the grin on your face starting to widen in anticipation of what’s to come. “Don’t know if it’s the right type or color but I figured you’d like it regardless.”

“I, uh-” she says, making an involuntary noise that you can only liken to some sort of quack. “I-I don’t really know what to say, Anon.”

The wind is taken out of your sails a bit, but this was an outcome you’d been considering when you initially planned this out.

“Hey, look, don’t worry about it,” you say, reaching up toward her neck to take the lead off. “If it’s too much I can just take it back to the store or-

She reaches up, putting her hand over yours, stopping you in your tracks and causing you to redirect your attention to her. You can only meet her gaze, listening intently as she starts to speak again.

“No, d-don’t,” she says, blushing brighter than you’ve ever seen from her before. “I like it.”

You feel relief at her words though you’re not exactly how to proceed from here, never having delved into this kink of hers beyond talking about it in passing. While you wanted nothing more than to pull her into a kiss, you remembered an important detail, and that was to set up a safeword with her before you proceeded. After all, the two of you never having done something like this, you felt it was the responsible thing to do in case you stepped over her comfort zone. She seems to have had the same idea you did a few moments ago, craning her neck up to kiss you. As much as it pains you to do so, you stop her by putting a finger to her lips, and she looks to you with a puzzled expression.

“Sorry, featherbutt, just, uh… realized we forgot to do something first,” you say, bringing your finger off her lips. “Should’ve probably asked you about a safeword or something last time we talked about this stuff.”

“S-shit, you’re right,” she says, not quite to meet your gaze out of what feels like embarrassment. “How about… power?”

You can’t help but raise an eyebrow at the choice, though you’re certainly not complaining about the quickness with which she came up with it. “Power it is, then. Just say the word if I’m going too far or if I-”
She stops your near rambling tone with a quick kiss to the lips, and you’re content to hold the kiss until she finally pulls away from you, nearly out of breath. “Don’t worry about that, Anon. I trust you. I trust you more than I’ve ever trusted anyone before.”

You can’t help but smile at her kind words, your heart fluttering at the high praise. “Alright, I’m just… kind of afraid I’ll do it wrong or something.”

“Anon,” she states, trying to get more of your already undivided attention as your gazes lock. “Just have fun with it, it’s my first time doing… well, anything like this.”

“Mine too,” you nod, her words giving you the reassurance you need to continue. “Guess I’ll just….”

You want to say something else, but the words die in your throat once you realize it’s better to show rather than tell. Bringing your free hand up, you bring two fingers to the underside of her muzzle, and you can feel her shudder slightly at the sudden contact. With an awkward set of movements, you use your fingers to tilt her head up towards yours. You pinch your fingers to take a careful, yet firm grasp of her muzzle, pulling her back into another kiss. Your lips crash together, and you decide to take the initiative to be a bit more forceful than you’re accustomed to. Bodies pressing against one another as the two of you shift around, you’re careful to not allow her or yourself to fall off the sofa. You’re not quite certain if you’re doing things correctly but soon enough you find yourself on top of her, your tongue prodding against her sharp teeth as if seeking permission to explore further. French kissing was no easy ordeal with how easily her teeth could cut just about anything to ribbons, but the opposite arrangement was almost unfeasible with how lengthy her tongue is. Seconds later, she opens up, allowing your tongue to mingle with hers. Tongues interlocked and with the two of you quickly running out of breath, you finally decide to put the collar wrapped around your hand to good use. Wrapping the leash around your hand two more times, you give it a firm tug, pulling her upright as you do. You quickly feel proof that you’re doing an alright job, one of her free hands suddenly finding itself on the back of your head, tugging your hair slightly as she too, pulls you even deeper into the kiss. The lack of air has you feeling a bit lightheaded, but you persevere, feeling reinvigorated when a muted rumble reverberates from her. You’d shared more passionate moments with her than you could count, but this took the cake in terms of your shared enthusiasm. She’s the first to pull away for breath, a thin string of spittle connecting the two of you as you each pant for breath. Combined with her expression, you can feel Anon Jr. reviving from his all too brief slumber, a slight twitch serving to announce it’s presence to her.

“Well- that was….” she pauses, still clearly out of breath from the kissing.

“Good?” you ask, taking the opportunity to finish her thoughts as the two of you stare into each other’s eyes.

She rolls her eyes ever so slightly, now having recovered her breath. “I was going to say different, but yeah, a good different. Maybe you could try tug-”

You kind of guess where she’s going with her sentence and instead decide to take the initiative, taking the raptor underneath you by surprise. A quick tug on the collar takes her by surprise, your lips quickly finding themselves against hers as you lean into her, pressing her deeper into the cushions. All the while, you snake a free hand around her side, slowly gliding across her shirt until it’s cupping the bottom of her breasts. You can feel her squirm slightly once she feels your warm hand, her slight sensitivity in that area being something you normally loved taking advantage of in the bedroom. As you continue to kiss, you decide to shake things up a bit, tugging slightly on the collar until her head is craned up and off the couch, moving your other hand up a bit more as you do. You take a handful of the scaled, yet pliable flesh, not quite being able to engulf it all with a single hand. Squeezing firmly, but not enough to cause discomfort provokes a reaction from her you weren’t quite expecting. You didn’t even think she could reach that far down, feeling a clawed hand on both your ass and back in what feels like an instant. She pulls you against her, grinding her clothed body against yours once there’s barely enough distance between you two. The close contact and warmth of her groin against yours feels good, almost way too good. Having abstained from doing anything with her for nearly a week without taking care of yourself was definitely taking its toll, and quickly. You can’t help but let out a muffled grunt as she pulls you even closer. To let some of the pressure off yourself you decide to repay the favor in kind, redoubling your efforts to stimulate her by repeatedly running your thumb over her nipple, kneading her breast with even more urgency. You hoped the effort would have the effect of loosening her grip some and lo and behold, you can feel her hand slip almost entirely off your sweatpants. The muffled moan she lets out as you continue your slow, almost methodical kneading fills you with confidence that you’re doing an excellent job. Unfortunately, your lungs can only do so much, and once again you find yourself parting ways to catch your breath again. Her flushed expression combined with her heavy panting has you straining the already cramped fabric of your boxers.

“Like that?” you ask, a wide grin tugging at the corners of your mouth when you take in the effect you’d had on her.

“Haah… yeah, I-” she says, still panting slightly, a small smile on her muzzle. “Almost… exactly like what I had in mind, actually. Should’ve done this ages ago if I knew you were going to be like… that.”

As much as you would’ve liked to continue kissing her, you felt an odd sense of urgency with your manhood threatening to poke a hole straight through your sweatpants. You have a plan, but you’re not entirely sure about being able to pull off the execution. Figuring you might as well go for broke, you lean down to whisper something into her sensitive ear, but not before tugging on the collar once more, giving you free access to her scaled neck. You lean down even closer and trail kisses all the way from the nape of her neck to her ears. Being careful to not ruin the moment by not taking into the account her sensitive hearing, you whisper out something in the most seductive tone you can muster.

“I need you to do something for me now,” you say, hoping she’d understand the implication behind the suave, yet commanding tone.

She nods rapidly, and you can’t help but take a little bit of pride in having reduced the normally cocky, almost stoic raptor into a flustered, blushy mess.

You’re not sure if you’re being too gentle, but you slowly bring her off the couch by firmly tugging on the collar until she’s in a seated position. She seems to be happily awaiting your next order, her gaze occasionally straying from yours to appreciate the prominent bulge in your pants that you were making absolutely no effort to hide from her. The sudden flaring of her nostrils told you that even if she hadn’t already seen or felt it, she would’ve certainly picked up on your arousal by now. Her strong sense of smell had landed you in hot water when you first started dating Thera, having lost the battle to keep your libido in check when the two of you first got cuddly. It was something you admittedly had always wanted to turn on her, her comments about the clothing she ‘borrowed’ from you having given you certain… ideas from time to time. 

Your thoughts are quickly interrupted by her soft voice ringing out, “So, what do you want me to do now… handler?”

For a moment you’re not entirely sure you heard your girlfriend correctly, nearly double taking at the words. While you hadn’t known this was something you were into, her words alone were enough to make you throb against the inside of your sweats, and she clearly took notice of this, letting a small grin briefly break through. You take a deep breath as you contemplate what to say and do next, not wanting to ruin the mood by doing something dumb. You remain wordless, tugging on the collar towards the front of the couch, Thera quickly following along, moving exactly where you’re directing her. You keep giving firm tugs until she’s off the couch, standing directly in front of you. Both her clawed hands are in front of her jean shorts, overlapping each other as she diligently waits for your next move. The intense blush shining through her scaled cheeks is enough to tell you this is an embarrassing yet thrilling experience to her.

“Alright,” you say loudly, hoping to get her undivided attention before you speak again. “On your knees, raptor.”

You can’t help but cringe a bit at the words that just came out of your mouth, though clearly your girlfriend has no problem with it, though she’s seemingly waiting on something. Shit, right, you forgot to tug on the collar. Tugging firmly, she quickly drops down onto her knees in front of you and you open your legs just enough to accommodate her presence. A singular tug forward puts her at eye level with your groin, close enough to where even an errant twitch could have your clothed length make contact with her muzzle.You can see her nostrils flare, her eyes briefly shutting as she gets what you think is a whiff of your scent. The sight is enough to make you grunt, and soon enough you can feel one of her hands rubbing the inside of your clothed thigh. While it’s even close to direct stimulation, combined with the lusty expression she’s wearing, it’s got you wanting to hurry things along even more. She’s seemingly forgotten that you’re taking charge, getting daring and running a clawed finger slowly along your bulge. 

While some part of you would like nothing more than to let her take charge, you quickly realize that’s the exact opposite of what she wants you to do. You decide to see where she’s going with it, almost positive she’s planning on doing something. Using both hands, she reaches for the hem of your sweatpants, and you lift yourself off the couch to help the process of getting them off along. She once again runs a clawed finger delicately from the tip of your clothed bulge to the base, the speed at which she does it almost agonizing to bear. All the while she looks up to you, meeting your gaze as she licks her lower lip. While the teasing is certainly enjoyable, you’re not just going to let her forget who’s in charge here. With a grunt and a slight tug on the collar, you quickly send a message telling her to hurry things along. What happens next though, you would’ve never expected, not coming from someone as timid as her in the bedroom. In a single swift, yet seemingly calculated movement, she uses her claw to tear a gash straight down the middle of your boxers. The fabric no longer constraining it, your sizable and painfully erect manhood springs out at her, the raptor flinching back to avoid getting hit in the nose. You tug at the collar a bit to bring her muzzle close, the contrast between the cool air and her warm breath causing your dick to twitch. You can see her nostrils flare slightly in reaction, your tip beading with precum as she continues to indirectly stimulate you. As much as you wanted to let her continue her little game, you quickly decide some scolding is in order. In fact, there was something else you’d wanted to work into the roleplay, and what she just did was the perfect way to introduce it. You fish the item from your pocket, giving the collar a slight upwards tug as you hold it out in the air in front of her. Her gaze immediately locks onto the toy you’re dangling by the tips of your fingers. To anyone not well versed in the variety of sex toys available for this kind of play, it looked fairly unassuming, a hard, black piece of plastic that vaguely resembles the letter D. The humor isn’t lost on you considering it’s made to… well, facilitate your giving of the D. Thera however, knows exactly what you’re holding in your hand, considering she’d been the one to teach you what a ring gag was weeks ago, having shown you some material of one in action. It hadn’t been cheap to find a material that would be able to hold up to her sharp teeth and impressive bite force, but you could find nearly anything on the internet with some effort.

“You know what this is?” you ask, dangling the gag right in front of her eyes.

She’s seemingly content to continue playing innocent, shaking her head no despite the flare of her nostrils as she continues to gaze intently at the toy. For someone who’d never done anything like this before she sure knew how to play the part. If anything, it was putting even more pressure to perform, struggling to come up with the words you wanted to say next. After some quick thinking back to things you’d said before, you finally come up with a solid followup to your question.

“This,” you state, putting emphasis on the word with a very slight tug to the collar. “Is for raptors who can’t be trusted not to misbehave with their handler.”

The emphasis you put on the word handler seemed to have it’s intended effect, as you can her thighs briefly shift, rubbing against one another. Her free hand still lingers around the front of her jean shorts, and you make a mental note to rectify that in a bit. You continue trying to come up with more things to say, really trying to hammer the handler angle she seemed to appreciate so much.

“You know what I do to raptors that insist on misbehaving?” you ask, craning your head downwards to be just above hers.

Once again she shakes her head no, the hand rubbing against your inner thigh slowly inching towards your groin. Even though the situation is arousing enough, the light, almost tickling sensation of her claws running against your exposed skin is more than enough to keep Anon Jr. at full attention as you continue to improvise.

“Sometimes, they keep pushing the limits and well….” you say, grasping the base of your dick with a free hand before giving it a slight jostle. “I’m forced to use my baton to get things back under control.”

You’d be lying if you said allowing those words to leave your mouth hadn’t hurt you on a spiritual level. It was the best thing you could come up with under the circumstances, though Thera seemingly found it humorous instead of mood killing, which you were grateful for. You decide to press on instead of letting it stop you once the raptor finishes struggling to stifle her laughter. Both of you finally getting back into character, you decide to continue, an idea popping into your head about how to continue.

“Oh, is punishment just a joke to you then?” you ask, giving the collar a firm tug forward until her muzzle is resting against one side of your length.

The contrast of cool scales and a few feathers against the smooth skin of your dick is enough to provoke another errant twitch, one you’re absolutely sure she felt against her face. You decide to up the ante, taking hold of your dick and resting it along the top of her snout, her nostrils now pressed tight against your sack. For a while she does nothing but allow it to happen, though you can faintly hear the sounds of denim rubbing against itself, enough to tell you you’re doing a good job.

“Don’t be shy now,” you say, the faint sounds of chirps and slight sniffing now filling an otherwise silent living room. “Best you get acquainted with the instrument that’ll be doing all the punishing.”

Another small tug to the collar is all it takes for her to become a more active participant in all this, groaning when you finally that all too familiar tongue lick alongside the bottom of your orbs. It’s been so long since you did anything you’d almost forgotten exactly how long, warm and silky her tongue is compared to her cool, bumpy scales. The sheer level of control she had with her tongue was nothing short of impressive, her tongue slowly dragging over every exposed inch of your sack it could reach, leaving them slick with her saliva. While it wasn’t direct stimulation, her tongue work was more than enough to satisfy, leaving your dick twitching, globs of precum drooling down onto the top of her muzzle. If that wasn’t enough, you could feel the licking intensify as she takes long drags of your scent straight from the source. You rest your free hand on the back of her head, pushing down ever so slightly as you gently rub the scales and feathers within the reach of your thumb and index finger. She seems to appreciate the care and affection despite her position, and the quickly intensifying movements of her tongue are proof enough of that. As much as you like what she’s doing, the dangerous combination of your abstinence from doing anything with her alongside her knowing exactly how to ‘attack’ you best, you’re not going to last much longer at this pace. But rather than just cut things short or have an anticlimactic finish, you decide to instead continue playing things up to delay your little death instead. Using your leash wrapped hand, you gently pull her head away from your crotch, taking some time to admire how exactly you’d affected the raptor. Her soft panting and the way her tongue sticks out from her slightly ajar mouth, the flare of her nostrils as she finally gets some fresh air, the way one of her hands has conveniently slipped partway into her shorts all come together to make for a truly arousing sight. If those things alone weren’t making it hard enough for you to calm yourself down, the lust drunk expression you could plainly see in her sunset colored eyes was the cherry on top.

Once you’re done drinking in the sights before you, you take the rubber ring gag back into your hand, your confidence at an all time high after seeing the state you left her in after pulling away.

“That’s enough familiarizing yourself for now,” you say, dangling the gag in front of her once more. “That was just a little taste of what I have in store for you.”

You can’t help but grin a bit at the unintentional wordplay, the dirty talk getting a bit less painful to say with each iteration. It was thrilling to take such a dominant position, and you’d be lying if you said it didn’t feel good, especially with someone so eagerly willing to take the opposite role.

“Keep that... thing away from me,” she hisses, baring the slightest hint of her sharp teeth as she does. “Come anywhere near me with that again and I’ll bite it off.”

You can’t help but cringe a bit at the thought, though you’re well aware she’s only playing her part up for your sake. At the very least, she’s given you an easy avenue with which to respond, grinning once the idea pops into your head.

A sharp tug of the collar brings her closer to the gag dangling above her and your grin only widens as you go to speak. “Funny you mention that, actually. That’s exactly what this little device was made to prevent.”

She feigns innocence, a confused expression spreading throughout her features. “W-what do you mean?”

“Don’t worry,” you laugh, playing into the little game of cat and mouse you have going. “Open your mouth wide and I’ll show you exactly what I mean.”

She doesn’t follow the order, intentionally, you suspect, so you decide to wrap the leash once more around your palm, giving it another firm tug after doing so. Still, she doesn’t budge, barely flinching at the tug of the leash. You decide to take things a bit further, using your wrapped hand to lift her muzzle slightly, forcing her to meet your gaze. Her stoic and expression of slight anger looks to be close to the real thing, but there was something you couldn’t explain about it that told you it wasn’t genuine.

You decide to bark the order out again, unwilling to back down to insubordination after getting to this point. “Open. Up.”

She jerks her muzzle away ever so slightly, but just enough to loosen your grip on her snout. You take hold of it once again, using your fingers to gently start to pry it open. The first thing you see as you pull and prod at the scaled flesh are her sharp, pearly teeth, very clearly belonging in the mouth of the predator submitting before you. You decide that you aren’t going to get your way like this, and you decide to sweeten the pot for her.

“If you’re to fight me the whole- ngh, way,” you say as she jerks away once more. “Then you’re not going to get the reward I know you love so much.”

Sure enough, her stoic demeanor starts to wear away, her mouth slowly opening to you as you press the flat of your thumb to it. She allows it passage, your digit quickly becoming acquainted with the warmth you’d felt on your groin not ten minutes ago. You press on, not satisfied until the entirety of your thumb comes to rest on her exceedingly long tongue, her ajar mouth giving you a pretty clear view to avoid bumping into those razor sharp teeth of hers. What she does next, you certainly weren’t expecting, and you can’t help but watch in an odd mix of awe and arousal as her tongue slowly comes to wrap itself around your intruding finger. You take it as a sign of things to come and even still, you continue to observe as she continues her near expert tongue work, merely using your thumb as a stand in for her coveted prize. After giving you what you could only call an impressive display of her talents, she slowly begins to pull away, leaving you with a saliva coated digit and a now painfully hard erection. She keeps her mouth open, and you use your free hand to keep her head steady as you move to put the ring gag in place. After a tiny bit of struggling, poking and prodding, you finally get the hard piece of rubber into place, very clearly keeping her snout propped open. Blowjobs had always been a point of contention and much care throughout the course of your relationship, always doing your best to satisfy your mutual oral fixations without any trips to the hospital in the process. Needless to say, you were excited at the prospect of taking some of that pressure off, allowing you both to just relax and get lost in whatever acts came to mind. Satisfied with the placement, you lean back into the couch a bit, tugging her forward using the leash so as to not let her forget you were calling the shots. She leans into it, allowing herself to be brought forward, her head and body now resting entirely between your legs. Using your free hand you take hold of your long since neglected manhood, giving it a set of slow, careful strokes meant to stoke her arousal further. As you go through the motions, you notice her arm moving ever so slightly and you quickly connect the dots. Thera was trying to get off while she thought you were distracted by the prospect of giving her a show. You weren’t going to allow for that to happen, at least, not by her own hand. Taking the matter into your own hands, you reach down with your wrapped hand to gently push her arm out of the way, leaning in all the while.

You can’t but grin down at the girl as you slowly wag your finger in front of her eyes. “Nuh uh. Misbehaving raptors aren’t allowed to do that.”

She looks to you with an almost desperate, lust filled expression as she slowly fishes her scaled hand from her jean shorts. You only got a faint glimpse of her fingers, but even you could see the slight sheen to them, instantly telling you exactly where they’d been. Still trapped in your loose grip, your dick twitched at the sight, longing for some much needed attention from her. Leash now almost entirely wrapped around your hand, you bring her forward, carefully aligning yourself with her open mouth. The radiating warmth is enough to make your length jump again, and you’re not entirely confident about how long you’ll last once the two of you actually get going. But that was a problem for future you, letting out a mix of a grunt and moan when you feel her warm, wet tongue make contact with the entire underside of your dick in an instant. Just resting it on her tongue has you dripping precum like a leaky faucet, your girlfriend&#039;s eyes glazing over even more once the taste hits her tongue. You’re not entirely sure if that’s what reinvigorated her, but you instinctively buck forward deeper into her muzzle when her tongue starts to wrap itself around your dick, the feeling akin to a velvet fist getting you off. As much as you’d like to relax into the sofa, you quickly decide to sit upright, putting both hands on her head as she gets into the groove. Slowly, you feed more and more into her muzzle, only stopping when your cockhead bumps into that rubber ring. Shifting her head using both hands, you carefully maneuver your length through the ring’s arc before continuing to push her head down. You were careful to not push her limits too far, never having done this before. However, she showed absolutely no signs of discomfort, seemingly content with wringing out your dick with her tongue. Her little muffled warbles, chirps and moans as she carefully tends to you only add to the warm, confined pleasure you’re feeling right now. So much so that you slowly start feeding your remaining inches into her muzzle. As a result of the ring gag propping her mouth open, your combined fluids start to pool and slowly drip from the sides of her muzzle. It’s almost unreasonably hot, and you decide to encourage and reward her behavior, the sloppy oral combined with her expression something you don’t ever want to stop experiencing.

“God, that’s- nmf, so fucking good,” you say, using your fingers to gently massage her sensitive scales as you press her head deeper into your groin. “I bet you’re- ngh, enjoying this, aren’t you?”

You continue to push her head down onto yourself, letting out another muffled moan once your length is entirely nestled in her snout. Her nostrils now press tight against your pubic bone, you quickly realize you should probably ease up a bit to let her catch her breath. Despite the lack of air, her tongue work doesn’t slow for even a second, even the slowest of licks aiding in sending you careening towards release. You contemplate pulling back once more to get your bearings but she seems to have other plans, knowing full well how close you are to release by your twitching combined with the noises that continue to slip from your mouth. Not only that, but you’re being stimulated on two fronts, the tip of her tongue now starting to lather your smooth sack as you hold her head in place, drawing back slowly before thrusting all the way back in. You’re amazed by how dextrous her tongue is, her tongue somehow managing to pull back the skin surrounding the tip without the aid of it’s tip. If you thought you were feeling good before, the pleasure you begin to feel as she focuses her efforts on your head could have you believing you’d died and gone to heaven. Her continued eye contact with you as she continues to masterfully work your length without any suction involved only helps add to the experience. You’re not sure how much longer you can last under the circumstances, and you’re grateful when you suddenly feel her tongue ease off your jewels, feeling it graze the underside of your dick as she pulls it back into her mouth. You continue your thrusting, slowly tightening your grip on her head as you do. That relief is short lived when you feel the long, thin tip of her tongue starts to worm it’s way underneath your foreskin, lingering around the head. You quickly realize she has no plans to make things easy on you, swirling her deft tongue around your head at what you can only call an agonizing pace. She slowly starts to pick up the pace with her swirling and you hold her head in place as you continue to climb towards an explosive peak. You figure you at least owe her the common courtesy of a warning given you’re not exactly giving her much choice.

“Fuck, Thera, I-” you say, berating yourself for letting her name slip in the roleplay. “I-I’m going to fuckin- mph, cum.”

You absolutely can’t take it any longer, letting yourself finally fall from the edge you’d been teetering on for the last hour. It feels as if your very soul is leaving your body, two weeks worth of frustration starting to leave your body. She’s seemingly taken by surprise as the first few thick, pearly ropes of seed splash against her tongue, some of it quickly dripping down the sides of her maw, lost to the floor below. Despite this, her tongue continues to wring you for everything you’re worth, cumming the hardest you have in months. An idea pops into your head as you continue to coat every available inch of space with fresh spunk. You continue to grunt as you ride out your orgasm, your dick spasming uncontrollably within it’s rubber confine as you continue to spill forth.

“Keep it- ngh, all in your mouth,” you say, rubbing gently at her scales as you keep her in place. “Don’t. Swallow.”

It was a lot to ask for considering the sheer volume you were putting out, but you could feel your orgasm start to wane, slowly loosening your grip on her muzzle as the power behind your ropes started to peter out. Gently extracting yourself from her maw, you notice your quickly softening dick is now absolutely drenched in a mix of your warm fluids. You quickly realize you’ve left the poor girl holding a mouthful of your semen with standing orders to not swallow. The thought alone draws one more errant twitch you as you begin to tilt her snout upwards, the ring gag still in place.

“Open up,” you say, gently tapping your fingers against the underside of her muzzle so you can get a good look.

You can feel yourself start to harden again when you get a good look at the cloudy, alabaster pool now forming at the back of her throat. The mess you’d made of her certainly didn’t help the view be any less arousing, rivulets of fluids still dripping down the sides of her mouth, almost certainly making their way down to stain her top and jean shorts. You never thought you’d find the idea of ‘staining’ her with your seed as appealing as you’re finding it right now, but here you are.

“You like your reward, girl?” you say, and you can’t help but to immediately recoil slightly at your words, not very experienced with this vein of dirty talk. “Now swallow it.”

You reach forward and dislodge the ring gag from her mouth, making sure to have your hand clear of her teeth before she clamps down. She closes her mouth, and you can briefly see a slight lump in her throat as she makes an audible swallowing noise. While you certainly believe she swallowed it all, you can’t help but play into her kink a bit more.

“Open up,” you say, tapping on the underside of her muzzle once more. “Show me you swallowed it all, I don’t want you wasting any more of it.”

“Right away... handler,” she nods, her words coming staggered as she starts to catch her breath again.

She tilts her head up and opens as wide as she possibly can, not a single trace of your cum left. She’d done an excellent job, especially at playing the part, which you figure deserves some words of praise.

“Good job,” you say, and you can feel her lean into your hand as you continue gently rubbing at her scales. “See how nice things can be when you listen to your handler?”

Some part of you is starting to believe it’s never going to be any easier to say this stuff, so you might as well let loose and have some fun with it. After all, it doesn’t seem like your girlfriend has any problem with it short of the laughter earlier, so at the very least you don’t seem to be saying anything that’s making the experience actively worse for her.
“Yeah…” she says, slowly nodding in agreement. “So what now… handler?”

Admittedly you didn’t think this far ahead when you’d planned this whole thing but even you could see things had heated up. Moving things to your bedroom seemed like the reasonable thing to do, but you weren’t exactly sure how to go about doing that. You looked down at the waiting raptor, now being able to get a better look at just how much of a mess you’d made of her clothes, darkened spots signifying all the places your combined fluids had dripped down onto. Not that you minded, but the blowjob had been sloppy, leaving your groin in a similar state of disaster. A cloudy mix of her saliva and your cum dripped down your half hard shaft, slowly coming to pool at the base of your dick. The sight was beyond arousing, and a devilish idea was slowly beginning to take root as you took it all in. Despite how lost you were in your thoughts, her gaze was still locked onto you as she waited for you to give her some kind of direction. You give a small tug on her collar for effect when you finally figure out what you’re going to say.

“We’re going to take this to the… testing chamber before we continue,” you say, quickly coming up with a different way to refer to your bedroom. “But first… I need you to clean me off. We’ll both be in a world of trouble if management finds out how my uniform got stained.”

You tug her forward with the collar to drive home your point, your dick slowly stiffening at the prospect of getting a tongue bath from the raptor kneeling before you. Your free hand quickly rises to the occasion, slowly moving to retake its resting place on the back of her head. Carefully, you slowly start maneuvering her head until her nose comes to rest dead center in your sac. You hold her there for a moment, Anon Jr. quickly reviving at the thought of her only being able to breathe in concentrated doses of your scent.



Not in a million years could you have imagined yourself being in this situation. It was pretty much everything you’d hoped it’d be when you first brought up the idea to Anon. The fact that he’d taken you completely by surprise with it made it all the better. Sure, the dirty talk and the roleplaying wasn’t perfect but he was doing a damn good job of setting your loins on fire with some of the stuff he’s said. It’d been hard to refrain from getting yourself off throughout all of this, and his comment about moving things to the bedroom had you anxious at the prospect of finally getting some release. Him telling you to clean the mess the two of you made off his cock certainly didn’t help lessen your arousal in the slightest. He tugs at the collar again and you can’t help but rub your thighs together, desperate for the slightest bit of stimulation. You can feel the dampness on your scales, your panties absolutely drenched in your sticky fluids. Some part of you hoped there wouldn’t be a visible stain on the outside of your jean shorts when you finally got off your knees, already blushing at the thought of him seeing just how worked up you are. You curse under your breath when you feel his hand on the back of your head again, a shudder running through your entire body as she starts rubbing your scales with the soft touch you love so much. While you’re doing your best to muffle any embarrassing noises, you can’t help but let out a chirp in surprise when he starts to slowly push your head towards his groin. As if it wasn’t bad enough already, the only thing you can smell as you start to approach is his cum mixing in with his already overpowering enough masculine scent. The sight of his messy, half hard length stiffening and extending out towards you combined with that has you nearly twitching for release, rubbing your thighs against one another out of desperation. It wasn’t entirely unexpected considering what he’d done before but he continues to push your head down, the light tugging on the collar nearly enough to make your head spin with desire. He continues doing this until your nose is firmly planted in his sack, something you’re not entirely used to him doing. That wasn’t to say you weren’t enjoying the little game he was playing, your thoughts growing cloudy as he practically forces you to take long drags of his scent. Not that you’d tell him, but it certainly wasn’t helping the fire raging down below by any means, leaning into the hand gently rubbing your scales as he continues to hold you in place. You quickly realize part of your tongue unconsciously slipped out of your muzzle, and you decide to take the opportunity to participate more actively in an effort to help move things along. The second your tongue makes contact with the underside of his balls, you can feel his length throb against the top of your muzzle, and you have to fight the urge to avoid going for a second round with him. Instead you focus on ‘cleaning’ every inch of the smooth skin you can reach with your long, thin tongue. Every groan, grunt or muffled moan he makes only serves to stoke your fire, unspoken confirmation and motivation to continue with what you’re doing.

&quot;That&#039;s enough polishing the equipment,&quot; he says, and you can&#039;t help but let out some air through your nostrils at his cheesy dirty talk. &quot;It should be clean enough for... testing purposes in the lab later.&quot;</textarea>
