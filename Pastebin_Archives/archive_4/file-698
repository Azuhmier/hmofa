immediately assumes it was you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;doesn&#039;t even give you a chance to react</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;punches you straight in the face, sending you tumbling backwards</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;both get dragged to the principle&#039;s office for fighting</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she explains herself first</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you tell the principle you were just punched out of nowhere and for no reason</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she realizes your voice is completely different from whoever it was that made the comment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her now misplaced anger allows her to maintain her composure, but inside she feels really bad</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;both of you get 3 days suspension</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her human dad arrives to pick her up before your parents can get you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;see her tearing up ever so slightly as she leaves</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your dad finally picks you up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;explain what happened in the car on the way home</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;luckily he&#039;s pissed at the school and the bunny now rather than you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;basically get 3 vacation days</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;next day while home alone the doorbell rings</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;go to answer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;see that it&#039;s the bunny</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her dad is standing behind her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;open door annoyed yet curious as to why they came here</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;invite them in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;sitting across from you in the living room she explains how she mistook you for someone else</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;says she felt really bad for it as soon as she realized it wasn&#039;t you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her slightly shaky voice and watery eyes let you know she&#039;s not lying</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;tell her that you forgive her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she was trying to do the right thing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;surprisingly her dad seems to be the most relieved by this</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;see them out, wishing them a good day as they get in their car</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;later tell your parents what happened</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;now dad is mostly just pissed at the school</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;finally get back to school</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;realize you have a class with the bunny girl</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;spend a little time chatting with her before class starts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;decide to talk more over lunch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;throughout the day your friends express their confusion at how the two of you seem to be getting along</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;they sort of accept it when you explain to them what the actual situation was</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;lunch time rolls around</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;get your food and head into the cafeteria</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;mosey around to give yourself time to find where she&#039;s sitting</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;doesn&#039;t take long thanks to her huge stature</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;notice she&#039;s sitting with some other bunny girls</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;they&#039;re also fucking giant</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;there&#039;s a white one, a brown one, and a gray one almost identical to the one who punched you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the only way you can tell the two apart besides their clothes is how one of them always looks like she&#039;s moments away from murder</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;sit down across from them and introduce yourself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;finally learn the one who punched you is named Megan</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Amanda is her identical twin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the brown one, seemingly most normal of the bunch, is named Lisa</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;and the white one, easily the most smug, is named Sally</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;spend time talking about yourselves over food</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Amanda tells you that Megan&#039;s expression is mostly just a tough-guy facade, much to her chagrin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;actually having a surprisingly fun time chatting with them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;eventually Sally chimes in with a comment about how you and Megan would make a great couple, jokingly calling you the &quot;two stone-faced lovers&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;apparently her sisters are allowed to get away with a ton more as, instead of getting pissed off, she just sits there, blushing slightly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you smugly retort with how that would be one hell of a &quot;how I met your mother&quot; story, eliciting an even more embarrassed blush from Megan</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;lunch is now just about over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;exchange numbers between you and the bunny sisters</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;end up talking to them frequently</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;surprisingly enough you talk to Megan almost every day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;eventually get to talking about more serious parts of your lives</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she tells you about how their mother died when they were just infants</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;luckily she understands when you don&#039;t have any good response to give to that, being much the same way herself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;tell her about how your parents divorced when you were young</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;nothing compared to losing her mother, but figured you may as well share</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your somber conversation ends when she has to go eat dinner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;meet up over a weekend just to hang out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;spend some time outdoors at a park before heading back to your house for lunch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the two of you fix something together since your parents are asleep</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;spend some more time talking over food</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;head into the living room to probably watch a movie after finishing up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;end up sitting on the couch just talking for a while</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;eventually you decide you want to ask her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;now is the perfect opportunity</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s just perusing random movies</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;then, you strike</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hey&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her ears perk up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You wanna go out?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she puts the remote down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;then punches you in the arm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;probably gonna leave a bruise</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;just as you&#039;re about to speak she wraps her arm around you and pulls you close to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she might as well be about to give you a noogie</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;when you try to look up at her face she pulls you down farther and leans her head back to make sure your vision of her face is completely obstructed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;then you get a very cheeky idea</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So I guess that&#039;s a no, then?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;to your surprise, she still doesn&#039;t speak</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;what you shouldn&#039;t have been surprised about is her using the arm that&#039;s wrapped around you to punch you in the other arm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;definitely gonna leave a bruise</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she then pulls you almost into a full on bear hug</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you&#039;re damn near sitting in her lap at this point</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she finally speaks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I oughtta punch you again.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What? Why?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;For not letting me ask you out.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you shoulda known</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it was rigged from the start</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You still wanna watch a movie?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Sure.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you two end up mostly just sitting there relaxing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you have an arm wrapped around her and she&#039;s got an arm wrapped around you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the movie is mostly just background noise, you may as well be sitting on the porch or on the bus</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;eventually you part ways and she goes back to her house</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;shortly after dinner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;get a text</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;3, actually</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;one from each of Megan&#039;s sisters</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;each basically just saying congratulations and asking how it went</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;give fairly vague answers since it still feels like a pretty intimate moment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;next day you get invited over to her house for dinner which they all helped their dad cook</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;spend most of dinner getting prodded and teased by Megan&#039;s sisters</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;mostly variations of them calling you a secret masochist, saying they knew all along, or saying they were impressed you did it before Megan did</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;surprisingly little from their dad though</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;not any of the stereotypical &quot;dad meeting his daughter&#039;s boyfriend&quot; stuff</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;just before you&#039;re all about done with dinner you ask him about the lack of that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;tells you that he has great trust in his daughters and that they&#039;ve had nothing but good things to say about you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;they all seem just slightly annoyed with him outing them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you feel very flattered and can&#039;t help but smile, something which elicits reactions from them as if they&#039;ve just seen a fairy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;next year</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;finally a senior</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;got a decent first truck from saving money</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;been taking it easy in school thanks to clearing out most required classes in the previous years</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;got an incredible girlfriend, though you&#039;re still jealous of how strong she is</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;getting ready to go pick her up for prom</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;going very early just to be absolutely safe should any obstacles come up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;in your tuxedo, dress shoes on, freshly shaven, just a bit of cologne, hair combed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;get in your truck that&#039;s almost contrasting of your attire to the point of parody</div></li><li class="li1"><div

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;someone makes fun of her for having a family pic in her locker
&gt;she turns around and immediately assumes it was you
&gt;doesn&#039;t even give you a chance to react
&gt;punches you straight in the face, sending you tumbling backwards
&gt;both get dragged to the principle&#039;s office for fighting
&gt;she explains herself first
&gt;you tell the principle you were just punched out of nowhere and for no reason
&gt;she realizes your voice is completely different from whoever it was that made the comment
&gt;her now misplaced anger allows her to maintain her composure, but inside she feels really bad
&gt;both of you get 3 days suspension
&gt;her human dad arrives to pick her up before your parents can get you
&gt;see her tearing up ever so slightly as she leaves
&gt;your dad finally picks you up
&gt;explain what happened in the car on the way home
&gt;luckily he&#039;s pissed at the school and the bunny now rather than you
&gt;basically get 3 vacation days
&gt;next day while home alone the doorbell rings
&gt;go to answer
&gt;see that it&#039;s the bunny
&gt;her dad is standing behind her
&gt;open door annoyed yet curious as to why they came here
&gt;invite them in
&gt;sitting across from you in the living room she explains how she mistook you for someone else
&gt;says she felt really bad for it as soon as she realized it wasn&#039;t you
&gt;her slightly shaky voice and watery eyes let you know she&#039;s not lying
&gt;tell her that you forgive her
&gt;she was trying to do the right thing
&gt;surprisingly her dad seems to be the most relieved by this
&gt;see them out, wishing them a good day as they get in their car
&gt;later tell your parents what happened
&gt;now dad is mostly just pissed at the school
&gt;finally get back to school
&gt;realize you have a class with the bunny girl
&gt;spend a little time chatting with her before class starts
&gt;decide to talk more over lunch
&gt;throughout the day your friends express their confusion at how the two of you seem to be getting along
&gt;they sort of accept it when you explain to them what the actual situation was
&gt;lunch time rolls around
&gt;get your food and head into the cafeteria
&gt;mosey around to give yourself time to find where she&#039;s sitting
&gt;doesn&#039;t take long thanks to her huge stature
&gt;notice she&#039;s sitting with some other bunny girls
&gt;they&#039;re also fucking giant
&gt;there&#039;s a white one, a brown one, and a gray one almost identical to the one who punched you
&gt;the only way you can tell the two apart besides their clothes is how one of them always looks like she&#039;s moments away from murder
&gt;sit down across from them and introduce yourself
&gt;finally learn the one who punched you is named Megan
&gt;Amanda is her identical twin
&gt;the brown one, seemingly most normal of the bunch, is named Lisa
&gt;and the white one, easily the most smug, is named Sally
&gt;spend time talking about yourselves over food
&gt;Amanda tells you that Megan&#039;s expression is mostly just a tough-guy facade, much to her chagrin
&gt;actually having a surprisingly fun time chatting with them
&gt;eventually Sally chimes in with a comment about how you and Megan would make a great couple, jokingly calling you the &quot;two stone-faced lovers&quot;
&gt;apparently her sisters are allowed to get away with a ton more as, instead of getting pissed off, she just sits there, blushing slightly
&gt;you smugly retort with how that would be one hell of a &quot;how I met your mother&quot; story, eliciting an even more embarrassed blush from Megan
&gt;lunch is now just about over
&gt;exchange numbers between you and the bunny sisters
&gt;end up talking to them frequently
&gt;surprisingly enough you talk to Megan almost every day
&gt;eventually get to talking about more serious parts of your lives
&gt;she tells you about how their mother died when they were just infants
&gt;luckily she understands when you don&#039;t have any good response to give to that, being much the same way herself
&gt;tell her about how your parents divorced when you were young
&gt;nothing compared to losing her mother, but figured you may as well share
&gt;your somber conversation ends when she has to go eat dinner
&gt;meet up over a weekend just to hang out
&gt;spend some time outdoors at a park before heading back to your house for lunch
&gt;the two of you fix something together since your parents are asleep
&gt;spend some more time talking over food
&gt;head into the living room to probably watch a movie after finishing up
&gt;end up sitting on the couch just talking for a while
&gt;eventually you decide you want to ask her
&gt;now is the perfect opportunity
&gt;she&#039;s just perusing random movies
&gt;then, you strike
&gt;&quot;Hey&quot;
&gt;her ears perk up
&gt;&quot;You wanna go out?&quot;
&gt;she puts the remote down
&gt;then punches you in the arm
&gt;probably gonna leave a bruise
&gt;just as you&#039;re about to speak she wraps her arm around you and pulls you close to her
&gt;she might as well be about to give you a noogie
&gt;when you try to look up at her face she pulls you down farther and leans her head back to make sure your vision of her face is completely obstructed
&gt;then you get a very cheeky idea
&gt;&quot;So I guess that&#039;s a no, then?&quot;
&gt;to your surprise, she still doesn&#039;t speak
&gt;what you shouldn&#039;t have been surprised about is her using the arm that&#039;s wrapped around you to punch you in the other arm
&gt;definitely gonna leave a bruise
&gt;she then pulls you almost into a full on bear hug
&gt;you&#039;re damn near sitting in her lap at this point
&gt;she finally speaks
&gt;&quot;I oughtta punch you again.&quot;
&gt;&quot;What? Why?&quot;
&gt;&quot;For not letting me ask you out.&quot;
&gt;you shoulda known
&gt;it was rigged from the start
&gt;&quot;You still wanna watch a movie?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sure.&quot;
&gt;you two end up mostly just sitting there relaxing
&gt;you have an arm wrapped around her and she&#039;s got an arm wrapped around you
&gt;the movie is mostly just background noise, you may as well be sitting on the porch or on the bus
&gt;eventually you part ways and she goes back to her house
&gt;shortly after dinner
&gt;get a text
&gt;3, actually
&gt;one from each of Megan&#039;s sisters
&gt;each basically just saying congratulations and asking how it went
&gt;give fairly vague answers since it still feels like a pretty intimate moment
&gt;next day you get invited over to her house for dinner which they all helped their dad cook
&gt;spend most of dinner getting prodded and teased by Megan&#039;s sisters
&gt;mostly variations of them calling you a secret masochist, saying they knew all along, or saying they were impressed you did it before Megan did
&gt;surprisingly little from their dad though
&gt;not any of the stereotypical &quot;dad meeting his daughter&#039;s boyfriend&quot; stuff
&gt;just before you&#039;re all about done with dinner you ask him about the lack of that
&gt;tells you that he has great trust in his daughters and that they&#039;ve had nothing but good things to say about you
&gt;they all seem just slightly annoyed with him outing them
&gt;you feel very flattered and can&#039;t help but smile, something which elicits reactions from them as if they&#039;ve just seen a fairy
&gt;next year
&gt;finally a senior
&gt;got a decent first truck from saving money
&gt;been taking it easy in school thanks to clearing out most required classes in the previous years
&gt;got an incredible girlfriend, though you&#039;re still jealous of how strong she is
&gt;getting ready to go pick her up for prom
&gt;going very early just to be absolutely safe should any obstacles come up
&gt;in your tuxedo, dress shoes on, freshly shaven, just a bit of cologne, hair combed
&gt;get in your truck that&#039;s almost contrasting of your attire to the point of parody
&gt;pull out of the driveway, waving to your parents
&gt;a few twists and turns later and you&#039;re heading down a fairly long two-lane straightaway to Megan&#039;s neighborhood
&gt;not quite dark yet but the Sun is close to the horizon
&gt;you see someone off to the side of the rode a ways ahead with their arm out
&gt;oh, it&#039;s a hitchhiker
&gt;you&#039;re surprised anyone still does that
&gt;slowly come to a stop next to them
&gt;realize it&#039;s actually a bunny woman
&gt;hopefully Megan doesn&#039;t think you were cheating on her
&gt;open the door and let her in
&gt;your truck tilts to the side as she crawls in
&gt;now that she&#039;s next to you you realize she&#039;s way bigger than you thought
&gt;she&#039;s actually a fucking giant
&gt;barely fits in your truck
&gt;definitely even bigger than Megan
&gt;you ask her where she&#039;s going
&gt;she simply responds by saying she&#039;ll get out when she needs to and that she won&#039;t be a bother
&gt;you usually didn&#039;t play music while driving for fear of getting distracted
&gt;this just made the ride feel unnecessarily tense now that there was someone else with you
&gt;neither of you spoke for the duration of the ride, though you were fine with this
&gt;eventually you got to the entrance to Megan&#039;s neighborhood and the bunny woman still hadn&#039;t left
&gt;at this point you told her you weren&#039;t able to take her any farther
&gt;swiftly and without saying anything she got out and went and stood by the side of the road
&gt;guess you were feeling uneasy for no reason
&gt;you turn into the neighborhood, slowly making your way down the street
&gt;you check your rear-view mirror and see her standing there, just waiting for another random car
&gt;you make your way through the twists and turns of the neighborhood towards Megan&#039;s house only to realize you&#039;ve hit a dead end, still not having reached her house
&gt;well, you&#039;re still early
&gt;you turn around and head for the entrance to the neighborhood to check the other half
&gt;you reach the street with the 5100s
&gt;see 5125, 27, 29, 31
&gt;just gotta keep going til you spot 5143
&gt;several houses down, right where the 40s should start, you see her
&gt;but not Megan, instead it&#039;s the bunny woman from earlier
&gt;you roll to a stop just in time to see her cross the street, straight towards 5143</textarea>
