(Human male/female white tail deer)</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">(Chapter 1)</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;be anon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;17 years old, excited as you can be. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The season just turned to autumn and now you are excited for your favorite season. Not because of the colors,Halloween,or the cool breezy air. No you are more excited about something else then those petty things other people like.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;During autumn and winter is the times you love the most. They created opportunists for you and other people like you. You are a hunter...well a novice hunter. Your grandfather got you into the sport when you were only twelve. He saw that you loved to watch him clean his guns and polish his knives. He asked you if you ever wanted to go hunter before. You answered him quickly saying that you would love to.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But by New York law states that you have to be 13 years of age to be legal to take the hunters safety course.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you took the course when you finally turned 13. When you went to take the course it was in the middle of September. You went to the building that read &quot;Pine Tree Rifle Club&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you have been here before a couple of times in the summer when your grandparents took you to their shooting league on Mondays. While their at that time you got to fire some of the guys your grandfather brought to compete with that being a .22 caliber Winchester.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once you got to the bench he adjusted the scope for you and everything all you had to do was aim and pull the trigger. Once you got the hang of the gun, the wind, the heat, and the humidity. You were a natural shooter, you got a perfect 250 score with 23x in the middle. You took the course with flying colors you were the top of the class even if being only 13. Other people who took it with you was jealous that they got out matched by a 13 year old. Fast forward 3 years and your grandfather tell you something.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Anon I have something to ask you.&quot; He said while lounging in his chair. &quot;On October 1st is when hunting season starts up. But only for bow hunting.&quot; Grandfather said with a look on his face that tells you he wants to do something.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Now I already had my silence and took the course. September 1st is when Pine tree is holding their bow safety course.&quot; He said while he picked up his tobacco chew from the can.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;after what he said you gave thought. You answered by saying yes and again taking a second safety course.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;once again you took the course it was almost identical to the first course but for bows. This time you weren&#039;t the youngest. But once again just like last time you did it with flying colors with a score of 98%.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you were finally ready for hunting after that. You monkeyed with your grandfathers bow and adjusted it to sight and weight.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">(Chapter 2)</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are in a truck going 42MPH on the way to the hunting area you’re grandfather had purchased a long time ago. He had a flat open field with a tree line and Oak, Birch, and Pine on the edge of camp. You’re grandfather had a couple of blinds set up for guns but not much for bow hunting. Today is October 1st the day of bow hunting season starts for New York for 4A.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You arrived at the campsite with giddy in your eyes. The excitement was thrilling to say the least. The time read 4:48 AM on your phone with the battery at 73% full. The air was crisp and cold on your face and fingers but it was nice feeling. You start to unpack your bow and start to get into gear with a bright orange camo suit. It was the best thing you have right now for warmth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you sling the bow to your side and tell your grandfather that you were going ahead of him. Your grandfather was 74 years old at the time and was sore from the bumpy car ride.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you start to walk towards your area to set up for the remaining hours of the day. You had a tree stand on a very large oak tree. The tree had a great view of a animal trail and a nesting area with a acorn tree nearby. It was the Ideal spot to see something.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you see the tree stand in view, your heart racing to go to it and wait for oncoming deer. The tree stand looked like it rusted over the time but you did not care about it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you start to climb the steps leading to the chair.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you make a mental check list to make sure nothing goes wrong. Safety harness check, bow check, flashlight check, arrows check, proper sitting check.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; everything looked like it was working.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sit their for hours not moving and keeping still. Many people see that as boring but you like to see it as wonderful. You get to see the birds chirping, squirrels coming out of their nests. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was amazing. You loved every second of it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the time on your phone read 9:27 Am with the battery at 4%. Damn maybe you should’ve not played some games for a hour.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hear a crunch of a branch in the distance from you. It’s go time you thought to yourself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you nock in a arrow onto your Compound bow. It felt like a eternity that you stayed in place hoping the animal would come your way.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It did. The animal was coming towards you and are ready for it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you start to see the outline of the deer coming. By the size of it, it seemed to be female.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">(Chapter 3)</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you stand up onto the platform breathing slowly a calmly but the adrenaline running through you is tell you to jump the shot. Each moment you take trying to look for the deer is another moment of rush you are taking from the thrill of the hunt.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can see the deer in the distance it is about 100 yards away from where you were.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;80…70…60…50…40 each 10 yards it takes from walking towards you is like a hit of a drug the feeling you have is blissful. This is your first deer ever and you were not going to let anything get in the way of it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;30…25…20…15</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can take the shot now that she is in full vision of you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you slowly draw the bow back into the anchor position, string to your cheek, the peep sight lined up perfectly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you get into stance. You move your front foot to the edge of the platform. That was your mistake.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hear the platform creaking.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can feel the screw in holder is coming loose from the tree.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;in a swift moment the platform is slanting downward towards the ground. You were a good 25 feet into the air.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hold onto the safety harness for dear life.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the platform gives up on supporting you and falls to the ground, crashing loudly onto the forest floor with your gear.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the safety harness catches you, But while catching you the strap goes under your neck and tightly constricts your neck hard.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you are having a hard time breathing now that you have no place to step.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you are trying to stay calm but the cut flow of oxygen is making it hard. You swing from the tree and into the air trying your best to gain some oxygen and not pass out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you struggle for about 4 minutes before you were so tired from doing it that you did not have enough strength to do so any more.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you just hanged there awaiting your final moments.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your vision is getting hazy, your arms feel weak, your whole body giving up on it’s self.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;while vision is still slowly clear, you see a big blob of light tan coming towards the tree.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you black out from not having enough oxygen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">(Chapter 4) </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can feel like you are floating in air. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the feelings of fear, panic, and anxiety seemed to fade away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you were in a black area. Their was no ground or at least you didn’t see one.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you felt warm. Like you were in a nice cozy bed with a fireplace nearby to keep you warm at night.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you start to see light in the distance. The light seemed like it was calling towards you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you start to float towards the light, But every time you try to go near it, the light seemed no closer than before.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;just then you felt like everything was going fast like you felt wind flying over you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you look back only to see nothing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;then you stopped floating, you were now falling. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you could see something under you. It looked like the ground, it was coming fast.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;before you could hit the ground you awoke to a sudden coldness on your face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”AHHHH” you screamed loudly feeling the sudden coldness that has bestowed upon your face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you look around your surroundings frantically.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it looked like a house but only it was round and more like a tent. The walls were made of hardened mud, the roof was made of dried grass bundled together with what looked like vines from a ivy plant.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; their was a small fire in a corner that had a chimney style over it to let the smoke out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you were sitting on a bed but it wasn’t a bed it was more like woven leaves together to form a base and 4 sturdy looking logs for posts. The blanket was made out of fur but more like coyote fur than a traditional deer pelt.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;who ever brought you here knew how to do this and was smart enough to make such things from the materials.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you were pretty amazed by it all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">(Chapter 5) </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hear a door swing open slightly from the left side of the room, you turn to see that the door is closed.&quot; Ah I must of scared the person away...&quot;you said softly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;“huh there must be more rooms than this one.” You thought to yourself still laying on the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hear humming, it sounded like let it snow? God you haven’t heard that song since last Christmas, who is singing it in the middle of November?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you start to get up from the bed but soon find it hard to even sit up straight. What the hell? Why can’t you sit up? What happened?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;oh yea I forgot I fell out of my tree stand and almost hung myself…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you’re back is killing you, it hurts to even rotate yourself to face the door. Was I on painkillers before?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you didn’t know but you were glad someone put painkillers in you somehow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can still hear the humming come from the other room, but now listening closely to it, it sounds like a female humming the yule tide tune.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That gave you a nervous and relieved feeling. You being taken care of a female but also the feeling of a stranger carried me off from my spot and put me in their home which looked more of a /diy/ and /out/ homeless man had a baby. I’d bet they would be proud.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The humming seemed to get louder and footsteps Started to come your way. You quickly roll over but you pull it through the pain and managing to not yell in pain.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you pretend to be asleep in the makeshift bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you hear the door open and hear clacking of something coming from the direction.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you stayed perfectly still but breathing slowly to keep up the idea of sleeping to the mysterious person. You hear it set something down next to you with the object making a noise. You start to be hit with a aroma of grassy hot vegetables if you had to guess.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The figure walks away from you and you hear the door close with a creaky sound.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you turn over to see a clay bowl and a wooden spoon crudely made out of oak.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Damn she must have a strong knife and patience to make that spoon.” Thinking about it you also notice the clay bowl had marks in it that looks like hooves on it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you couldn’t tell the animal by the shape of it due to the liquid in the bowl filled to the brim but on the outside it looked smoother on the outside than the inside on the little bit you can see.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;man you could kill for crackers with the soup. Oyster crackers would be best.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;speaking of soup, the soup looks like it has sliced Carrots, chopped Onion, some type of mushroom, and a scallions. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”bleh” you say with a disgusted look on your face, but it is food and you were pretty starving to say the least…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you pick up the wooden spoon and slowly bring the tool to the soup carefully dipping in and bringing the spoon carefully to your mouth.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;slurping up the liquid it hit you like a ton of bricks. It tasted sweet but notice it had no sort of broth more like flavored water with V8 with it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but food is food so you ate all of it up except the carrots and onions.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Ah! I see that you are finally away” a voice called out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">(Chapter 6) </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you turn your head around slowly to come face to face to the thing that gave you shelter and a warm meal.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;all you saw first was the feet of the person. The feet was covered around with dirty cloth with a string to tie around the ankle. Wow that didn’t help.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;next you look up slightly above the feet to find very wide and strong looking pair of legs but as you keep looking at the legs, they seem to have a pair of pants with realistic dirty muddied amber fur. The more you look at it the more of a feeling of unease washes over you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;” Hey! Are you going to keep staring at my legs Mr. hunter?” The voice said softly with a hint of embarrassment tone in the voice. Speaking if the voice it sounded a lot like a voice you once heard on a cartoon when you were younger, You think the show was named animainiacs but sounded a lot like the deer and a episode. It sounded also tomboyish and gave off a sound of a farmers daughters voice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; “I-I’m sorry miss…” you say while now looking down on the crudely made bowl. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You glance up to see the person face…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The face of the tomboyish outdoors women looked odd. It had a mask over her face that looked very realistic to that of a deer’s head. The eyes looked like they had a alive look similar to that of a taxidermist look to a trophy on a wall. The ears looked like they were moving but you could not tell by the way of the poorly dim lit room you were in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you are faced to Faced with your rescuer. “T-thank you for saving me…” you try to say to the girl but you said it very softly almost as a light wispier towards her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You are very welcome hunter. I’m glad I saw you in the distance or else you would of hanged yourself.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the thing spoke but not as if someone wore a mask and talked but was crystal clear and the mouth on the mask moved as well.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the mask spoke, you must be dreaming. This should be a dream. This has to be a dream. There is no way a talking deer should exist.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">(Chapter 7) </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were dumbfounded by the way that the animal spoke. How could you believe that this was a real deer walking on two legs and speaking English? This seems practically impossible of what you known in all your life! </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait maybe it is a mask! It must be one of those masks you find in the Halloween store that move as you talk. That must be it! </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You started to move out of the bed, swinging your legs around the edge and onto the cold grass-less dirt floor as the autumn cool air breezed over your bare feet. You cautiously moved towards the thing taking step by step as if you were a newborn baby making his first steps towards their parents. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your hands ever so slightly moving towards the things head. You can see that your hands are shaking, as you move your hands to her head, she spoke. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Um excuse me boy, but what the hell you doing there?&quot; She spoke again in that tomboyish farmer accent with the mouth moving her ears twitching slightly. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you didn’t answer her all you wanted was to know if this was really a mask. As you first made contact to the things head, the fur on the mask felt like it was made with synthetic fur but mixed with earthly dirt. As you started to pull upwards on the head, it gave great resistance. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;OW, What the hell is that for, you fucking prick!&quot; The women talked with anger in her tone and the intent to hurt. With that confirming it, this was no mask but a living talking deer! </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you fell backwards as her hoof launched you backwards. The blow knocked the wind out of you as you fell onto the bed. The bed frame gave out and smashed onto the cold hard ground. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Great now you broke the bed! I knew I should have left you to die you fucking soft skin!&quot; She now said with the intent to kill as she lunged after you onto the bed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as you were regaining your breath you struggled to move out of the way as she lunged at you. She was extremely heavy must of weighed over 200 pounds! She struggled as you struggled to maintain strength as she seemed to out of breath. You pushed her off of you and stood onto your feet while she was still now destroyed bed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you stood straight, facing the now out of breath deer. She moved sluggishly trying to get off the bed. But ended up falling onto the harsh bitter ground. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you were confused on why she just slumped to the ground. You knew by her body type she could have easily overpowered you and killed you but why was she like this? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you moved very cautiously towards to the motionless deer. She was lying on her stomach her back towards you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;something warm and wet started to touch your right foot. You looked down and saw that a dark red stream of blood was coming from the deer and onto your foot. It looked like she was hurt while you two were fighting but you don’t remember her ever getting stabbed or injured all you did was have her tackle you and you pushed her off to the side of you and then you got onto your feet. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You thought to yourself &quot;you can leave this animal here and let it die and never speak of this again, OR you could repay back the deer for the shelter and saving your life.&quot; You thought this over for 3 minutes. Fuck. She tried to kill you but you did owe her your life, so now you got to save her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with that thinking you struggled to lift her up off of the ground. You grabbed her arms and legs and cattle style hoisted her onto the bed. She was bleeding. A lot. You walked around the small area and searched for water to clean the area. But all you could find was your backpack a pale and some bowls around the place. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;with your backpack at least you knew that water bottles would be in there.There is a full bottle and another half empty water bottle in your backpack. With that much you should be able to clean the wound. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You head back over to where the unconscious deer is currently resting. You open the half empty water bottle and pour it over the area with the most blood. The animals body winces in pain as you pour it over the wound. Now you can see the wound better. It looked like something clawed her left outer thigh and a bullet wound in the lower chest cavity where a bullet entry or exit hole is, but by guessing from the other side it is more of a bullet entry.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You go back to your backpack and look inside for your EDC (Every Day Carry) handbag where a small first aid kit should be. You find the handbag in the front pouch and open it up to see where the first aid kit should be. You grab the kit and rummage through the contents of it, where you find a curved sewing needle and some homemade sinew string you made a while back. You head back over to the deer and prepare the area with the rest of the half empty water bottle onto the wounds. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once again she winces in pain but still seems to be unconscious. You take Your shirt and wipe off any blood that remain from the area. Too bad you don’t have a razor to make this a hell of a lot easier on you and on her, but this will have to do. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you bring the curved needle to the bullet wound and slowly insert the curved needle and sinew into the skin and just outside of the wound itself. Thankfully you took home economics class in middle school and they taught you how to sow something all be it not on a living thing. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you keep going in and out of the area to close the wound you can tell her breathing is getting a bit heavier. With a final pull around the zig zag pattern you close the wound tight. With that the wound is closed and safely tight. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now to do something around the clawed area is tricky. You would have to use a full bottle of water on it and then sew together the smaller clawed parts and then have to wrap it in gauze and a lot of cloth to make it so that she doesn’t try to pick at it and to keep the area clean from infections. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the one thing you thought about while fixing her was, did a pack of coyote&#039;s attack her and later escaped only to get shot? Or was it that another hunter was hunting with blood hounds and the hounds picked her scent and tried to wound her while their master shot her. Even then how did she escape? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sewed her smaller clawed areas and gauze and bandaged her up where they should not cause any problems for her later when she wakes up. You couldn’t try to get the bullet inside her cause then you would have a bigger mess on your hands and it would mean that she would be dead a lot quicker and she already lost quite a lot of blood while on the floor and while you were cleaning the areas. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh well, by the look of outside it seems to be night you might as well sleep too since you are pretty exhausted yourself. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you lied down on the ground with your bag leaning on the bed and you covering yourself with your jacket you found while searching the den. Well as you drifted off into a slumber you could hear a faint coyote call in the distance</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">(Chapter 8) </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you awoke to the sound of moans, judging by the brisk orange citrus color in the little hole in the side of the hut, it seems to be early dawn or just beginning to be dusk. How long were you out? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you groggily stand up and look over to the where the moans are coming from. It seems the thing left the bed while you were sleeping, where the thing laid, a huge blood stain is left where her leg has been. I guess she opened her wound. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you look over to the door and start to quietly walk towards it as if you were a robber in a heavily armed bank. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you take a peek into the area, it seems that now with some light in the room it looked like an old style nuclear bomb shelter minus the whole metal walls and no light, only the design remains the same, where you were staying it looked like an addon to the area you are seeing. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You see there is cabinets made out of hardened clay. The room is bare expect for the clay cabinets and what looks like an old broken pop up table you would take for family events with one area cracked and a corner broken off. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you walk into the room hoping to find the deer before she opened her wounds any more. You follow the sounds of moans coming from a wooden door that looks like it was thrown off the hinges and just placed there as a makeshift door. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you knock on the &#039;door&#039; and the thing goes forward onto the ground. Well it looked like it was just standing, not really on support or anything. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you look inside and see the deer on the floor tears in her eyes with blood dripping from her leg. The awkward moment staring at each other was brisk and quick. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She throws a crudely made wooden spoon at you. It smacks you right in the face. She then throws another wooden spoon at you and starts speaking, saying to &quot;Get out of here!&quot; And &quot;leave me alone!&quot; In her accent. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you walk out of the area and put back the door that was in there and place it so it would not fall again. You sit on the ground outside of the door. Since you propped the door on the wall you can see a little of what is inside of the room. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you start to speak in a soft but friendly tone. &quot;Um hey I saw you had some wounds yesterday, and I wanted to repay you for you know... saving my life. So, I took some medicine from my bag and applied it to your wounds, but since you reopening the cuts I&#039;m going have to take a look at them and fix them again so they won&#039;t get infected.&quot; All you could hear was radio silence from her end.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It seemed she didn’t want to talk. &quot;look if you know how to do it I can give you the supplies.&quot; With what you said she seemed to respond or at least made a sound to confirm she could do it, all you could heard was a &quot;humph&quot;. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you go to the other room where your bag was left and grabbed the first aid kit and other items, you then went back to the ajar door and slowly placed the items through the hole. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you could hear that she was moving, that’s a good sign then at least she could then patch herself up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it took all of 27 minutes or longer, you didn’t know you never carried a watch with you that she started to speak. &quot;hey listen... thank you for trying to patch up my wounds last night...&quot; With her accent she sounded like she was a punished farm boy that did something bad and was forced to say it by the father. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;look I&#039;m sorry for touching you and pull your head, I never seen this before and I was kind of delusional and thought you were only wearing a mask. I never seen a talking deer before.&quot; You said at her while trying to sound sincere but it sounded more like a excuse than a apology.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">(chapter 9) </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1"> &gt;after the apology all you two did was sit their hoping one would talk first but it seemed like no one wanted to talk about anything. It took a good 30 minutes before anyone said anything, you were the first one to talk. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So miss, where did you come from?&quot; Was all you could think of at that moment. She didn’t respond until a couple of minutes later. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I was born England, from a country called Berkshire. My father lives there and he sent me here because he didn’t want anyone to find me and he honestly, he lived a quiet life before I came along.&quot; Her voice sorrows. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;honestly you thought she wasn’t going to talk opening about it and you originally thought she came from a lab that experimented on animals to create hybrids or war animals but her coming from somewhere normal like England. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well my name is Anon, I was hunting in the woods in my tree stand until it collapsed and my safety harness which I guess didn’t put on correctly hanged myself.&quot; You sighed. &quot;If you want me to leave I will pack up my stuff or what&#039;s left of my stuff and head on my way to a near town to get to a store or something.&quot; Saying that you start to get off of the ground and start grab your pack. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;all you could hear as if it were a little mouse quietly sneaking in the night. &quot;Please don’t leave.&quot; Was heard just beyond the door. &quot;You are the first soft skin that hasn’t tried to kill me or try to harm me in anyway, please don’t leave yet.&quot;  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you were confused on why she wants you to stay other than you being nice to her and not killing her the first chance you got, but she did try to kill you when you got to close to her, you guess she is very defensive about her and not getting harmed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your stomach roared as if it were a lion, you haven&#039;t eaten since yesterday and you were hungry to say the least. You heard a giggle beyond the door and then another roar of a stomach but this time it wasn’t yours, by your guess it was her stomach this time. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;looks like we both need to eat&quot; said the voice beyond the door. You were getting hungry and couldn’t really lie about it as though your stomach already announced it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you were feeling a bit scared, not because you are talking to a talking deer but instead of that, you were getting scared of it having other motives than just what it implied. It was like talking to an old best friend you haven&#039;t seen in a while, but you couldn’t shake the feeling of something sinister at hand here. Like why was she acting so friendly to you? And why were you acting so friendly to her?! It just didn’t make sense to your brain. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I know a river we could go to get a drink of water and food.&quot; You heard as the door was being adjusted just behind your back. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;sure I&#039;ll go...&quot; Was all you could mutter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">(Chapter 10) </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you arrive at the river, not even 5 minutes went by. All you two did was walk peacefully but with her, you don’t even know her name yet, but you two acts very friendly towards each other.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it is a bit weird to be so friendly that seems like an it should be put into a fairy tale or something you would find in some myth&#039;s. Something like this just seems like a dream. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the river water looks clear but muddy at the same time like if you put flavor powder to make water taste fruitier in a sense but not as colorful. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I know I&#039;m being very friendly to you anon. But I haven&#039;t talked to anyone in such a long time it&#039;s been very lonely here in the woods. I wish my sisters were around though they loved Pa and everything in the forest.&quot; The deer women said while taking a small clay bowl and bringing it down to the water and dipping it in while the water elegantly fills the bowl. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Could you tell me your name Miss? I&#039;ve been wondering that since I told you mine but you still haven&#039;t told me yours yet. You questioned the strange deer with such a simple question even a toddler could answer. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;yes I can. My name is Fia, my father doesn’t really have time to name so many of his children so he names us what we are. For me it is Fia.&quot; The women said while taking a drink from the bowl. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;what do you mean &#039;many children&#039;?&quot; You said perplexed on how many children he had just to name them what they are? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;let&#039;s see he has me, he has Iasc, Iora, béar, and Luch and around as many animals there is in Berkshire and around Berkshire.&quot; Fia said still drinking from the bowl. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;holy shit, what is he a god?&quot; You asked the deer. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Sorta, he is a ghost who lives in the Windsor Forest and Great park. My uncle is Cernunnos so he gave father the ability to reproduce but not with you soft skins like you. Uncle isn&#039;t fond of soft skins. He gave Pa exception since in his eyes he did nothing wrong but he never told me what he did and I don’t plan on knowing either.&quot; Fia said staring in the forest with a blank expression while watching the birds chirp away in the forest, it felt like the forest was alive with how the birds and other animals roamed around the forest as if they don’t see you as a threat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">(Chapter 11) </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1"> &gt;after finishing drinking from the water Fia wandered aimlessly around the riverbed. For about 5 minutes or so she just walked up and down the riverbed to you seemed like for no reason, then she jumped into the river, splashing around was heard as you saw in the water the deer fighting something. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;as she was fighting something a glimmer in the water caught your eye, you walk towards the glimmer that was resting on the riverbed, the sun glossing the object. You bend over and pick up the object from the riverbed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was a bullet casing, it was a .223 casing the ones used for large game like deer and coyote. .223 was the one of the most common gun used in New York for hunting deer and other big game animals that you have seen used.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fia comes out of the water 2 minutes later with a big catfish the size of your forearm, it was huge compared to the ones you seen caught by locals. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Wow! That’s a huge catfish Fia.&quot; You speak amazed by her ability all the while hiding the bullet casing in your coat pocket. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yea, it is huge for a catfish. I caught it for you since you haven&#039;t eaten anything plus I don’t really know what you soft skins eat.&quot; Fia spoke with her ears waving in the air trying to get dry from the river. Fia walks over onto dry land and ties the slippery catfishes tail to a tree branch. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;um... shouldn’t we kill the catfish first so it doesn’t suffer? Just my thought since it is the most humane thing to do.&quot; You spoke taking a large rock from the riverbed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;This is always how I kill my fish, if I killed the fish now then it wouldn’t amuse me.&quot; Fia said with a hint of disappointment in her voice. &quot;but alright since you are going to eat the fish you can kill it, anyway I just use the fish for fertilizer for my garden.&quot; Fia grabs the fish and places it on a flat rock. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;walking towards to the fish you stand just in front of its face. Looming over the fish with the big rock as if you were a skyscraper to this fish. You swiftly smack the fish over the head with the rock killing it instantly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">(Chapter 12) </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Say Fia, how come you eat fish? Isn&#039;t fish and meat extremely bad for deer like you.&quot; You asked taking out a filet knife from your bag and slowly fillet the fish into the parts for consumption and non-edible parts like the tail bones gills and organs. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Normal deer yes to a limit, you see deer can eat fish fine but would get sick later on, I&#039;ve seen other deer around here eat meat like when soft skins wearing white garments put up bat nets, planning on releasing the bats but the deer around the area came across a lone bird that got caught in the net and ate it alive, it was gruesome.&quot; Fia said all the while staring at you filleting the fish with an intense look and hunger in the eyes as if she hadn&#039;t eaten anything in a while. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take out a penny stove out of your bag and a small metal grill that goes along with it. You poor the chemicals into the area and put the penny on top. A few flames flicker here and there, about 2 minutes later flames from holes finally come into play and all of the holes that are in the stove are now shooting out a healthy flame enough to good something on. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;grabbing the small grill, you place the grill over the area where the flames are. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fia looking amazed by the sudden flames coming out of the can, asking how you have done that without anything to strike against or to heat up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well Fia, the chemicals in this here water is called alcohol, the penny which is on the top makes the alcohol heat up and the stuff that is inside the can is tinder which is what makes the flames, or something like that, I never really understood the entire thing only really know what makes it do that and how to make it.&quot; Saying that while taking the slices of catfish and putting them onto the grill, cooking them slowly and steadily making sure the fish does not burn or become inedible.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">(Chapter 13) </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a while the slices of fish become a golden-brown color with streaks of charred fish where the meat and the grilled met at. You could see Fia in the distance by the riverbed taking flat rocks and skipping the rocks across the water. Seeing what she was doing made you remember when you were a child and you used to skip the shale rocks with your twin sister at the lake house your father took you while he was working on the house for his client. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This only saddened you for a bit as you remember that it has been days or maybe weeks since you returned home, you hope that they are not too worried about you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe after today Fia would let you go back home or even show you the closest town or any houses nearby with a working phone, you doubt that she knows anyone, she said before that you are the first human that haven&#039;t tried to hurt or even kill her the second you see her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You call out to Fia by the riverbed that the food is cooked and ready to eat, this only made her ears swivel around her head at first, then her body turned to your direction and starting to walk towards you with hop and a skip in her step. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It seemed she was eager to eat the fish. You would be too if you haven&#039;t eaten anything for a while, even now you are eager as well to eat the fish. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;It smells amazing anon!&quot; Fia says to you while crouching down to the little stove on the flat rock, her butt is wiggling with her tail in anticipation, you couldn&#039;t help but stare at her behind. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The growl of your stomach snaps you out of the hypnotized state. You grab a fork and a cutting knife out of your bag, cutting pieces from the fish you take a piece from the fish and put it in your mouth. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It tasted like soggy socks with salmon mixed in. Your grandfather always said to you that people either like the taste of catfish or hate it, reason being that catfish are scavengers and would pretty much eat anything off the bottom of riverbed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fia just sat at other side of the flat rock across from you, it seems she is waiting for something. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Fia what is the matter why are you not eating?&quot; You saying that with another small piece taken from the fish and stuffing the fish in your mouth. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well... I don’t have good grip on many things even with my hands my thumbs are just part hoof so grabbing things is hard for me if they are small.&quot; Fia looking down at her hands. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grab a piece of the fish with your fork and hand feed her the fish. This made Fia happy with a little yay from her and her chomping down on the fish from your fork. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fia chewed the fish thoroughly, with a gulp she spoke. &quot;Delicious, it tastes amazing, better than I have ever cooked one.&quot; Fia gleamed with joy. &quot;glad you enjoyed it Fia.&quot; You said to the joyed deer while giving her another piece of the fish. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Within a half hour the giant catfish was gone and both belly&#039;s full, but mostly Fia&#039;s. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well that was a good brunch but due to the sky it seems like it&#039;s around 2pm or 3pm just guessing, where should we go?&quot; You said to the deer women who was lying on a fallen tree that was rotting away. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The deer never answered you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hey over there you okay?&quot; You called out to the deer once again. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not a response. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get up from the ground and walk towards Fia. She is sound asleep with her hands under her head acting as a pillow. Guess she got sleepy after that food. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You notice her attire is mostly a crudely made loose leather bikini covering her stomach and her bottom half of her breasts like a low hanging crop top but the top of her breasts are exposed, guessing just from looks she has to be at least B cup maybe a C cup, her pants were that of old torn jeans, it doesn’t look like the rips were intentional guessing by the thread lining of the rips, her jeans look too tight on her curvy figure, her ass is just the right shape of that of a bubble butt but her hips bring out the most of her figure, her thighs were huge compared to the rest of her assets. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The rips on her jeans looked like an animal did the rips for most of it, there is some rips that have thorns and birdox on it. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fia stretches her arms outwards scaring you. &gt;you fall flat on your ass from the sudden movement from fia, is she waking up? Did she notice you checking her body out? </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get up from the ground and rush over to your backpack cleaning the area and acting as if you weren&#039;t checking her body out. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;5 minutes go by of you cleaning the area. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Another 5 minutes go by. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It seemed she wasn’t awake. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pick up the rest of the items around the area wash the tools in the river, eventually Fia woke up and came over to you asking what you were doing, you replied with washing your tools and other objects, to your surprised she asked you to show her how to use those tools and ways to craft some stuff from your bag. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You agreed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You told Fia that it was starting to get dark and getting colder, she understood and she told you to follow her for she knows the way from here to the hut.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">(Chapter 14) </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a short hike following Fia towards her hut, you could see the outline of the hut in the distance. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;” Hey I wanna ask you something” you say to the deer. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A simple Hmmm was the only response from the large deer ahead of you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”do you think I could stay another night? My family must be worried about me but I don’t want to go into the forest at night and my flashlight isn&#039;t working.” you asked the while looking around the forest.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fia stopped a few feet in front of the you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Sure, but I only got one bed in my hut. So, me and you gotta share a bed.” the deer said while stepping over a fallen hemlock tree. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With that said you and fia walk towards the hut without speaking to one another. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">Chapter 15) </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You enter the hut dark as it can be inside. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fia enters behind you, you can hear her rummaging through something behind you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A bright flash emits from behind you while a small glow of orange surrounds the room you two are you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look behind you to find that fia has struck a match and lit up a small oil lamp. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;” Let there be light!” you say to fia. Fia looks at you with a confused face. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Guess she didn’t find that amusing.  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;” We should head on to bed, we got a long day ahead of us tomorrow if you want to go back to a town.” Fia said while putting the lamp onto wall mounted hook. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt; “Yea I guess we do.” you said to fia while putting your stuff at a corner of the room. You look towards fia’s direction to find her fixing the bed. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;” Come on, the bed is small so we gotta get close to each other if we want to make it work.” fia told while getting into the bed and lifting the blanket up so you could get in as well. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You follow fia and hop into bed with her. She puts the blanket over both of you making sure both of you have some blanket as well. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;” Well...goodnight.” fia said to you while turning over to face the wall. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;” Yea...goodnight.” you said to the deer in a low tone. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could barely sleep, with fia sleeping next to you and sleeping in an unfamiliar location. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;5 minutes go by, then it turns into 10 minutes, after that 15 minutes go by, you could not sleep at all. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could hear fia snoring softly, it amuses you to thinking that a deer can snore. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While thinking of what happened today as the events played out in your head is when you feel that fia is pulling you into her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could not help but let her do so as waking a deer after she has fallen asleep seems like a bad idea to you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While you were thinking she has pulled you into her making her the big spoon here. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You couldn’t help but have mixed feelings about the situation you are in right now. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You couldn’t budge her arm even a little bit so you just lied there with fia cuddling you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It felt oddly calm and relaxing to you. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Soon you find yourself falling into a slumber with how things have turned out.</div></li></ol>        </div>

(Chapter 1)

&gt;be anon
&gt;17 years old, excited as you can be. 
&gt;The season just turned to autumn and now you are excited for your favorite season. Not because of the colors,Halloween,or the cool breezy air. No you are more excited about something else then those petty things other people like.
&gt;During autumn and winter is the times you love the most. They created opportunists for you and other people like you. You are a hunter...well a novice hunter. Your grandfather got you into the sport when you were only twelve. He saw that you loved to watch him clean his guns and polish his knives. He asked you if you ever wanted to go hunter before. You answered him quickly saying that you would love to.
&gt;But by New York law states that you have to be 13 years of age to be legal to take the hunters safety course.
&gt;you took the course when you finally turned 13. When you went to take the course it was in the middle of September. You went to the building that read &quot;Pine Tree Rifle Club&quot;
&gt;you have been here before a couple of times in the summer when your grandparents took you to their shooting league on Mondays. While their at that time you got to fire some of the guys your grandfather brought to compete with that being a .22 caliber Winchester.
&gt;Once you got to the bench he adjusted the scope for you and everything all you had to do was aim and pull the trigger. Once you got the hang of the gun, the wind, the heat, and the humidity. You were a natural shooter, you got a perfect 250 score with 23x in the middle. You took the course with flying colors you were the top of the class even if being only 13. Other people who took it with you was jealous that they got out matched by a 13 year old. Fast forward 3 years and your grandfather tell you something.
&gt;&quot;Anon I have something to ask you.&quot; He said while lounging in his chair. &quot;On October 1st is when hunting season starts up. But only for bow hunting.&quot; Grandfather said with a look on his face that tells you he wants to do something.
&gt;&quot;Now I already had my silence and took the course. September 1st is when Pine tree is holding their bow safety course.&quot; He said while he picked up his tobacco chew from the can.
&gt;after what he said you gave thought. You answered by saying yes and again taking a second safety course.
&gt;once again you took the course it was almost identical to the first course but for bows. This time you weren&#039;t the youngest. But once again just like last time you did it with flying colors with a score of 98%.
&gt;you were finally ready for hunting after that. You monkeyed with your grandfathers bow and adjusted it to sight and weight.

(Chapter 2)

&gt;You are in a truck going 42MPH on the way to the hunting area you’re grandfather had purchased a long time ago. He had a flat open field with a tree line and Oak, Birch, and Pine on the edge of camp. You’re grandfather had a couple of blinds set up for guns but not much for bow hunting. Today is October 1st the day of bow hunting season starts for New York for 4A.
&gt;You arrived at the campsite with giddy in your eyes. The excitement was thrilling to say the least. The time read 4:48 AM on your phone with the battery at 73% full. The air was crisp and cold on your face and fingers but it was nice feeling. You start to unpack your bow and start to get into gear with a bright orange camo suit. It was the best thing you have right now for warmth.
&gt;you sling the bow to your side and tell your grandfather that you were going ahead of him. Your grandfather was 74 years old at the time and was sore from the bumpy car ride.
&gt;you start to walk towards your area to set up for the remaining hours of the day. You had a tree stand on a very large oak tree. The tree had a great view of a animal trail and a nesting area with a acorn tree nearby. It was the Ideal spot to see something.
&gt;you see the tree stand in view, your heart racing to go to it and wait for oncoming deer. The tree stand looked like it rusted over the time but you did not care about it.
&gt;you start to climb the steps leading to the chair.
&gt;you make a mental check list to make sure nothing goes wrong. Safety harness check, bow check, flashlight check, arrows check, proper sitting check.
&gt; everything looked like it was working.
&gt;You sit their for hours not moving and keeping still. Many people see that as boring but you like to see it as wonderful. You get to see the birds chirping, squirrels coming out of their nests. 
&gt;It was amazing. You loved every second of it.
&gt;the time on your phone read 9:27 Am with the battery at 4%. Damn maybe you should’ve not played some games for a hour.
&gt;you hear a crunch of a branch in the distance from you. It’s go time you thought to yourself.
&gt;you nock in a arrow onto your Compound bow. It felt like a eternity that you stayed in place hoping the animal would come your way.
&gt;It did. The animal was coming towards you and are ready for it.
&gt;you start to see the outline of the deer coming. By the size of it, it seemed to be female.

(Chapter 3)

&gt;you stand up onto the platform breathing slowly a calmly but the adrenaline running through you is tell you to jump the shot. Each moment you take trying to look for the deer is another moment of rush you are taking from the thrill of the hunt.
&gt;you can see the deer in the distance it is about 100 yards away from where you were.
&gt;80…70…60…50…40 each 10 yards it takes from walking towards you is like a hit of a drug the feeling you have is blissful. This is your first deer ever and you were not going to let anything get in the way of it.
&gt;30…25…20…15
&gt;you can take the shot now that she is in full vision of you. 
&gt;you slowly draw the bow back into the anchor position, string to your cheek, the peep sight lined up perfectly.
&gt;you get into stance. You move your front foot to the edge of the platform. That was your mistake.
&gt;you hear the platform creaking.
&gt;you can feel the screw in holder is coming loose from the tree.
&gt;in a swift moment the platform is slanting downward towards the ground. You were a good 25 feet into the air.
&gt;you hold onto the safety harness for dear life.
&gt;the platform gives up on supporting you and falls to the ground, crashing loudly onto the forest floor with your gear.
&gt;the safety harness catches you, But while catching you the strap goes under your neck and tightly constricts your neck hard.
&gt;you are having a hard time breathing now that you have no place to step.
&gt;you are trying to stay calm but the cut flow of oxygen is making it hard. You swing from the tree and into the air trying your best to gain some oxygen and not pass out.
&gt;you struggle for about 4 minutes before you were so tired from doing it that you did not have enough strength to do so any more.
&gt;you just hanged there awaiting your final moments.
&gt;your vision is getting hazy, your arms feel weak, your whole body giving up on it’s self.
&gt;while vision is still slowly clear, you see a big blob of light tan coming towards the tree.
&gt;you black out from not having enough oxygen.


(Chapter 4) 

&gt;you can feel like you are floating in air. 
&gt;the feelings of fear, panic, and anxiety seemed to fade away
&gt;you were in a black area. Their was no ground or at least you didn’t see one.
&gt;you felt warm. Like you were in a nice cozy bed with a fireplace nearby to keep you warm at night.
&gt;you start to see light in the distance. The light seemed like it was calling towards you.
&gt;you start to float towards the light, But every time you try to go near it, the light seemed no closer than before.
&gt;just then you felt like everything was going fast like you felt wind flying over you.
&gt;you look back only to see nothing.
&gt;then you stopped floating, you were now falling. 
&gt;you could see something under you. It looked like the ground, it was coming fast.
&gt;before you could hit the ground you awoke to a sudden coldness on your face.
&gt;”AHHHH” you screamed loudly feeling the sudden coldness that has bestowed upon your face.
&gt;you look around your surroundings frantically.
&gt;it looked like a house but only it was round and more like a tent. The walls were made of hardened mud, the roof was made of dried grass bundled together with what looked like vines from a ivy plant.
&gt; their was a small fire in a corner that had a chimney style over it to let the smoke out.
&gt;you were sitting on a bed but it wasn’t a bed it was more like woven leaves together to form a base and 4 sturdy looking logs for posts. The blanket was made out of fur but more like coyote fur than a traditional deer pelt.
&gt;who ever brought you here knew how to do this and was smart enough to make such things from the materials.
&gt;you were pretty amazed by it all.

(Chapter 5) 

&gt;you hear a door swing open slightly from the left side of the room, you turn to see that the door is closed.&quot; Ah I must of scared the person away...&quot;you said softly.
&gt;“huh there must be more rooms than this one.” You thought to yourself still laying on the bed.
&gt;you hear humming, it sounded like let it snow? God you haven’t heard that song since last Christmas, who is singing it in the middle of November?
&gt;you start to get up from the bed but soon find it hard to even sit up straight. What the hell? Why can’t you sit up? What happened?
&gt;oh yea I forgot I fell out of my tree stand and almost hung myself…
&gt;you’re back is killing you, it hurts to even rotate yourself to face the door. Was I on painkillers before?
&gt;you didn’t know but you were glad someone put painkillers in you somehow.
&gt;you can still hear the humming come from the other room, but now listening closely to it, it sounds like a female humming the yule tide tune.
&gt;That gave you a nervous and relieved feeling. You being taken care of a female but also the feeling of a stranger carried me off from my spot and put me in their home which looked more of a /diy/ and /out/ homeless man had a baby. I’d bet they would be proud.
&gt;The humming seemed to get louder and footsteps Started to come your way. You quickly roll over but you pull it through the pain and managing to not yell in pain.
&gt;you pretend to be asleep in the makeshift bed.
&gt;you hear the door open and hear clacking of something coming from the direction.
&gt;you stayed perfectly still but breathing slowly to keep up the idea of sleeping to the mysterious person. You hear it set something down next to you with the object making a noise. You start to be hit with a aroma of grassy hot vegetables if you had to guess.
&gt;The figure walks away from you and you hear the door close with a creaky sound.
&gt;you turn over to see a clay bowl and a wooden spoon crudely made out of oak.
&gt;”Damn she must have a strong knife and patience to make that spoon.” Thinking about it you also notice the clay bowl had marks in it that looks like hooves on it. 
&gt;you couldn’t tell the animal by the shape of it due to the liquid in the bowl filled to the brim but on the outside it looked smoother on the outside than the inside on the little bit you can see.
&gt;man you could kill for crackers with the soup. Oyster crackers would be best.
&gt;speaking of soup, the soup looks like it has sliced Carrots, chopped Onion, some type of mushroom, and a scallions. 
&gt;”bleh” you say with a disgusted look on your face, but it is food and you were pretty starving to say the least…
&gt;you pick up the wooden spoon and slowly bring the tool to the soup carefully dipping in and bringing the spoon carefully to your mouth.
&gt;slurping up the liquid it hit you like a ton of bricks. It tasted sweet but notice it had no sort of broth more like flavored water with V8 with it.
&gt;but food is food so you ate all of it up except the carrots and onions.
&gt;”Ah! I see that you are finally away” a voice called out.

(Chapter 6) 

&gt;you turn your head around slowly to come face to face to the thing that gave you shelter and a warm meal.
&gt;all you saw first was the feet of the person. The feet was covered around with dirty cloth with a string to tie around the ankle. Wow that didn’t help.
&gt;next you look up slightly above the feet to find very wide and strong looking pair of legs but as you keep looking at the legs, they seem to have a pair of pants with realistic dirty muddied amber fur. The more you look at it the more of a feeling of unease washes over you. 
&gt;” Hey! Are you going to keep staring at my legs Mr. hunter?” The voice said softly with a hint of embarrassment tone in the voice. Speaking if the voice it sounded a lot like a voice you once heard on a cartoon when you were younger, You think the show was named animainiacs but sounded a lot like the deer and a episode. It sounded also tomboyish and gave off a sound of a farmers daughters voice.
&gt; “I-I’m sorry miss…” you say while now looking down on the crudely made bowl. 
&gt;You glance up to see the person face…
&gt;The face of the tomboyish outdoors women looked odd. It had a mask over her face that looked very realistic to that of a deer’s head. The eyes looked like they had a alive look similar to that of a taxidermist look to a trophy on a wall. The ears looked like they were moving but you could not tell by the way of the poorly dim lit room you were in.
&gt;you are faced to Faced with your rescuer. “T-thank you for saving me…” you try to say to the girl but you said it very softly almost as a light wispier towards her.
&gt;”You are very welcome hunter. I’m glad I saw you in the distance or else you would of hanged yourself.”
&gt;the thing spoke but not as if someone wore a mask and talked but was crystal clear and the mouth on the mask moved as well.
&gt;the mask spoke, you must be dreaming. This should be a dream. This has to be a dream. There is no way a talking deer should exist.

(Chapter 7) 

&gt;You were dumbfounded by the way that the animal spoke. How could you believe that this was a real deer walking on two legs and speaking English? This seems practically impossible of what you known in all your life! 
&gt;Wait maybe it is a mask! It must be one of those masks you find in the Halloween store that move as you talk. That must be it! 
&gt;You started to move out of the bed, swinging your legs around the edge and onto the cold grass-less dirt floor as the autumn cool air breezed over your bare feet. You cautiously moved towards the thing taking step by step as if you were a newborn baby making his first steps towards their parents. 
&gt;Your hands ever so slightly moving towards the things head. You can see that your hands are shaking, as you move your hands to her head, she spoke. 
&gt;&quot;Um excuse me boy, but what the hell you doing there?&quot; She spoke again in that tomboyish farmer accent with the mouth moving her ears twitching slightly. 
&gt;you didn’t answer her all you wanted was to know if this was really a mask. As you first made contact to the things head, the fur on the mask felt like it was made with synthetic fur but mixed with earthly dirt. As you started to pull upwards on the head, it gave great resistance. 
&gt;&quot;OW, What the hell is that for, you fucking prick!&quot; The women talked with anger in her tone and the intent to hurt. With that confirming it, this was no mask but a living talking deer! 
&gt;you fell backwards as her hoof launched you backwards. The blow knocked the wind out of you as you fell onto the bed. The bed frame gave out and smashed onto the cold hard ground. 
&gt;&quot;Great now you broke the bed! I knew I should have left you to die you fucking soft skin!&quot; She now said with the intent to kill as she lunged after you onto the bed. 
&gt;as you were regaining your breath you struggled to move out of the way as she lunged at you. She was extremely heavy must of weighed over 200 pounds! She struggled as you struggled to maintain strength as she seemed to out of breath. You pushed her off of you and stood onto your feet while she was still now destroyed bed. 
&gt;you stood straight, facing the now out of breath deer. She moved sluggishly trying to get off the bed. But ended up falling onto the harsh bitter ground. 
&gt;you were confused on why she just slumped to the ground. You knew by her body type she could have easily overpowered you and killed you but why was she like this? 
&gt;you moved very cautiously towards to the motionless deer. She was lying on her stomach her back towards you. 
&gt;something warm and wet started to touch your right foot. You looked down and saw that a dark red stream of blood was coming from the deer and onto your foot. It looked like she was hurt while you two were fighting but you don’t remember her ever getting stabbed or injured all you did was have her tackle you and you pushed her off to the side of you and then you got onto your feet. 
&gt;You thought to yourself &quot;you can leave this animal here and let it die and never speak of this again, OR you could repay back the deer for the shelter and saving your life.&quot; You thought this over for 3 minutes. Fuck. She tried to kill you but you did owe her your life, so now you got to save her. 
&gt;with that thinking you struggled to lift her up off of the ground. You grabbed her arms and legs and cattle style hoisted her onto the bed. She was bleeding. A lot. You walked around the small area and searched for water to clean the area. But all you could find was your backpack a pale and some bowls around the place. 
&gt;with your backpack at least you knew that water bottles would be in there.There is a full bottle and another half empty water bottle in your backpack. With that much you should be able to clean the wound. 
&gt;You head back over to where the unconscious deer is currently resting. You open the half empty water bottle and pour it over the area with the most blood. The animals body winces in pain as you pour it over the wound. Now you can see the wound better. It looked like something clawed her left outer thigh and a bullet wound in the lower chest cavity where a bullet entry or exit hole is, but by guessing from the other side it is more of a bullet entry.  
&gt;You go back to your backpack and look inside for your EDC (Every Day Carry) handbag where a small first aid kit should be. You find the handbag in the front pouch and open it up to see where the first aid kit should be. You grab the kit and rummage through the contents of it, where you find a curved sewing needle and some homemade sinew string you made a while back. You head back over to the deer and prepare the area with the rest of the half empty water bottle onto the wounds. 
&gt;Once again she winces in pain but still seems to be unconscious. You take Your shirt and wipe off any blood that remain from the area. Too bad you don’t have a razor to make this a hell of a lot easier on you and on her, but this will have to do. 
&gt;you bring the curved needle to the bullet wound and slowly insert the curved needle and sinew into the skin and just outside of the wound itself. Thankfully you took home economics class in middle school and they taught you how to sow something all be it not on a living thing. 
&gt;As you keep going in and out of the area to close the wound you can tell her breathing is getting a bit heavier. With a final pull around the zig zag pattern you close the wound tight. With that the wound is closed and safely tight. 
&gt;Now to do something around the clawed area is tricky. You would have to use a full bottle of water on it and then sew together the smaller clawed parts and then have to wrap it in gauze and a lot of cloth to make it so that she doesn’t try to pick at it and to keep the area clean from infections. 
&gt;the one thing you thought about while fixing her was, did a pack of coyote&#039;s attack her and later escaped only to get shot? Or was it that another hunter was hunting with blood hounds and the hounds picked her scent and tried to wound her while their master shot her. Even then how did she escape? 
&gt;You sewed her smaller clawed areas and gauze and bandaged her up where they should not cause any problems for her later when she wakes up. You couldn’t try to get the bullet inside her cause then you would have a bigger mess on your hands and it would mean that she would be dead a lot quicker and she already lost quite a lot of blood while on the floor and while you were cleaning the areas. 
&gt;Oh well, by the look of outside it seems to be night you might as well sleep too since you are pretty exhausted yourself. 
&gt;you lied down on the ground with your bag leaning on the bed and you covering yourself with your jacket you found while searching the den. Well as you drifted off into a slumber you could hear a faint coyote call in the distance

(Chapter 8) 

&gt;you awoke to the sound of moans, judging by the brisk orange citrus color in the little hole in the side of the hut, it seems to be early dawn or just beginning to be dusk. How long were you out? 
&gt;you groggily stand up and look over to the where the moans are coming from. It seems the thing left the bed while you were sleeping, where the thing laid, a huge blood stain is left where her leg has been. I guess she opened her wound. 
&gt;you look over to the door and start to quietly walk towards it as if you were a robber in a heavily armed bank. 
&gt;you take a peek into the area, it seems that now with some light in the room it looked like an old style nuclear bomb shelter minus the whole metal walls and no light, only the design remains the same, where you were staying it looked like an addon to the area you are seeing. 
&gt;You see there is cabinets made out of hardened clay. The room is bare expect for the clay cabinets and what looks like an old broken pop up table you would take for family events with one area cracked and a corner broken off. 
&gt;you walk into the room hoping to find the deer before she opened her wounds any more. You follow the sounds of moans coming from a wooden door that looks like it was thrown off the hinges and just placed there as a makeshift door. 
&gt;you knock on the &#039;door&#039; and the thing goes forward onto the ground. Well it looked like it was just standing, not really on support or anything. 
&gt;you look inside and see the deer on the floor tears in her eyes with blood dripping from her leg. The awkward moment staring at each other was brisk and quick. 
&gt;She throws a crudely made wooden spoon at you. It smacks you right in the face. She then throws another wooden spoon at you and starts speaking, saying to &quot;Get out of here!&quot; And &quot;leave me alone!&quot; In her accent. 
&gt;you walk out of the area and put back the door that was in there and place it so it would not fall again. You sit on the ground outside of the door. Since you propped the door on the wall you can see a little of what is inside of the room. 
&gt;you start to speak in a soft but friendly tone. &quot;Um hey I saw you had some wounds yesterday, and I wanted to repay you for you know... saving my life. So, I took some medicine from my bag and applied it to your wounds, but since you reopening the cuts I&#039;m going have to take a look at them and fix them again so they won&#039;t get infected.&quot; All you could hear was radio silence from her end.  
&gt;It seemed she didn’t want to talk. &quot;look if you know how to do it I can give you the supplies.&quot; With what you said she seemed to respond or at least made a sound to confirm she could do it, all you could heard was a &quot;humph&quot;. 
&gt;you go to the other room where your bag was left and grabbed the first aid kit and other items, you then went back to the ajar door and slowly placed the items through the hole. 
&gt;you could hear that she was moving, that’s a good sign then at least she could then patch herself up. 
&gt;it took all of 27 minutes or longer, you didn’t know you never carried a watch with you that she started to speak. &quot;hey listen... thank you for trying to patch up my wounds last night...&quot; With her accent she sounded like she was a punished farm boy that did something bad and was forced to say it by the father. 
&gt;&quot;look I&#039;m sorry for touching you and pull your head, I never seen this before and I was kind of delusional and thought you were only wearing a mask. I never seen a talking deer before.&quot; You said at her while trying to sound sincere but it sounded more like a excuse than a apology.

(chapter 9) 

 &gt;after the apology all you two did was sit their hoping one would talk first but it seemed like no one wanted to talk about anything. It took a good 30 minutes before anyone said anything, you were the first one to talk. 
&gt;&quot;So miss, where did you come from?&quot; Was all you could think of at that moment. She didn’t respond until a couple of minutes later. 
&gt;&quot;I was born England, from a country called Berkshire. My father lives there and he sent me here because he didn’t want anyone to find me and he honestly, he lived a quiet life before I came along.&quot; Her voice sorrows. 
&gt;honestly you thought she wasn’t going to talk opening about it and you originally thought she came from a lab that experimented on animals to create hybrids or war animals but her coming from somewhere normal like England. 
&gt;&quot;Well my name is Anon, I was hunting in the woods in my tree stand until it collapsed and my safety harness which I guess didn’t put on correctly hanged myself.&quot; You sighed. &quot;If you want me to leave I will pack up my stuff or what&#039;s left of my stuff and head on my way to a near town to get to a store or something.&quot; Saying that you start to get off of the ground and start grab your pack. 
&gt;all you could hear as if it were a little mouse quietly sneaking in the night. &quot;Please don’t leave.&quot; Was heard just beyond the door. &quot;You are the first soft skin that hasn’t tried to kill me or try to harm me in anyway, please don’t leave yet.&quot;  
&gt;you were confused on why she wants you to stay other than you being nice to her and not killing her the first chance you got, but she did try to kill you when you got to close to her, you guess she is very defensive about her and not getting harmed. 
&gt;your stomach roared as if it were a lion, you haven&#039;t eaten since yesterday and you were hungry to say the least. You heard a giggle beyond the door and then another roar of a stomach but this time it wasn’t yours, by your guess it was her stomach this time. 
&gt;&quot;looks like we both need to eat&quot; said the voice beyond the door. You were getting hungry and couldn’t really lie about it as though your stomach already announced it. 
&gt;you were feeling a bit scared, not because you are talking to a talking deer but instead of that, you were getting scared of it having other motives than just what it implied. It was like talking to an old best friend you haven&#039;t seen in a while, but you couldn’t shake the feeling of something sinister at hand here. Like why was she acting so friendly to you? And why were you acting so friendly to her?! It just didn’t make sense to your brain. 
&gt;&quot;I know a river we could go to get a drink of water and food.&quot; You heard as the door was being adjusted just behind your back. 
&gt;&quot;sure I&#039;ll go...&quot; Was all you could mutter.

(Chapter 10) 

&gt;you arrive at the river, not even 5 minutes went by. All you two did was walk peacefully but with her, you don’t even know her name yet, but you two acts very friendly towards each other.  
&gt;it is a bit weird to be so friendly that seems like an it should be put into a fairy tale or something you would find in some myth&#039;s. Something like this just seems like a dream. 
&gt;the river water looks clear but muddy at the same time like if you put flavor powder to make water taste fruitier in a sense but not as colorful. 
&gt;&quot;I know I&#039;m being very friendly to you anon. But I haven&#039;t talked to anyone in such a long time it&#039;s been very lonely here in the woods. I wish my sisters were around though they loved Pa and everything in the forest.&quot; The deer women said while taking a small clay bowl and bringing it down to the water and dipping it in while the water elegantly fills the bowl. 
&gt;&quot;Could you tell me your name Miss? I&#039;ve been wondering that since I told you mine but you still haven&#039;t told me yours yet. You questioned the strange deer with such a simple question even a toddler could answer. 
&gt;&quot;yes I can. My name is Fia, my father doesn’t really have time to name so many of his children so he names us what we are. For me it is Fia.&quot; The women said while taking a drink from the bowl. 
&gt;&quot;what do you mean &#039;many children&#039;?&quot; You said perplexed on how many children he had just to name them what they are? 
&gt;&quot;let&#039;s see he has me, he has Iasc, Iora, béar, and Luch and around as many animals there is in Berkshire and around Berkshire.&quot; Fia said still drinking from the bowl. 
&gt;&quot;holy shit, what is he a god?&quot; You asked the deer. 
&gt;&quot;Sorta, he is a ghost who lives in the Windsor Forest and Great park. My uncle is Cernunnos so he gave father the ability to reproduce but not with you soft skins like you. Uncle isn&#039;t fond of soft skins. He gave Pa exception since in his eyes he did nothing wrong but he never told me what he did and I don’t plan on knowing either.&quot; Fia said staring in the forest with a blank expression while watching the birds chirp away in the forest, it felt like the forest was alive with how the birds and other animals roamed around the forest as if they don’t see you as a threat.

(Chapter 11) 

 &gt;after finishing drinking from the water Fia wandered aimlessly around the riverbed. For about 5 minutes or so she just walked up and down the riverbed to you seemed like for no reason, then she jumped into the river, splashing around was heard as you saw in the water the deer fighting something. 
&gt;as she was fighting something a glimmer in the water caught your eye, you walk towards the glimmer that was resting on the riverbed, the sun glossing the object. You bend over and pick up the object from the riverbed. 
&gt;It was a bullet casing, it was a .223 casing the ones used for large game like deer and coyote. .223 was the one of the most common gun used in New York for hunting deer and other big game animals that you have seen used.
&gt;Fia comes out of the water 2 minutes later with a big catfish the size of your forearm, it was huge compared to the ones you seen caught by locals. 
&gt;&quot;Wow! That’s a huge catfish Fia.&quot; You speak amazed by her ability all the while hiding the bullet casing in your coat pocket. 
&gt;&quot;Yea, it is huge for a catfish. I caught it for you since you haven&#039;t eaten anything plus I don’t really know what you soft skins eat.&quot; Fia spoke with her ears waving in the air trying to get dry from the river. Fia walks over onto dry land and ties the slippery catfishes tail to a tree branch. 
&gt;&quot;um... shouldn’t we kill the catfish first so it doesn’t suffer? Just my thought since it is the most humane thing to do.&quot; You spoke taking a large rock from the riverbed. 
&gt;&quot;This is always how I kill my fish, if I killed the fish now then it wouldn’t amuse me.&quot; Fia said with a hint of disappointment in her voice. &quot;but alright since you are going to eat the fish you can kill it, anyway I just use the fish for fertilizer for my garden.&quot; Fia grabs the fish and places it on a flat rock. 
&gt;walking towards to the fish you stand just in front of its face. Looming over the fish with the big rock as if you were a skyscraper to this fish. You swiftly smack the fish over the head with the rock killing it instantly.

(Chapter 12) 
 
&gt;&quot;Say Fia, how come you eat fish? Isn&#039;t fish and meat extremely bad for deer like you.&quot; You asked taking out a filet knife from your bag and slowly fillet the fish into the parts for consumption and non-edible parts like the tail bones gills and organs. 
&gt;&quot;Normal deer yes to a limit, you see deer can eat fish fine but would get sick later on, I&#039;ve seen other deer around here eat meat like when soft skins wearing white garments put up bat nets, planning on releasing the bats but the deer around the area came across a lone bird that got caught in the net and ate it alive, it was gruesome.&quot; Fia said all the while staring at you filleting the fish with an intense look and hunger in the eyes as if she hadn&#039;t eaten anything in a while. 
&gt;You take out a penny stove out of your bag and a small metal grill that goes along with it. You poor the chemicals into the area and put the penny on top. A few flames flicker here and there, about 2 minutes later flames from holes finally come into play and all of the holes that are in the stove are now shooting out a healthy flame enough to good something on. 
&gt;grabbing the small grill, you place the grill over the area where the flames are. 
&gt;Fia looking amazed by the sudden flames coming out of the can, asking how you have done that without anything to strike against or to heat up. 
&gt;&quot;Well Fia, the chemicals in this here water is called alcohol, the penny which is on the top makes the alcohol heat up and the stuff that is inside the can is tinder which is what makes the flames, or something like that, I never really understood the entire thing only really know what makes it do that and how to make it.&quot; Saying that while taking the slices of catfish and putting them onto the grill, cooking them slowly and steadily making sure the fish does not burn or become inedible.

(Chapter 13) 

&gt;After a while the slices of fish become a golden-brown color with streaks of charred fish where the meat and the grilled met at. You could see Fia in the distance by the riverbed taking flat rocks and skipping the rocks across the water. Seeing what she was doing made you remember when you were a child and you used to skip the shale rocks with your twin sister at the lake house your father took you while he was working on the house for his client. 
&gt;This only saddened you for a bit as you remember that it has been days or maybe weeks since you returned home, you hope that they are not too worried about you. 
&gt;Maybe after today Fia would let you go back home or even show you the closest town or any houses nearby with a working phone, you doubt that she knows anyone, she said before that you are the first human that haven&#039;t tried to hurt or even kill her the second you see her. 
&gt;You call out to Fia by the riverbed that the food is cooked and ready to eat, this only made her ears swivel around her head at first, then her body turned to your direction and starting to walk towards you with hop and a skip in her step. 
&gt;It seemed she was eager to eat the fish. You would be too if you haven&#039;t eaten anything for a while, even now you are eager as well to eat the fish. 
&gt;&quot;It smells amazing anon!&quot; Fia says to you while crouching down to the little stove on the flat rock, her butt is wiggling with her tail in anticipation, you couldn&#039;t help but stare at her behind. 
&gt;The growl of your stomach snaps you out of the hypnotized state. You grab a fork and a cutting knife out of your bag, cutting pieces from the fish you take a piece from the fish and put it in your mouth. 
&gt;It tasted like soggy socks with salmon mixed in. Your grandfather always said to you that people either like the taste of catfish or hate it, reason being that catfish are scavengers and would pretty much eat anything off the bottom of riverbed. 
&gt;Fia just sat at other side of the flat rock across from you, it seems she is waiting for something. 
&gt;&quot;Fia what is the matter why are you not eating?&quot; You saying that with another small piece taken from the fish and stuffing the fish in your mouth. 
&gt;&quot;Well... I don’t have good grip on many things even with my hands my thumbs are just part hoof so grabbing things is hard for me if they are small.&quot; Fia looking down at her hands. 
&gt;You grab a piece of the fish with your fork and hand feed her the fish. This made Fia happy with a little yay from her and her chomping down on the fish from your fork. 
&gt;Fia chewed the fish thoroughly, with a gulp she spoke. &quot;Delicious, it tastes amazing, better than I have ever cooked one.&quot; Fia gleamed with joy. &quot;glad you enjoyed it Fia.&quot; You said to the joyed deer while giving her another piece of the fish. 
&gt;Within a half hour the giant catfish was gone and both belly&#039;s full, but mostly Fia&#039;s. 
&gt;&quot;Well that was a good brunch but due to the sky it seems like it&#039;s around 2pm or 3pm just guessing, where should we go?&quot; You said to the deer women who was lying on a fallen tree that was rotting away. 
&gt;The deer never answered you. 
&gt;&quot;Hey over there you okay?&quot; You called out to the deer once again. 
&gt;Not a response. 
&gt;You get up from the ground and walk towards Fia. She is sound asleep with her hands under her head acting as a pillow. Guess she got sleepy after that food. 
&gt;You notice her attire is mostly a crudely made loose leather bikini covering her stomach and her bottom half of her breasts like a low hanging crop top but the top of her breasts are exposed, guessing just from looks she has to be at least B cup maybe a C cup, her pants were that of old torn jeans, it doesn’t look like the rips were intentional guessing by the thread lining of the rips, her jeans look too tight on her curvy figure, her ass is just the right shape of that of a bubble butt but her hips bring out the most of her figure, her thighs were huge compared to the rest of her assets. 
&gt;The rips on her jeans looked like an animal did the rips for most of it, there is some rips that have thorns and birdox on it. 
&gt;Fia stretches her arms outwards scaring you. &gt;you fall flat on your ass from the sudden movement from fia, is she waking up? Did she notice you checking her body out? 
&gt;You get up from the ground and rush over to your backpack cleaning the area and acting as if you weren&#039;t checking her body out. 
&gt;5 minutes go by of you cleaning the area. 
&gt;Another 5 minutes go by. 
&gt;It seemed she wasn’t awake. 
&gt;You pick up the rest of the items around the area wash the tools in the river, eventually Fia woke up and came over to you asking what you were doing, you replied with washing your tools and other objects, to your surprised she asked you to show her how to use those tools and ways to craft some stuff from your bag. 
&gt;You agreed. 
&gt;You told Fia that it was starting to get dark and getting colder, she understood and she told you to follow her for she knows the way from here to the hut.

(Chapter 14) 

&gt;After a short hike following Fia towards her hut, you could see the outline of the hut in the distance. 
&gt;” Hey I wanna ask you something” you say to the deer. 
&gt;A simple Hmmm was the only response from the large deer ahead of you. 
&gt;”do you think I could stay another night? My family must be worried about me but I don’t want to go into the forest at night and my flashlight isn&#039;t working.” you asked the while looking around the forest.  
&gt;Fia stopped a few feet in front of the you. 
&gt;”Sure, but I only got one bed in my hut. So, me and you gotta share a bed.” the deer said while stepping over a fallen hemlock tree. 
&gt;With that said you and fia walk towards the hut without speaking to one another. 

Chapter 15) 

&gt;You enter the hut dark as it can be inside. 
&gt;Fia enters behind you, you can hear her rummaging through something behind you. 
&gt;A bright flash emits from behind you while a small glow of orange surrounds the room you two are you. 
&gt;You look behind you to find that fia has struck a match and lit up a small oil lamp. 
&gt;” Let there be light!” you say to fia. Fia looks at you with a confused face. 
&gt;Guess she didn’t find that amusing.  
&gt;” We should head on to bed, we got a long day ahead of us tomorrow if you want to go back to a town.” Fia said while putting the lamp onto wall mounted hook. 
&gt; “Yea I guess we do.” you said to fia while putting your stuff at a corner of the room. You look towards fia’s direction to find her fixing the bed. 
&gt;” Come on, the bed is small so we gotta get close to each other if we want to make it work.” fia told while getting into the bed and lifting the blanket up so you could get in as well. 
&gt;You follow fia and hop into bed with her. She puts the blanket over both of you making sure both of you have some blanket as well. 
&gt;” Well...goodnight.” fia said to you while turning over to face the wall. 
&gt;” Yea...goodnight.” you said to the deer in a low tone. 
&gt;You could barely sleep, with fia sleeping next to you and sleeping in an unfamiliar location. 
&gt;5 minutes go by, then it turns into 10 minutes, after that 15 minutes go by, you could not sleep at all. 
&gt;You could hear fia snoring softly, it amuses you to thinking that a deer can snore. 
&gt;While thinking of what happened today as the events played out in your head is when you feel that fia is pulling you into her. 
&gt;You could not help but let her do so as waking a deer after she has fallen asleep seems like a bad idea to you. 
&gt;While you were thinking she has pulled you into her making her the big spoon here. 
&gt;You couldn’t help but have mixed feelings about the situation you are in right now. 
&gt;You couldn’t budge her arm even a little bit so you just lied there with fia cuddling you. 
&gt;It felt oddly calm and relaxing to you. 
&gt;Soon you find yourself falling into a slumber with how things have turned out.</textarea>
