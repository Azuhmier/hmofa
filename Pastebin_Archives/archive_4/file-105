        <div class="source" style=" ">
            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s a beautiful day today.  The sun&#039;s shining, there&#039;s a pleasant breeze blowing, and your favorite song is stuck in your head...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mainly because your wife is whistling it as she walks, just like always.  You cast a loving look over at her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ve been married to Lena Lynx for a little more than a year now, and every day has been like something out of a cartoon.  Mainly because, well, she IS out of a cartoon.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Despite the breeze blowing head on, her fur barely moves in the wind.  She walks with exaggerated, rhythmic movements that follow the tune she&#039;s whistling.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her grayscale fur makes her stand out even amongst a town where several non-human women live.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But, honestly?  You wouldn&#039;t change a thing about her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lena stops whistling and smiles, her ears twitching mischievously.  She speaks in her ever-so-slightly grainy, tinny voice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Where we going today, sweetheart?  Thought we had errands to run?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With an audible tone, a little black question mark appears above her head as she tilts her head inquisitively.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry about it, Lena; you&#039;ll see where we&#039;re going soon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She giggles and wraps one of her arms around you, hugging you close as you continue walking.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well, wherever we&#039;re goin&#039;, it couldn&#039;t be a nicer day!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shades her eyes and looks up at the sun, winking at it audibly.  You chuckle, remembering that the sun in her old toon winked back.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sighs happily, wrapping her tail around you with an accordion sound.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I love you, Anon.  Hope you never forget that.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You crane your neck and kiss her on the cheek, prompting little black hearts to drift up from her head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Love you too, Lena.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She starts purring loudly as she grasps your hand tightly.  Her white-gloved fingers interlock with yours as you continue to walk.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She soon begins happily whistling her favorite song, resuming her rhythmic swaying and dancing.  It&#039;s not long before you begin mimicking her moves, well, as best you can, anyway.  You&#039;re not as flexible as her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can&#039;t help but notice people watching her as they pass by.  Some smile and adopt her tune, whistling along.  Others look confused, but politely nod.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One woman, a white wolf, smiles and gently tips her wide-brimmed hat as her human companion waves.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lena takes in the attention with a broad grin, beaming at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I wonder if any of &#039;em remember my old show?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shrug, masking a smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Who can say?  Even if they don&#039;t, it doesn&#039;t matter; you&#039;re here now, in the real world.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her smile widens even farther.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yep!  You&#039;re stuck with me, Anon!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She chuckles again, kissing you on the forehead and putting loudly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I wouldn&#039;t dream of being with anyone else, Lena.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stares at you with a smile...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then lets out a loud OOF when she bumps into something.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lena falls back onto her rear, a cloud of grey dust proofing up from the ground and an exaggerated CRASH echoing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She rubs her head with a little scowl, then audibly blinks a few times.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In front of her, also on the ground, sits an older woman who seems to be... a lynx hybrid of some sort.  The woman frowns and rubs her head, tousling her silver hair.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lena immediately hops you and dashes over.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m sorry!  You alright, lady?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your Toon wife helps the red-furred lynx up, with the older woman brushing dirt off her dress.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The woman smiles appreciatively.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m fine, thank you, miss...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her eyes widen as she gets a good look at Lena.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...y-you&#039;re not... Lena Lynx, are you?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;An exclamation point appears above the Toon&#039;s head as she smiles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I sure am!  You... recognize me?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The red lynx hugs your wife, smiling.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Recognize you?  I loved your cartoon! I watched every episode growing up.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tiny, inky tears well up in Lena&#039;s eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Wow, I-I can&#039;t believe someone remembers little ol&#039; me.  You&#039;ve made this ol&#039; gal&#039;s day, miss...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Conne, sweetie.  Rita Conne.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Miss Conne.  I can&#039;t tell ya how happy this makes me; thank you!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two women laugh and chat about Lena&#039;s show for a while before parting ways, waving farewell to each other.  Lena sighs happily, wiping tears of joy from her eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Can ya believe it, Anon?  She KNOWS me!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I heard!  I&#039;m happy for you, honey.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She wraps her tail around you again, squeezing you lovingly as you star walking again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So, we almost there, Anon?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We are.  But you have to close your eyes, okay?  It&#039;s a surprise.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ooh!  Gladly!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She makes a point of closing her black eyes, then whips a blindfold from nowhere and ties it over them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You chuckle at her antics, then lead her to your destination.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you enter, you wink at the staff.  They were already expecting you, since you called weeks ago.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lena probably thinks you forgot, but today&#039;s her birthday.  Well, at least, according to her show, it is.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you&#039;ve had a surprise planned for a while now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you walk, Lena quietly hums her theme song, swaying to the beat as always.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few, older members of the staff smile nostalgically at her inkblot appearance.  Some younger ones seem confused, but still grin at you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A nervous looking cat sheepishly squeaks out a hello, then runs off on her way.  Lena chuckles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Sounds like someone was a bit of a fraidy cat, huh?  Where are we, anyway?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Patience, honey.  We&#039;re almost there.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lead her in through the double doors, and stop just shy of the theatre&#039;s massive screen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The room darkens, and you lay a hand on Lena&#039;s shoulder.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We&#039;re here.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before she can take off her blindfold, the first few notes of a familiar song fill the room.  Lena gasps and rips off the cloth as the screen shows a warm, friendly face...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks around the theatre with an awestruck expression, seeing countless people waving and cheering as her theme song begins to play.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The first episode of Lena&#039;s cartoon begins as you lead her to a VIP seat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your wife stammers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;H-h-how... did-did you do this?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry about it.  Just enjoy the show.  They&#039;ve got every episode up there, and we&#039;re gonna marathon them all.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Black tears of happiness streak down her face as she smiles lovingly.  Hearts appear in her eyes and above her head as she practically tackles you into a hug.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Happy birthday, honey.  I love you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She purrs so loudly you can barely hear anything else.  Above the happy din, you can faintly hear her babbling &quot;I love you&quot; rapidly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The audience around you fawns over your wife, cheering and AWWWWing at her affections.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When she eventually lets you go, she keeps an arm around you and turns to the screen.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Every single episode, huh?  Well, let me give you the backstage commentary for each and every one of em, sweetheart.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And so she does.  Every last episode prompts her to launch into a story of what it was like to &quot;film&quot; that short.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The people around you listen intently, laughing and smiling at her tales.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lena devours the attention, tail whipping happily and more tears glimmering in her eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She plants a kiss on you after every story, with the crowd AWWWing appropriately.  One young woman behind you attempts to catch some of the hearts constantly drifting from your wife&#039;s head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For three hours, your birthday surprise continues in this way.  Episode after episode is met with applause and cheers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;By the midpoint, everyone in the room is singing along to her theme song every time it starts.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lena practically melts every time the chorus of her name rings out.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually, it all comes down to this.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The final episode.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even the theatre staff are singing Lena&#039;s theme song now.  She can barely carry a tune through happy sobs, but you happily let every word fly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She leans on you, wrapping her arms around you tightly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is the only episode she offers no commentary on.  She merely sits silently, running a hand up and down your side and kissing you countless times.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The crowd laughs raucously at the toon, driving her to beam happily each time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You rest your head on the massive, fluffy tuft of fur around her neck, listening to her purr.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;T-thank you so much, Anon.  I love you.  I love you so, so much.  You&#039;re the best husband ever.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;And you&#039;re the best wife, Lena.  Happy birthday, honey.  I love you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As the Lena onscreen takes her final bow, the crowd goes absolutely wild, practically shaking the theatre with their applause.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lena pulls you into a loving kiss just as the toon fades to black.</div></li></ol>        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;It&#039;s a beautiful day today.  The sun&#039;s shining, there&#039;s a pleasant breeze blowing, and your favorite song is stuck in your head...
&gt;Mainly because your wife is whistling it as she walks, just like always.  You cast a loving look over at her.
&gt;You&#039;ve been married to Lena Lynx for a little more than a year now, and every day has been like something out of a cartoon.  Mainly because, well, she IS out of a cartoon.
&gt;Despite the breeze blowing head on, her fur barely moves in the wind.  She walks with exaggerated, rhythmic movements that follow the tune she&#039;s whistling.
&gt;Her grayscale fur makes her stand out even amongst a town where several non-human women live.
&gt;But, honestly?  You wouldn&#039;t change a thing about her.
&gt;Lena stops whistling and smiles, her ears twitching mischievously.  She speaks in her ever-so-slightly grainy, tinny voice.
&gt;&quot;Where we going today, sweetheart?  Thought we had errands to run?&quot;
&gt;With an audible tone, a little black question mark appears above her head as she tilts her head inquisitively.
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry about it, Lena; you&#039;ll see where we&#039;re going soon.&quot;
&gt;She giggles and wraps one of her arms around you, hugging you close as you continue walking.
&gt;&quot;Well, wherever we&#039;re goin&#039;, it couldn&#039;t be a nicer day!&quot;
&gt;She shades her eyes and looks up at the sun, winking at it audibly.  You chuckle, remembering that the sun in her old toon winked back.
&gt;She sighs happily, wrapping her tail around you with an accordion sound.
&gt;&quot;I love you, Anon.  Hope you never forget that.&quot;
&gt;You crane your neck and kiss her on the cheek, prompting little black hearts to drift up from her head.
&gt;&quot;Love you too, Lena.&quot;

&gt;She starts purring loudly as she grasps your hand tightly.  Her white-gloved fingers interlock with yours as you continue to walk.
&gt;She soon begins happily whistling her favorite song, resuming her rhythmic swaying and dancing.  It&#039;s not long before you begin mimicking her moves, well, as best you can, anyway.  You&#039;re not as flexible as her.
&gt;You can&#039;t help but notice people watching her as they pass by.  Some smile and adopt her tune, whistling along.  Others look confused, but politely nod.
&gt;One woman, a white wolf, smiles and gently tips her wide-brimmed hat as her human companion waves.
&gt;Lena takes in the attention with a broad grin, beaming at you.
&gt;&quot;I wonder if any of &#039;em remember my old show?&quot;
&gt;You shrug, masking a smile.
&gt;&quot;Who can say?  Even if they don&#039;t, it doesn&#039;t matter; you&#039;re here now, in the real world.&quot;
&gt;Her smile widens even farther.
&gt;&quot;Yep!  You&#039;re stuck with me, Anon!&quot;
&gt;She chuckles again, kissing you on the forehead and putting loudly.
&gt;&quot;I wouldn&#039;t dream of being with anyone else, Lena.&quot;
&gt;She stares at you with a smile...
&gt;Then lets out a loud OOF when she bumps into something.
&gt;Lena falls back onto her rear, a cloud of grey dust proofing up from the ground and an exaggerated CRASH echoing.
&gt;She rubs her head with a little scowl, then audibly blinks a few times.
&gt;In front of her, also on the ground, sits an older woman who seems to be... a lynx hybrid of some sort.  The woman frowns and rubs her head, tousling her silver hair.
&gt;Lena immediately hops you and dashes over.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m sorry!  You alright, lady?&quot;
&gt;Your Toon wife helps the red-furred lynx up, with the older woman brushing dirt off her dress.

&gt;The woman smiles appreciatively.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m fine, thank you, miss...&quot;
&gt;Her eyes widen as she gets a good look at Lena.
&gt;&quot;...y-you&#039;re not... Lena Lynx, are you?&quot;
&gt;An exclamation point appears above the Toon&#039;s head as she smiles.
&gt;&quot;I sure am!  You... recognize me?&quot;
&gt;The red lynx hugs your wife, smiling.
&gt;&quot;Recognize you?  I loved your cartoon! I watched every episode growing up.&quot;
&gt;Tiny, inky tears well up in Lena&#039;s eyes.
&gt;&quot;Wow, I-I can&#039;t believe someone remembers little ol&#039; me.  You&#039;ve made this ol&#039; gal&#039;s day, miss...&quot;
&gt;&quot;Conne, sweetie.  Rita Conne.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Miss Conne.  I can&#039;t tell ya how happy this makes me; thank you!&quot;
&gt;The two women laugh and chat about Lena&#039;s show for a while before parting ways, waving farewell to each other.  Lena sighs happily, wiping tears of joy from her eyes.
&gt;&quot;Can ya believe it, Anon?  She KNOWS me!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I heard!  I&#039;m happy for you, honey.&quot;
&gt;She wraps her tail around you again, squeezing you lovingly as you star walking again.
&gt;&quot;So, we almost there, Anon?&quot;
&gt;&quot;We are.  But you have to close your eyes, okay?  It&#039;s a surprise.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ooh!  Gladly!&quot;
&gt;She makes a point of closing her black eyes, then whips a blindfold from nowhere and ties it over them.
&gt;You chuckle at her antics, then lead her to your destination.

&gt;As you enter, you wink at the staff.  They were already expecting you, since you called weeks ago.
&gt;Lena probably thinks you forgot, but today&#039;s her birthday.  Well, at least, according to her show, it is.
&gt;And you&#039;ve had a surprise planned for a while now.
&gt;As you walk, Lena quietly hums her theme song, swaying to the beat as always.
&gt;A few, older members of the staff smile nostalgically at her inkblot appearance.  Some younger ones seem confused, but still grin at you.
&gt;A nervous looking cat sheepishly squeaks out a hello, then runs off on her way.  Lena chuckles.
&gt;&quot;Sounds like someone was a bit of a fraidy cat, huh?  Where are we, anyway?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Patience, honey.  We&#039;re almost there.&quot;
&gt;You lead her in through the double doors, and stop just shy of the theatre&#039;s massive screen.
&gt;The room darkens, and you lay a hand on Lena&#039;s shoulder.
&gt;&quot;We&#039;re here.&quot;
&gt;Before she can take off her blindfold, the first few notes of a familiar song fill the room.  Lena gasps and rips off the cloth as the screen shows a warm, friendly face...
&gt;Her face.
&gt;She looks around the theatre with an awestruck expression, seeing countless people waving and cheering as her theme song begins to play.

&gt;The first episode of Lena&#039;s cartoon begins as you lead her to a VIP seat.
&gt;Your wife stammers.
&gt;&quot;H-h-how... did-did you do this?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry about it.  Just enjoy the show.  They&#039;ve got every episode up there, and we&#039;re gonna marathon them all.&quot;
&gt;Black tears of happiness streak down her face as she smiles lovingly.  Hearts appear in her eyes and above her head as she practically tackles you into a hug.
&gt;&quot;Happy birthday, honey.  I love you.&quot;
&gt;She purrs so loudly you can barely hear anything else.  Above the happy din, you can faintly hear her babbling &quot;I love you&quot; rapidly.
&gt;The audience around you fawns over your wife, cheering and AWWWWing at her affections.
&gt;When she eventually lets you go, she keeps an arm around you and turns to the screen.
&gt;&quot;Every single episode, huh?  Well, let me give you the backstage commentary for each and every one of em, sweetheart.&quot;
&gt;And so she does.  Every last episode prompts her to launch into a story of what it was like to &quot;film&quot; that short.
&gt;The people around you listen intently, laughing and smiling at her tales.
&gt;Lena devours the attention, tail whipping happily and more tears glimmering in her eyes.
&gt;She plants a kiss on you after every story, with the crowd AWWWing appropriately.  One young woman behind you attempts to catch some of the hearts constantly drifting from your wife&#039;s head.
&gt;For three hours, your birthday surprise continues in this way.  Episode after episode is met with applause and cheers.
&gt;By the midpoint, everyone in the room is singing along to her theme song every time it starts.
&gt;Lena practically melts every time the chorus of her name rings out.

&gt;Eventually, it all comes down to this.
&gt;The final episode.
&gt;Even the theatre staff are singing Lena&#039;s theme song now.  She can barely carry a tune through happy sobs, but you happily let every word fly.
&gt;She leans on you, wrapping her arms around you tightly.
&gt;This is the only episode she offers no commentary on.  She merely sits silently, running a hand up and down your side and kissing you countless times.
&gt;The crowd laughs raucously at the toon, driving her to beam happily each time.
&gt;You rest your head on the massive, fluffy tuft of fur around her neck, listening to her purr.
&gt;&quot;T-thank you so much, Anon.  I love you.  I love you so, so much.  You&#039;re the best husband ever.&quot;
&gt;&quot;And you&#039;re the best wife, Lena.  Happy birthday, honey.  I love you.&quot;
&gt;As the Lena onscreen takes her final bow, the crowd goes absolutely wild, practically shaking the theatre with their applause.
&gt;Lena pulls you into a loving kiss just as the toon fades to black.</textarea>
