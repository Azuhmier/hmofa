            <ol class="text"><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You awaken from a midday nap to a knock at the door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Who could that be?  You never have company over.  Not that you mind, really.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Investigating the knock reveals nothing more than a box, left behind with nary a card explaining why it&#039;s here.  Humph.  You don&#039;t remember ordering any package...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whatever it is, it&#039;s a tiny, light box.  Probably something your neighbor bought, or something like that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...though it DOES have your name scribbled on it crudely in marker.  How odd.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Can&#039;t be your parents, your mom&#039;s too meticulous to let Dad scribble on a gift like that.  Nobody from work would know your address.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So... who sent it?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whatever, might as well bring it inside.  Not like you&#039;ve got anything better to do.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take the box inside and open it, curiosity burning.  Inside is a small unlabeled packet, apparently full of seeds.  A small brochure of sorts rests inside the box as well.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;GROW A FRIEND!  Hey You!  Are you lonely?  Need a companion?  Just add our patented seeds to soil, add water, and in a day, you&#039;ll have grown your own friend!  Water them every day, and soon your friend will be ready for a night on the town!  -Warning: do not forget to water Grow A Friend.-&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...what?  What kinda scam is this?  There&#039;s no way that these seeds can grow into a &quot;friend.&quot;  Unless you start talking to flowers, maybe.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bah.  Guess it can&#039;t hurt to try?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You happen to have a flowerpot in your windowsill, and the flowers inside are dead, so you pluck them and dump the seed packet into the waiting soil.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once they&#039;re buried, you grab a glass of water and soak the seeds.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...and that&#039;s it, apparently.  The instructions didn&#039;t call for anything else. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Guess you just wait for tomorrow?  </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Meh, whatever.  It&#039;s late anyways.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Might as well turn in for the night, you can check the seeds tomorrow morning.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quickly get ready for bed and burrow under your covers, yawning.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just as you doze off, you swear you hear the neighbor&#039;s cat purring.  Little jerk must be out on the fire escape again.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh well, not enough to keep you awake.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You awaken to the sound of a cat yowling.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ugggh, can&#039;t they keep that little shit home if he&#039;s gonna be that loud?  You roll out of bed and head to the window.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There&#039;s no cat out there.  It dimly occurs to you that the sound is coming from your living room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Did Tom sneak in, the little bastard?  Wouldn&#039;t be the first time.  You swear, one day you&#039;re gonna-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your train of thought entirely derails at what you see in your living room.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lounging on the floor, in a pile of soil, is... a cat-woman?  Her fur is a pale, creamy color.  But there&#039;s more to it than that.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her body is covered with pink flowers of all sizes, and they seem to be... part of her?  Two even serve as tall, pointy ears, while some stamens act as whiskers.  Leaves also seem to sprout from parts of her body.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All that takes a backseat to her bones, though.  Her head seems to be a skull entirely, while her arms are skeletal from the elbow down.  Long, curved ribs erupt just below rather sizable breasts, protecting a slim waist.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Huge, glassy eyes focus on you, red pupils narrowing to slits.  She opens her mouth in a hiss, then suddenly clamps her jaw shut with a click.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She blinks a few times, absentmindedly running a bony hand along her curvy leg.  There&#039;s a long, awkward pause, then she speaks.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Myowl?  Friend?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stares at you expectantly, floral ears twitching. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uhhh...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your eyes roam over her body as she tilts her head, confused.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Are you not friend?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I, uh... I guess I am?  I-&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She immediately leaps to her skeletal feet and charges at you, arms outstretched.  The cat embraces you tightly, bony arms digging into your back as she lets off a raspy purr.  Alarmingly, she&#039;s quite a bit taller than you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hi, friend.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her fur feels like... very fine grass.  The various flowers running down her spine are definitely real, as well.  ...as are her bony arms and the ribs gently poking into your own chest.  The scent of a flower garden fills your head.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Mmmmmya... you&#039;re warm, friend~&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Y-you too...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What the hell is going on here?  Are you hallucinating?  Surely not, right?  But then, how do you explain the woman hugging you right now?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She rubs her head against you affectionately, the bone scrubbing against your cheek, then sighs happily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...friend, I&#039;m thirsty.  Can you water me?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Huh?  Sure, sure...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wander into the kitchen as she lets go of you.  You scratch your head as you fill a glass of water for your... uh, friend?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you return, she purrs again and gently takes the water from you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Thanks!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She unceremoniously dumps the water down her chest, the liquid running down her front and dripping off her ribs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Nyaahhh... that&#039;s better.  Now, friend, what we gonna do?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Huh?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We&#039;re friends, friend!  Friends do stuff together, so what we gonna do?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uhhh... what do you want to do... Miss?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She chuckles, a high pitched, chirpy sort of sound.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;My name&#039;s not Miss, silly friend!  I&#039;m Orchid!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Okay then, uh, Orchid.  What do you want to do?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her smile fades slightly, her pupils dilating.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uhhh...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She fidgets a little, eyes darting around the room nervously.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;....n-not... not sure.  I-I wanna do what you wanna do, friend.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You don&#039;t have any preferences?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her pupils expand farther as her expression becomes full-blown panic.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;N-n-no, nya!  Whatever you want is fine!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What&#039;s wrong?  Just wanted your opinion...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She calms down slightly, eyes returning to normal slowly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;... I&#039;d like a movie, maybe?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She cringes, closing her eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Alright, sounds fun.  Lemme see what&#039;s on Netflix.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She opens her eyes, an expression of wonder on her face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You wanna do what I wanna do?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Of course.  Sounds fun to me.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...I thought you&#039;d wanna pick?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Nahhh.  You&#039;re my guest, you pick.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She blinks a few times, then pulls you into another purring hug.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You put on a generic comedy film and hop onto the couch.

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;You awaken from a midday nap to a knock at the door.
&gt;Who could that be?  You never have company over.  Not that you mind, really.
&gt;Investigating the knock reveals nothing more than a box, left behind with nary a card explaining why it&#039;s here.  Humph.  You don&#039;t remember ordering any package...
&gt;Whatever it is, it&#039;s a tiny, light box.  Probably something your neighbor bought, or something like that.
&gt;...though it DOES have your name scribbled on it crudely in marker.  How odd.
&gt;Can&#039;t be your parents, your mom&#039;s too meticulous to let Dad scribble on a gift like that.  Nobody from work would know your address.
&gt;So... who sent it?
&gt;Whatever, might as well bring it inside.  Not like you&#039;ve got anything better to do.
&gt;You take the box inside and open it, curiosity burning.  Inside is a small unlabeled packet, apparently full of seeds.  A small brochure of sorts rests inside the box as well.

&gt;&quot;GROW A FRIEND!  Hey You!  Are you lonely?  Need a companion?  Just add our patented seeds to soil, add water, and in a day, you&#039;ll have grown your own friend!  Water them every day, and soon your friend will be ready for a night on the town!  -Warning: do not forget to water Grow A Friend.-&quot;
&gt;...what?  What kinda scam is this?  There&#039;s no way that these seeds can grow into a &quot;friend.&quot;  Unless you start talking to flowers, maybe.
&gt;Bah.  Guess it can&#039;t hurt to try?
&gt;You happen to have a flowerpot in your windowsill, and the flowers inside are dead, so you pluck them and dump the seed packet into the waiting soil.
&gt;Once they&#039;re buried, you grab a glass of water and soak the seeds.
&gt;...and that&#039;s it, apparently.  The instructions didn&#039;t call for anything else. 
&gt;Guess you just wait for tomorrow?  
&gt;Meh, whatever.  It&#039;s late anyways.
&gt;Might as well turn in for the night, you can check the seeds tomorrow morning.
&gt;You quickly get ready for bed and burrow under your covers, yawning.
&gt;Just as you doze off, you swear you hear the neighbor&#039;s cat purring.  Little jerk must be out on the fire escape again.
&gt;Oh well, not enough to keep you awake.

&gt;You awaken to the sound of a cat yowling.
&gt;Ugggh, can&#039;t they keep that little shit home if he&#039;s gonna be that loud?  You roll out of bed and head to the window.
&gt;There&#039;s no cat out there.  It dimly occurs to you that the sound is coming from your living room.
&gt;Did Tom sneak in, the little bastard?  Wouldn&#039;t be the first time.  You swear, one day you&#039;re gonna-
&gt;...
&gt;Your train of thought entirely derails at what you see in your living room.
&gt;Lounging on the floor, in a pile of soil, is... a cat-woman?  Her fur is a pale, creamy color.  But there&#039;s more to it than that.
&gt;Her body is covered with pink flowers of all sizes, and they seem to be... part of her?  Two even serve as tall, pointy ears, while some stamens act as whiskers.  Leaves also seem to sprout from parts of her body.
&gt;All that takes a backseat to her bones, though.  Her head seems to be a skull entirely, while her arms are skeletal from the elbow down.  Long, curved ribs erupt just below rather sizable breasts, protecting a slim waist.
&gt;Huge, glassy eyes focus on you, red pupils narrowing to slits.  She opens her mouth in a hiss, then suddenly clamps her jaw shut with a click.
&gt;She blinks a few times, absentmindedly running a bony hand along her curvy leg.  There&#039;s a long, awkward pause, then she speaks.
&gt;&quot;Myowl?  Friend?&quot;
&gt;She stares at you expectantly, floral ears twitching. 
&gt;&quot;Uhhh...&quot;
&gt;Your eyes roam over her body as she tilts her head, confused.
&gt;&quot;Are you not friend?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I, uh... I guess I am?  I-&quot;
&gt;She immediately leaps to her skeletal feet and charges at you, arms outstretched.  The cat embraces you tightly, bony arms digging into your back as she lets off a raspy purr.  Alarmingly, she&#039;s quite a bit taller than you.
&gt;&quot;Hi, friend.&quot;
&gt;Her fur feels like... very fine grass.  The various flowers running down her spine are definitely real, as well.  ...as are her bony arms and the ribs gently poking into your own chest.  The scent of a flower garden fills your head.
&gt;&quot;Mmmmmya... you&#039;re warm, friend~&quot;
&gt;&quot;Y-you too...&quot;
&gt;What the hell is going on here?  Are you hallucinating?  Surely not, right?  But then, how do you explain the woman hugging you right now?
&gt;She rubs her head against you affectionately, the bone scrubbing against your cheek, then sighs happily.
&gt;&quot;...friend, I&#039;m thirsty.  Can you water me?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Huh?  Sure, sure...&quot;
&gt;You wander into the kitchen as she lets go of you.  You scratch your head as you fill a glass of water for your... uh, friend?
&gt;When you return, she purrs again and gently takes the water from you.
&gt;&quot;Thanks!&quot;
&gt;She unceremoniously dumps the water down her chest, the liquid running down her front and dripping off her ribs.
&gt;&quot;Nyaahhh... that&#039;s better.  Now, friend, what we gonna do?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Huh?&quot;
&gt;&quot;We&#039;re friends, friend!  Friends do stuff together, so what we gonna do?&quot;

&gt;&quot;Uhhh... what do you want to do... Miss?&quot;
&gt;She chuckles, a high pitched, chirpy sort of sound.
&gt;&quot;My name&#039;s not Miss, silly friend!  I&#039;m Orchid!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Okay then, uh, Orchid.  What do you want to do?&quot;
&gt;Her smile fades slightly, her pupils dilating.
&gt;&quot;Uhhh...&quot;
&gt;She fidgets a little, eyes darting around the room nervously.
&gt;&quot;....n-not... not sure.  I-I wanna do what you wanna do, friend.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You don&#039;t have any preferences?&quot;
&gt;Her pupils expand farther as her expression becomes full-blown panic.
&gt;&quot;N-n-no, nya!  Whatever you want is fine!&quot;
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s wrong?  Just wanted your opinion...&quot;
&gt;She calms down slightly, eyes returning to normal slowly.
&gt;&quot;... I&#039;d like a movie, maybe?&quot;
&gt;She cringes, closing her eyes.
&gt;&quot;Alright, sounds fun.  Lemme see what&#039;s on Netflix.&quot;
&gt;She opens her eyes, an expression of wonder on her face.
&gt;&quot;You wanna do what I wanna do?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Of course.  Sounds fun to me.&quot;
&gt;&quot;...I thought you&#039;d wanna pick?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nahhh.  You&#039;re my guest, you pick.&quot;
&gt;She blinks a few times, then pulls you into another purring hug.

&gt;You put on a generic comedy film and hop onto the couch.  Orchid follows suit, leaning her rather slight weight on you.
&gt;&quot;What we watching, friend?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Uhh, I don&#039;t even remember the name, to be honest.&quot;
&gt;She laughs again, then rests her skull on your shoulder.
&gt;Your mind races, and you decide to question her.
&gt;&quot;How did you get here?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Grew, silly friend!  You planted me, remember?&quot;
&gt;Wait, what?
&gt;&quot;You grew from those seeds?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nyep!  Grow A Friend!&quot;
&gt;&quot;....how?&quot;
&gt;She frowns.
&gt;&quot;Uh... not sure?  Just know I grew, friend.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I... I see.  What&#039;s it like being a plant?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nice, nice; I like it.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Good, good.  Uh... why are you... bony?&quot;
&gt;Genuine confusion crosses her face.
&gt;&quot;Huh?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Your... face and arms?&quot;
&gt;&quot;What???&quot;
&gt;You gently take her hand and show it to her.
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t understand, friend.  I look like I&#039;m supposed to look.&quot;
&gt;&quot;...well, alright.  I was just worried.&quot;
&gt;She gasps, and her floral tail waves excitedly.
&gt;&quot;You were worried about me, friend?  You like me, you really do!&quot;
&gt;She practically impales you on her ribs, she hugs you so hard.

&gt;As the movie goes on, Orchid silently watches, purring loudly when you laugh.  She keeps her bony arms around you the whole time.
&gt;The movie ends, and she turns to you.
&gt;&quot;That was nice, friend!  Thanks for letting me join you.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Of course.  It was kinda nice to have someone here for once.&quot;
&gt;She tilts her head, frowning.
&gt;&quot;For once?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah, I don&#039;t get much company here.&quot;
&gt;Her frown deepens, and she suddenly hugs you close, burying your chin in her considerable, leafy cleavage.
&gt;&quot;My poor friend!  I&#039;m sorry you&#039;re lonesome, friend.  That&#039;s why I&#039;m here, though.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m fine, really, but thank you.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I wanna be your friend forever.  Nobody should have no friends.&quot;
&gt;...your heart fills with warmth as the plant-cat hugs you closer, purring.
&gt;&quot;Thank you, Orchid.  I think you&#039;re gonna be a good friend.&quot;
&gt;Her eyes light up with glee.
&gt;&quot;You think so?  Hooray!&quot;
&gt;She rubs her head against you happily.
&gt;&quot;Mmmya~ I hope we&#039;re best friends, friend.&quot;
&gt;You can&#039;t help but feel her growing on you.
&gt;Nobody around here has ever gave enough of a shit to try and make friends, and here this weird monster is offering unconditional companionship.
&gt;Well, hell.  You&#039;re not gonna turn that down because she&#039;s a little weird.  Besides, she&#039;s kinda cute.
&gt;&quot;You know what?  I think that&#039;ll happen sooner than you think, Orchid.&quot;

&gt;&quot;Hmm.  What do YOU wanna do, Orchid?&quot;
&gt;She puts a bony hand to her chin, then smiles.
&gt;With a giggle, she plants a skeletal kiss on your cheek.
&gt;&quot;...maybe another movie, too, friend?&quot;
&gt;You think you can handle that.  Anything for a friend.</textarea>
