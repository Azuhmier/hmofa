BY LAZ BRIAR


&gt;The duties of the Librarius Sola are particularly burdensome this week
&gt;You&#039;ve noticed, over the past few days, a series of older, human-written tomes have been transported to the 
private sanctum of Ofelia
&gt;As one of the only dutiful scribes available, it is you under pain of responsibility to find these scripts and 
deliver them to her
&gt;This is usually not a concern, yet, some of these texts linger in corners of the Librarius that you&#039;re 
surprised still exist
&gt;Even more surprising is their content - or perhaps lack of; you do not recognize ANY of the authors, and they 
seem to be musings of personal affairs
&gt;How strange, you think

&gt;Indeed, you are an apprentice scribe to Ofelia, Matriarch of Words
&gt;Or was it, Keeper of Grand Syntax?
&gt;No, no, perhaps Priestess of the Pale Scroll
&gt;Ah well, grand titles are common amongst the high-beasts in the capital of Solaria
&gt;It is befitting, you figure - she is, after all, a Pegasarii, one of the noble high servants Empress Eternal 

Karletta Frampt
&gt;She is a pegasarii and you but a human, caught in the grand white halls of service, specifically the 

Librarius, a massive codex of written works stretching throughout the Empire, perhaps farther
&gt;From this, you attend and nurture each book like a child, given the proper time
&gt;And make no mistake, this is a task fit not for everyone
&gt;Some of these books are massive; some inscribed in stone!
&gt;You move them, examine them, collect them, and store them
&gt;All under the whim of Ofelia

&gt;Despite the labors, you don&#039;t mind it
&gt;In fact, you find it quite exhilarating!
&gt;Some days you sneak a small book about the &quot;high-beasts,&quot; the noble blooded anthropoids who serve and guard 
the capital
&gt;In it are luxurious tales spun in grand epics; indeed, the pegasarii who fly on wings of fire, or the ember-
tailed vixens with burning lances, or the pale lions whose cries invoke the wrath of the sun itself
&gt;When you&#039;re lucky, sometimes there are personal accounts, and those accounts come with sketches
&gt;Ahh, you are always amazed - the high beasts are clad in intricate armor and weapons befitting only the 
strongest of warriors
&gt;You admit, you often look at the pegasarii a bit too long
&gt;It&#039;s hard not to
&gt;Ofelia is one, though retired from her noble services
&gt;To the eye she is an unassuming anthropoid mare at first glance
&gt;But upon second, the wielder of the gaze is treated to a lovely figure of snowy white horsehair crowned with a mane of strange reds
&gt;You say strange, because Ofelia&#039;s mane seems to shimmer like fire
&gt;Of course she is often in noble habit of gold and scarlet
&gt;And her wings, ahh! Mighty and lofty, fit for such a mythical creature
&gt;How she came upon the service of the Librarius Sola you aren&#039;t sure, but you don&#039;t complain

&gt;It&#039;s a new day, and after your morning sup of bread and cheese, you return to a task picked by Ofelia
&gt;She&#039;s requested one last book, somewhere in the aged columns of human indexes
&gt;You note she&#039;s been fascinated with them as of late, though you don&#039;t question it
&gt;Likely she is just conducting research; after all, there&#039;s more to Solaria than just low-beasts
&gt;At any rate, you go to the section of the Librarius, a lonely corner at one of the low levels
&gt;In it are tomes left unattended, mainly because they are loose patchworks of scribbles, random notes, poor 

attempts at novella, and you think a child&#039;s portrait of a knight
&gt;You are methodic, however, and finding the sum of Ofelia&#039;s intrigue is a task you are happy to comply with
&gt;After some sifting, you indeed catch the small thing, a dainty book wrapped in red
&gt;The title is worn beyond recognition - you only make out some of it
&gt;All you can compile is &quot;utra,&quot; and that appears to be in Low-Anglic
&gt;But, it fits Ofelia&#039;s definitions perfectly, and your careful eye confirms the rest
&gt;With tender care, you hoist the thing and return to the elevator mechanisms, heading to Ofelia&#039;s private 
quarters

&gt;The quarters are in the highest part of the indexes, a large circular room, filled with ornamentations and 
devices mysterious to you
&gt;A grand telescope sits on one side for the dissection of star-paths, while a center table is where Ofelia 
rests her current object of fancy
&gt;You enter with polite diligence, careful with your prize
&gt;&quot;Grand Mistress, I&#039;ve retrieved the tome, as you asked,&quot; you say, not quite seeing her
&gt;For a moment, you wonder if she isn&#039;t there; usually, she&#039;s occupied with something, and it&#039;s hard to miss the 
wings
&gt;You decided to place the book on her center desk - you&#039;re sure she&#039;ll find it
&gt;As you approach, you notice there are several tomes open, pages flicked through, bookmarked, read
&gt;It&#039;s not your business to mind the affairs of a pegasarii, but you are curious
&gt;Setting the book on the table, you take a gander, and. . .
&gt;Oh my
&gt;These are certainly the earlier passages you retrieved, but they&#039;re not what you expected
&gt;They&#039;re. . . adult in nature, to put it bluntly
&gt;The books have scribbled sketches and images, and in particular, of very &#039;compromising&#039; positions
&gt;To be blunt, they&#039;re quite erotic in nature
&gt;You hear a laugh
&gt;&quot;Finding the indexes interesting, student?&quot;
&gt;You jump, as Ofelia approaches from the side, wings fluttering as her hoofs click against the stone floor
&gt;&quot;Er, well. . .&quot;
&gt;You try to muster some words, but anything you might say paints a lie against your expression
&gt;Ofelia waives you off, amused
&gt;&quot;You needn&#039;t lie, student. I find them fascinating. Humans ponder such lustful things.&quot;
&gt;You clear your throat, stepping back
&gt;&quot;I suppose we do,&quot; you say
&gt;You attempt to shift the subject - &quot;I&#039;ve brought the passage you asked f-&quot;
&gt;Ofelia struts up to you, a smirk pulling at her lips
&gt;You forget how much larger she is than you, several hands by estimate, and her wings certainly make her 

daunting
&gt;&quot;I know what you brought, student.&quot;
&gt;She holds out her hand, expecting
&gt;At proximity, you can&#039;t help but notice her scarlet habit is more. . . exposed than usual
&gt;In fact, the split of her massive cleavage looms over you, her gentle breaths send the weighty breasts 

wobbling ever so gently
&gt;You try not to mind this, handing over the worn book
&gt;&quot;Ahem, well, it uh. Appears to have sustained some. . . damage. . .&quot;
&gt;She takes the piece and immediately begins flipping through it
&gt;Her scarlet eyes dance over the pages and you can see her smirk widen to a sinister smile
&gt;The white fur blossoms with blush as her cheeks flush
&gt;&quot;Yes, just what I was hoping to see. . .&quot; she says
&gt;You can only imagine what lingers on those pages, but, remembering yourself, you attempt to bow and leave
&gt;You don&#039;t know why, you feel you&#039;d rather stay and. . . look
&gt;&quot;If nothing else, Grand Mistress, I will uh, take my-&quot;
&gt;Her gaze snaps to you
&gt;&quot;Leave? Oh no, you&#039;ll do no such thing, student.&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re taken aback; what else could she need?
&gt;Setting the book aside, she looks you over with a grin most wicked
&gt;Her hands trail behind her, unfastening, and at once, her habit robes fall away
&gt;&quot;I need a plaything to sate my curiosity, after all.&quot;

&gt;&quot;Mistress! I-if the scarlet clerics happen upon me, surely I&#039;ll be flayed!&quot;
&gt;Ofelia has decided today, of all things, you are suited to a different task than just shuffling books
&gt;Keeper of pages she might be, the pegasarii is still imbued with strange magics
&gt;She&#039;s used them to, well, bind you, having clamped you to a bed
&gt;You&#039;ve been stripped and, to your embarrassment, exposed for her
&gt;Her nake, curvaceous figure sends wild thoughts through your mind
&gt;The fat rump and hefty bust are like something out of a dream, causing your malehood to spring up like a 
newborn tree
&gt;&quot;The scarlet clerics have better things to do.&quot;
&gt;It&#039;s clear Ofelia cares little for the regiments and routines of the Solarian orders; what terrible mischief!
&gt;Clamped on her large, luxurious bed, she approaches you, eyes tossing over your figure
&gt;&quot;Now then, what use can I get from you, I wonder. . . we&#039;ll need to do something with this, I think.&quot;
&gt;You grunt, frightened yet quite aroused, as she crawls over you, her finger coming to tap at the tip of your 
flank
&gt;&quot;I. . .&quot; You cannot find any words for this &quot;predicament,&quot; though, you feel yourself less interested in 
combatting the situation
&gt;A new sensation comes over you, however, like liquid warmth
&gt;Tendrils of gold wrap around your shaft, and to your immediate shock, you seem to be &quot;growing&quot; larger
&gt;It feels astounding, really, the whole of your loins trembling
&gt;Until, as soon as this &#039;enchantment&#039; began, your flesh is like that of a stallion
&gt;You now, quite literally, have a cock of glowing light
&gt;That&#039;s. . . different
&gt;The pegasarri seems pleased, taking her hand and immediately stroking the reforged mast
&gt;An amazed breath escapes you, as you squirm against the magical behinds, soft silky palm caressing your groin
&gt;&quot;This will do quite nicely, student. It&#039;s so hard finding any males with the strength to please me. So many 
broken, old men. But you. . .&quot;
&gt;Her face is wild, and now, her soft, moist lips come to your tip
&gt;Oh by Sol Solarius! Is she doing what you think she is?
&gt;Yes, she applies warm, mirthful kisses against the sides of your fiery cock, mumbling in adoration as she does
&gt;A tongue leaps to lap at the side, then the tip, watching you for reactions
&gt;You, of course, are beside yourself with pleasure
&gt;Not only is this strange, enchanted flesh larger, it&#039;s far more sensitive too, sending fields of tingling heat 
throughout its length every time Ofelia touches it
&gt;&quot;Gagggh! Grand Mi-&quot;
&gt;She scoffs, &quot;Oh, student, enough of the titles. They&#039;re such laborious things.&quot;
&gt;She practically hugs your length with her face, smothering the flesh into her cheek, her other palm carefully 
squeezing your testes
&gt;What wild sights! You can&#039;t believe what you&#039;re seeing; even the way your luminous shaft dimples her visage is 
such a strangely pleasing vision
&gt;You groan, practically humping the air, though the bindings on your wrists and ankles make things difficult
&gt;&quot;Ohh? You like that? Fascinating. There were so many pictorials of this act, student. Humans are such a 
creative, lustful bunch.&quot;
&gt;Laughing, she proceeds to wrap her lips about the tip, and here you practically buck
&gt;Her giggles are muffled, pinning you down as her maw begins to suckle and serve the bright inches, slurping 
against them
&gt;&quot;Ngnn! By the angels of Sol!&quot;
&gt;What else can you say, really? This is not what you could ever imagine
&gt;You watched with astounded enthuse as the pegasarii mare engulfs your flank, a sloppy chorus of muffled moans 
and mouth strokes filling the private chamber
&gt;Ofelia is staring at you with those blood red eyes, clearly amused, her throat bulging as the lance of light 
dives into her
&gt;Even her plump, white haunches sway and wiggle with her motions, like some bizarre conductor overseeing a 
sexual orchestra
&gt;Her nose flares as her mouth drapes over your enchanted flesh, down to the threshold, gulps and sloppy trails 
of saliva escaping her
&gt;&quot;Nnnf, b-by the golden hammer of Frampt!&quot;
&gt;Worse (or perhaps better) yet, you cannot seem to reach peak
&gt;Your cock is utterly sieged with the intense heat of an orgasm, yet you cannot seem to reach out
&gt;What torment! Is it the magic preventing you from doing so?
&gt;Perhaps Ofelia knows this, continuing to milk and toy with your flesh, her lips stroking every veiny inch with 
a craftsman&#039;s care
&gt;Finally, she slows her motions, releasing you with an audible pop, the luminous malehood drizzled with saliva
&gt;&quot;Agh, Ofelia, this is too much!&quot; you plead, the whole of your flesh trembling
&gt;She regards you with an amused grin
&gt;&quot;Oh? I think it can be much more, student.&quot;
&gt;You aren&#039;t sure what she means, but you don&#039;t know if you can take anymore!
&gt;&quot;W-what do you mean?&quot;
&gt;For a moment, she rises, sitting on you, her plump, soft rump resting just before the axis of your malehood
&gt;The weight is immense, but not overly so, though you are forced to gaze at her large, heavy tits
&gt;&quot;Ahh, it&#039;s a shame you are bound, otherwise, you could play with me.&quot;
&gt;She laughs a bit, taking her palms and tossing her immense bosom together
&gt;&quot;Perhaps for another time. . .&quot;
&gt;You groan, clenching your teeth; that&#039;s not fair! 
&gt;The pegasarri seems quite happy to torment you, rubbing her bottom against the immense light-cock
&gt;Her cheeks sandwich your loins a moment, and you can feel the sodden, moist warmth of her nether lips barely 
touch you
&gt;Agh! By the Bright Heavens! If you don&#039;t find release soon you may perish, you&#039;re sure of it!
&gt;Again, you try to hump, but the shimmering, magical coils holding you in place allow for no such thing
&gt;Bah! Damned magics
&gt;Worse, Ofelia has seen fit to lean just so, that her wobbling mantle and perky nips are but an inch from your 
face
&gt;What sins have you committed to possible deserve such a terrible torment?
&gt;&quot;Ofelia! Please! If you don&#039;t grant me release I&#039;ll die! I can&#039;t stand this!&quot;
&gt;For a moment, the winged mare ignores you, continuing to wiggle against your shaft
&gt;&quot;Ahh, I&#039;m only warming up, student.&quot;
&gt;She sighs, exchanging position once again (much to your chagrin, you were enjoying the view of her hefty tits)
&gt;&quot;But I suppose you should be rewarded for your labors. You at least have the stamina I desire. . .&quot;
&gt;Now, the grand mare has shifted to where her backside is visible
&gt;The immensity of her rump is quite easy to appreciate from the angle, as is the majestic splendor of her wings
&gt;She rises, only just so, that her adequately soft, plump pussy spreads into view
&gt;The nether lips now fondle the crown of your enchanced cock, sending small springs of aroused pleasure through 
you
&gt;&quot;By SOL!&quot;
&gt;Ofelia nickers, profoundly amused
&gt;It has only now dawned on you what is about to happen; a confidant of the Empress Eternal, a great warrior on 
wings of fire is about to mount you like some primal mate
&gt;Oh gods! There isn&#039;t a tome in all the Librarius which could&#039;ve prepared you for this!
&gt;&quot;Nnmmf. . . think I made you a bit large. . .&quot; mutters Ofelia
&gt;Her hips dance again, and her suckling snatch parts, the wet warmth of her tunnel now enveloping you
&gt;In one smooth, fluid motion, her bottom comes crashing upon your loins, and you&#039;re enveloped by her
&gt;&quot;Gah!&quot;
&gt;Oh by all the fields of Isarius, you wish you could reach out and grope those splendid hills of mare rump
&gt;Alas, you are at the mercy of her actions
&gt;Indeed, Ofelia begins to bounce her hips against your immense shaft of light
&gt;Each rise suckles your length while each crash sends a clap of impact which echoes throughout the bedroom 

chamber
&gt;&quot;Ohnff. . . student. . . it feels marvelous. . .&quot;
&gt;Ofelia&#039;s wings begin to flap, adding momentum to her falls and rises
&gt;Ah, and what&#039;s this? You hear her moan
&gt;Oh it&#039;s a sound greater than all the songs sung by the clerical priests
&gt;Though you are restrained, you fidget and squirm, doing your best to hump into the immense backside
&gt;Each motion causes healthy, jubilant jiggles to cascade through her bottom, yet another exciting vision
&gt;The pegasarii looks back to you, face flushed, exhaling with hot, whet groans as her hips dance against you
&gt;&quot;Ofelia! Agh!&quot;
&gt;Despite your vocation, you are truly at a loss for words
&gt;What an animal you are, nothing but a low-beast, despite your human heritage
&gt;The winged-mare enhances her pace, now bouncing wildly atop your luminescent cock
&gt;Her melodic moans are something out of a dream; to think, this powerful creature is pleased by you!
&gt;Oh, by Sol!
&gt;She&#039;s tossing her self like a rambunctious storm now, milking you dry
&gt;Agh! You can&#039;t take it anymore! Your enchanted flesh is roaring with an intensity like no other
&gt;It is so overwhelmingly good it actually *hurts*
&gt;You weren&#039;t meant to feel such incredible sensations!
&gt;&quot;Nnnff! student! Your lance. . . stronger than a hundred stallions!&quot;
&gt;Ofelia seems lost in her own estate of orgasmic delight; after all, you don&#039;t figure yourself an equine 
soldier

&gt;By all the fires!
&gt;It seems whatever &#039;lock&#039; was in place, were there such a thing, has released
&gt;And by proxy, so do you!
&gt;&quot;HNNGG!&quot;
&gt;Oh, heavens
&gt;You can feel the rivers of hot white utterly bursting from you
&gt;The emission is an utter deluge, Ofelia shouting with surprise as you drown her mare cunt with an excess of 
enchanted seed
&gt;That&#039;s certainly not you! You can hardly believe it yourself
&gt;And each dollop that escapes you, each &#039;wave&#039; creates tremors of tingling intensity bringing you over the edge
&gt;Again, the physical, pleasing intensity is so profound you are in a splendid agony
&gt;You can barely see yourself as Ofelia slams her lips against you, accepting every bit of seed you eject
&gt;Once you are spent, you breathe as though just hefting one of the ancient stone scriptures
&gt;&quot;B-by Sol above. . .&quot;
&gt;Ofelia has also ceased her motions, suckling cunny keeping you in place
&gt;Eventually, she does shift, her damp, pink pussy slipping from you, along with a trail of hot white
&gt;Oh heavens, thank goodness, it&#039;s over now
&gt;You don&#039;t think you can match the stamina of anything further
&gt;Ofelia stands now, turning to you
&gt;She&#039;s grinning
&gt;&quot;A good warm up, student.&quot;
&gt;Oh. . . no. . .

&gt;Ofelia spends the rest of the evening toying with you and the enchanted cock
&gt;It&#039;s a tormenting bliss
&gt;You&#039;re freed from your shackles, but only just so, allowed to fornicate with strange new positions she locates 
from the tomes you brought
&gt;She binds your neck with light, forcing you to fuck her while you push her ankles to her neck
&gt;Or, she has you mount her from behind, bouncing into her soft pucker
&gt;Your coated with sweat, and each time you think you&#039;re spent, she forces magic into the pulp of your essence 
and grants you renewed vigor
&gt;This goes on for. . . well, frankly, you can&#039;t even keep track of time
&gt;You think, eventually, you&#039;re allowed to rest
&gt;The private chamber is a mess of ejaculate and Sol knows what else
&gt;You hope Ofelia can speak on your behalf, because the other Librarius Sola attendants won&#039;t find your absence 
amusing
&gt;Well, perhaps it would be worth it
&gt;To have mated with a pegasarii - ah, be damned, it would be worth a flaying from the clerics
&gt;You fall asleep again

&gt;At some point, Ofelia wakes you
&gt;To your relief, you are allowed to feed and bathe, along with the assurance no one will disturb you
&gt;You go to clean in her water-room, thankful for the hot water
&gt;You return, only to find Ofelia in the main chamber, nake once more, bending over
&gt;You notice something, however
&gt;This time, it&#039;s HER ankles and wrists which are bound by magical light
&gt;&quot;Your turn,&quot; she announces with a devilish smirk

&gt;Oh, by the sun</textarea>
