        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Be Staff Sergeant Anon
&gt;Wait no, Just Anon now
&gt;The service said they no longer needed you after the Lazing incident
&gt;Fucking insurgents and their god damned Laser pointers burned out your right retina
&gt;You can see out of your right eye but not was well as before
&gt;So now you are just Anon, College student
&gt;And you already hated it
&gt;Turns out you don&#039;t actually use algebra in real life and having not used it in nearly 10 years means you totally forgot it
&gt;So here you are in College Algebra, the most basic math course the college offers.
&gt;Of course you&#039;re in class 15 minutes early
&gt;Slowly others begin to show up
&gt;Anthros and humans.
&gt;You never had much experience with Anthros in the service, not many signed up
&gt;They slowly start filling in seats away from you, you guess your scowl scared them off
&gt;Eventually the only seat left is the one next to you, you don&#039;t care either way but you wish you didn&#039;t need this class for your degree
&gt;An Anthro comes in and looks around, She looks like a snow leopard but you&#039;re not totally sure
&gt;She looks to be a head shorter than you, but that&#039;s not saying much as you are 6&#039;5 and nearly everyone is shorter than you, she&#039;s wearing a black hoodie that says &quot;school&quot; in white lettering as well as loose fitting jeans and black rimmed glasses 
&gt;She looks chubby-ish but it&#039;s hard to tell because of all the loose fitting clothing
&gt;She frowns slightly when she sees the only seat available is the one next to you
&gt;Iuch your ego says
&gt;Still she takes the seat and fiddles nervously with her bag, when you notice somethings about her bag that doesn&#039;t shock you but intrigues you
&gt;Its covered in various video game pins that you recognize and play
&gt;Bioshock, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, various Pokemon pins and a few of the badges and a few you don&#039;t recognize
&gt;She might be a bigger nerd than you are and that&#039;s saying something
&gt; &quot;I like all the pins you&#039;ve collected&quot; you say to her &quot;Bloodborne was one of my favorite games&quot;
&gt;She jumps slightly and says &quot;huh?&quot; 
&gt;She looks confused, like she never expected anyone to talk to her
&gt;&quot;Your Pins&quot; you point at her bag &quot;Those are a bunch of games I&#039;ve played and even streamed&quot; 
&gt;She looks at you for a moment, like shes re-assessing you, you guess she didn&#039;t think you were a gamer.  &quot;You&#039;re a streamer?&quot; she asks in a non believing manner.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not popular or anything but yes I play and stream games in my free time&quot; you reply &quot;Why? is it really that hard to believe I play video games?&quot; 
&gt;You raise an eyebrow at her questioningly
&gt;&quot;W-well no&quot; she answers looking a little flustered that &quot;I just would expect you to be the football game or COD bro type of guy, you look the part anyway&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s got a point, you are wearing a &quot;Check Meowt&quot; tank with a cat on the front.
&gt;&quot;Well I guess you can&#039;t quite judge a book by its cover now can you&quot; you say to her &quot;I&#039;m Anon by the way&quot;
&gt;You extend your hand to her
&gt;She shakes it briefly &quot;Clara&quot;
&gt;Looks like Class is starting but you&#039;re already feeling a bit better about it

~~~~~~~~

After class
&gt;&quot;Well that was a waste of time&quot; you say out loud to yourself as people start packing up.
&gt;Clara Snickers at that
&gt;&quot;How long has it been since you took any college?&quot; she asks you
&gt;&quot;Never did&quot; you reply &quot;I joined the military right after high school&quot;
&gt;&quot;You were in the military?&quot; She asks a bit surprised
&gt;She looks like shes re-assessing you again
&gt;&quot;Yea, I served and deployed a few times&quot; you reply as you stand up
&gt;She&#039;s gawking at you from her seat, her mouth slightly open
&gt;&quot;What?&quot; you ask confusedly
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re TALL&quot; She says as she stand up
&gt;You were right you are about a foot taller than her
&gt;&quot;How observant of you&quot; you say jokingly
&gt;She&#039;s still looking up and down you
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ve just never seen a Human this tall in real life&quot; she says looking up at you, beaming
&gt;She did have a point, you were tall for a human and she probably grew up around giraffe or elephant anthros; to see a tall human clearly amazes her
&gt;You blow air out your nose in a short laugh &quot;well, here I am&quot; you say raising your arms and spinning around for her to see
&gt;A difficult task with all the desks in the way
&gt;&quot;Anyway whens your next class?&quot; you ask her &quot;Wanna grab lunch? I don&#039;t have class for another 2 hours&quot;
&gt;Her eye widen slightly at the question
&gt;&quot;M-me? Lunch? W-with you?&quot; She stammers out looking somewhat bewildered
&gt;&quot;Uhh yes?&quot; you ask questioningly &quot;Is that a problem? I mean I would rather have company while eating and have some good conversation&quot;
&gt;&quot;Uhm it&#039;s just that..&quot; she pauses unsure of what to say next &quot;Humans and Anthros don&#039;t usually commingle, a bunch of humans still hate Us, and some states are trying to outlaw interspecies relationships all together&quot;
&gt;&quot;Fuck em&quot; you say bluntly &quot;I served to protect their right to say whatever, but I don&#039;t have to agree with them, besides I asked you to go to lunch, not a romantic candlelit dinner&quot;
&gt;She laughs at that last part &quot;Ok ok I see your point&quot; she relents &quot;I don&#039;t have another class for a little while&quot;
&gt;&quot;Alright then let&#039;s get moving&quot; you say as you bow like an usher motioning towards the classroom door &quot;I have just the place in mind&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh really?&quot; She looks at you questioningly &quot;What were you thinking?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I know this awesome sushi joint with all you can eat lunch specials for military and veterans&quot; you respond, walking to the parking lot where you parked your jeep
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not a veteran though&quot; she says dejectedly &quot;It&#039;s all you can eat for you but not for me&quot; 
&gt;She looks disappointed
&gt;&quot;I know you aren&#039;t a veteran&quot; you laugh &quot;That&#039;s why it&#039;s my treat. They still have all you can eat for non military folk but it&#039;s a little more expensive&quot;
&gt;Her ears perk up at this &quot;You don&#039;t have to do that&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yea but I want to, I&#039;m the one who asked you to lunch after all&quot; you say confidently as you unlock the jeep
&gt;You get in as she climbs into the jeep and you start it up, it gives a slight roar that causes Clara to jump slightly
&gt;&quot;Sorry, I should have warned you about that. I&#039;ve been working on this jeep as a hobby&quot; you say apologetically
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t be sorry&quot; she says with a laugh as she puts her pin covered bag in the back seat &quot;It Just surprised me that&#039;s all, and more to my point of you don&#039;t seem like a hardcore gaming kind of guy&quot;
&gt;You raise your eyebrow questioningly as you pull out of the parking lot
&gt;&quot;I mean, you were military, you fix cars, and you dress like a total Bro, if you excuse the term, next thing you&#039;ll say is you lift weights everyday&quot;
&gt;&quot;Actually.....&quot; you start so say
&gt;She cuts you off &quot;You do lift weights?!?&quot; She laughs, &quot;You&#039;re either a total liar or the most contradictory nerd I&#039;ve ever met. you aren&#039;t one of those &quot;Do you even lift&quot; guys are you?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m more one of those &quot;doth thou even Hoist guys&quot;&quot; you respond with a laugh &quot;I like what I like, and here&quot; you hand her your phone &quot;You can see all the videos on my youtube channel&quot; 
&gt;She spends the rest of the ride Criticizing your techniques in Bloodborne and dark souls
~At the restaurant~
&gt;She&#039;s staring at you amazed
&gt;&quot;I can&#039;t believe you ate all that&quot; she says as she motions to the Stack of 15 small sushi Plates
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m a big guy&quot; you respond trying to sound hurt &quot;Besides the portions are small&quot;
&gt;&quot;But that&quot; she motions again with her arms wide &quot;That&#039;s ridiculous&quot;
&gt;She looks at her five plates, she had only eaten 4 and a half technically. You finished the rest of it.
&gt;&quot;Are all humans bottomless pits?&quot; she asks you, eyes wide as though she&#039;s made a stunning revelation
&gt;&quot;Naw, just the ones who need the protein for gains&quot; you almost laugh as you say that because you flex when you say Gains
&gt;This lunch was awesome for you, you had great company and got to eat a ton of your favorite food
&gt;There were some odd Stares but a sharp look from you put an end to that
&gt;You still got that command presence down
&gt;She&#039;s Laughing at your flexing and a few tables look over
&gt;You see an elderly couple to your left frown at you, then bury their face in their Menus
&gt;You casually glance to you right and see a couple of lion Anthros giving you the evil eye.
&gt;&quot;I guess I see what you mean&quot; you say at a low volume
&gt;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she says
&gt;You do a quick head nod in the lions direction
&gt;She looks over none to subtly and looks back at you then sighs
&gt;&quot;Haven&#039;t you seen this stuff before?&quot; she asks flatly &quot;It&#039;s a little odd to see a Human eating with a Snow leopard&quot; 
&gt;Aha She is a snow leopard, that would have been an awkward question
&gt;You push that thought aside &quot;No I can&#039;t say I have, I didn&#039;t run into Anthros in the service and before then I was just a dumb teen and never noticed I guess&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Does it bother you at all? I mean the Humans over there must think so low of you, and the Lions are probably saying i&#039;m a traitor&quot; she says all that so matter-of-fact you give pause
&gt;&quot;Fuck em&quot; you say again 
&gt;She stares at you dumbfounded
&gt;&quot;Who cares what people think? they&#039;ve been fighting about who can be with who since the fucking civil war&quot; you state bluntly
&gt;She looks dumbfounded still, like a deer in the headlights
&gt;&quot;As long as you&#039;re happy with the person you&#039;re with, who cares&quot; you say shrugging
&gt;She still dumbfounded but then looks questioningly at you, while scratching her chin, Her tail flicking softly behind her
&gt;&quot;I hadn&#039;t thought about it like that.&quot; she says finally
&gt;You grin at her
&gt;&quot;Anyway back to what matters, let&#039;s get back to campus, you still have your class and I have mine in like 20 minutes&quot; you say
&gt;You already paid the check and didn&#039;t let her see how much it was, your food was only $10 and hers was about $20, still you didn&#039;t want her to feel guilty about it
&gt;You move out of the booth and help her out as well 
&gt;&quot;So gentlemanly&quot; she mocks you playfully
&gt;So in proper accordance you Also hold open the restaurant door and open the jeep door for her
&gt;She&#039;s trying not to laugh at it all
&gt;You drive back to campus, talking about random shit
&gt;You drop her off in front of the building her class is in
&gt;&quot;Thank you for a wonderful lunch Anon&quot; she says as she hands you a piece of paper
&gt;&quot;Whats this&quot; you ask as you look at the paper, only then noticing its a phone number
GOT DEM DIGITS YO
&gt;&quot;My Phone Number and my PawsApp address&quot; she says as she looks a bit flustered
&gt;You swear you can see her blushing through her fur
&gt;You smile at her
&gt;&quot;Well I guess that means I get to see more of you then&quot; you say with a smile
&gt;You can definitely see her blushing now
&gt;&quot;Yes&quot; she says loudly trying to look mean, but instead looking cute. &quot;Now go to your class and don&#039;t be late!&quot; 
&gt;You throw up a mock Salute at her &quot;YES MA&#039;AM&quot; you shout
&gt;She facepaws and and turns and walks away, turning about halfway to the building to give you a beautiful smile and a wave.
&gt;You start driving to your next class.
&gt;Maybe college won&#039;t be so bad after all


&gt;It&#039;s been about 2 weeks since you and Clara first spoke and had lunch together
&gt;Every time you have a class break together (which is fairly often even though you only share one class, the college sets up times like that) you sit and chat or go get lunch
&gt;You learn a lot about her
&gt;She&#039;s going to school to become a nurse
&gt;Her parents immigrated from Mongolia but she was born in the US
&gt;Not that you would care, you aren&#039;t all &quot;THEY TUK OR JERBS&quot;
&gt;Your time with her is awesome and a thing you look forward too
&gt;Speaking of which shes sitting next to you at a small burger joint
&gt;&quot;So Anon, what do you think of this place&quot; She asks smugly &quot;Better than the one you suggested last week huh?&quot;
&gt;You&#039;ve been trying to outdo each other with the best food places
&gt;You sigh in defeat &quot;Yes, you win this round&quot; 
&gt;She flicks her ears and her tail flicks against you
&gt;&quot;By the way, isn&#039;t today the day you usually have class longer than me&quot; she asks
&gt;You think a moment. It&#039;s Thursday which means you have your two 3 hours classes while she only has a 3 hour class followed by her 1.5 hour class
&gt;&quot;Yea why?&quot; you finally respond, raising an eyebrow questioningly
&gt;She knew that already why would she ask that ?
&gt;&quot;I want to run home and then when you get out can you come pick me up? I wanna make us dinner&quot; She says practically bouncing in excitement
&gt;&quot;Uh sure, that&#039;s kinda sudden though, not that i mind, what&#039;s the occasion?&quot;
&gt;&quot;My mom taught me a new recipe from Mongolia and I want to try to make it!&quot; she says so excitedly she literally is bouncing now, her paws on her cheeks as she talks.
&gt;You smile at that. she always does that when she gets super excited about something
&gt;Like when you showed her the shiny promotional Aegislash on pokemon Y 
&gt;You snap back to focusing on her, she&#039;s so excited about this, its adorable
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll have the ingredients for Mongolian food though&quot; You say, rubbing your chin
&gt;Stubble, you haven&#039;t shaved in 2 weeks except tidying up
&gt;Years in the military meant you had not been able to grow any proper facial hair besides an 80&#039;s pornstar mustache
&gt;She waves a paw at you dismissively, &quot;I&#039;ll pick up what I need at the asian food market near my place&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s a date then&quot; you say and you watch her ears flutter and look away from you nervously
&gt;By now her reservations about being seen with you have disappeared, but you can still get those shy responses if you push the right buttons
&gt;&quot;Good&quot; she says looking back at you with a snap, her tail swishing side to side
&gt;You check your watch and see it&#039;s about time to head back to class
~~~~~~
During class
&gt;You&#039;re in your Humanities class trying to take notes
&gt;It&#039;s something about gender relations between Anthros and Humans
&gt;One of the male wolf anthros in the class is ranting about how many female Anthros are choosing to date humans
&gt;It&#039;s basically the &quot;black men be stealing our wimminz&quot; rant you&#039;ve heard a thousand times online
&gt;Your mind drifts to Clara
&gt;It&#039;s not totally unexpected that she wants to come to your place, it&#039;s just the reason threw you off
&gt;She never once has told you she likes cooking, nor has she ever told you she likes Mongolian food
&gt;You shouldn&#039;t be surprised though, her parents are from Mongolia
&gt;You snap back to reality, wolf boy is still ranting 
&gt;&quot;And even my sister came home with a human!&quot; he snaps angrily at almost a yell &quot;She finds a Human roommate near her college, lives with him for like 2 weeks than comes home during holiday saying her and him are a couple&quot;
&gt;You can&#039;t hold your tongue as you say &quot;Why do you care? Are you trying to date your sister?&quot; 
&gt;Snickers from the crowd
&gt;He turns to you &quot;Yea its super funny for you human, but some of us don&#039;t like Interspecies relationships&quot; he snaps
&gt;&quot;I seem to recall Nazis not liking Mixed race relationships either&quot; you say calmly &quot;You don&#039;t choose who you love&quot;
&gt;He looks mad but doesn&#039;t say anything
&gt;You smirk and go back to typing notes from the powerpoint slide.
~~~~
After class
&gt;Your phone bings at you as you walk out of the building
&gt;PawsApp says you have a new message from Clara
&gt;It&#039;s her Address
&gt;It&#039;s in the Arthro District unsurprisingly
&gt;What does surprise you is her next Message
&gt;&quot;Park a few blocks away down the corner&quot; it says
&gt;You frown slightly, unsure what to make of it but you type the message &quot;Ok I&#039;ll see you there&quot; while walking to your jeep
&gt;Walking and texting, walking while eating or drinking. These are new to you again.
&gt;In the service you have it ingrained into you that you walk to walk, if you need to use the phone you stop walking.
&gt;You hop into the jeep and rev it up, then pull out of your parking spot thinking about all the things you missed while being in the service 
&gt;You&#039;re so deep in thought that you barely notice that you&#039;re already by her house
&gt;You open up PawsApp and type &quot;Hey, I&#039;m where you wanted me to be&quot; 
&gt;You get a response almost instantly
&gt;&quot;Great! See you in a minute&quot;
&gt;You smile and wait
&gt;After about a minute or so, you see her carrying a few bags, and you&#039;re almost shocked
&gt;Not because of bags, but whats shes wearing
&gt;She usually wears baggy clothes that hide her features but not now
&gt;She&#039;s wearing a red t shirt that is tight on her breasts that says &quot;Come to the dark side we have bacon&quot; with Darth Vader on it
&gt;Vaders face is stretched out by Her grapefruit sized breasts, which you hadn&#039;t been able to full appreciate the size of until now
&gt;She&#039;s also wearing some jean shorts, or are they capris? You never did know the difference but you can see her hips are perfect in every way.
&gt;You stare mouth slightly agape until you snap yourself out of it, get out of the jeep and walk over to meet her
&gt;&quot;Well hello there&quot; you say in a playful voice as you take the bags from her and start walking her back to the jeep
&gt;&quot;Oh shut up you&quot; she says as she climbs in, 
&gt;You throw the bags in the back and start the jeep up
&gt;She doesn&#039;t jump anymore when you start it
&gt;You pull away from the curb and start to drive 
&gt;You notice people and Anthros staring
&gt;Most seem a little confused, like they don&#039;t quite understand what they are seeing
&gt;A few smile
&gt;Some look downright angry
&gt;You smile at that 
&gt;Their tears are delicious 
&gt;&quot;Hey, can we make a quick pit stop?&quot; Clara asks nervously
&gt;You look over at her and see her tail swishing side to side 
&gt;&quot;Yea sure, but you gotta tell me what that was all about&quot; you say sternly
&gt;&quot;What what was about&quot; she says without looking at you, her ears flat
&gt;&quot;The whole park 2 blocks away and around the corner deal&quot; you say flatly, 
&gt;You want to look at her, but god dammit you also don&#039;t want to crash
&gt;Not crashing is more important
&gt;Clara is more interesting though
&gt;&quot;My...Dad...&quot; she pauses for a few seconds, trying to figure out what to say in the best way &quot;He doesn&#039;t like humans much, still doesn&#039;t forgive them, after all they are the reason he and mom fled Mongolia&quot;
&gt;You remember reading about how bad it was for anthros in some other countries, some still having segregation
&gt;You sneak a peek at her out of the corner of your eye
&gt;She&#039;s looking at her paws, ears as flat as they could go.
&gt;&quot;Hey hey hey&quot; you say in a comforting tone, reaching over and rubbing the ear you could reach &quot;It&#039;s not big deal, I was just curious&quot;
&gt;She perks up a bit at that
&gt;&quot;Now about that pit stop you wanted, I thought you got everything at that asian store?&quot; you ask
&gt;&quot;Oh well, uhm, yea I did but I wanted to go to..&quot; she trails off, her tail flicking adorably like it always does what she&#039;s embarrassed
&gt;&quot;Go to ...&quot; you lead her on, rolling your hand at her to continue 
&gt;She Buries her face in her paws &quot;Fue winnkaer sttoww&quot; she says through her Paws, tail still flicking.
&gt;&quot;What?&quot; you ask &quot;I can&#039;t hear you through your paws. Come on, I&#039;m not gonna make you feel bad about it so spit it out&quot;
&gt;She brings her face out of her paws and says sternly &quot;The Liquor Store&quot;
&gt;Hm she never really talked about drinking before, your stories of your old unit having a bar built into the HQ must&#039;ve rubbed off.
&gt;&quot;Sure I know of one by my place&quot; you say 
&gt;She looks at you in a questioning way
&gt;&quot;What?? Come on, I can get drinks when I want! I&#039;m an adult!&quot; you say defensively
&gt;She laughs and flicks her tail at you gently
&gt;&quot;I know you&#039;re an adult, I just didn&#039;t think you drank THAT often&quot; she says playfully
&gt;&quot;One of my streamed series is Drunk Dark souls&quot; you say to her, shooing her tail away from your face
&gt;&quot;That sounds like an excuse to get drunk and play video games&quot; she laughs,
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s exactly what it is&quot; you say with a smile
&gt;It isn&#039;t very long before you pull into the Parking lot of the liquor
&gt;You park and get out of the jeep then walk over to the front door and hold it open for Clara
&gt;&quot;Anon, How are you Brother!&quot; a camel Anthro with a thick accent waves to you
&gt;&quot;Not bad Ali, how are you&quot; you say as you fist bump him
&gt;Fist hoove?
&gt;Whatever
&gt;&quot;Who is your lovely friend?&quot; he says looking at Clara
&gt;&quot;She&#039;s a friend from college&quot; you say to him
&gt;Ali looks at you questioningly 
&gt;&quot;Mhmmm&quot; he says smugly at you
&gt;You look at him sternly and he turns around wearing a big stupid smug smirk
&gt;You walk over to Clara who is looking at the shelves of Liquors
&gt;She looks overwhelmed
&gt;&quot;What? Do you not know what to get?&quot; you ask as you grab a bottle of Kraken rum
&gt;&quot;I.. Uh. No. I don&#039;t drink much and usually, it&#039;s because my friends offer me some spiked punch&quot; she says, her tails flicking slightly &quot;I&#039;ll just have some of what you have there&quot;
&gt;That seems like a bad idea 
&gt;&quot;Uhm, I think it may be a little strong for you&quot; you say looking down at her
&gt;She angrily pouts at you
&gt;&quot;What do you suggest then?&quot; she says crossing her arms, her tail is swishing like she&#039;s annoyed by that comment
&gt;You grab a bottle of pineapple rum
&gt;&quot;You like pineapples right?&quot; you ask as you walk to the counter
&gt;You knew she did, she told you it was her favorite fruit
&gt;&quot;Yes!&quot; she says with a giddy bounce 
&gt; Ali rings it up
&gt;&quot;I got the drinks since you bought stuff to make dinner&quot; you say bluntly
&gt;&quot;Fair enough&quot; she replies
&gt;Ali is still smirking at you as you swipe your card.
&gt;He bags up your bottles, give you another fist bump and and says &quot;Have a nice night my friend&quot;
&gt;&quot;Thanks you too&quot; you say over your shoulder as you leave the shop
&gt;Clara is already by the jeep, doing her excited bounce &quot;This is going to be great&quot; she says 
&gt;You hop into the jeep, turn it on and start driving to your house
&gt;&quot;So Ali owns that shop?&quot; Clara asks you &quot;I didn&#039;t expect any Anthros outside the district&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yea, he and his brother own the store&quot; you say as you drive &quot;No one says Anthros have to live in the district, he chose to open a liquor store because even if someone is a speciest they still want their booze&quot;
&gt;&quot;Smart&quot; She says &quot;Everyone loves booze&quot;
&gt;You laugh &quot;Anyway we&#039;re getting close&quot;
&gt;You pull down a road and pull into your driveway
&gt;She gawks at your house
&gt;&quot;What? Is something wrong&quot; you look at her 
&gt;She&#039;s still sitting in the Jeep, she looks at your Old El Camino parked next to the Jeep, your house and your yard
&gt;&quot;You Live here?!?&quot; She asks looking amazed like the first time you met
&gt;You&#039;re slightly taken aback
&gt;&quot;Ummm...yes?&quot; you don&#039;t really know how to respond
&gt;Your house is just a basic single story 3 bedroom house you bought when you were in the service. hooray VA home loans
&gt;&quot;You Live in a house?! By yourself? A FULL stand alone house?&quot; she&#039;s getting out of the house and gawking at you and the house
&gt;&quot;Is that bad?&quot; you ask, still confused
&gt;&quot;No! It&#039;s just I expected you to live in an apartment or something, not rent a house by yourself&quot; she seems to have snapped out of the trance she was in 
&gt;&quot;Oh... Well I don&#039;t rent it. I own it&quot; you say, unlocking the door as you talk
&gt;She follows you in and looks around
&gt;She still looks shocked but her tail is swishing in curiosity
&gt;You take the food to the Kitchen and put it in the fridge, no need to unbag it since she&#039;s going to take it all out
&gt;&quot;You want a tour?&quot; you call out
&gt;You wait for a reply, but get none
&gt;You turn around and find...Nothing
&gt;Where is she?
&gt;You decide to look for her and go room to room
&gt;Main room? Nope
&gt;Game room? Nope
&gt;Office? Nope
&gt;Bathroom light is off
&gt;Bedroom? Check....
&gt;She&#039;s laying on your bed, her face smashed into your pillow sniffing deeply
&gt;&quot;Clara?&quot; 
&gt;You walk up and put a hand on her back and she jumps slightly
&gt;&quot;Wha? Uh...Sorry&quot; her ears go flat and her tail flicks &quot;It smells good.&quot;
&gt;Not what you expected, but not a bad thing
&gt;You bend down and lift her from the bed
&gt;&quot;Come on I&#039;ll give you a tour&quot;
~~~
Later that Night
&gt;Clara is bouncing around your kitchen with her apron on, cooking whatever she decided to make
&gt;you didn&#039;t even know she brought an apron
&gt;She&#039;s had quite a bit to drink too. 
&gt;She asked to mix a rum and coke and then another.. Then another and another.
&gt;She tried your rum too 
&gt;Her fur and tail all puffed out in disgust
&gt;You guess it was too strong for her even if her reaction was adorable
&gt;But she loves the pineapple rum
&gt;A bit much too much though as she mixes herself another rum and coke while cooking
&gt;She has you sitting in your main room playing games while she cooks, so she can watch you and you her
&gt;Still she&#039;s happily bouncing around your kitchen.
&gt;The smells from the kitchen are.....Interesting
&gt;She finally brings out a plate of....Something
&gt;&quot;Eat up&quot; She says, slurring her words 
&gt;She&#039;s smiling and proud of herself for making....Whatever this is
&gt;&quot;Uhm Clara what is this?&quot; you ask her poking the...Whatever it is she made
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s Chanasan Makh!&quot; she stumbles a bit and falls onto the couch
&gt;You&#039;re concerned now.
&gt;&quot;Hey Clara, I think you might have had a bit much to drink babe&quot; you say as you stand up
&gt;You go over to her
&gt;She lays on the couch and has wiggled out of her apron 
&gt;Her shirt has creeped up, exposing her tummy with is only slightly chubby but it just the right amount of chub
&gt;You reach down to help her up
&gt;&quot;Come on, let&#039;s get you to bed&quot; you say
&gt;You gently but firmly grab her arm and start to help her up
&gt;She has other plans
&gt;She pulls you down instead
&gt;You may be bigger than her but you weren&#039;t expecting this and your center of gravity was totally off 
&gt;You fall over and she&#039;s on top of you in a flash
&gt;&quot;You called me babbbeee&quot; she says in a singsong voice; wobbling a little as she straddles you
&gt;She pulls off the red star wars shirt revealing a black bra and those wonderful grapefruit sized breasts
&gt;&quot;This isn&#039;t right, shes drunk&quot; you think to yourself
&gt;She falls forward onto you and kisses you
&gt;Well she tries, she puts her lips over your nose and upper lips, her fangs give a slight cut to the side of your nose
&gt;&quot;C-Clara! Stop come on&quot; You gasp out &quot;You&#039;re drunk and this isn&#039;t right&quot;
&gt;&quot;Kitty wants what she wants&quot; she growls gently
&gt;She&#039;s trying to kiss down your neck
&gt;You&#039;re wondering what you should do when the answer is presented to you
&gt;Painfully
&gt;She collapses on top of you and starts snoring softly
&gt;You&#039;re relieved, but her full weight surprised you and knocked the wind out of you
&gt;Well ok, you have a passed out half naked, drunk Snow leopard on top of you.
&gt;That&#039;s the strangest sentence you&#039;re ever had to think
&gt;Well could be worse
&gt;You roll over, careful to support Clara&#039;s head and you place her on the couch
&gt;She&#039;s going to hate the morning
&gt;You scoop her up with little effort and carry her to the bedroom
&gt;Has her fur always been this soft? 
&gt;You tuck her into one side of your extra long king size bed (your feet hang off the edge on anything smaller and it&#039;s hard to find extra long twins)
&gt;She&#039;s still snoring softly as you leave the room to check the damage from her &quot;cooking&quot;
&gt;The kitchen looks like a mess, but most of it is throw away scraps of whatever meat this is
&gt;Is this tripe? Are those gizzards? What was she making?
&gt;You clean up and grab 4 water bottles out of your fridge and chug one down as you walk to the bedroom
&gt;Hangovers happen because your body loses too much water and gets dehydrated 
&gt;You had some alcohol but still are buzzed, and would rather avoid a stinging headache in the morning because you&#039;re going to have to nurse Clara back to health
&gt;You set the 3 remaining water bottles on a bedside table near her
&gt;You go back to the kitchen, make a sandwich and munch on it slowly, thinking about what happened
&gt;She came onto you strong, you can tell she never drank like that before
&gt;Did she take the term liquid courage too literally?
&gt;Your head is buzzing with questions as you lay down next to her in the bed

The next morning

&gt;You awake at 7 am like always
&gt;Even without an alarm you still get up at 7, habits die hard 
&gt;Clara is still sleeping but it looks like she drank one of the 3 water bottles in her sleep
&gt;You know it won&#039;t be enough
&gt;You get up throw on a Muscle shirt (it says &quot;show me your Kitties&quot;, you got it just to show Clara) and some shorts
&gt;You go get water bottle from the fridge and start to drink from it
&gt;You open the front door and make sure the screen is locked and open the back door to get a cool breeze through the house
&gt;Gotta get that smell from whatever Clara tried to make out of the house
&gt;&quot;Uuuuugggghhhh&quot; you hear a moan from the bedroom
&gt;Welp it&#039;s time
&gt;You go back into the bedroom
&gt;Clara is awake 
&gt;Barely
&gt;&quot;A-anon?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes Clara?&quot; you answer her moan, shes cute even when shes hungover
&gt;&quot;What happened last night? Did we.......Did we do it?&quot; she groans &quot;Ugh the room is spinning&quot;
&gt;&quot;Here&quot; you move her leg softly so that one paw is flat on the ground
the room spinning is your body trying to center itself or something, but if you place a foot flat on the floor the spinning will stop
&gt;Soft fur
&gt;She sits up quickly
&gt;&quot;Bathroom!&quot; She yelps
&gt;You point it out, and she&#039;s out of the bed running to it
&gt;You hear her dry heave a few times then start puking up whatever is in her stomach
&gt;You go and hold her hair and rub her back gently
&gt;She&#039;s still just wearing her jeans and bra
&gt;Soft fur
&gt;&quot;Ughh, I made a fool out of myself last night, didn&#039;t I?&quot; she moans
&gt;She still has her face down in the toilet
&gt;&quot;Yea a bit&quot; you say bluntly
&gt;No need to sugar coat it
&gt;&quot;Were you trying to out drink me? You were pounding those drinks down Clara&quot; 
&gt;She&#039;s quiet
&gt;&quot;I...I just wanted to have fun with you and...You know&quot; She says looking up at you from the toilet &quot;I was nervous and my friends from school said try to drink a bit&quot;
&gt;You rub your right hand on your face and keep the left one rubbing Clara&#039;s back
&gt;&quot;Clara, the key is a bit, not drink to the point where you blackout, besides you don&#039;t want your first time to be a night you don&#039;t even remember&quot;
&gt;She winces slightly at your words, her ears are flat and her tail is flicking slightly
&gt;&quot;Who told you I was a virgin?&quot; she says looking up from the toilet before immediately going face down into it and puking more
&gt;&quot;What? I meant first time with someone that isn&#039;t a one night stand. You&#039;re a virgin?&quot; you say in a confused tone
&gt;She nods into the toilet
&gt;That explains that
&gt;&quot;The human guys at my school were either total jocks or creepy neckbeards and the Anthros liked to stick to their own species&quot; she seemed to want to justify why, but you didn&#039;t care why
&gt;You had a virgin Snow leopard here who wanted you but was scared of it all
&gt;You sigh
&gt;&quot;Clara&quot;
&gt;&quot;Hmmm?&quot; she moans from the toilet
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t force yourself to do anything until you&#039;re ready, and for the moment to be right&quot; you say as you rub her back with both hands &gt;&quot;I care about you too much to just want sex&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s quiet for a moment
&gt;&quot;You won&#039;t get bored of me?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I promise I won&#039;t get bored, you&#039;re too much fun to ever get bored of&quot; you say in a comforting voice
&gt;You kiss the top of her head
&gt;Her heaving seems to have stopped which means it&#039;s time for her to lay back down
&gt;You&#039;ve had your share of hangovers like this
&gt;Empty the stomach
&gt;Sleep off the nausea
&gt;Drink water
&gt;Eat greasy food
&gt;You never understood that last part about greasy food but it works
&gt;You help her up and walk her back to the bed slowly
&gt;She gets into the bed and you start tucking her in gently
&gt;Suddenly she sit up and wraps her arms around you
&gt;&quot;Does this mean we&#039;re....?&quot;she whispers
&gt;&quot;Yes&quot; you answer as you wrap your arms around her &quot;Now get some more sleep. I know just what you need to get past this hangover&quot;
&gt;She lets go and so do you, although you didn&#039;t want to
&gt;&quot;Ok anon&quot; she whispers before falling back to sleep
&gt;You finish tucking her in 
&gt;You now have a virgin snow leopard burrito on your bed
&gt;Sounds like a weird chipotle order
&gt;You leave her in the room and throw on some flip-flops, grab your keys and wallet, then head out of the house
&gt;You hop into the El camino, you like to drive it for local adventures because it only gets 13 miles to the gallon and takes premium gas.
&gt;You&#039;ve done a ton of work on this muscle car 
&gt;You&#039;ve used it in a few races at the local track
&gt;They never even stood a chance
&gt;You pull out of the driveway and head to the gas station first
&gt;You hop out of the car head inside and go to the drink section.
&gt;She needs Gatorade 
&gt;And aspirin 
&gt;You grab a 8 pack of the yellow gatorade (it doesn&#039;t have a flavor, it&#039;s just yellow and fuck you if you think otherwise)
&gt;You grab a small bottle of Aspirin 
&gt;Check out and back into your car, the off to the next place
&gt;Local burger place
&gt;You walk in and order 2 burgers
&gt;Hers is rare, toasted bun, cheddar cheese, bacon and no veggies
&gt;Yours is medium rare, Cheddar, lettuce, onion, pickles, bacon and a few jalapenos 
&gt;You pay for your meals and jump back into the car and head home
&gt;When you get there, Clara is still sleeping and snoring softly
&gt;So cute
&gt;You put the food on the counter and remove the buns, don&#039;t want those to get soggy 
&gt;You prepare a small breakfast for you, a banana, and a small bowl of cereal
&gt;You don&#039;t have Cable. No need. Instead its a laptop hooked up to a big screen TV, you can find stuff on the interwebs if you want to watch a show
&gt;But shows aren&#039;t what you&#039;re looking for
&gt;Forums
&gt;There a few forums you frequent and one has a thread you&#039;ve been to frequently
&gt;A Human-Anthro thread
&gt;Mostly stories of exploits but also useful info
&gt;Info about how to keep your Anthro partner happy
&gt;Info about places certain Anthros shouldn&#039;t go (a dude learned the hard way that any reptile Anthro does NOT like going to any cold place)
&gt;Info on places to avoid too. 
&gt;Certain states still frown upon relationships
&gt;You&#039;re so engrossed in reading up that you almost didn&#039;t notice the sound of stirring in your bedroom
&gt;Almost
&gt;You turn off the TV and walk to the bedroom
&gt;The snow leopard burrito has arms and now look like a cocoon with a soft muzzle and arms
&gt;You hand her a gatorade &quot;Drink this, the whole thing&quot;
&gt;She opens it up and drinks about half
&gt;&quot;Hey now finish it up, also take these&quot; you hand her 2 Aspirin tablets &quot;They&#039;ll take the edge off the headache and the gatorade will help you feel better faster&quot;
&gt;She just nods and take the pills and finished up the gatorade
&gt;&quot;What time is it Anon&quot; 
&gt;You look at your alarm clock it says 9:54
&gt;&quot;Almost 10&quot; 
&gt;She rubs her face and muzzle then looks up at you
&gt;&quot;Thanks anon&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re surprised
&gt;&quot;For what?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t think most guys would have had that much self restraint&quot; she says looking away from you, her ears going flat
&gt;&quot;You made it easier for me, you passed out after trying to kiss me&quot; you point the to cut on your nose
&gt;She puts her face into her paws and Moans &quot;ohhhh noooo&quot;
&gt;You laugh
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s ok Clara&quot;
&gt;She looks at you &quot;You sure?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well I wouldn&#039;t say it was if it wasn&#039;t, now come on we have a full day of video games and I got you a burger from that place you love&quot;
&gt;Her eyes Light up &quot;Really?!&quot;
&gt;You scratch the top of her head gently, getting a soft purr from her
&gt;&quot;I know how to take care of a hangover and I know how to take care of someone I care for&quot;
&gt;Her ears flick and if you could see her tail you&#039;re sure it would be flicking as well
&gt;So cute
&gt;&quot;Where is my shirt?&quot; she asks 
&gt;You totally forgot she wasn&#039;t wearing one and just had on her bra
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s in the main room, but I should wash it, you got some of whatever you tried to make last night on it
&gt;She groans again
&gt;&quot;Did I trash your kitchen?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Only a bit&quot; you laugh &quot;Don&#039;t worry, I took care of it&quot;
&gt;She looks at you, ears flicking gently &quot;Thanks&quot;
&gt;You wave it off and head to your closet
&gt;&quot;You can wear one of my shirts if you want, I mean I don&#039;t mind you going around in just a bra but&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll take a shirt&quot; She says in a playful tone
&gt;You pick one that that has Solaire on in with the words &quot;praise the sun&quot; on it
&gt;&quot;Nice&quot; she says at your selection
&gt;You smile and hand it to her
&gt;She puts it on
&gt;It&#039;s too big, well too long, it almost goes to her knees
&gt;Cute
&gt;She&#039;s out of bed and walking towards the kitchen
&gt;&quot;Now where are those burgers&quot; she calls over her shoulder to you
&gt;You smile and follow her
It&#039;s going to be a good day
~~~~~~~~
A week later, your house Friday night
&gt;Clara has been coming over regularly
&gt;Some nights you sit and play video games together
&gt;Some you watch Movies (she likes horror movies but is terrified of them and usually ends up latched onto your arm)
&gt;Tonight is a streaming night, as you play Dark souls 3 and she sits next to you, mocking you playfully
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t just use the shield, you need to dodge him and get behind him&quot; she instructs
&gt;&quot;Woman, I know how to play! This is my 4th save file! I Know what I&#039;m doing!&quot; you retort, as you character Stabs its spear through the invaders back
&gt;The words &quot;invader banished&quot; show up on the screen
&gt;&quot;I knew you could do it&quot; she says with a purr and gives you a quick kiss
&gt;Your stream has gotten more popular lately
&gt;Apparently a 6&#039;5 buff nerd playing games with an Anthro is interesting to watch
&gt;You hand off the controller to her
&gt;&quot;Your turn babe, I&#039;m gonna grab a drink, you want anything?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yea grab me one of those diet cokes please&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sure thing&quot; you answer
&gt;yYu don&#039;t usually have soda around the house except for chasers or mixers
&gt;Now you keep a supply of diet coke (Clara&#039;s favorite) in the fridge
&gt;You grab one and refill your water bottle
&gt;&quot;FUCKING BULLSHIT!&quot; you hear her yell from the other room
&gt;You walk back into the room and see the words YOU DIED on the screen and pontiff sylvan
&gt;You snicker
&gt;&quot;Hey no laughing! This boss is bullshit!&quot;
&gt;&quot;You gotta stay to his left&quot; you say as you hand her your drink 
&gt;You sit next to her
&gt;&quot;I WAS going left!
&gt;&quot;Not go left! His left! Your right! I thought you beat this game!&quot; you tickle her side gently 
&gt;She squirms and swats your hand away with her paw
&gt;&quot;I did but I uh&quot; her ears go flat &quot;I always summoned a sunbro to help me&quot;
&gt;You shake your head in mock disappointment
&gt;&quot;To think my girlfriend would stoop so low as to summon&quot; you say in mock sadness
&gt;&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; she hits you with a pillow
&gt;The chat is going mad with things ranging from &quot;CUTEEEE *u*&quot; to &quot;PRAISE THE SUN \[T]/&quot; to &quot;only quitters summon!&quot;
&gt;She gives you the controller &quot;You do it then&quot;
&gt;You accept the controller and go to swap weapons &quot;Why are you using an Ultra Greatsword? The things are so fucking slow&quot; you say as you swap the black knight greatsword for your irithyll straight sword
&gt;&quot;It looks cool&quot; she says flatly &quot;And i would rather hit things once and have them die&quot;
&gt;You are circling the left and stabbing the boss
&gt;After about a minute the words HEIR OF FIRE DESTROYED Flash across the screen
&gt;You look at her, smiling
&gt;She looks mad and so cute
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t say anything or I&#039;ll claw your face off&quot; she says as her waves her paw at you, her claws coming out
&gt;&quot;Yes Ma&#039;am&quot; you say still smiling as you hand her the controller
&gt;&quot;By the way Anon, I was wondering if you wanted to come with me to a party tomorrow, one of the other nurse students invited me and said I could bring someone&quot; she says as she makes the character dodge fireballs
&gt;&quot;Sure, a bit last minute though&quot; you say, rubbing your stubble &quot;it there a fancy occasion or something?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t think so, I think it&#039;s just a friendly party&quot; she says
&gt;Her character is fighting a giant rat crocodile thing
&gt;&quot;Get behind him he&#039;s going to do that lighting breath attack&quot;
&gt;&quot;I FUCKING KNOW!&quot; She says as the character dodges it and slams the ultra greatsword down on the creature. 
&gt;You laugh
&gt;You continue to play together and go to sleep together
~~~~~~
The Next day, your house 1 hour until the party
&gt;Clara is in the shower
&gt;You showered already since she has all the fur she usually uses all the hot water
&gt;You&#039;re wearing jeans, a Gorillaz T-shirt and your usual combat boots
&gt;It&#039;s hard to find shoes your size and you&#039;ll be damned before you go to a party in your workout shoes
&gt;&quot;Anon grab me another towel!&quot; you hear her yell from the bathroom
&gt;Your bathroom isn&#039;t really built for anthros
&gt;She&#039;s told you that usually there are a shitton of water jets and a full body hair dryer
&gt;You recall reading about that on the Human-anthro thread too
&gt;She steps out of the shower wrapped in a towel. she&#039;s so cute when shes a fuzzy after a shower
&gt;&quot;Get lost! I need to change&quot; she says shooing you into the main room
&gt;&quot;Dagnabbit it was hoping for a peepshow&quot; you say in a accent that sounds like an old man from a western as you snap your fingers
&gt;She laughs and walks into the bedroom, her ears flicking
&gt;She looks back at you and smiles then closes the door
&gt;She comes out some time later all dressed and ready to go
&gt;She&#039;s gorgeous as usual
&gt;Wearing a shirt with Radiation boy from fallout 4 on it
&gt;It&#039;s tight on her, showing her curves on only a little bit of midriff, that little bit of chub that she knows drives you wild
&gt;God damn her breasts are amazing too, those grapefruit size orbs are perfect
&gt;She&#039;s wearing jeans that show her curves and ass, her fluffy tail swishing behind her as you stare
&gt;Her black glasses sit in front of those gorgeous blue eyes
&gt;Her ears flick &quot;D-do I look alright&quot; she asks timidly
&gt;You walk over and hug her tight
&gt;&quot;Alright? You look fucking amazing&quot; you reassure her
&gt;She hugs back and wraps her tail around you as well
&gt;You love when she does that
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s get going&quot; you say

At the party

&gt;You can hear the music as you park in the street in front of the house, 
&gt;It&#039;s pop music, but you aren&#039;t going to go into a party expecting your usual rock music
&gt;Still it&#039;s nice to get out of the house and go somewhere besides the college
&gt;Hell, you might even make a friend
&gt;Clara leads you to the door and she rings the doorbell
&gt;A Tigress Opens the door and her eyes light up &quot;CLARA! YOU MADE IT&quot; she hugs Clara
&gt;&quot;Hey Emi, I told you I would&quot; she says as she breaks from the hug 
&gt;&quot;This is Anon&quot; Clara says as she grabs your arm
&gt;The tigeresses eye go wide
&gt;&quot;A human?&quot; she says dumbfounded
&gt;You half smile and wave &quot;Hi&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh Uhm Hi HELLO!&quot; she finally snap out of it and hugs you in term
&gt;oh, she&#039;s a hugger
&gt;You walk in and feel all eyes on you
&gt;You&#039;re the only human here....
&gt;You should have figured that Clara&#039;s nursing program was for Nursing Anthros after all their biology is different.
&gt;You don&#039;t let it bother you as you walk in 
&gt;Clara is going around introducing you to everyone
&gt;Usually she&#039;s so reserved around people, but you guess since she knows everyone she&#039;s relaxed
&gt;You mingle for a while with Clara and hang out talking to the Anthros
&gt;Most are cool with you there and just ask questions about &quot;human Stuff&quot;
&gt;&quot;Aren&#039;t you cold with no fur&quot; &quot;Can I see your teeth?&quot; &quot;How did you get so tall?&quot;
&gt;This goes on for a while then you excuse yourself 
&gt;Clara is in a corner talking to an Anthro dog girl
&gt;You smile and wave to her as you walk onto the back porch
&gt;You are a huge Introvert and you needed a quick break
&gt;After about 10 minutes, you walk into the house only to see Clara cornered by 2 Lions
&gt;One is easily 6&#039;10 and the other is probably 6&#039;8
&gt;Clara catches you looking and shoots you a pleading look
&gt;You walk over and hear the taller one talking
&gt;&quot;Hey pretty little thing, let&#039;s get out of here&quot; he says
&gt;&quot;We can show you a real good time&quot; the other says
&gt;He tries to touch her arm and she reels back only to be stopped by the corner
&gt;You walk up behind them both
&gt;&quot;Excuse me, I think she doesn&#039;t want you touching her and I think you should leave&quot; you say calmly
&gt;You are Livid but you know to stay calm
&gt;The taller lion looks at you and laughs 
&gt;&quot;Fuck off you little Cuck, we can do what we want and we want to have a good time&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yea fuck off before we fuck you up&quot; the shorter one chimes in
The key to commands isn&#039;t just barking them outright, First ask politely,then demand, and if that doesn&#039;t work, enforce 
&gt;You knew how to make your voice commanding without raising it
&gt;Years of practice ordering soldiers
&gt;Your voice is cold as ice as you say &quot;Leave now before you do something you regret&quot;
&gt;The room is silent, even the music seems to have stopped, all eyes on you, the lone human standing up to 2 lions
&gt;&quot;We warned you&quot; the shorter one says &quot;Now we&#039;re gonna fuck you up and then fuck this girl here&quot;
&gt;The taller one reaches over and grabs Clara by the breast 
&gt;&quot;There ain&#039;t shit you can about it&quot; the tall one says
&gt;The short one is swinging at you, claws Extended
&gt;You&#039;re back on the Battlefield
&gt;The insurgent in front of you is swinging at you
the key to a fight isn&#039;t brute strength alone you need technique
&gt;This insurgent has neither
&gt;He&#039;s swinging his arm wide, fully extended
&gt;You step in and give an uppercut straight into his stomach
&gt;He retches and pukes out whatever he had in him 
&gt;He doubles over exposing his back
&gt;You smash an elbow into his kidney, sending him straight down into his sick
&gt;The other insurgent looks stunned, but pulls a knife out and swings it at you
the correct way to hold a knife is actually like the movie Psycho, punch like normal then swing, the knife is not the weapon it&#039;s a tool, you are the weapon
&gt;He swings wide,you step to his left and send a right hook into his jaw
the correct way to punch is to put you full body into it and use your index and middle finger knuckles to hit with, they are reinforced by your arm
&gt;The force of your punch sends him spinning to your left.
&gt;You catch his throat in the crook of your left elbow
&gt;A quick kick to the back of his knee with your foot and you force him down
&gt;He manages to catch himself from going all the way down by putting his hand to the floor 
&gt;The hand is still holding the knife
you can&#039;t have that
&gt;You stomp full force with your heel on the hand with a sickening crunch
imagine holding a knife and having someone slam a sledgehammer onto your hand 
&gt;But you aren&#039;t a sledgehammer
&gt;You&#039;re 240 lbs of bone muscle and anger
&gt;You don&#039;t need to check but most of the bones in that hand are broken
&gt;You Slam your right arm behind his head getting him into a chokehold
the chokehold is technically called the carotid restraint, you&#039;re not choking them to cut the supply of air but cut the supply of blood to the brain
&gt;You&#039;re flexing your left and and pushing down on his neck with your right
&gt;You were Angry
&gt;Angry that you were in this battlefield 
&gt;Angry that you didn&#039;t have a weapon
&gt;Angry that they ever dared to touch her
&gt;Her???
&gt;HER!
&gt;In the immortal words of Eminem &quot;Snap back to reality&quot;
&gt;You aren&#039;t on a battlefield, you&#039;re in a living room at a party
&gt;You look up at Clara
&gt;Her eyes are wide and one paw is over her mouth
&gt;You have the taller lion in the carotid still
&gt;You loosen up and say softly &quot;I told you not to do something you would regret, didn&#039;t I?&quot;
&gt;No answer 
&gt;You shake him 
&gt;&quot;DIDN&#039;T I?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Y-yes&quot; he gasps out
&gt;&quot;You won&#039;t do that again will you?&quot;
&gt;&quot;N-no&quot;
&gt;&quot;Now you&#039;re going to apologize to the nice Leopard aren&#039;t you&quot;
&gt;&quot;S-sorry&quot; he gasps
&gt;&quot;Good, now get your friend and fuck off&quot; you say as you let go
&gt;His right paw is broken, his friend is groaning face down a puddle of his own vomit
&gt;You watch as he collects his friend and they saunter out the front door
&gt;You see someone was recording the whole thing on a phone
&gt;You look at Emi &quot;Sorry about that&quot; you say &quot;Let me help clean this puke up&quot;
&gt;Emi Smiles &quot;I got it, take care of her&quot; she nods towards Clara
&gt;You turn to face Clara

&gt;Be Clara
&gt;You just watched your human boyfriend beat the shit out of 2 Lions in less than 20 seconds
&gt;You&#039;ve never seen him like this
&gt;He&#039;s always so nice and sweet and laughing
&gt;The whole time his face was that of pure Fury and Undying rage
&gt;You could smell his adrenaline and his musk
&gt;He was so Angry
&gt;Angry for you, because they touched you 
&gt;Angry because they dared to even hint at doing anything to you
&gt;You had heard some of his stories, his fights, his battles
&gt;But that was a different Anon
&gt;Now that Anon was in front of you, and when he looked up you saw the fire in his eyes
&gt;It scared you
&gt;It Aroused you
&gt;And as soon as he saw you, the fire died
&gt;Your Anon was back 
~~~~~~
&gt;Be anon
&gt;Clara is still wide eyed and has both her paws to her mouth now
&gt;Shit did you go overboard?
&gt;&quot;Sorry babe&quot; you say 
&gt;Sorry? that&#039;s all you can think of? seriously?
&gt;Suddenly She&#039;s on you and pulling you into a Deep kiss ,arms and tail wrapping around you
&gt;A kiss that blasted away every other kiss and was everything you never even knew you wanted
&gt;Her tongue is coiling around yours  
&gt;You can feel each of her sharp teeth
&gt;You taste every corner of her mouth and never want to separate
&gt;But you also need air
&gt;You break away and breathe deeply, savoring her smell
&gt;You look into her twinkling blue eyes
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s go home&quot; she whispers
&gt;You smile and nod
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s go&quot;
&gt;You look around
&gt;The guy who recorded the fight, an anthro cheetah, is replaying it and showing the video to a Bear 
&gt;&quot;Dude post that shit, I swear it&#039;ll go viral&quot; the bear says
&gt;Clara grabs your hand and Leads you off
&gt;&quot;Bye Emi&quot; she yells as she walks out the door
&gt;&quot;Have fun you two&quot; you hear Emi call out 
&gt;Clara is practically pulling you to the jeep
&gt;You get in and start it up
&gt;&quot;GO!&quot; She pants
&gt;You&#039;ve never seen her like this.
&gt;She&#039;s panting and squirming
&gt;She grabs your hand and guides it into her crotch and uses your hand to rub her through her pants
&gt;Breathe
&gt;You&#039;re driving with your left hand and rubbing Clara through her pants with your right 
&gt;Shes panting and grinding against your hand 
&gt;You recall something from the Human Anthro forum
&gt;A dude named Cheetah_anon told a story of how he got a Chubby cheetah to call him master, fucked the mom, and then got a BJ from the sister
&gt;You don&#039;t know if that was all true, but one thing is sticking out in your mind
&gt;Cats are used to quick mating sessions he said
&gt;They won&#039;t feel true satisfaction until they feel semen in their womb
&gt;Judging by the way Clara is moaning, you cant discount his words
&gt;She unzips her pants and you gently rub her outer lips
&gt;you&#039;re glad you have long arms, so you don&#039;t have to lean too far
&gt;It&#039;s hard to focus on driving 
&gt;You slip a finger between her lips and rub up and down gently
&gt;Slowly
&gt;Her insides are so hot and you love it
&gt;She&#039;s grinding and moaning softly
&gt;You pause at her clit and rub in a slow circle on it making her gasp
&gt;God shes wet, her panties are soaked through and so are her jeans
&gt;There is a red light, thank god, you reach over with your left hand and pull her face to yours and kiss her deeply, your tongues caressing each other
&gt;Her almost like soft sandpaper tongue tastes like everything you wanted and the promise of things to come
&gt;The kiss sends her over her edge 
&gt;You can feel her orgasm on your hand
&gt;&quot;Oh god anon&quot; she moans &quot;Keep going please&quot;
&gt;You start to drive again and your rubbing gets faster 
&gt;One finger to rub her lips and the other to rub her clit
&gt;Shes shuddering and moaning softly
&gt;&quot;H-harder&quot; he moans to you
&gt;You press harder on her clit which causes her to shudder harder
&gt;&quot;Oh god keep going, I&#039;m so close&quot; she moans 
&gt;You don&#039;t need anymore invitation than that
&gt;Your middle finger on her clit and your pointer and ring finger rubbing her lips
&gt;You Feel her grinding into your hand and shudder and throws her head back
&gt;God dam, the speed limit made this ride so much slower 
&gt;But you can see your house and have never been happier
&gt;You don&#039;t even bother about parking in the driveway. Garage door up
&gt;Pull in
&gt;As the garage door closes, Clara is already out of her seat 
&gt;Her soaked seat
Iaintevenmad.jpg
&gt;You get out and go around the car and shes on you, arms and tail wrapped around you as you kiss again
&gt;&quot;I told you the right moment would come and would be worth it&quot; you whisper to her
&gt;&quot;Mhm&quot; She&#039;s biting her lips softly
&gt;You move out of the garage 
&gt;She&#039;s pulling up your shirt
&gt;You help help pull it off and you in term help her with hers,
&gt;Both are dropped and forgotten
&gt;You come in for a kiss again. Her pads trace across your back, you hands cup and hold her perfect ass 
&gt;You try rubbing just above the base of her tail
&gt;She moans into your mouth from it
&gt;You get to you knees and guide her pants off of her
&gt;You can&#039;t help but admire her perfect body
&gt;How could you not
&gt;&quot;No fair &quot; she mockingly whines at you gesturing you your own pants
&gt;Off they go!
&gt;She&#039;s looking at your boxer briefs
You like the support they provide shut up
&gt;Well she&#039;s not looking at the boxer briefs but what&#039;s beneath them
&gt;You take the lead and move with her to the bedroom
&gt;You replaced the light bulbs in your lamps to have red light while the ceiling lights have white light bulbs
&gt;Red light is better for your eyes to adjust to when going from total dark to bright
&gt;It also makes some damn good mood lighting
&gt;You turn to her, she&#039;s biting her lip gently and you see her ears flicking nervously
&gt;You wrap her in her arms, pick her up gently and kiss her, getting a squeak of surprise into your mouth
&gt;You sit her on the bad, still kissing and your each both hands behind her and remove her black bra, which is promptly thrown aside
&gt;Her breasts are perfect, grapefruit sized and perky.
&gt;Her pink nipples, surrounded by pink areolas, are a beautiful contrast to her grey fur
&gt;You slide your hands down her sides, looking into those blue eyes
&gt;In those eyes was everything you never knew you wanted
&gt;And more
&gt;You reach her still soaked panties
&gt;Black with a little red heart on the front
&gt;You slide them off of her and they are also thrown aside
&gt;You stand back upright
&gt;There she is, your beautiful chubby snow leopard, naked and looking at you with those blue eyes
&gt;2 months ago you were a soldier
&gt;3 weeks ago you were a borderline depressed student
&gt;A week ago you were a man who knew he wanted her more than anything but held back 
&gt;And it was all her
&gt;You lean in close to her and kiss her neck
&gt;She&#039;s purring softly,the sound is more intoxicating than any alcohol or drug you&#039;ve ever tried
&gt;You kiss down her body, kissing and sucking both nipples 
&gt;She&#039;s moaning and purring and squirming from your kisses
&gt;You kiss her navel, which is only partly hidden by fur
&gt;You reach the main event 
&gt;With one hand you reach up and slowly lay her on her back, while kissing right above her slit right where the fur tapered down into skin
&gt;A quick lick
&gt;It&#039;s like electricity has gone through her body
&gt;You push you tongue a little into her slit 
&gt;She&#039;s gripping the sheets with both paws, you can hear the blanket ripping
&gt;You savor her flavors, metallic and sweet
&gt;You lick and suck on her pearly pink clit
&gt;She shudders and moans and purrs loader, fueling your licks to go longer and slower over her clit
&gt;You do long licks up her pussy and slow down to focus a slow circle on her clit
&gt;&quot;Oh..g-god Anon I-I-I -c-can&#039;t&quot; she moans before a violent shudder
&gt;A wave of warm liquid Sprays out of her onto your face
&gt;You keep going kissing and licking, your hands rubbing the outsides of her thighs
&gt;A-a-anon I-I-I&quot; is all she stammer out between shudders before another wave hits your face
&gt;You look up at her mouth still on her clit
&gt;You see her face between her breasts,
&gt;She&#039;s panting and moaning and shuddering 
&gt;That intoxicating purr is boring into your head, a sound you&#039;ll never get rid of and never want to
&gt;You just want her 
&gt;Everything you wanted
&gt;Everything you want
&gt;Everything you will want
&gt;She&#039;s looking at you
&gt;Those striking blue eyes like lightning through your heart
&gt;She beckons you with a finger
&gt;You stand up
&gt;Your erection is painfully restrained by your boxer briefs
&gt;You take them off letting it out 
&gt;She&#039;s staring, mouth slightly agape
&gt;You&#039;re 6&#039;5, and your member is... proportional to the rest of you
&gt;You wear size 16 shoes and the rumor about shoe size is true for you.
&gt;You look at her, she&#039;s still staring
&gt;&quot;Is it what you expected?&quot; you ask her calmly
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s...Bigger than I thought...... Plus there are no spikes....&quot;
&gt;Your mind reels for a second. You recall a video where a housecat screams because of its mates Spiny dick
&gt;You rub her thighs &quot;You ready Love?&quot; you say 
&gt;You&#039;re in position
&gt;If you wanted to you could simply shove it in and go to town
&gt;But she deserves better than that, she deserves love and tenderness
&gt;And so do you
&gt;Too many one night stands that fulfilled your lust, but left your heart in more pieces than before
&gt;you&#039;re rubbing you head of your member gently against her slit, up and down 
&gt;&quot;I-I&#039;m ready anon&quot; she shuddered
&gt;She&#039;s on her back looking up at you, she opens up her arms and wraps her tail around you, ears straight up,
&gt;You lean forward into her embrace, holding her tight
&gt;Her scent filling your head, her arms around you tracing figures of some old forgotten language, her tail wrapped around you in a secret hug that you&#039;ve never felt before
&gt;You slowly gently push into her pussy
&gt;Inch by inch, centimeter by centimeter 
&gt;She gasps with each passing moment and hugs you
&gt;You slide in easily due do how much licking and foreplay you&#039;ve done 
&gt;The last thing you want is to hurt her
&gt;Figuratively or literally
&gt;To you, it seems like hours as you push slowly into her willing and accepting pussy
&gt;It was probably only 30 seconds though
&gt;But you don&#039;t care about that
&gt;You care about her
&gt;You bring your mouth to hers and kiss her
&gt;An explosion to blast away the dull times of your life, 
&gt;Every second of hurt on the battlefield
&gt;Every second of sadness on the streets where you grew up
&gt;Every time your heart laid broken at your feet 
&gt;Gone in a single kiss
&gt;If heaven was real than this was it, and you don&#039;t need anything else
&gt;You finally feel your pelvis hit hers
&gt;Your hilt is the only part of you visible
&gt;Shes holding you close
&gt;You start to slowly pull out of her
&gt;Gasps in your ears and shudders against your body
&gt;Her walls tightening up against your member
&gt;Purrs resonating in the soul you never knew you had
&gt;You push back in, greeted by more shudders
&gt;Her claws are out slightly and etching across your back and you start to go faster
&gt;Her walls clamping on you, inviting everything you have to give her
&gt;&quot;O-ohhhh f-fuck&quot; she moans into your mouth
&gt;And splash of liquid sprays out of her pussy and her walls contract sharply
&gt;You&#039;ve lost track of how many orgasms she has had and you&#039;re so close
&gt;Suddenly a thought hits you
&gt;You weren&#039;t wearing a condom and females determine the species of the offspring
&gt;&quot;P-pill&quot; she shudders out, barely able to think a coherent thought
&gt;That&#039;s all you needed, you pushed harder and harder into her pussy
&gt;Her breasts bounce in front of you as you fuck her pussy hard
&gt;No
&gt;This isn&#039;t fucking
&gt;Fucking is without emotion, a means to get rid of lust
&gt;This is more than that
&gt;You feel her, feel for her and feel the love around you both.
&gt;You&#039;re loving every inch of her as you push and pull in and out and you&#039;re making sure she knows it
&gt;You talk to her in quiet whispers
&gt;&quot;Clara this is amazing&quot;  &quot;Clara you make me happy&quot; &quot;Clara I love you&quot;
&gt;You can barely think as you say the last one
&gt;Saying i love you during sex? This isn&#039;t some shitty doujin
&gt;But you couldn&#039;t deny it
&gt;She&#039;s everything you wanted
&gt;Everything you never knew you wanted
&gt;Everything you never knew you would want
&gt;And more than that
&gt;Her purring ever present, letting you know that no matter what, she&#039;s going to be there, in the back of your mind
&gt;You&#039;re so close.
&gt;So close to her
&gt;&quot;C-clara I-I’m&quot; is all you manage to choke out
&gt;Dd-do it&quot; she whispers
&gt;You push deep into her and explode into her pussy.
&gt;Your seed trying to find the furthest reaches of her 
&gt;You stay pushed deep into her, her claws in your back, your body ridged against her, your face kissing hers, your fingers buried into the fur of her back, her tail wrapped around you
&gt;Bliss
&gt;You pull out slowly
&gt;She&#039;s soaked this side of bed with her squirting. You kiss her deeply and play with her tongue as she plays with yours.
&gt;You smile at her and she smiles at you
&gt;&quot;I love you Clara&quot;
&gt;You feel like a shitty love story
&gt;But you loved her, have loved her, will love her
&gt;You just didn&#039;t know when else to say it without feeling like you pressured her into this
&gt;&quot;I love you too Anon&quot; she whispers to you.
&gt;You&#039;re both basking in the afterglow when suddenly she whacks you gently with a paw
&gt;&quot;Get me a towel to clean up you dingus, you came like a gallon in me&quot; she says in a mock angry voice &quot;And get me a gatorade or 2, Jesus you look like you were swimming&quot;
&gt;That&#039;s your girl
&gt;You wonder to the hall closet
&gt;Hand towel? Nope full size gotta clean up the jizz AND the squirt
&gt;You grab it and extra just in case
&gt;You go to the kitchen and grab 4 gatorades, 2 tucked under your arm and 2 held in your left hand
&gt;You go back to the room and set the gatorades down 
&gt;You then grab a towel and wipe upwards on Claras pussy , getting a few shudders out of her
&gt;You then set the other towel on the large wet spot on the bed so no one has to sleep in a puddle of wet
&gt;You settle into bed next to her, looking into those bright blue eyes
&gt;&quot;I love you Anon&quot;
&gt;&quot;I love you too Clara&quot;
&gt;You both drift off to sleep in each others arms


&gt;You awake with a start 
&gt;8 am
&gt;You slept in late
&gt;You hear a faint purring next to you and look to your right
&gt;There&#039;s Clara 
&gt;She&#039;s still sleeping and has a faint smile
&gt;So cute
&gt;You get out of bed , trying to be a quiet as possible
&gt;You throw on a pair of boxers and a tank top and head to the kitchen
&gt;Hungry
&gt;You and Clara both had not eaten since the party and the ....ahem following events
&gt;You go to the fridge, grab some eggs and bacon and a bit of cheese to make omelettes
&gt;You yawn and stretch a bit as you grab a frying pan out of the cupboard and place it on the stove
&gt;You spray the pan with some cooking spray that you had next to the stove
&gt;Bacon on, heat on
&gt;You sneak back to the bedroom and grab your phone and place a quick kiss on Clara&#039;s forehead
&gt;Maybe some music to help you relax
&gt;You click Youtube and grab a water bottle while it loads
&gt;It loads up as you take a swing and you nearly choke
&gt;#3 on trending is a video title &quot;HUMAN DEFENDS ANTHRO GF FROM PREDATORS&quot;
&gt;WHAT THE FUCK
&gt;You recalled that cheetah saying her gonna post it online but you didn&#039;t expect.... well This!
&gt;Fuck! The bacon!
&gt;You rush over and flip it
&gt;You click the video and sure enough it&#039;s you at the party, punching and fighting the lions
&gt;The comments are..positive? 
&gt;Like from the video of the fat kid who powerbombed a bully
&gt;&quot;You go human&quot;, &quot;I wish my man would do something like this&quot; &quot;BEAST MODE&quot;
&gt;There are some negative but still this isn&#039;t what you expected
&gt;You pull the bacon off the stove
&gt;You drain the fat and then start making the eggs
&gt;You hear a yawning behind you and turn around to see Clara come around the corner, yawning
&gt;She&#039;s wearing one of your shirts, it says &quot;Hug Life&quot; and has a cat with a bandana on
&gt;&quot;Morning babe&quot; she yawns as she sits on the couch in the main room
&gt;You walk over and give her a kiss
&gt;&quot;Good morning, how much cheese you want in your omelette?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Murder that bitch with cheese&quot;
&gt;You laugh &quot;Ok tons of cheese&quot;
&gt;You start making hers first
&gt;It&#039;s just polite to serve your guest first
&gt;She&#039;s got the wireless keyboard to the laptop- TV setup and is browsing the web
&gt;&quot;HOLY SHIT ANON!&quot;
&gt;You jump a bit, you weren&#039;t expecting an outburst
&gt;&quot;YOU&#039;RE FAMOUS!&quot; She Yells, bouncing up and down excitedly, which causes her breasts to jiggle 
&gt;&quot;LOOK LOOK LOOK!&quot; she might as well be vibrating at this point
&gt;&quot;I saw&quot; you say casually as you flip her omelette over
&gt;&quot;Why aren&#039;t you more excited about this?&quot; she asks as she walks over and wraps her arms around your waist, her tail swishing side to side slowly
&gt;&quot;I didn&#039;t do it for fame&quot; 
&gt;She huffs 
&gt;&quot;I know that, it&#039;s just usually viral videos are of stupid people doing stupid things&quot; she says looking up at you &quot;Like that one video of the girl whos drugged up talking about choking on a big black dick&quot;
&gt;You laugh as you pull her omelette off the stove and put in on a plate &quot;True&quot; you say as you put 5 pieces of bacon next to the stupidly cheesy omelette
&gt;&quot;And it&#039;s exciting to see people responding so positively to it&quot; she says as she scrolls the comments
&gt;&quot;Youtube would ban anything too nasty&quot; you point out
&gt;&quot;Yeah I know but people are saying that you&#039;re a hero and stuff for standing up to them&quot; she says as she cuts into her omelette
&gt;&quot;Mmmm das good&quot;
&gt;You get to making yours and put on pandora 
&gt;You crumble up your bacon into the eggs so it&#039;s a bacon and cheese omelette
&gt;You look at Clara, she&#039;s wiggling side to side with the beat of the music and Munching on her omelette and scrolling through the comments of the video
&gt;She&#039;s so goddamn cute
&gt;You busy yourself with making your eggs
&gt;Eventually you finish yours and Plop down next to her on the couch
&gt;You pull her in and kiss the top of her head
&gt;Her ears wiggle 
&gt;You sit together and eat
~~~~
Later that day
&gt;You&#039;re all dressed and relaxing
&gt;Clara is as well but is wearing her usual baggy clothes that hid her features
&gt;She&#039;s leaning against you as you play borderlands 2 together
&gt;&quot;Come on, revive me&quot; you say
&gt;&quot;Busy&quot;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re just grabbing all the good guns!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Like i said busy!&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s sitting in your lap as you both play
&gt;&quot;Hey anon we should get another TV in here so we can play online games together&quot; she says as she finally revives you
&gt;&quot;Sounds like a good idea&quot; you say &quot;We could stream together&quot;
&gt;Clara&#039;s Phone rings 
&gt;She looks at it and her ears go flat
&gt;You peek at her phone and see a picture of what looks like an Older version of Clara
&gt;Her mother Maybe?
&gt;You don&#039;t think she has sisters.
&gt;She picks up
&gt;&quot;H-hey mom&quot; you Instantly hear yelling from the phone
&gt;You can&#039;t make it out
&gt;Clara gets out of your lap and starts pacing around the house
&gt;&quot;Of course I wanted to tell you, but&quot;
&gt;&quot;No, you shouldn&#039;t have had to find out that way! But&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m with him now&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re catching only one side of a conversation that&#039;s making you concerned
&gt;You recall the video online of you fighting those lions
&gt;Was Clara in the video? You haven&#039;t watched it, 
&gt;After all why watch it, you lived it
&gt;You pull it up on your phone
&gt;It&#039;s only about 40 seconds
&gt;It starts at the point where the lion puts his hand on Clara&#039;s breast
&gt;Fuck, so it did show Clara
&gt;You watch the rest of it. It seems a lot shorter than when you lived it
&gt;But still it was popular and on the internet which means Her parents must have seen it
&gt;Including Her father, who doesn&#039;t like humans
&gt;Great 
&gt;&quot;Uhm A-anon?&quot; 
&gt;You look up at her
&gt;Her ears are flat and she look like she might have been crying
&gt;&quot;M-my parents don&#039;t want me to see you anymore&quot;
&gt;Your heart drops
&gt;&quot;But...&quot;
&gt;&quot;But?&quot; you say
&gt;&quot;They saw the video of you defending me,and they want to meet you&quot; she says
So your saying theres a chance
&gt;She&#039;s looking down and her ears are flat
&gt;You get up and give her a hug
&gt;&quot;Its ok, we&#039;re ok, we&#039;re gonna make it&quot; you reassure her
&gt;&quot;But what if they say I can&#039;t see you&quot; she sounds like she&#039;s going to cry
&gt;&quot;Would you stop?&quot; you ask calmly
&gt;She looks up at you 
&gt;&quot;No&quot;
&gt;You smile and kiss her
&gt;&quot;Then we&#039;re ok&quot;
&gt;&quot;But what if the cut off my money supply? I can&#039;t pay for college and and where would I live and and and...&quot;
&gt;You kiss her again
&gt;&quot;If that happens, I got it&quot;
&gt;&quot;What? No! We&#039;ve only been together a few weeks! I couldn&#039;t ask you to do that!&quot; she says looking at you with her Blue eyes
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s why you don&#039;t have to ask&quot; you say as you kiss her again
&gt;Her tail wraps around you 
&gt;She relaxes a bit
&gt;&quot;I love you Clara, I don&#039;t care what anyone says about that, and I&#039;m not going to let them tell me I can&#039;t&quot; you smile at her
&gt;&quot;I love you too Anon&quot; She says as she buries her muzzle into your chest
&gt;You pet the top of her head and she purrs gently
&gt;Soft fur
&gt;&quot;When should I meet them&quot;
&gt;She bites her lip, you can see her fangs
&gt;Her ears go flat again
&gt;&quot;Uhmm.....Now?&quot; she says pleadingly &quot;The sooner we meet them, the better&quot;
&gt;You sigh
&gt;This isn&#039;t how you imagined your day going, 
&gt;You imagined video games, sex, video games, sex, and maybe Pizza
&gt;Not meet the parents
&gt;Oh well, it was gonna happen sooner or later
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s go then&quot; you say and you part 
&gt;She turns away from you and you give her a light spank
&gt;She squeaks gently and looks back at you
&gt;&quot;You&#039;ll pay for that later Mister&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh I know, and I look forward to it&quot;
~~~~~
in front of Clara&#039;s House
&gt;&quot;So what are their names again?&quot;
&gt;&quot;John and Stacy&quot;
&gt;&quot;I thought they were from mongolia!&quot;
&gt;&quot;They are they took American names when they immigrated&quot;
&gt;Well, that keeps things easy and explains why Clara has an American name
&gt;John and Stacy Zaya
&gt;You&#039;re walking up the pathway that leads to her house, a basic 2 story house
&gt;The Door opens as you and Clara approach
&gt;In the doorway to greet you is Clara&#039;s mother
&gt;She basically looks like an older version of Clara but a bit thinner and taller
&gt;You smile as you approach
&gt;&quot;Clara, you did not say he was so tall&quot; she says with a hint of an accent
&gt;&quot;Mom you saw the video! You knew he was tall&quot; Clara says as she hugs her mom
&gt;&quot;The video did not do it justice&quot; 
&gt;You extend your hand to her
&gt;&quot;Hello Mrs.Zaya, I&#039;m Anon&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Oh please just call me Stacy&quot; She says with a smile
&gt;You were not expecting this at all 
&gt;She&#039;s being nice and friendly towards you
&gt;&quot;Thank you for defending my daughter like that&quot; she says still shaking your hand
&gt;She&#039;s not letting go
&gt;&quot;Anyone would have&quot; you say smiling
&gt;&quot;But you did&quot;
&gt;Clara saves you from her moms handshake
&gt;&quot;Why don&#039;t we go inside mom?&quot;
&gt;Stacy finally lets your hand go and looks at Clara
&gt;&quot;Wonderful Idea! Come Anon!&quot; She says as she beckons you into the house
&gt;You shoot a quick Glance to Clara
&gt;She smiles and follows her mom into the house
&gt;You follow Clara inside 
&gt;The house is very... Colorful. The walls are yellow
&gt;Pictures of Clara when she was a cub cover the walls
&gt;You reach the living room where Clara&#039;s father is waiting
&gt;He&#039;s watching the video of you beating the lions on a tablet, with a look of angry and of being impressed
&gt;&quot;John, Clara is Home with Anon&quot;
&gt;He looks up and quickly hides the tablet, then stands to greet you
&gt;He&#039;s shorter than Stacy but much stockier
&gt;&quot;Nice to meet you Mr.Zaya&quot; you say extending a hand
&gt;&quot;Likewise Mr. Anon&quot; he takes you hand in his paw and shakes it
&gt;He also as an accent but stronger than Stacy&#039;s
&gt;You assume he&#039;s trying to squeeze your hand, but its not working at all
&gt;&quot;Please, just Anon&quot;
&gt;&quot;Very well Anon, please sit&quot; he beckons to a couch
&gt;&quot;Thank you&quot; you say as you sit down
&gt;Clara sits next to you wearing a worried smile
&gt;Stacy and John sit on a loveseat facing you
&gt;&quot;Anon, I am thankful for what you did for my daughter&quot; He starts
&gt;&quot;SO VERY Thankful&quot; Stacy says, smiling wide
&gt;Ah, so only John has a problem with you
&gt;Winning over one is easier than winning over 2
&gt;&quot;But I must ask you to refrain seeing my daughter in the future, She belongs with her own Kind&quot; He continues
&gt;you clear your throat
&gt;&quot;With all Due Respect Mr.Zaya,&quot; you says politely yet bluntly
&gt;&quot;No&quot;
&gt;He looks like you were about to present him with an award but instead slapped him with it
&gt;&quot;B-but I Forbid- !&quot; he starts
&gt;You cut him off
&gt; &quot;I don&#039;t care&quot; you say in the same polite tone &quot;I care too much about Clara to just bow down and say Ok. I have literally fought lions off of her&quot;
&gt;&quot;You let one touch her!&quot; 
&gt;&quot;And then I shattered the bones in his paw&quot; you&#039;re polite, years of dealing with officers who just showed up and thought they knew how to run things taught you how to politely say fuck you and have them not be insulted
&gt;&quot;B-but we will cut off her funds then! You will be to blame for her having to dropout of college!&quot; 
&gt;He&#039;s trying you convince you by threatening her? What a cheap trick. But it&#039;s a trick that won&#039;t work.
&gt;&quot;Fine&quot;
&gt;His mouth is agape 
&gt;&quot;What do you mean FINE?!&quot; he&#039;s starting to shout
&gt;&quot;Dear&quot; Says Stacy
&gt;&quot;I can handle all her expenses&quot; Stay calm and polite, let him lose his temper
&gt;You look over at Clara, She&#039;s looking at you like you&#039;re mad
&gt;You wink at her and put your hand on her paw
&gt;&quot;YOU&#039;LL HANDLE IT? WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU EVEN DO FOR WORK!&quot; he accent is getting stronger 
&gt;This is obviously not how he planned this conversation to go
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t-&quot; you start
&gt;&quot;YOU DON&#039;T EVE HAVE A JOB AND YOU PROPOSE TO HANDLE HER MONEY!?
&gt;You clear your throat loudly and intentionally
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t need to work&quot;
&gt;This catches his attention
&gt;&quot;What? You don&#039;t need to work? What madness is this&quot; he says half to you, half to himself
&gt;Stacy looks confused too
&gt;You look at Clara and give her paw a quick squeeze
&gt;&quot;No, I have enough set aside to last a long time due to good investments&quot;
&gt;You had never talked to Clara about you Financial status and she never asked
&gt;&quot;Plus I get disability Pay from the military thanks to this&quot; you point to your right eye &quot;And this&quot; you point to your back
&gt;He&#039;s looking at you differently
&gt;&quot;You were military?&quot; he asks wide eyed &quot;You fought in the war?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I deployed 3 times and went on over 50 combat missions&quot;
&gt;The war or more commonly called &quot; The Anthro Liberation Movement&quot; was a series of deployments to middle eastern countries that were committing systematic Genocide of Anthros Deemed &quot;unworthy&quot;
&gt;America and its allies stepped in but still the price was high
&gt;Millions of anthros and humans died
&gt;He&#039;s now gone quiet
&gt;&quot;I was unaware of this&quot; he said &quot;And what of your family? What do they think of this union of yours&quot;
&gt;He motions at you and Clara
&gt;Clara goes to stop you but you squeeze her paw, She knows family is a touchy subject
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s ok&quot; you tell her
&gt;&quot;They&#039;re dead&quot;
&gt;Stacy and John Freeze 
&gt;&quot;W-wha&quot; John is stuttering, 
&gt;&quot;Oh no, Anon I&#039;m so sorry&quot; Stacy has her paws over her heart
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t be, it was a car crash. They didn&#039;t feel a thing, left me with property that I rent out or sold outright then I joined the military&quot; 
&gt;You Shrug
&gt;&quot;Good investing&quot;
&gt;He&#039;s looking at you in a different light
&gt;you&#039;re no longer the human come to steal his daughter but the Man come to court her
&gt;At least, that&#039;s what you hope
&gt;&quot;Look sir, I know Humans must have done awful things to you to make you flee mongolia, But that was before I was born&quot;
&gt;&quot;Just give me a chance&quot; you say you&#039;re still using a polite tone but a more friendly one
&gt;&quot;Besides I love your daughter&quot; you say as you look into Clara&#039;s eyes
&gt;Her ear flick at you and you feel her tail starting to wrap around you
&gt;&quot;Ohhhhhhh My little Girl&quot; Stacy has her paws over Her mouth and looks on the verge of tears
&gt;&quot;John&quot; She says, Whacking him on the Shoulder &quot;Stop letting your grudge get in the way of our daughters happiness!&quot;
&gt;Oh god she&#039;s using the wife tone
&gt;&quot;I-I-I-I....Very well. But mark my words Mr.Anon you better not hurt her&quot; he says relenting to his wife
&gt;Clara has started her bouncing
&gt;&quot;YAYYYY&quot; She Cries pouncing onto you wrapping you in a big hug
&gt;Clara is happily bouncing around you
&gt;&quot;omigoshomigoshomigosh I&#039;ve wanted to show you my room for so long Anon and now can&quot; she says with glee
&gt;Shes grabs you arm and pulls you out of her living room
&gt;&quot;IMSOEXCITEDCOMEONSLOWPOKE&quot;
&gt;&quot;Be sure to leave to door open&quot; you hear John grunt
&gt;You hear Stacy whack him gently and say &quot;she&#039;s an adult let her ha--&quot;
&gt;The rest is cut off in the babble from your Bouncing snow leopard 
&gt;She&#039;s literally pulling you
&gt;Past the main all with all the pictures of Cub Clara (you really would like to look at those)
&gt;Up the stairs (she almost trips you with her tail)
&gt;Into her room
&gt;She as a basic twin sized bed with a Dr. Who blanket covering it
&gt;The walls are covered in video game posters from gamestop and the internet
&gt;She has a gaming rig set up next to a big TV with a Playstation 4 hooked up
&gt;She&#039;s spinning in the center of the room
&gt;Finally, she stops to look at you
&gt;&quot;What do you think&quot; she asks excitedly
&gt;&quot;This is pretty awesome&quot; you say to her, looking around nodding your head &quot;Is that a replica buster sword?&quot;
&gt;Her eyes are twinkling and she has a goofy open mouth smile, where you can see her fangs and teeth
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s foam!&quot; she says 
&gt;&quot;I couldn&#039;t lift the real metal one&quot; she pouts
&gt;You sit on the bed and she pounces you and sits into your lap
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m glad you were able to convince Da to let me stay with you&quot; she says, looking up and you and nuzzling your chin
&gt;&quot;I had back up from you and your mom&quot; you admit &quot;I think he thought I was just going to bow down and leave&quot; 
&gt;You kiss her forehead and hug her tight
&gt;Even when she is sitting in you lap you&#039;re almost a clear head above her in height
&gt;She starts grinding on you softly
&gt;&quot;Hey anon want to have some celebratory fun?
Horrorboner.jpg
&gt;&quot;Babe, I just now managed to win over your dad, the last thing we need it be caught having sex&quot; 
&gt;She pouts
&gt;&quot;Unless You have a room that can completely drown your Purring and moaning&quot; 
&gt;&quot;I Know! The bathroom&quot; She says suddenly bouncing a bit, her ears flicking excitedly
&gt;She grabs you and leads you down the hall then shoves you into the room at the end
&gt;&quot;Stay!&quot; She runs off
&gt;&quot;Hey I&#039;m not a dog you know!&quot; You say as she closes the door
&gt;Sigh
&gt;The bathroom is large, on your right there is a shower with Nozzles pointed every which way and in the left corner there is a full body hair dryer.
&gt;Makes sense
&gt;You hear Clara call out &quot;MA I&#039;M GOING TO TAKE A SHOWER, I HAVEN&#039;T HAD A GOOD ONE AT ANONS&quot;
&gt;She bursts back in and closes the door behind her
&gt;She turns around and has a mischievous look on her face 
&gt;&quot;What did you do?&quot; you ask her sternly
&gt;&quot;I asked mom to cover for us&quot; She says with a sly grin
ohgodwhat
&gt;&quot;She&#039;s the one who took me to get my pill, I pretty sure she&#039;s just happy I have a guy here and not a girl&quot;
&quot;Hey, is that a possib--&quot;
&quot;No!&quot; she yells playfully before pouncing on you and kissing you deeply
&gt;Her tongue is rough and smooth all at once, her fangs press against your lips. You taste her and pull her close, wrapping your arms around her
&gt;Her tail creeps around you 
&gt;Her ears flick and twirl
&gt;You both finally break from the kiss
&gt;&quot;So then, reconsidered my offer about fun?&quot; she asks coyly
&gt;&quot;You offer is considered and accepted my dear&quot; you say &quot;Arms up!&quot;
&gt;She lifts her arms and you pull her shirt off her
&gt;She&#039;s wearing a gray Bra that matches her fur
&gt;You can&#039;t help but stare
&gt;&quot;Your turn Anon&quot; you stick your arms up and bend at the waist, so she can grab your shirt and pull it off
&gt;You pull her in for a kiss again
&gt;You rub her back with your left hand and gently rub small circles above the base of her tail
&gt;She moans gently into your mouth &quot;no fair&quot;
&gt;Her pads rub your back and sides
&gt;Your left hand now finds its way forward and undoes the button on her pants
&gt;Its slides gently into her panties and rubs her lips 
&gt;She&#039;s gasping and moaning into your mouth
&gt;Her paws have gotten your pants unbuttoned and pushed down a bit allowing one of her paws to wrap around your stiff erection
&gt;You pull away for a moment and she pouts
&gt;You pull her pants down to her ankles and kiss her pussy gently through her panties
&gt;Shes moaning and purring and puts her paws on either side of your head 
&gt;You kiss and lick her through her panties 
&gt;There&#039;s a wet spot growing, that&#039;s not only your saliva
&gt;Mostly not anyway
&gt;You gently grab her panties and slide them down over her curvy hips and down her gorgeous legs
&gt;She steps out of them and kicks them to the side
&gt;You go back to kissing her pussy, this time unhindered by cloth in the way
&gt;Your tongue finds her clit and you start licking in circles 
&gt;You then put your whole mouth to her pussy and start licking and sucking her clit with your tongue occasionally finding its way into her
&gt;She&#039;s covering her mouth and shuddering, bent over from the pleasure, her eyes scrunched closed
&gt;You wrap your arms around her and place your hand on the base of her tail and start scratching it gently
&gt;Her eyes Jolt open and she bucks backwards
&gt;A splash of liquid hits your face and you continue to lick
&gt;Her legs give out and you catch her as she falls
&gt;You give her a second to regain some control
&gt;&quot;Holy fuck Anon&quot; she says lazily, her eyes half open
&gt;You smile
&gt;You kiss her and her tongue shoots into your mouth, trying to get a taste of herself
&gt;You stay like this for a moment
&gt;&quot;Can you stand babe?&quot; you ask as you slowly undo her bra and take it off her
&gt;&quot;Mhm&quot; she says 
&gt;You help her up before getting to your feet yourself and sliding your boxer briefs down and kicking them to the side
&gt;She looks at your erection for a moment and slides closer to you, wrapping her arms around your neck
&gt;&quot;Let me turn on the water babe&quot; she whispers into your ears and your right hand rubs her ass and the other holds her tail stroking it gently, eliciting purrs from her
&gt;You let go reluctantly
&gt;She turns away from you purposefully keeping her tail lifted so you can see everything
&gt;Her pussy is dripping wet and her clit is just poking out from between her lips, bright pink and glistening
&gt;Her asshole is pretty pink and twitching gently
&gt;She looks back at you as she turns on the water jets
&gt;All the jets kick on gently and shes tests the water with a paw
&gt;She then gets into the shower and turns you to, her back against the shower wall
&gt;She beckons to you, curling one finger pad at you, claw extended
&gt;You accept this invitation
&gt;As you snap the shower door shut all the jets kick on full blast, covering you both in warm relaxing water
&gt;Seeing her wet is different, she looks thinner, yet but also so cute as she wears a quiet expecting smile
&gt;Her ears are flicking and her tail which usually would swish gently more wags because of the weight of the water
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re gorgeous love&quot; you reassure her
&gt;With that she&#039;s back into your arms and you in hers, kissing and rubbing each other
&gt;Your erection presses painfully against her stomach
&gt;&quot;Want me to help with that&quot; she asks you, wrapping a soft padded paw around your shaft
&gt;She gets down on her knees and puts her paws on her gorgeous tits, 
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ve always wanted to do this&quot; she says as she looks up at you
&gt;You nod silently as you press your member into her cleavage
&gt;She looks up at you &quot;it&#039;s so warm&quot;
&gt;She presses her tits together firmly and and begins moving them slowly yet firmly up and down your cock
&gt;The feeling is amazing, 
&gt;Her wet fur coupled with the warm water is overwhelming
&gt;Shes purring loudly, the vibrations of her purring only adding to the feelings
&gt;She&#039;s pumping faster now. Gently making sure it doesn&#039;t pop out accidentally and keeping a steady pace that gradually gets faster
&gt;You have to lean against a nozzle
&gt;She&#039;s keeps going and licks the tip of your erection
&gt;Gently coiling and licking the tip before closing her lips around it, careful to keep her fangs away from it
&gt;She&#039;s not sucking the tip of your cock, licking it gently and titfucking it 
&gt;Her purring is louder
&gt;&quot;Holy fuck Clara I&#039;m going to---&quot;
&gt;&quot;Do it&quot; she gasps as she opens her mouth wide
&gt;You cum into her open mouth and all over her cleavage staining the grey fur white for a moment before the water washes it away gently
&gt;She licks her lips and kisses the tip of your cock
&gt;&quot;Tasty&quot;
&gt;Goddamn you love this Leopard
&gt;She stand up and puts her arms around you purring gently &quot;I hope that&#039;s not all you have in you&quot;
&gt;you smile at her and spank her gently making a wet &quot;whap&quot; sound
&gt;Her eyes go wide for a moment then half closed, still purring
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s what i thought&quot; she says as she turns around and bend over slightly raising her tail just the slightest bit.
&gt;God dam
&gt;You step forward and put your hands on her hips and rub up and down gently with the head of your cock
&gt;She&#039;s purring and moaning
&gt;Your going all the way and rubbing her asshole gently then rubbing downwards in between her velvety lips and and poking her clit gently
&gt;&quot;Mmmmm stop teasing Love&quot; she moans
&gt;You line up with her pussy and slide into her gently
&gt;Her ears are flicking like crazy, her tail wrapped around your leg
&gt;You move slowly at first, gripping her hips and pulling her closer as you thrust into her
&gt;She&#039;s moaning and purring loudly as her eyes roll back slightly
&gt;You feel her walls clench around you as you continue to thrust into her 
&gt;You&#039;re sure if you were not showering, you would feel warm liquid splash down around you
&gt;&quot;Oh-oh god Annnnon - I-I-cant&quot; her legs give out again
&gt;You catch her and pick her up to face you
&gt;She&#039;s quivering slightly and looking at you longingly
&gt;You hook your elbows under her knees, she wraps her arms around you
&gt;You&#039;re holding her completely off the floor now
&gt;Her paws trace your back and she looks deep into your eyes 
&gt;You Slowly push into her slit
&gt;Inch by inch
&gt;She moans into your ear, wrapping her arms tighter around you 
&gt;You finally make the final push and are completely embedded into her
&gt;Her tail wraps around your leg
&gt;&quot;Do it&quot; she moans 
&gt;You start bouncing her on your engorged cock
&gt;Each thrust making a wet slapping sound as your bodies collide and separate
&gt;Her walls clench around you 
&gt;&quot;I-I-I---&quot; is all she can gasp put before she digs her claws into your back and she shudders, throwing her head back
&gt;Her pussy tightens harder and you continue thrusting into her. keeping the same pace
&gt;God she&#039;s tight
&gt;&quot;Clara..&quot; you gasp out &quot;Clara I&#039;m close&quot;
&gt;She snaps out of her after orgasm daze and Immediately Kisses you, you feel her tongue wrapping around yours
&gt;The combined stimulation from the kiss and her pussy overwhelm you 
&gt;With one last heaving thrust, you push yourself deep into her and release everything into her
&gt;Her pussy tightens again as she orgasms as well, shuddering
&gt;Each shudder causes her pussy to tighten and milk more from you.
&gt;You slowly pull out of her and set her back down
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s....That&#039;s one hell of a celebration&quot; she pants 
&gt;You catch your breath and hug her close, savoring feeling of the shower and her pressed against you.
&gt;&quot;I love you Clara&quot;
&gt;&quot;I love you too Anon&quot;
&gt;You both stay like this for a while before Clara pulls away &quot;We should probably actually shower&quot;
&gt;You can&#039;t help but agree
&gt;You help her wash her fur and tail
&gt;You both step out of the shower and into the blow dryer
&gt;It&#039;s like one of those car wash dryers 
&gt;The force of the air feels like its lifting you up
&gt;It only takes about 2 minutes of this before you are both dry 
&gt;Well you were dry after only about 10 seconds but still
&gt;You look at Clara and her fur is all poofed out
&gt;Pet the fuzzy tail is all you think
&gt;Fuck it, you actually did pet her tail
&gt;She looks back at you questioningly
&gt;&quot;Uhhh pet the fuzzy tail&quot; you pet it again
&gt;She hides a Snort of a laugh and covers her mouth
&gt;&quot;And when I first met you, I didn&#039;t think you were a nerd&quot; she says, smiling
&gt;She&#039;s wiping down her fur so it isn&#039;t so poofy
&gt;You put back on your clothes, since you didn&#039;t bring a change 
&gt;She goes to her room and you follow
&gt;You close the door behind you as you enter
&gt;She drops her towel and goes to her closet
&gt;God, is she gorgeous
&gt;You feel like the luckiest guy everytime you see her , naked or not
&gt;&quot;What underwear should I wear Anon?&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Hmm I like those red ones you own, we should go shopping for some new stuff though&quot; you answer
&gt;&quot;Why? I have enough underwear?&quot; she looks at you perplexed
&gt;She&#039;s pulling up those red lacy panties you like
&gt;&quot;Because dressing rooms are fun&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ohmygod you perv&quot; she says as she puts on the matching red bra &quot;But Ok, that would be fun&quot;
&gt;She pulls out a Muse T Shirt (your gift to her) and jean shorts and puts them on
&gt;A knock at the door
&gt;&quot;Come in&quot; calls Clara
&gt;Stacy pops her head in and says &quot;Wonderful! Now that you&#039;re clean&quot; 
&gt;She looks at you and winks before she continues &quot;How about anon stay for dinner?&quot;
&gt;Clara looks at you
&gt;&quot;Sure&quot; you say
It&#039;s going to be a good night
~~~~
2 weeks Later
&gt;You&#039;re Driving home
&gt;It&#039;s been great with Clara
&gt;Shes fun, she&#039;s sexy, and you love her
&gt;Today she had something to do with her schooling 
&gt;Something at a hospital or something
&gt;You hear firetrucks as you drive
&gt;So today you were probably going to stream drunk dark souls
&gt;You had gotten a few offers for sponsorship after the video of you went viral
&gt;They praise you as a hero or at least a champion of those in Anthro couples
&gt;Maybe you would...wait
&gt;Why is that fire truck turning down your street?
&gt;What is that smoke?
&gt;Your heart is racing
&gt;You speed down the street and your heart sinks
&gt;The words &quot;beast fucker&quot; spray painted on your driveway
&gt;Your house
&gt;Your house is on fire


&gt;Be Clara
&gt;Sou&#039;re speeding to Anon&#039;s house
&gt;You don&#039;t care if the police try to stop you
&gt;He needs you now more than ever
You pull into his street and drive past the news van, the firetruck and a few cop cars
&gt;One officer sees you and walks up to you as you get out of the car
&gt;&quot;Ms. Zaya?&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Yes that&#039;s me&quot; you answer him 
&gt;&quot;Hi, I&#039;m officer Johnson, I tried talking to Anon, but he&#039;s um... predisposed so I thought I would talk to you&quot;
&gt;Predisposed?
&gt;&quot;Uhm ok. any Idea whose did this? also is my family safe?&quot; you ask 
&gt;&quot;We have a patrol car near your parents house, as for who did this, a group already claimed responsibility for it. the call themselves the Society Holding Against Mixed Marriages or i guess SHAMM for short&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ok thank you officer. Uhm Where is anon?&quot; you ask politely
&gt;He sighs &quot;follow the yelling&quot;
&gt;You do hear a distinctive yell of incomprehensible words
&gt;You follow them to find Anon in the park behind his former house with a 2x4 of wood beating a tree and yelling a string of Curses
&gt;&quot;FUCKINGTWATSWALLOWSHITSTAINSHOMWOWWHORINGCUNTBITERS&quot;
&gt;Where did he even find a 2x4? You weren&#039;t going to ask
&gt;He seems to either want to cut down the tree with the 2x4 or cause it to break
&gt;Neither are happening
&gt;&quot;FUCKINGCUNTS!&quot; He yells as he throws the 2x4 into the inferno that was once his house
&gt;&quot;A GROUP CALLED SHAMM! SHAMM? WHERE THE FUCK IS VINCE TELLING ME ITS SUPER ABSORBENT!?&quot;
&gt;&quot;A-anon&quot; you say timidly
&gt;&quot;WHAT?!&quot; he yells
&gt;You recoil from him
&gt;He realizes what he did and softens up a bit
&gt;&quot;S-sorry Clara, I didn&#039;t me-&quot;
&gt;You cut him off
&gt;&quot;Its ok&quot; you walk forward and hug him around the waist
&gt;Everything he had from his family had been in the house
&gt;Every momento from his travels
&gt;Every award he had won for his service
&gt;No wonder he was mad
&gt;He hugs back
it&#039;ll be ok

~~~

A week Later
&gt;Be anon
&gt;Luckily you had insurance and your El camino had been getting painted when SHAMM burnt your house down
&gt;Those idiots were caught like 4 hours later too
&gt;Turns out they were a bunch of rednecks who traveled from like 3 states over in a truck with &quot;SHAMM&quot; painted on the side
&gt;Clara&#039;s parents were letting you stay at their house
&gt;John had actually warmed up to you somewhat
&gt;plus, a huge outreach from The Anthro Community
&gt;Kickstarters, Gofundme pages, one company even offered to put in a full Anthro friendly bathroom and sponsor your streams as long as you talked about them
&gt;That was all great, but your biggest supporter in all of this was Clara
&gt;When you two were not snuggling, video gaming, or having Sex, she was talking to different groups to try and get back things
&gt;&quot;Can you recover pictures from a burn out computer hard drive?&quot; &quot;Can we get New copies of the awards Anon earned&quot; 
&gt;Stuff like that
&gt;You had to drop all your classes though
&gt;All your school stuff was Extra crispy
&gt;But all that is behind you now, or at least it doesn&#039;t matter
&gt;You have date night planned!
&gt;A Surprise date night at that
&gt;Well Clara knew you were going on a date but she didn&#039;t know where
&gt;You had prepared everything
&gt;Painted El Camino, roll-able memory foam mattress, a few blankets, a good radio, and plenty of snacks.
&gt;She was getting dressed as you laid out on her....Your shared bed
&gt;Tough sleeping on a twin size again
&gt;&quot;What do I wear? how formal are we talking here Anon&quot; she says in an annoyed voice
&gt;She hates surprises or rather hates not knowing what they are.
&gt;&quot;Something comfortable, maybe that one skirt? The one that blueish?&quot; you reply
&gt;&quot;Fine, just get out while I change&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Comeon! I love watching you get dressed&quot; you say in mock sadness
&gt;&quot;You&#039;ve seen me naked hundreds of times&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ve seen the sunrise hundreds of times, doesn&#039;t make it any less beautiful&quot; you say as she shoos you out the door and closes it
&gt;Fine then 
&gt;You go down stairs 
&gt;John is in the kitchen, reading news on his tablet
&gt;&quot;Anon! Just the man I wanted to see&quot; He says, beckoning you over
&gt;&quot;You are good man&quot;
&gt;He&#039;s been drinking
&gt;&quot;You take good care of her, even in light of this tragedy against you&quot; he has one paw on your shoulder 
&gt;&quot;So when we get grandcubs ey?&quot; 
&gt;OH GOD
&gt;You play it cool though
&gt;&quot;When Clara and I have a place to call home together&quot; you say 
&gt;He seems satisfied with this answer
&gt;&quot;Good good good&quot; he rambles
&gt;You are saved by Stacy who pops her head in
&gt;&quot;John dear maybe we should get you to bed&quot; she has him by the shoulders and is leading him
&gt;She turns back to you
&gt;&quot;Have fun you two&quot; say says
&gt;You will
&gt;&quot;Ok Anon, I&#039;m ready&quot; Clara is walking down the stairs
&gt;You always stare
&gt;She&#039;s wearing a beautiful black top that shows off just enough cleavage and her dark blue Skirt with lace around the bottom
&gt;Her usual Black framed glasses replaced with a sleeker thinner frame
&gt;You smile at her 
&gt;&quot;you look gorgeous&quot;
&gt;&quot;You always say that&quot;
&gt;&quot;And I always mean it&quot;
&gt;She kisses you 
&gt;&quot;Lets go&quot; you say as you hold open the front door for her
&gt;She walks over to your jeep
&gt;&quot;Nope, wrong car love&quot; you say as you walk to your el camino
&gt;She looks confused
&gt;&quot;What? Why?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Secret&quot; you answer with a finger to your lips
&gt;She rolls her eyes as she gets in
&gt;You start the car up and it lets out a hearty roar
&gt;American Muscle cars are the best (fuck you if you think otherwise)
&gt;You drive a short way to a Sushi restaurant as you discuss the legal proceedings of SHAMM and how stupid their name is
&gt;She looks at you disappointed &quot;Sushi? that&#039;s it?&quot;
&gt;You smile as you head inside
&gt;This sushi place isn&#039;t a sit down restaurant but has good sushi
&gt;&quot;Order for Anon?&quot; the Anthro red panda behind the counter yells
&gt;&quot;Here&quot; you say as you walk up and grab the order
&gt;Clara looks confused as you walk back to the car
&gt;&quot;What have you got planned Mister &quot;she says coyly, wrapping her tail around your arm as you drive
Stuff
2 hours later
&gt;You&#039;ve driven pretty far from the city
&gt;You both ate sushi as you drove (your idea) 
&gt;You told jokes laughed and had fun
&gt;But the main event is coming up shortly
&gt;&quot;Where are we?&quot; she asks you
the problem with modern society is they got rid of the drive in movie, there were only a few left way outside of cities
&gt;You were pulling into one now though
&gt;Her eyes light up
&gt;&quot;NO WAY&quot; 
&gt;She&#039;s bouncing, her ears perked and her tail wrapped around your wrist
&gt;You smile
&gt;&quot;Surprise!&quot;
&gt;She smiles &quot;Ok, I love it, but why the el camino? The jeep has more space&quot;
&gt;You drive towards the back and then back the car into your respective space
&gt;&quot;Uhm Anon, the movie is the other....&quot; she says before it dawns on her
&gt;She whacks your arm
&gt;&quot;You sneaky cunt&quot; she says as she gets out
&gt;Here you are, perfect date night set
&gt;You unroll the mattress in the bed of the el camino, get up a few pillows, throw a few blankets in it put the radio on the cab (audio in drive-in movie theaters is via radios to get sound to the audience in case you didn&#039;t know)
&gt;You have set up an comfy outdoor bed in the bed of your el camino
&gt;Complete with some sushi and blankets for snuggling
&gt;Shes bouncing as you set up the makeshift bed
&gt;You smile as she crawls in and you turn on the radio and tune it to the frequency for movie audio
&gt;You get in after her
&gt;There you both are, cuddled together in the crisp night air, in the bed of an el camino watching a movie
&gt;She&#039;s got her arms around your arm, her tail around your body, her head leaned against you
&gt;Bliss
&gt;About half an hour into the movie, she shifts
&gt;She&#039;s crawling over you
&gt;She plops herself down into your lap and wraps your arms around her
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s much comfier this way&quot; she says
&gt;You can&#039;t argue, although her perfect ass is now right up against your crotch
&gt;She notices this and starts slowly grinding on you
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s wrong Anon? You look distracted, maybe I should see what bothering you?&quot;
&gt;She disappears under the blankets
&gt;&quot;Hey Clara Wha-a-a-at&quot; is all you can sputter out before she attacks you with her mouth
&gt;She&#039;s under the blankets, licking you 
&gt;Her tongue used to scare you a bit, after all it&#039;s a bit like sandpaper
&gt;Not anymore though
&gt;She&#039;s slowly licking up and down your member
&gt;&quot;Clara, we are outside you know&quot; you whisper as she takes the whole thing into her mouth
&gt;You didn&#039;t know she could deepthroat like that
&gt;She goes all the way down and all the way up then kisses the tip 
&gt;You hear her giggle as you twitch involuntarily
&gt;You&#039;re trying your hardest to keep a straight face as she licks up and down your shaft again
&gt;Her tongue is raspy but still very soft
&gt;She takes your cock back into her mouth and bobs up and down again, wrapping her tail around your legs
&gt;&quot;Holy fuck Clara, I&#039;m gonna--&quot; you say quiet enough for only her to hear
&gt;She takes your cock all the way in and you erupt directly into her throat
&gt;Her tongue licks up and down as if She’s trying to milk you with it
&gt;Slowly she slides up, eliciting shivers from you 
&gt;She stops at the tip and kisses it gently before sliding up into your lap again
&gt;&quot;Holy fuck Clara that was amazing&quot; you say as you nuzzle into her fuzzy cheek
&gt;&quot;We aren&#039;t done yet big boy&quot; she whispers and she grinds on you more &quot;Also I&#039;m not wearing any panties&quot;
&gt;You had your arms around her in a hug with your face in her neck
&gt;now one hand was sliding down her chest , over her tummy 
&gt;you go under her skirt and rub her lips gently
&gt;She&#039;s already wet
&gt;You rub her clit gently with your thumb and a slide one finger into her
&gt;She gasps and puts one paw on your face which is still nuzzled in her neck
&gt;You keep rubbing and fingering her gently
&gt;&quot;One more finger baby&quot; she whispers to you
&gt;You slide on more finger into her wetness and alternate curling them in her
&gt;You then push deeper and curl both fingers slightly, you know what she wants
&gt;You start rubbing her spot, gently but quickly pushing in and out of her all while keeping your thumb on her clit
&gt;&quot;Ah A-anon I&#039;m going to---&quot; She gasps loudly 
&gt;You quickly throw your left hand up and cover her mouth as she shudders, and you feel a splash of liquid soak your right hand
&gt;As you pull your hand from her muzzle, she takes one of your fingers into her mouth and sucks it gently
&gt;&quot;Mmmmm I can feel something is ready to go again&quot; She purrs to you
&gt;You were at fully erect again
&gt;She reaches under the blanket and pulls her skirt over your cock and you feel...something
&gt;Something plastic? Maybe rubber?
&gt;You&#039;re confused why is rubber....
&gt;&quot;Oh you finally found it&quot; she purrs as she kisses your neck &quot;Why don&#039;t you pull that out, and we can have some fun&quot;
&gt;In the immortal words of Noob-noob &quot;GOD DAM&quot;
&gt;You kiss into her neck &quot;When did you become such a freaky kitty?&quot;
&gt;&quot;When I fell in love with a human&quot; she purrs.
&gt;You reach down and grip the buttplug and slowly pull it out
&gt;She gasps and put a paw on your face and kisses you as it slides out
&gt;&quot;Mmmmm come on love&quot; she purrs 
&gt;you&#039;re looking down into her eyes as she says that
&gt;Mega erection
&gt;You use your hand and position your cock against her ass
&gt;She slowly lowers herself onto it
&gt;She gasps and shudders as you slowly slide into her tight asshole
&gt;Her footpaws shudder and her tail wraps around you as best she can with her shudders
&gt;She now taken all of you into her
&gt;&quot;Oh god Anon, I came from just that&quot; She purrs
&gt;&quot;Are you ready babe&quot; you say as you nuzzle back into her neck
&gt;&quot;Yes&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re taking the lead, gently lifting and lowering her on your cock
&gt;&quot;Ohhhh god yes Anon&quot; she purrs 
&gt;You can feel her fingering herself
&gt;You start moving faster 
&gt;Suddenly she takes the lead and starts moving on her own.
&gt;She&#039;s bouncing up and down on you, leaving you free to grab her Delicious tits and tease her nipples
&gt;You feel another splash of liquid and her walls clamp down on you
&gt;She stops bouncing and shudders again
&gt;You take the lead again and bounce her more 
&gt;&quot;Ahh A-anon do it&quot; 
&gt;You slam her down onto you and cover her mouth as she starts to moan loudly
&gt;You cum into her ass and keep squirting as she purrs
&gt;&quot;Put the plug back in when you pull out babe&quot; she says kissing you again
&gt;God dam
1 year later
&gt;You were ready were not you?
&gt;You felt like you forgot something still
&gt;Restaurant reservations- check
&gt;Fancy cloths-check
&gt;That special something- check
&gt;Now you just needed to pass the time until the reservation
&gt;It was going to be agony
~~~
&gt;Be Clara
&gt;You have never seen Anon like this
&gt;First, he was in the back yard mowing 
&gt;Then, he was trying and horribly failing at games you knew he was great at
&gt;He even burned breakfast, which was one of his fortes 
&gt;He kept checking his watch and swearing softly
&gt;Something was up but you didn&#039;t know 
~~~~
&gt;Be Anon 
&gt;It was time
&gt;Finally, after all day of trying to calm your nerves and failing utterly
&gt;Clara kept asking if you were alright and if you were ill
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m fine&quot; you answered every time and every time she looks skeptical
&gt;&quot;Clara go change into something fancy, I have a surprise for you&quot; you call to her 
&gt;She&#039;s playing destiny 2 with some of her friends in the other room
&gt;&quot;Uhm ok Anon, what&#039;s this surprise&quot; she says dejectedly &quot;We were in a raid&quot;
&gt;&quot;Trust me you&#039;ll like this more&quot; 
&gt;She narrows her eyes and goes to the bedroom of your house that had been rebuilt
&gt;&quot;How fancy?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Very&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Ugh I hate getting fancy, this better be the best goddam surprise&quot;
&gt;Oh she had no idea
&gt;About 30 minutes later, she emerges wearing a black dress and black heels
&gt;&quot;Ok, what are you wear--&quot;
&gt;She stops mid question
&gt;you&#039;re clean shaven, wearing a White button up and a black tie, black dress pants and Dress shoes
&gt;&quot;Wait, when did you change, and where did you get all that?&quot; She asks you
&gt;You smile &quot;secrets secrets&quot;
&gt;&quot;Hmpf fine!&quot;
&gt;You open the front door for her and usher her out
&gt;&quot;Where are we going Anon?&quot;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;ll see&quot;
smooth dude
~
&gt;45 minutes later you pull up to the restaurant
&gt;You watch as Clara&#039;s eyes go wide
&gt;&quot;Oh my god Anon, I&#039;ve been wanting to go here!&quot; She says and she bounces happily, her tail swishing around
&gt;It&#039;s the fanciest steak restaurant in the city
&gt;&quot;I know love&quot; you answer calmly
&gt;&quot;How?! You need a reservation and you have to get it at least--&quot;
&gt;&quot;3 months in advance&quot; you say smugly &quot;I know&quot;
&gt;You pull up and give the valet the keys
&gt;You help Clara out of the car and walk with her to the entrance and open the door for her
&gt;&quot;Ah Mr.Anon we&#039;ve been expecting you&quot; An Anthro Jaguar says to you &quot;Please follow me to your table&quot;
&gt;You get to the table and watch Clara
&gt;Her eyes are wide and her Paws are covering her mouth, her ears flicking gently
&gt;There are a dozen roses on the table, which is in its own room
&gt;You pull her chair out for her and she sits
&gt;You sit down across from her
&gt;&quot;Anon how much is all this? You didn&#039;t have to do all this did you&quot; she says, looking around
&gt;&quot;Anything for the woman I love&quot; 
&gt;You smile &quot;Go ahead and get whatever you want&quot; 
&gt;She&#039;s looking at the menu, eyes wide
&gt;&quot;They have that Japan steak I told you about Anon! The one that&#039;s like $150 per steak!&quot; she says amazed
&gt;&quot;Get it if you want&quot;
&gt;You both order
soon
After dinner
&gt;&quot;Anon this was an amazing night&quot; she says sipping her wine
&gt;You smile
&gt;You reach into your pocket and pull out a small box
&gt;Clara&#039;s eyes go wider than ever before
&quot;A-anon? what&#039;s?&quot;
&gt;she gasps and puts her paws to her mouth as you get down on one knee and open the box to her
&quot;Clara, you are the best friend I&#039;ve ever had and the most amazing woman. Now will you make me the happiest man and Marry me?&quot; you say looking up into her bright blue eyes, which are tearing up
&gt;&quot;Y-yes!&quot; She says happily, putting out her paw
&gt;You slide the ring over her fur and past her pad
&gt;You stand up and kiss her &quot;Hows that for best surprise?&quot;
~~~
2 years Later
&gt;Be anon
&gt;You&#039;re sitting playing video games on your couch, with them on silent
&gt;Clara should be home soon
&gt;Actually, you hear her car pull up
&gt;A moment later she walks in
&gt;She&#039;s wearing her nurse scrubs
&gt;You shift slightly and get a soft whimper from your right
&gt;You look over
&gt;&quot;Ohh look who&#039;s awake!&quot; you coo
&gt;Yours and Clara&#039;s first cub stares out at you
&gt;She looks just like Clara did except she has your eyes
&gt;You scoop her up and tickle her paws gently getting a tiny laugh
&gt;You walk over to Clara and give her a kiss.
&gt;&quot;I Love you Clara&quot;
&gt;&quot;I Love you Anon&quot;
All this because you decided to go to college
