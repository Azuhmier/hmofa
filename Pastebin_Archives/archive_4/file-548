Hehehe...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your time together is then cut terribly short when you notice the time on the clock.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Hey Mal, looks like itâ€™s time to go.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Awww...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I know, I know. C&#039;mon, get up.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You push the reluctant yeen off of you and into her chair, and she starts to readjust her tie and gets her coat back on.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Both of you make it to the door, and you hold it open for your disabled mate.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Out the building&#039;s bottom floor and to the parking lot outside in the dark of the wee hours, you unlock your Impreza.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You roll her down the ramp and to the passenger side of the car, and help her climb in before collapsing her chair and stuffing it into the back seat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s all small talk from there, just you and Mallory riding to her work.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Arriving, she leans over and kisses you on the cheek when you park.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Oh honey, we can do better.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Following up with a deeper, closer embrace as you turn off the car, you rub her back comfortingly one last time.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Have fun at work, love.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t cause too much trouble at home, Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I won&#039;t...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Good.

You wave to your love.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Bye hon!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She giggles, and goes in.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You contemplate the morning, and the gold ring around your finger.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;How lucky you are.</div></li></ol>        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Fast breathing, tightly wrapped arms, and a damp shoulder greet you when you stir awake with a groan.
&gt;&quot;A-Anon?&quot; The voice is quiet, feminine, worried.
&gt;You bolt awake when you realize what&#039;s going on.
&quot;Shhhhâ€¦ It&#039;s alright, honey. Everything&#039;s fine. I&#039;m here for you.&quot;
&gt;Only sobs meet your voice.
&gt;You rub the big yeen&#039;s back, running fur-less fingers through soft tan fluff.
&gt;A few minutes of this helps her cool down enough to breathe evenly again.
&quot;You okay Mallory?&quot;
&gt;A bolt of lightning strikes nearby, and she hunkers down around you again.
&gt;&quot;M-my-my l-l-egs... I c-can-n&#039;t feel m-my legs...&quot;
&gt;You feel her shake against you, tears starting to flow freely again.
&gt;She used to love the rain and the thunder.
&quot;Just lean into me, Mal. You&#039;re in my arms hon. I&#039;m here. You&#039;re right here at home in my arms.&quot;
&gt;Fuck those motherfucking hajjis.
&gt;Fuck their villages.
&gt;Fuck their lands.
&gt;Fuck their oil.
&gt;Fuck &#039;em all.
&gt;You dare a glance at the clock over the hyenaâ€™s shoulder.
&gt;0322 in bright red lettering glares back at you.
&quot;Mal?&quot;
&gt;&quot;A-Anon?&quot;
&quot;I love you.&quot;
&gt;The proud soldier looks up with teary eyes, unflinching even at the loud report of another lightning bolt.
&gt;&quot;I-I love you t-too, Anon.&quot;
&gt;She seems to calm down after that, seeming to remember where she is.
&gt;The yeen steadies, and you find yourself drifting with her into slumber once more...
---
&gt;You wake up to the yeen you love petting your head softly.
&gt;You grumble, but nuzzle into her bosom lovingly.
&gt;&quot;Morning, Anon.&quot;
&quot;Bad dream?&quot;
&gt;She just pets you a few minutes longer.
&gt;&quot;We need to get up and go, love. It&#039;s almost five.&quot;
&gt;Another groan, and you roll away from her soft grasp and onto your feet out of the bed.
&gt;You lazily step up to the dresser, and give a short look at her shadowbox.
&gt;She misses the Army, sometimes.
&gt;She always says &quot;Fuck the desert,&quot; but you still see it in her eyes every so often.
&gt;The way she stares at those ribbons, those ranks, those badges and photos.
&gt;You know the hyena all too well.
&gt;She always tells you about how she saw it as the tenth circle of hell, but you know better.
&gt;You know, deep down beneath those spots and that thick muscle, she misses it, sometimes.
&gt;She misses her friends.
&gt;She misses the desert.
&gt;She misses the pounding of the .50.
&gt;She misses her legs.
&gt;Medical discharge, honorable of course.
&gt;Sent home with a bronze star (with valor), purple heart, and a week in the hospital.
&gt;She&#039;d been lucky. Guy in the passenger seat lost his legs *and* his dick.
&gt;Poor Lieutenant Avery.
&gt;Rest of the Humvee got out with minor head trauma.
&gt;Hajjis hadn&#039;t set the explosives right, only half the load went off.
&gt;You would only have a flag if those idiots weren&#039;t such fuckups.
&gt;Fuck.
&gt;You and your love don&#039;t get many days off together, unfortunately.
&gt;Fortunately you do get paid enough for Mallory&#039;s prosthetics to not have caused a financial crisis. Fuckers are expensive.
&quot;Hey.&quot;
&gt;She looks up.
&quot;Mornin&#039; Mal.&quot;
&gt;She smiles at your half-awake grumblings.
&gt;If you hadn&#039;t been together so long, those teeth would be intimidating.
&gt;Her height would be, too, if she hadn&#039;t lost half of it.
&gt;If. So many &#039;If&#039;s.
&gt;You shake yourself awake.
&gt;Her giggles are music to your ears.
&gt;The dresser rolls open with a tug, and you pull out a shirt and pair of pants; the ones you know she likes best.
&gt;She sighs.
&gt;&quot;Shit Anon, if I didnâ€™t work today, you and I would be fucking right now.&quot;
&gt;No doubt she&#039;s staring at your ass.
&gt;Well, who are you to deny her a show?
&gt;You bend over and let her leer as you grab your socks. A quick glance behind you confirms your suspicions.
&quot;See something you like, hon?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Every day.&quot;
&gt;You turn when you stand and watch your lovely mate shuffle and open up her wheelchair, dropping into it gracelessly.
&gt;She&#039;s gotten quite good at that little trick, no matter how bad it looks.
&gt;Despite how much she needs you, Mallory always strives for independence.
&gt;How&#039;d she put it? &quot;I just want to be normal&quot;?
&gt;The walk around the bed is short
&gt;The kiss you share with her is anything but.
&gt;She sighs through her nose while she hangs upon your shoulders, reaching even despite your bent posture.
&gt;You hate to break the embrace, but there&#039;s shit to do.
&gt;&quot;Gods, I love you Anon.&quot;
&quot;I love you too, Mal. Bath?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Hell yeah. Let me get my shit together.&quot;
&gt;You get out of the former grunt&#039;s way and she sets about grabbing her things.
&gt;The small bathroom isnâ€™t much, but it&#039;s accessible, like the rest of the apartment.
&gt;The hyena rolls in to set her fake legs, clothes, and other effects by the sink right as the water&#039;s getting warm.
&gt;&quot;Can I get a hand, honey?&quot;
&gt;Legs or no legs, she&#039;s still just as pretty and as wonderful as the day you met her.
&gt;Russet fur and chocolate spots, amber eyes and bright emotion, white chest and pink nipples.
&gt;She&#039;s still the girl you fell in love with.
&gt;&quot;Heh, you still there Anon? I mean, I do enjoy the attention, but the morning wonâ€™t last foreverâ€¦&quot;
&gt;You realize just how long you&#039;ve been staring at her nude form (and how painfully erect you are), and blush.
&quot;Sorry... Here.&quot;
&gt;Taking her proffered hand and lifting the naked vet into the tub, Mal giggles.
&gt;&quot;What would I do without you, love? Oh! That&#039;s cold!&quot;
&quot;Sorry, water&#039;s warm. Tub might not be yet.&quot;
&gt;She nods.
&gt;&quot;Go get breakfast ready, Anon. Come get me in ten.&quot;
&quot;Yes ma&#039;am.&quot;
&gt;A quick kiss, and you&#039;re off. You love it when sheâ€™s like that, all commanding and such.
&gt;Reflecting how thick Mallory&#039;s figure is, her appetite is unending compared to yours.
&gt;Before (and during) her deployment, she was able to just work it off by exercising. Now, however...
&gt;It&#039;s alright though. You quite enjoy how soft her belly has gotten.
&gt;You&#039;ve become somewhat of an expert at making Malâ€™s preferred quick-start breakfast.
&gt;Two eggs, some diced potato hash, and toast with butter and jam. Maybe an apple to split between the two of you if sheâ€™s feeling &quot;fruity&quot;.
&gt;Your breakfast is much simpler: a bowl of corn Chex and a banana.
&gt;Oh, and thereâ€™s always Malâ€™s favorite part: her &#039;special&#039; cookies.
&gt;They don&#039;t work for everyone, but she practically can&#039;t go a day without at least half of one.
&gt;She says they do wonders for all kinds of symptoms, from the ringing ears to her phantom pains.
&gt;You also know she likes how they make her feel (plus they make her especially ticklish, for some reason).
&gt;You just finish plating everything and start in on your cereal when you realize that it&#039;s been almost twelve full minutes since you left her.
&gt;She hates it when you&#039;re late.
&gt;Even running across the small apartment to her can&#039;t save you from her ire.
&gt;In the empty tub sits a soaked, royally pissed hyena.
&gt;Her glare is piercing, and you almost flinch from its ferocity.
&gt;&quot;If I were to suddenly regrow my feet, I&#039;d have my foot so far up your ass youâ€™d be licking my toes. Do you know how long I&#039;ve been sitting here?!&quot;
&quot;Two minutes...&quot;
&gt;&quot;TWO MIN-&quot; she remembers sheâ€™s still in the apartment, &quot;Two minutes! You&#039;d have better cooked up a hell of a meal, Anon, or I&#039;ll have your ass instead!&quot; She&#039;ll do it, too.
&quot;S-sorry, Mal. Lost track of time.&quot;
&gt;Nice stutter.
&gt;&quot;Whatever. Just hurry up and dry me off, dumbass.&quot; You get to it, sneaking a grope in when you think sheâ€™s not paying attention.
&gt;&quot;Hey! Quit fuckin&#039; around and actually dry me off, damnit!&quot;
&gt;Some time later, and youâ€™re helping the morph out into her seat again.
&gt;&quot;Alright, now get going. I&#039;ve got the rest from here.&quot;
&quot;You sure?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes I&#039;m sure! I&#039;m not a baby!&quot;
&quot;Didn&#039;t seem like that last night.&quot;
&gt;She shrinks a bit. Normally she takes that sort of thing like the light-hearted comment you meant it to be.
&gt;That nightmare must&#039;ve really sucked.
&quot;Hey, you okay? You need me to leave?&quot;
&gt;&quot;No! N-no. Justâ€¦ stay here. With me.&quot;
&gt;You pat her head and scritch her ears before setting your ass on the counter.
&gt;She rolls up and starts getting her faux-limbs and work clothing on, brushing her hair, and fixing herself for her workday.
&gt;You just sit there in companionable silence, knowing your presence at this time of day is a comfort to her.
&gt;She finishes brushing those sharp teeth, and spits.
&gt;&quot;How do I look?&quot; A worried chuckle escapes her.
&quot;Gorgeous as always.&quot;
&gt;&quot;T-thanks, hon.&quot; Malloryâ€™s blushing, and you canâ€™t help but smile.
&quot;Breakfast? It&#039;s probably a little cold by now, but still.&quot;
&gt;Her emphatic nod earns a nice laugh from you, and you hop down and push the anthro female along.
&gt;The two of you get to the table and quickly begin eating.
&gt;Your Chex are soggy, and you know her eggs are cold by her expression, but the yeen is still grateful for the help.
&gt;&quot;Looks like I won&#039;t be chewing on your rear today, Anon. Thanks.&quot;
&gt;You wipe your brow exaggeratedly, and she nearly chokes on a bite.
&quot;So, on a more serious topic...&quot;
&gt;The look she gives you is worried, but open nonetheless.
&gt;&quot;Is it about my dream?&quot; You nod, and she whimpers. &quot;It was nothing t-too serious... Just the usual, trapped in the H-Humvee, again... Th-then losing feeling in my legs...&quot; Her whimpering gets louder.
&quot;Hey, it&#039;s alright Mal. I&#039;m here for you, okay? No need to be ashamed.&quot;
&gt;She perks up a bit at that.
&quot;T-thanks Anon. I love you.&quot;
&gt;You both finish quickly thereafter, and as Mallory grabs her work bag you retrieve the keys to the car.
&gt;She rinses her dish out in the sink and leaves it, and you push open the blinds to see the sky just starting to lighten to a nice blue.
&gt;&quot;Hey, honey? We still have about half an hour until we need to leave, really.&quot;
&quot;You want to sit on the couch and cuddle.&quot;
&gt;Mal nods happily, and you sigh.
&gt;A short jaunt to the couch, and you pull the dressed-up hyena into your lap.
&gt;&quot;Eep! Careful! I don&#039;t want to get wrinkles in my skirt.&quot;
&gt;She pulls off her coat and hangs it on the handle of the wheelchair.
&quot;Oh hush you. You would gladly wear wrinkled things if it meant snuggling with me a few minutes more.&quot;
&gt;She growls, but doesn&#039;t deny it.
&gt;You rub her belly and kiss her head, running all over her torso and chest, sometimes even copping an intimate feel.
&gt;She sighs happily, and you both relax to the sounds of the morning: footsteps, running water, soft breathingâ€¦
&gt;Suddenly, feeling mischievous, you curl your fingers against Mallory&#039;s sides, tickling her.
&gt;&quot;Aahhh! Anon! S-stop! Hahaha!&quot; She laughs uncontrollably, squirming and flailing, helpless to escape your cruel grasp.
&gt;You just smile lazily.
&quot;Say you give in.&quot;
&gt;She looks back at you, and you stop to let her breathe.
&gt;&quot;Never...&quot;
&quot;What was that?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I said neve-aaaAHH!&quot; You keep going.
&quot;All you have to do is say you give in...&quot;
&gt;&quot;Iâ€™ll never surrender to you, Anon!&quot;
&quot;Well then, I guess Iâ€™ll never stop tickling you.&quot;
&gt;This keeps going a few more times, before she finally admits defeat.
&gt;&quot;I yield! I yield! Please, Anon! Let me go.&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t.
&gt;&quot;Anon, please. Let go!&quot;
&quot;Say it.&quot;
&gt;She growls, and you press in at her flanks again, making her tense up.
&gt;&quot;Iâ€¦ I give in,&quot; the hyena says with more than just a little shame.
&gt;You return to petting her and pinching playfully at that cute belly of hers, getting her to squeak softly every time you do.
&quot;Battle-hardened, eh? Hehehe...&quot;
&gt;Your time together is then cut terribly short when you notice the time on the clock.
&quot;Hey Mal, looks like itâ€™s time to go.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Awww...&quot;
&quot;I know, I know. C&#039;mon, get up.&quot;
&gt;You push the reluctant yeen off of you and into her chair, and she starts to readjust her tie and gets her coat back on.
&gt;Both of you make it to the door, and you hold it open for your disabled mate.
&gt;Out the building&#039;s bottom floor and to the parking lot outside in the dark of the wee hours, you unlock your Impreza.
&gt;You roll her down the ramp and to the passenger side of the car, and help her climb in before collapsing her chair and stuffing it into the back seat.
&gt;It&#039;s all small talk from there, just you and Mallory riding to her work.
&gt;Arriving, she leans over and kisses you on the cheek when you park.
&quot;Oh honey, we can do better.&quot;
&gt;Following up with a deeper, closer embrace as you turn off the car, you rub her back comfortingly one last time.
&quot;Have fun at work, love.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t cause too much trouble at home, Anon.&quot;
&quot;I won&#039;t...&quot;
&gt;&quot;Good. Now help me out of here.&quot;
&gt;You jump out and unfold the chair, opening Mal&#039;s door and carrying her into the implement.
&gt;A final goodbye kiss, and she&#039;s wheeling to work. You wave to your love.
&quot;Bye hon!&quot;
&gt;She giggles, and goes in.
&gt;You contemplate the morning, and the gold ring around your finger.
&gt;How lucky you are.</textarea>
