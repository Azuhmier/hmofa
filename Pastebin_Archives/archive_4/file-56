Is? ...Has been? Whatever, she would usually be described as a delinquent</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tall, Tough, and with fur dye tattoos covering her muscular arms</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her short hair, dyed neon blue, and usually wearing a leather biker jacket; she looked like she was robbing you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In fact a few cops had stopped you both in the streets on date nights, asking you if everything was ok.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You always wrapped one arm around Aisha&#039;s waist and pulled her close, earning a surprised yelp from her when that happened</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That little squeak is what made the cops believe you when you said it was a date between the two of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her embarrassed look is what convinced them, and her trying to hide behind you really sold it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was, and still is embarrassed about being seen as soft and loving</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Having grown up in a large family of criminals, she had to be tough</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her father has been in prison for 15 years, her older brother was in jail for robbery, and her younger siblings all had various crimes marking their records</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But Aisha didn&#039;t.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mainly because of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You told her that if she needed money, you would help her so she didn&#039;t have to rob people or burgle or whatever</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She deserved better, and you were determined to help her realize it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But all that falls to the wayside as you step out of the sushi restaurant, your arm locked around her muscular arm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Where to now Babe?&quot; you ask happily, looking up at her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you had a classic date, a Movie at the theaters and dinner.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She bites her lower lip and looks to the side concerned at what she has to say</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You already know it’s because of something with her family</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Uh...Can we go to your place Anon? I think one of my brothers has a girlfriend over or something&quot; she says, not looking you in the eyes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A weak excuse, but not one you were going to argue with</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ok Love, Lets go&quot; you say with a smile</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hand interlocked with her padded fingers, you lead her back to her motorcycle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She learned to ride early on, and buying a car is expensive, so usually she gave you rides everywhere</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The confused looks from people at your college were priceless she dropped you off and gave you a goodbye kiss</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A muscular paw squeezes your butt as you grab your helmet, making you jump in surprise</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hey!&quot; you call out in anger as you look to Aisha, who giggles</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Sorry sorry! You’re just SO cute!&quot; she says with a grin, buckling her own helmet over her dyed hair</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a quick sweep of her leg, she’s on her bike and patting the seat behind her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Come on Anon&quot; she cooes softly, the way she speaks would surprise anyone else, the soft voice coming from such a tough looking woman is startling at best</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Quickly you swing a leg over the bike and wrap your arms around her waist, earning a satisfied “mmm&quot; from her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You know that it is only for you to hear, as she reves up her bike and sets off to your apartment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The world blurs by as you hug her close</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In times like this, when there was nothing but the sound of her bike, you and her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were truly reminded of how close you were to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yea, you both looked like polar opposites, but you knew everything about her, her loses and fears</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But that didn’t matter, it never did</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even now as your arms were wrapped around Aisha&#039;s thicc waist, you didn’t think about your differences</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Rather you thought about everything you had in common</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Both of you had parents who didn’t care</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sure, it was pure coincidence that you grew up with parents who would rather get high </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And she grew up with parents who would rather go rob someone over raising thier children</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Somehow it brought you both closer together</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe it’s because when you have no one else rooting for you, all you need is one other person rooting you on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For you that other person just happened to be her, and you were sure for her, you were that other person</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And in the end, you didn’t need anyone else; you were self-sufficient, but having Aisha&#039;s approval made every accomplishment that much sweeter.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When she told you of every small thing,  her getting accepted into the local trade school; her graduating high school as the first one in her family... you threw a small party consisting of just you and her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her bike roars as she splits the lanes of traffic, zooming in-between the cars at a standstill.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your state never did make it illegal, so she would take advantage of it, regardless of how you said it terrified you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some things you just could never change, and her veering through traffic was one of them.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But if that was it, just her being defiant about lane splitting, that was one you were willing to concede.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The highway is packed because of nothing, just people being right assholes and slowing down for literally nothing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It used to annoy you, getting stuck in traffic for some assholes who were so engrossed watching a cop pull over some dumb idiot who sped.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Those things didn’t bother you anymore, Aisha liked to drive, and you didn’t mind being a passenger to this wild ride.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hold her close as the world zips by in a roaring flurry, earning satisfied high pitched “A Hummmm&quot; noises from Aisha</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If you didn’t have your head pressed against her back you would miss those small noises, but you were so glad you didn’t.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hearing her enjoyment from it all was the best drug you could ever have.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re so lost in thought, mesmerized by Aisha&#039;s firm body and the sounds she makes, that you don’t even realized that you&#039;re at your apartment.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nuzzles, tight hugs, and happy whimpers from Aisha tell you this night isn’t one of sex, but one of quiet snuggles.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Overflowing love between two people who deserved it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was perfect as you unlocked your apartment door and got pulled softly by Aisha to your bedroom.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No words are needed as you bother strip happily.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her to just a pair of stretched panties, and you to a pair of loose boxers.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had gotten an extra-long bed to accommodate her height a while ago, even though she hated that you spent money on her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She always did hate when you bought things for her sake, even now, after so many months into your relationship.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;months? Years? Did it matter?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She is your best friend and you don’t mind spending a bit of money for her comfort.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Both of you slip into your bed in your preferred sleeping positions; you on your back and her cuddled up to your side</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Perfect for you to wrap one arm around her waist and pull her close.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I love you Anon&quot; Aisha whispers happily, snuggling her head into your chest.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I love you too Aisha&quot; you murmur, half asleep already.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It had been a long day; although it had been wonderful to spend with Aisha, a day on your feet all day was exhausting</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Aisha&#039;s large head nuzzles into your chest, pulling the blankets into a small pillow between her head and your bony ribs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Thank you for such a wonderful day&quot; she murmurs happily, her large ears twitching and tickling your chin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You rub your hand up and down her back in reassurance</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I had such a good time with you babe&quot; you say with the aloofness only fatigue can bring.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A happy, &quot;Ahum&quot; is the only answer you get from her and she pulls you closer to her.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear rain start to splatter against your windows and the two of you drift off to sleep together</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Weight, or was it pressure?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Something pressing down on your chest and limbs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not pressing like Aisha&#039;s comforting weight on you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No, this was all encompassing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You struggle against it and feel your body collapse upon itself, not listening to your commands to move.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nothing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No response from your body at all.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You struggle against it, trying hard to move, only to have the feeling change</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was no longer crushing weight, but dozens of spectral hands pulling you downwards into the bed.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The only thing you can control is your eyes as you search around for answers as to what is tormenting you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They rest, at long last, on your semi open closet door.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Did you leave it open? Or did Aisha?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Doesn’t matter now as a pair of blood red glowing eyes stare at you, with dozens of ghastly hands spewing forth from the closet opening.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All you can do is whimper softly, as you feel the hands pulling you towards the closet.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your fearful whimpers cause a soft stirring </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;How could you forget Aisha?

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;This evening had been perfect for you.
&gt;How could it not have been?
&gt;You got to spend the entire day with Aisha, your girlfriend
&gt;Sure both of you earned random stares throughout the day, but you did your best to ignore them.
&gt;After all, people staring was nothing new.
&gt;She is a 7 foot tall African spotted dog anthro, while you are just...You.
&gt;Her confession of love to you was out of the blue, with her saying she loved you because of all you did for her.
&gt;Turns out all you did was let her copy your homework so she wouldn&#039;t fail chemistry back in high school.
&gt;But that was all it took it seems, with you now in college and her in a trade school for fixing Motorcycles.
&gt;Both of you had stuck through it, despite how it looked to outsiders
&gt;She was... Is? ...Has been? Whatever, she would usually be described as a delinquent
&gt;Tall, Tough, and with fur dye tattoos covering her muscular arms
&gt;Her short hair, dyed neon blue, and usually wearing a leather biker jacket; she looked like she was robbing you
&gt;In fact a few cops had stopped you both in the streets on date nights, asking you if everything was ok.
&gt;You always wrapped one arm around Aisha&#039;s waist and pulled her close, earning a surprised yelp from her when that happened
&gt;That little squeak is what made the cops believe you when you said it was a date between the two of you.
&gt;Her embarrassed look is what convinced them, and her trying to hide behind you really sold it
&gt;She was, and still is embarrassed about being seen as soft and loving
&gt;Having grown up in a large family of criminals, she had to be tough
&gt;Her father has been in prison for 15 years, her older brother was in jail for robbery, and her younger siblings all had various crimes marking their records
&gt;But Aisha didn&#039;t.
&gt;Mainly because of you
&gt;You told her that if she needed money, you would help her so she didn&#039;t have to rob people or burgle or whatever
&gt;She deserved better, and you were determined to help her realize it
&gt;But all that falls to the wayside as you step out of the sushi restaurant, your arm locked around her muscular arm
&gt;&quot;Where to now Babe?&quot; you ask happily, looking up at her.
&gt;The two of you had a classic date, a Movie at the theaters and dinner.
&gt;She bites her lower lip and looks to the side concerned at what she has to say
&gt;You already know it’s because of something with her family
&gt;&quot;Uh...Can we go to your place Anon? I think one of my brothers has a girlfriend over or something&quot; she says, not looking you in the eyes.
&gt;A weak excuse, but not one you were going to argue with
&gt;&quot;Ok Love, Lets go&quot; you say with a smile
&gt;You hand interlocked with her padded fingers, you lead her back to her motorcycle.
&gt;She learned to ride early on, and buying a car is expensive, so usually she gave you rides everywhere
&gt;The confused looks from people at your college were priceless she dropped you off and gave you a goodbye kiss
&gt;A muscular paw squeezes your butt as you grab your helmet, making you jump in surprise
&gt;&quot;Hey!&quot; you call out in anger as you look to Aisha, who giggles
&gt;&quot;Sorry sorry! You’re just SO cute!&quot; she says with a grin, buckling her own helmet over her dyed hair
&gt;With a quick sweep of her leg, she’s on her bike and patting the seat behind her
&gt;&quot;Come on Anon&quot; she cooes softly, the way she speaks would surprise anyone else, the soft voice coming from such a tough looking woman is startling at best
&gt;Quickly you swing a leg over the bike and wrap your arms around her waist, earning a satisfied “mmm&quot; from her
&gt;You know that it is only for you to hear, as she reves up her bike and sets off to your apartment
&gt;The world blurs by as you hug her close
&gt;In times like this, when there was nothing but the sound of her bike, you and her
&gt;You were truly reminded of how close you were to her
&gt;Yea, you both looked like polar opposites, but you knew everything about her, her loses and fears
&gt;But that didn’t matter, it never did
&gt;Even now as your arms were wrapped around Aisha&#039;s thicc waist, you didn’t think about your differences
&gt;Rather you thought about everything you had in common
&gt;Both of you had parents who didn’t care
&gt;Sure, it was pure coincidence that you grew up with parents who would rather get high 
&gt;And she grew up with parents who would rather go rob someone over raising thier children
&gt;Somehow it brought you both closer together
&gt;Maybe it’s because when you have no one else rooting for you, all you need is one other person rooting you on
&gt;For you that other person just happened to be her, and you were sure for her, you were that other person
&gt;And in the end, you didn’t need anyone else; you were self-sufficient, but having Aisha&#039;s approval made every accomplishment that much sweeter.
&gt;When she told you of every small thing,  her getting accepted into the local trade school; her graduating high school as the first one in her family... you threw a small party consisting of just you and her.
&gt;Her bike roars as she splits the lanes of traffic, zooming in-between the cars at a standstill.
&gt;Your state never did make it illegal, so she would take advantage of it, regardless of how you said it terrified you.
&gt;Some things you just could never change, and her veering through traffic was one of them.
&gt;But if that was it, just her being defiant about lane splitting, that was one you were willing to concede.
&gt;The highway is packed because of nothing, just people being right assholes and slowing down for literally nothing.
&gt;It used to annoy you, getting stuck in traffic for some assholes who were so engrossed watching a cop pull over some dumb idiot who sped.
&gt;Those things didn’t bother you anymore, Aisha liked to drive, and you didn’t mind being a passenger to this wild ride.
&gt;You hold her close as the world zips by in a roaring flurry, earning satisfied high pitched “A Hummmm&quot; noises from Aisha
&gt;If you didn’t have your head pressed against her back you would miss those small noises, but you were so glad you didn’t.
&gt;Hearing her enjoyment from it all was the best drug you could ever have.
&gt;You&#039;re so lost in thought, mesmerized by Aisha&#039;s firm body and the sounds she makes, that you don’t even realized that you&#039;re at your apartment.
&gt;Nuzzles, tight hugs, and happy whimpers from Aisha tell you this night isn’t one of sex, but one of quiet snuggles.
&gt;Overflowing love between two people who deserved it.
&gt;It was perfect as you unlocked your apartment door and got pulled softly by Aisha to your bedroom.
&gt;No words are needed as you bother strip happily.
&gt;Her to just a pair of stretched panties, and you to a pair of loose boxers.
&gt;You had gotten an extra-long bed to accommodate her height a while ago, even though she hated that you spent money on her.
&gt;She always did hate when you bought things for her sake, even now, after so many months into your relationship.
&gt;months? Years? Did it matter?
&gt;She is your best friend and you don’t mind spending a bit of money for her comfort.
&gt;Both of you slip into your bed in your preferred sleeping positions; you on your back and her cuddled up to your side
&gt;Perfect for you to wrap one arm around her waist and pull her close.
&gt;&quot;I love you Anon&quot; Aisha whispers happily, snuggling her head into your chest.
&gt;&quot;I love you too Aisha&quot; you murmur, half asleep already.
&gt;It had been a long day; although it had been wonderful to spend with Aisha, a day on your feet all day was exhausting
&gt;Aisha&#039;s large head nuzzles into your chest, pulling the blankets into a small pillow between her head and your bony ribs
&gt;&quot;Thank you for such a wonderful day&quot; she murmurs happily, her large ears twitching and tickling your chin.
&gt;You rub your hand up and down her back in reassurance
&gt;&quot;I had such a good time with you babe&quot; you say with the aloofness only fatigue can bring.
&gt;A happy, &quot;Ahum&quot; is the only answer you get from her and she pulls you closer to her.
&gt;You hear rain start to splatter against your windows and the two of you drift off to sleep together

&gt;Weight, or was it pressure?
&gt;Something pressing down on your chest and limbs.
&gt;Not pressing like Aisha&#039;s comforting weight on you.
&gt;No, this was all encompassing.
&gt;You struggle against it and feel your body collapse upon itself, not listening to your commands to move.
&gt;Nothing.
&gt;No response from your body at all.
&gt;You struggle against it, trying hard to move, only to have the feeling change
&gt;It was no longer crushing weight, but dozens of spectral hands pulling you downwards into the bed.
&gt;The only thing you can control is your eyes as you search around for answers as to what is tormenting you.
&gt;They rest, at long last, on your semi open closet door.
&gt;Did you leave it open? Or did Aisha?
&gt;Doesn’t matter now as a pair of blood red glowing eyes stare at you, with dozens of ghastly hands spewing forth from the closet opening.
&gt;All you can do is whimper softly, as you feel the hands pulling you towards the closet.
&gt;Your fearful whimpers cause a soft stirring 
&gt;How could you forget Aisha? Probably because the crushing weight from these hands made the weight from her head unnoticeable
&gt;&quot;A-anon?&quot; she whispers looking at you, her blue eyes glinting in the dark.
&gt;You can&#039;t answer, looking your eyes onto hers in a panic, trying to ignore the red eyes from the closet.
&gt;&quot;A-anon!? Are you ok?! She cries sitting up quickly, looking over your body for any physical issues.
&gt;You can&#039;t move, you can&#039;t answer, and all you can do is blink like an idiot.
&gt;It’s been a long time since you suffered from sleep paralysis.
&gt;Your body is still asleep but your mind isn’t.
&gt;Ok... Stay calm.
&gt;Blink at her, get her attention.
&gt;You blink your eyes furiously at her, until she looks at them.
&gt;&quot;Why are you?... Can&#039;t you...&quot; she murmurs with a slight frown.
&gt;Come on, you had talked to her about this before
&gt;&quot;That thing, night frozenness or something!&quot; she says in realization, looking into your eyes with unwavering determination.
&gt;Her muscular frame wraps around you, seeming to push aside the specters hands 
&gt;&quot;Uh... I got you love, it&#039;s ok, I got you&quot; she whispers, nuzzling your head into the crook of her neck
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s ok...it&#039;s ok&quot; she reassures you softly
&gt;You focus on her instead of the hundreds of shadow hands trying to get to you.
&gt;They all seem to be repelled by the soft caress of you love, which was a welcome surprise.
&gt;Closing your eyes and ignoring everything besides Aisha, you stay awake and unable to move.
&gt;Aisha&#039;s whispers turn to soft snores as she keeps you pressed to her.
&gt;You don&#039;t even realize you’ve fallen asleep, until you feel your eyes snap open to sunlight streaming through the window.
&gt;The smell off coffee and bacon fills the air as you wander out of the bedroom and find Aisha in the kitchen, wearing short shorts and an apron.
&gt;Her ears swivel towards you as you walk up behind her.
&gt;&quot;Hey love&quot; you say, wrapping your arms around her waist.
&gt;&quot;Hey baby, you ok?&quot; she says happily as she tends to the bacon.
&gt;&quot;Mhm, I love you&quot; you say pushing the side of your face into the soft fur of her back.
&gt;she gives a short snicker and Smiles happily.
&gt;&quot;Love you too&quot;</textarea>
