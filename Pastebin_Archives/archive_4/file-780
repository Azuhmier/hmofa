&gt;down the driveway, up the steps and had to brace herself to prevent slamming into the door, which she started happily bouncing in front of while she waited on you 2 to get there
&gt;the house was originally supposed to be a summer home for your friends well off parents but they lost interest in it and decided to rent it to you for cheap
