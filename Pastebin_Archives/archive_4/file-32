Catch yourself an Anon, of course.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Don’t take shortcuts through the nature reserve,” they said</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Don’t go anywhere near the reserve if you don’t have to,” they said</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Don’t get out of your vehicle for any reason if you decide to go INTO the reserve,” they said</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why the hell didn’t you listen?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s been a long drive and you just want to get back as soon as possible</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But it’s also getting late and really foggy out, and you need to stretch your legs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you disregarded all warnings and take a break outside the car</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now you’re thinking this place was some kind of stupid little urban legend, or reverse psychology to get all the superstitious tourists to visit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s actually very serene here, especially with the setting sun casting an orange glow everywhere</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You splash a little cool water from the creek on your face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not a sound for miles except the insects and wildlife</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And a soft popping noise</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And the yelp you make when you feel a sharp sting from something stuck into you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re almost afraid to pull it out, but the fear of leaving it in is worse</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pluck the object out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s a tiny dart with a syringe</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Completely empty</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Another one sticks you, and another</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try running back to your car, but the wooziness kicks in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You black out as you trip and bang your head against the car door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you come to, you’re floating in the air</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re draped over someone’s shoulder, and there’s a dog tail wagging in the corner of your eye</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait, the tail is attached to the person carrying you?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to get a better look around you, but your body is numb and unresponsive</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Just keep still, we’re almost there,” comes a feminine, but raspy voice</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s no mistaking it, you’re hanging off a walking, talking, female wolf of some sort</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can barely see the tranquilizer rifle bobbing on her opposite shoulder</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even for being a humanoid canine, she’s still wearing fatigues and hunting clothes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;True to her word, you arrive at a small shack just as the sun winks out completely</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The inside of the place looks like what you’d expect from someone roughing it in the woods</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It has a very earthly smell to it, but it’s also extremely cozy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So is the bed, which you’re dumped on top of unceremoniously</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get to see the wolfess in her entirety: slate fur with brown markings, amber eyes showing pride in her catch, and an overall athletic build (for a wolf, at least)</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sets her hunting gear aside and starts to disrobe you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can’t really protest, considering the threat of her sharp nails and the sedative still in your body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The latter is taken care of when you feel the pinch from a new kind of needle</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’ll let you finish the rest yourself,” she says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Guess she means your underwear, which is all you’re left with now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She heads into a small bathroom and you hear the pitter-patter of a shower starting</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your limbs get their feeling back, though you’re not exactly rushing to move around</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Come on, get up,” she grunts, pulling you up to your feet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A claw digs into your underwear and snaps your waistband</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You’re going to have to take this off eventually,” she says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, maybe a wolfess isn’t going to judge your nudity</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Though she does give you a quick brow-raise of interest before shoving you into the shower</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stand there very still for a moment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s not like showers are foreign to you, but taking one at the command of an anthropomorphic wolf?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You slowly rinse yourself, but the wolfess is getting impatient</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She growls as she checks the time on her…phone?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Shit. We’re running late, and I don’t have a lot of hot water to waste anyway. Move over.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In seconds the wolf peels off her own clothes, stark naked</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see the faint definition of muscle even through her coat of fur, with strong thighs and a broad torso</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s definitely respectable in the chest department, which you gaze at with undivided attention</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Two weighty breasts flop out of her shirt, the pink nipples partially hidden by her fur</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They hang enticingly as she bends forward to remove her pants</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her whipping tail soon draws your attention to her toned rump</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This, however, you don’t get to thoroughly examine, as she’s back upright and pushing you deeper into the shower</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The wolfess mutters to herself, but you can’t discern if it’s about you or not</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She soaps up her paws and works the lather into your scalp and over your body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A part of you enjoys the eroticism of the moment, but she’s so quick in her cleaning that you don’t get to take it in for very long</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She then covers a brush with the soap and thrusts it to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Do my back while I work the front.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tentatively scrub up and down her spine, hoping the speed and the reach is what she wants</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It could be better</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She barks “harder” and “lower” to you repeatedly, until you worry you’re going to wear the bristles down to nothing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When she’s satisfied the brush is yanked from your grip and tossed aside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re towel dried with enough friction to start a fire</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She wrings the moisture out and snaps the towel at you like some kind of locker-room horseplay</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;…Are there anthro horses here, too?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re left with a pretty snazzy suit and tie laid out back in the living room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At this point you know enough about what’s going on (and don’t want to be disobedient) to hastily get dressed without her instruction</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s still in the bathroom with a hair dryer on at full blast</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see her fur floof up as she blows air all over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have a little trouble with the suit, to put it lightly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It seems like it wasn’t originally meant for a human and had to be retrofitted for your kind of body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Clasps and buttons where you wouldn’t expect, and some seams that actually dig into your skin a bit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you can finish the wolfess is already fully clothed in an elegant, silky dress with a floral hairclip</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She fixes your awkward mistakes and straightens your tie a bit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Alright, we need to move.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She forces you out the door, grabbing an uncharacteristically dainty purse</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Further contrasting her polished appearance is a battered, muddy jeep parked just outside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re hoisted into it before the wolfess hops to the driver’s side</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She guns it through the forest along a weathered dirt path, almost hurling you out of the vehicle in the process as you bounce over rough terrain and the occasional buried log</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see the light of a large building among the darkness of the night</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It looks to be some kind of convention center or main office building for the reservation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She slides among other parked vehicles of very familiar human models, and you’re swiftly pulled out of the jeep </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Remember, if anyone asks, your name is ‘Anon’, got it?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div

        <textarea class="textarea">Last-Minute Courting [Wolf; Dressing and Undressing, Contrived Excuse for Deep Kissing]: What do you do when you&#039;re late for a party and don&#039;t have anyone to go with? Catch yourself an Anon, of course.

&gt;”Don’t take shortcuts through the nature reserve,” they said
&gt;”Don’t go anywhere near the reserve if you don’t have to,” they said
&gt;”Don’t get out of your vehicle for any reason if you decide to go INTO the reserve,” they said
&gt;Why the hell didn’t you listen?
&gt;It’s been a long drive and you just want to get back as soon as possible
&gt;But it’s also getting late and really foggy out, and you need to stretch your legs
&gt;So you disregarded all warnings and take a break outside the car
&gt;Now you’re thinking this place was some kind of stupid little urban legend, or reverse psychology to get all the superstitious tourists to visit
&gt;It’s actually very serene here, especially with the setting sun casting an orange glow everywhere
&gt;You splash a little cool water from the creek on your face
&gt;Not a sound for miles except the insects and wildlife
&gt;And a soft popping noise
&gt;And the yelp you make when you feel a sharp sting from something stuck into you
&gt;You’re almost afraid to pull it out, but the fear of leaving it in is worse
&gt;You pluck the object out
&gt;It’s a tiny dart with a syringe
&gt;Completely empty
&gt;Another one sticks you, and another
&gt;You try running back to your car, but the wooziness kicks in
&gt;You black out as you trip and bang your head against the car door

&gt;When you come to, you’re floating in the air
&gt;You’re draped over someone’s shoulder, and there’s a dog tail wagging in the corner of your eye
&gt;Wait, the tail is attached to the person carrying you?
&gt;You try to get a better look around you, but your body is numb and unresponsive
&gt;”Just keep still, we’re almost there,” comes a feminine, but raspy voice
&gt;There’s no mistaking it, you’re hanging off a walking, talking, female wolf of some sort
&gt;You can barely see the tranquilizer rifle bobbing on her opposite shoulder
&gt;Even for being a humanoid canine, she’s still wearing fatigues and hunting clothes
&gt;True to her word, you arrive at a small shack just as the sun winks out completely
&gt;The inside of the place looks like what you’d expect from someone roughing it in the woods
&gt;It has a very earthly smell to it, but it’s also extremely cozy
&gt;So is the bed, which you’re dumped on top of unceremoniously
&gt;You get to see the wolfess in her entirety: slate fur with brown markings, amber eyes showing pride in her catch, and an overall athletic build (for a wolf, at least)
&gt;She sets her hunting gear aside and starts to disrobe you
&gt;You can’t really protest, considering the threat of her sharp nails and the sedative still in your body
&gt;The latter is taken care of when you feel the pinch from a new kind of needle
&gt;”I’ll let you finish the rest yourself,” she says
&gt;Guess she means your underwear, which is all you’re left with now
&gt;She heads into a small bathroom and you hear the pitter-patter of a shower starting
&gt;Your limbs get their feeling back, though you’re not exactly rushing to move around
&gt;”Come on, get up,” she grunts, pulling you up to your feet
&gt;A claw digs into your underwear and snaps your waistband
&gt;”You’re going to have to take this off eventually,” she says
&gt;Well, maybe a wolfess isn’t going to judge your nudity
&gt;Though she does give you a quick brow-raise of interest before shoving you into the shower
&gt;You stand there very still for a moment
&gt;It’s not like showers are foreign to you, but taking one at the command of an anthropomorphic wolf?
&gt;You slowly rinse yourself, but the wolfess is getting impatient
&gt;She growls as she checks the time on her…phone?
&gt;”Shit. We’re running late, and I don’t have a lot of hot water to waste anyway. Move over.”
&gt;In seconds the wolf peels off her own clothes, stark naked
&gt;You can see the faint definition of muscle even through her coat of fur, with strong thighs and a broad torso
&gt;She’s definitely respectable in the chest department, which you gaze at with undivided attention
&gt;Two weighty breasts flop out of her shirt, the pink nipples partially hidden by her fur
&gt;They hang enticingly as she bends forward to remove her pants
&gt;Her whipping tail soon draws your attention to her toned rump
&gt;This, however, you don’t get to thoroughly examine, as she’s back upright and pushing you deeper into the shower
&gt;The wolfess mutters to herself, but you can’t discern if it’s about you or not
&gt;She soaps up her paws and works the lather into your scalp and over your body
&gt;A part of you enjoys the eroticism of the moment, but she’s so quick in her cleaning that you don’t get to take it in for very long
&gt;She then covers a brush with the soap and thrusts it to you
&gt;”Do my back while I work the front.”
&gt;You tentatively scrub up and down her spine, hoping the speed and the reach is what she wants
&gt;It could be better
&gt;She barks “harder” and “lower” to you repeatedly, until you worry you’re going to wear the bristles down to nothing
&gt;When she’s satisfied the brush is yanked from your grip and tossed aside
&gt;You’re towel dried with enough friction to start a fire
&gt;She wrings the moisture out and snaps the towel at you like some kind of locker-room horseplay
&gt;…Are there anthro horses here, too?
&gt;You’re left with a pretty snazzy suit and tie laid out back in the living room
&gt;At this point you know enough about what’s going on (and don’t want to be disobedient) to hastily get dressed without her instruction
&gt;She’s still in the bathroom with a hair dryer on at full blast
&gt;You can see her fur floof up as she blows air all over
&gt;You have a little trouble with the suit, to put it lightly
&gt;It seems like it wasn’t originally meant for a human and had to be retrofitted for your kind of body
&gt;Clasps and buttons where you wouldn’t expect, and some seams that actually dig into your skin a bit
&gt;Before you can finish the wolfess is already fully clothed in an elegant, silky dress with a floral hairclip
&gt;She fixes your awkward mistakes and straightens your tie a bit
&gt;”Alright, we need to move.”
&gt;She forces you out the door, grabbing an uncharacteristically dainty purse
&gt;Further contrasting her polished appearance is a battered, muddy jeep parked just outside
&gt;You’re hoisted into it before the wolfess hops to the driver’s side
&gt;She guns it through the forest along a weathered dirt path, almost hurling you out of the vehicle in the process as you bounce over rough terrain and the occasional buried log
&gt;You can see the light of a large building among the darkness of the night
&gt;It looks to be some kind of convention center or main office building for the reservation
&gt;She slides among other parked vehicles of very familiar human models, and you’re swiftly pulled out of the jeep 
&gt;”Remember, if anyone asks, your name is ‘Anon’, got it?”

&gt;Everything in the last half hour or so blurred by so fast you hardly had time to take in the full weight of the situation
&gt;Now that you have a chance to catch your breath, you’re hit with a truckload of confusion and disbelief
&gt;Anthros of all species are milling about in the main gathering hall
&gt;Bears, mice, cats, birds…
&gt;Yes, even horses
&gt;They’re all doing things humans would do at parties: eat, drink, and socialize
&gt;There’s a banner hanging from the ceiling advertising some sort of “Annual something Reservation something something Gala”
&gt;Or something
&gt;”Nimet, darling? What do we have tonight?”
&gt;A graceful, aged doe struts up to you and the wolfess
&gt;Nimet, huh?
&gt;”This is Anon,” she says, “the one I’ve told you about? Remember?”
&gt;”Charmed,” the doe says with a curt nod. “I didn’t think your stories of him were real, and you failed to specify exactly what he was. What is a human doing in our reservation?”
&gt;”Enjoying the party, I would think,” Nimet scoffs. “Remember when you said the only way I’d get a date is if I ‘hunted and tagged’ one? Well, Anon’s here to make you not a liar.”
&gt;You and the doe have a battle of who can make the more shocked expression
&gt;The doe seems to be winning, as she struggles to find a good counter
&gt;”I see. WELL, then I suppose given your usually boisterous attitude, you’re telling the truth when you admit to having ‘hunted’ this gentleman, hmm?”
&gt;”I thought you stuck-ups knew sarcasm,” Nimet snaps back. “Anon and I have actually been together for a while now, and we’re quite happy, thank you very much.”
&gt;”O-oh?”
&gt;The doe is taken aback by the verbal assault, but she tries to call the wolfess on her bluff
&gt;”Then I suppose Anon would be happy to validate your claims?” the doe says, giving you a sly grin
&gt;”I’ll do you one better,” the wolfess responds
&gt;She turns to you and plants her muzzle on your lips, caressing your head with her large paws
&gt;There isn’t much you can do to break away, especially with her tongue darting into your mouth
&gt;After you overcome to suddenness of the action, you actually begin to enjoy it
&gt;You return Nimet’s caressing and try to match the intensity of her kiss
&gt;She hasn’t given you control for one second since you met her, but right now you’re more than happy to relinquish yourself for as long as she wants
&gt;When she finally pulls off you, a thin strand of saliva still connect the two of you
&gt;The wolfess pulls a handkerchief out with an exaggerated flourish and dabs her mouth
&gt;”Happy now?” she says to the doe flatly
 &gt;The doe stammers for a bit, then clears her throat
&gt;”Enjoy the party, you two” she manages to get out before briskly walking off
&gt;Several onlookers are both impressed and jealous of what they just saw

&gt;Nimet manages to keep you from dealing with too many nosy guests for the next hour
&gt;Humans seem to be an oddity of their own around here
&gt;You wonder whether the warnings of the reservation were to keep the anthros safe from the humans, or the other way around
&gt;How many others have gotten abducted from their vehicles and dressed up for dates?
&gt;Nimet herself doesn’t seem to be socializing much, instead keeping you close by as though you are her trophy date
&gt;She’s so stoic and distant you start to think maybe you did something to upset her
&gt;Not that you’ve really had much liberty to make your own choices
&gt;The wolfess remains this way for a while, until she pulls you off to the side in an adjacent dining room
&gt;”Look, I…want to thank you for going along with this. You were a good sport this whole time; probably too much for your own good, honestly.”
&gt;She runs a claw along your suit, gently
&gt;”When the night’s over, I can take you back to your car if…that’s what you want.”
&gt;You lean in continue your kiss
&gt;This time, it’s slower and more reserved
&gt;But perhaps even more passionate that the first
&gt;You look into her amber eyes when you’re finished, and her lips pull back into a genuinely caring smile
&gt;”Well, we should probably back up a bit first. I didn’t even let you get a chance to tell me your real name….”</textarea>
