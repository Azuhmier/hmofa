No more un-planned photographic adventures to bumfuck-nowhere</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Secretly you hope you’ll be back in bed at home, but the shameful hope that this is all a really mundane dream only makes you feel less like a 22-year-old and more like a scared little kid</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You really don’t want to open your eyes. The comforting bliss of darkness is all that’s keeping you from cry-ing like a kid</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, here goes nothing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;On 3, okay?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;1</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;2</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Can I get you some coffee, or a pillow?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your eyelids peel open</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A waitress, a real fucking movie-ass waitress in a blue uniform with a notepad and all is looking impatiently down at you, her canine eyes half-open</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s an older looking Coyote, a little bored, wearing a purple bowtie in her rust-colored fur, like a super-model who had just cat-walked out of Wal-Mart</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You blink a few times</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thought that waitresses only looked like this in movies?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”So, should I come back or…?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“No, no, I think I’m ready to order something to drink,” you stammer, snapping back to reality. “Can I uhhh… have some coffee?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She feigns delight. “Sure can. Cream, sugar?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shake your head and smile nervously</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Just black is fine.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She raises a questioning stare at you, as if to ask if you can ‘actually handle black coffee’</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a few seconds, she swivels on her heels and sashays towards the kitchen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can’t help but watch her go, her tail swishing fluidly over her nicely padded butt, made all the more captivating by her hour-glass frame</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s kind of sexy, in like, a really trashy, milfy kind of way</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re not that kind of photographer, but if she offered, you’d have a hard time saying no</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ah, speaking of</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You haul your camera out onto the table, hoping to at least take some artsy shots of the diner. It’d suck to come all this way and have nothing to show for it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your camera is a cheap one (by camera standards at least), and because you’re fairly stingy, you still only have the kit lens for it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Which, on reflection, was probably a bad idea, because you have no idea what conditions you want to shoot in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Okay, take a few shots, check the bus schedule on your (almost) dead phone, and head home</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pop your head out over the booth to get a look around for a good subject</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your gaze flicks around the cleanly-lit diner, scanning for someone...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you come up empty</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wow, you’re really the only person here right now. That’s an odd feeling</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You a reporter?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The waitress asks in a flat tone as she glares down at you, mug of coffee in hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Startled, you shake your head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“No, no. Just a college student out on a road trip, trying to see what I can see, you know?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She says nothing and continues to cast silent judgement down on you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Without a dissatisfied grunt, she sets the coffee down and walks back towards the kitchen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wonder what that was about? She seemed awfully pissed off about the camera thing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quietly take a sip of coffee, but nearly spray it across the table when the painfully sweet taste of way too much cream and sugar passes your lips</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She put so much in this mug that it’s practically white</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re beginning to get the feeling that she doesn’t like you a whole lot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You snap a quick photo of her sweet, sweet backside as she saunters back over to the kitchen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The viewfinder renders in glorious HD the pear-shape of her body, dress tight against her frumpy butt, the rust-colored tail protruding just above the slope of her ass</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It feels like you got some semblance of justice, and you still try drinking the shitty cream coffee just because you paid for it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fuck you, you sexy milfy coyote lady. Fuck you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After that you spend some time flicking through your photos</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bored with that, You start taking shots of everything, from artful compositions of the booth you’re in, to shitty blog shots of the “coffee” sitting half-consumed on your table</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re so busy spitefully and boldly taking photos of everything, you don’t notice how much time slips away from you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or that you’re no longer alone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You a reporter from the city?” A voice from behind you causes you to nearly drop your camera (good thing you were wearing the neck strap)</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A blue heeler is peeking over the top of the booth behind you, his light blue eyes curiously watching as you find the words to answer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have none, but that’s okay, this kid is leading the conversation like a child steering a racecar</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Can I see your camera?” He asks, extending a thin arm over the booth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well gee, that’s really fucking forward</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Ummmm, no...” you offer in return. “I’m just taking some photos of some stuff before I head back home.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Oh, where you from?” His eyes light up, and a friendly smile widens across his face. “You from the city or something? You out here to write a story about meth?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What the hell is up with this kid?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell him that you’re just a college student from the city, out on a photo project</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you leave out the part about getting cold feet and wanting to go home</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you’re finished with the explanation, the kid, who tells you his name is Jesse, practically leaps into the chair opposite of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He’s… Well, a little too friendly, and it makes you uncomfortable</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He might be trying to rob you, or he might be retarded</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Heelers: friendly, intelligent, high energy, usually find good work out in agriculture due to their heritage and breeding standards</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This guy must not have gotten the intelligence genes his breed is known for</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He’s wearing a heavy flannel buttoned all the way up, some loose and dirty jeans, a pair of work shoes, and he smells like he’s been rolling around the fields for a few days</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He leans eagerly across the table, extending the length of his thin body in order to peek at what you’re do-ing, and if it weren’t for the table separating you two, you’re sure he’d be touching you by now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re assaulted by his seemingly innocuous questions of ‘what’s this, how’s that work, you ever taken photos for magazines before?’ And you do your best to answer all of them, leaving you practically out of breath by the time the waitress comes back over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This guy is really reminding you of the fact that you’re an introvert</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The waitress returns, bearing an appraising scowl, especially when she finds you’ve suddenly gained a meal partner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Jesse, you bothering my customers again?” She asks with a cold tone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Heeler cocks his head, seemingly confused by the question</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Naw Lee Anne, my friend here...” he looks at you, suddenly remembering he forgot to ask you your name</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Anon,” you answer, with a tone that says ‘I want to die’</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse completely ignores your verbalized plea for death</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yep, definitely retarded</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”My friend Anon and I were just catching up over dinner.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait, hold the fuck up, you didn’t say anything about dinner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lee Anne shakes her head with disapproval</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Not if you ain’t got money this time.

So can I have a cup of coffee, some eggs n some bacon please? And uhhh, get my buddy Anon here a fresh cup of coffee, he looks like he mighta’ put too much cream into his. Clumsy hands.

Ain’t you just so generous?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can’t be sure, but you can almost sense some heavily veiled sarcasm from your waitress</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;God you want to fucking die right now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lee Anne sighs before sauntering off, muttering something about ‘Making friends with humans is gonna get you shot round’ here hun.’</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The bell above the door chimes, but you pay it no attention</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s going to take all of your focus to get through this uncomfortable encounter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As Lee Anne takes her sweet time in putting the order in, Jesse turns back to you and grins, obviously very pleased with the way this whole evening is shaping up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re not grinning, you’re between strangling him and crying from the awkwardness</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But who should you be mad at?

The point is you don’t do that shit to people, especially if you don’t even know them!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse still looks confused as the words leave your mouth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Aren’t Heelers supposed to be an intelligent breed?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The words finally register, and he nods, already ready with an answer for you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Well, we got dinner to get to know each other, right? No big deal. Out here mammals is a lot friendlier than you think.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yes big deal,” you sigh. “You get your food and then I’m leaving, okay? I gotta catch a bus back home.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Heeler cocks his head, trying to process your statement</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Back home? The buses don’t run this time of night out here. You heading west?

He is a she? Is this crazy bitch about to assault you?

They look two sizes too big, and they’re fucking filthy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe she’s just really flat?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you could maybe start to see her naked underneath</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your mind starts to wander to what this anthro-dog would look like disrobed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hmmm, small pink nubs on her chest where her tits ought to be, boyish, almost stick-thin frame, bright pink slit between her legs-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shake the thoughts violently from your head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now is not the time to be fantasizing! This bumpkin might stab you! Or claw your face off! Or worse,</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your dick!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Shit, no, I didn’t mean...” your voice drops to a whisper, “fucking, like...actual sex… It’s just an expression that we use at school.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her shoulders drop, and she cocks her head a little</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Wait, you just say that stuff to random people?” She questions, scratching a spot behind her ears. “That’s the most retarded thing I ever heard, and I can’t even go to college.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I guess it is,” you reply sheepishly. Now it was your turn to start blushing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She suppresses a laugh behind her palm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yep, definitely a girl</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Besides, if anyone out here found out I was shacking up with a human, they’d drag us both down to the creek and shoot us like frogs without a second thought.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shoot us like frogs!?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">”Are you fucking me?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Didn’t we just go over this? No, I’m not fucking you!” Her voice echoes in the empty diner, barely compet-ing with the shitty drone of the radio</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“No, no, that’s not what I meant!” You slap your head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You want to find the people who wrote your ‘Human-Anthro Relations&#039; textbook and strangle them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They were dead wrong about heelers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“What I mean is: are things that… bad out here? Like, humans and anthros still can’t associate?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nodding, She takes another sip of your ‘coffee’</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I suppose so. It depends on where you are and what kinda skin you’re wearing. There’s towns out here where I wouldn’t dare visit, and there’s towns where you wouldn’t visit had you known’ little better. And then there’s places like Meeker, that are just… in between. This here is one of those towns where you’re probably better off not visiting, if I do say so myself.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“What do you mean by ‘in between?’”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse nods and tilts your ‘coffee’ mug towards you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You think that Lee Anne accidentally put too much cream in your coffee? Naw, she did that on purpose, and she’d probably do much worse if she didn’t think you had money.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Which reminds you: You really don’t have any money</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You open your mouth to tell her that you probably won’t be able to afford a bus ticket AND her meal, but she’s not listening</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She rests her chin on her palm and stares off into the empty diner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Things aren’t like your fancy college out here. People aren’t as kind, and nobody’s tip-toeing around no-body. Kindness is as rare as the rain these days. It’s easy to get lonely out here. Been dreamin’ of leavin’, but I know I’d never make it outside of this lil’ shitheap.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look around the diner, half expecting a pack of feral anthros to bust through the door and beat the piss out of you for not having fur</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Christ, what kind of mess did you get yourself into? This isn’t exactly Deliverance shit, but you’re starting to feel like you’re way out of your element</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lean across the table, as close as you can get to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Psst, is it true about the busses this time of night?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods slowly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Yeah, you’re stuck here until at least tomorrow, and it feels like it’s getting late,” she remarks, picking up your ‘coffee’ again and downing the last of it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You silently cringe as you watch it go down her gullet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Good god that must have be like drinking pure syrup</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Hope that food gets here soon, could use a good bite to eat,” she says as she digs her tongue into what’s left of the mug</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”And some coffee. I need a pick-me-up.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As if on cue, your favorite trailer slut waitress appears, a plate of food and two mugs of coffee at the ready</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse hardly waits until Lee Anne is done setting the food down before practically stuffing her face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Christ hun, at least let me put the plate down first,” Lee Anne groans. “When’s the last time you ate?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse looks up towards Lee Anne, her cheeks bulging, egg yolk running down her chin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She swallows hard (nice) and holds up two fingers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lee Anne’s face twists up with disgust</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Ain’t your tweaker momma feeding you? Or she spending all that government cheese on more crank?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse stops her ravenous assault on the plate and stares down at the table</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oooh boy this is getting awkward</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You want to say something, but you’re not sure what you could say in this instance</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A look of confusion and hurt plays out across her usually cheerful and excitable face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Heeler says nothing, just stares down at the table</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lee Anne clears her throat, and you open your mouth to call her a fucking bitch, but she’s too quick, and you’re too beta</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Well, if you ever need anything else to eat, try to bring another human by, maybe he’ll cover your meal too,” She smirks at you and hands you the check. ”Here Mr. Moneybags, bring that up when you’re ready or when she’s taken you for another ride.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And with that crushing performance, the coyote spins on her heels and saunters off, a very proud and caus-tic grin spreading across her rust colored fur</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t know what to say, or what you could say</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse just sits there, looking hurt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sit there in stunned silence, feeling conflicted</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;On one hand, that felt completely uncalled for on Lee Anne’s part, and on the other hand, you wonder if you’ve just been taken for a ride, as if this is something Jesse does all the time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You check the bill</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;$24, so basically you can’t afford to get back home if you pay this</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fucking hell</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your start to say something, but Jesse grabs you by the hand and drags you out of the diner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to say something when she drags you round back to where the dumpsters are, but as you open your mouth she clumsily shoves her tongue in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For a solid 15 seconds there’s this confusing silence where you, profoundly awkward, and her, profoundly inexperienced, tongue wrestle</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It feels like you’re having a breathing contest, seeing who can go the longest without opening their eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t know where to put your hands either, and neither does she, so you two basically just stand there like weird statues, trying to imitate what you think making out is supposed to be like</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Do you…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Do you grab her butt or something? How does this work?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re about to make a move, but she pulls away quickly, leaving you breathless</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She quickly wipes a trail of spit from her lips, her face bright red with heat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She clenches her eyes shut, sending tears rolling down her cheeks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”T-That’s for dinner, and… and whatever else you want, because I owe you, and…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s trembling, and you’re not sure if it’s from embarrassment, sadness, or adrenaline considering she just forced herself on you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe it’s all three?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”And I- I ain’t some kind of whore or anything, but I o-owe you for dinner tonight, and for being so k-kind...”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can tell that she’s trying very hard to hold back tears, given that she pretty much won’t look you in the eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”We can go back to my place, or… wherever… My mom won’t care nothing, or about who I bring home,” she says, trying to wear a brave smile. “Besides, I swear I ain’t using you. I ain’t that type’a gal.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Another moment of indecision</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You realistically could say yes, because you haven’t gotten laid in like two years, and the last time was an awkward drunken hookup at a party you didn’t want to be at</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And she tasted like vomit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But this feels almost wrong</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And her on the verge of crying doesn’t help</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’ve never been great with women, so you just blurt the first thing that comes to mind</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I want to go home.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She ends up fully sobbing, and whispers something about how she wants to go home too, but you’re too paralyzed with the feels to actually say something comforting</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Does ‘there there’ even comfort anyone?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you can actually do or say anything, she gently presses her head into your chest and grabs you by your shirt collar</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For the first time in what you imagine is a few years, you imagine, she allows herself to sob</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You go for a hug, but settle for a hover hand</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesus fuck why are you like this?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’m sorry,” she chokes out, unaware of your awkward attempt at comforting her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’m sorry for kissing you, and for using you, and for...”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This time you actually just hug her, because you honestly can’t stand to hear her like this anymore</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can feel a metaphorical pair of testicles drop into your literal sack</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She hushes up, and you let her sob silently into your ratty old college shirt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few minutes pass, and when she’s finally done, she blows her nose on the collar of her old shirt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ew</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She buttons up her crusty denim jacket and steps back, trying not to look you in the eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”S-Sorry bout that,” she stammers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her it’s okay. Not the first time an anthro dog has cried into your shirt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Wait, are you kidding?” She slaps her head in disbelief. “In all the hurry I forgot to ask if you even had a girl-friend.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Or a boyfriend?” She says cautiously, “I don’t judge much. If you can’t tell, I’m not really in a position to be judging others.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“No, no,” you smile and shake your head. “I’m single as hell, and probably will be for the rest of my days.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You ‘n me both, Anon. You ‘n me both,” she sighs, rubbing her palm on the back of her neck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can still feel the tension of what just happened between you two, but it feels somewhat dissipated by now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The moon is already well into the night sky, and with the crickets chirping a summer symphony, you decide that it’s at least 8 or 9 p.m.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse notices too, and stifles a yawn</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Normally I don’t do this, but since I made you miss your bus home, would you like to stay the night with me?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Come home? With her?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Stay the night at a strange anthro woman’s ‘home’?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What could go wrong</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No, fuck this, you’re going to see if you can sleep in the diner and wait for the next bus</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You open your mouth to issue your declaration of independence, but the roar of an engine clips your speech</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A pair of headlights open up on you, outlining your shapes in gold</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Pressed against the dumpster, Jesse blocking the source of the light with her back, you can only see two thin shadows piling out of a shitbeater truck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Digitride feet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Heaving tails</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Broad

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse gasps, squeals, and then tumbles forward, crashing into you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You manage to catch her in your arms</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Holy shit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”The bitch blocked my shot!” A deep voice groans</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Best body armor he’s ever had,” another voice adds with a hateful chuckle</div></li><li class="li1"><div

this can’t be real</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;How does someone die so quickly and so senselessly?</div></li><li class="li1"><div

crop of acne</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Smelled your scent from a mile away, pinkie.” He narrows a scowl at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He’s got a heavy wrench dangling from his right arm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A similarly young crocodile trundles into the light, cradling a double barrel shotgun</div></li><li class="li1"><div

Now you got FOUR FUCKING SECONDS to drop the heeler and take it like a man.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A shotgun blast to the head is peaceful in its own way, you guess</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s one millisecond of agony, and then darkness</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not so bad, right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel your grip on Jesse loosening</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you’re about to drop her weight, when you hear her say, weakly, with a throat full of blood:</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Go.

the side</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The shotgun barks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The brickwork of the diner explodes above you, riddled with

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You set your sights on hiding in the tall cornfields, just a few feet from the diner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A quick check over your shoulders

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You fumble for your camera again when you see the wrench-wielding coyote bounding towards you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He leaps into the air

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He lands on your chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And brings the wrench down on skull, shattering bone and-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Can I get you some coffee, or a pillow?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your eyelids peel open</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A waitress, a real fucking movie-ass waitress in a blue uniform with a notepad and all is looking impatiently down at you, her canine eyes half-open</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s an older looking Coyote, a little bored, wearing a purple bowtie in her rust-colored fur, like a super-model who had just cat-walked out of Wal-Mart</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You blink a few times</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thought that waitresses only looked like this in movies?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”So, should I come back or…?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What the fuck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You a reporter?” She asks, eyes narrowing. “Because we don’t have need of a reporter in our town.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Seconds ago you were getting your brain evicted from your skull outside the diner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And now you’re here, back in the diner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And it’s day time now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But how</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Was it all a dream?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s starting to fade in your grainy imagination, wiping back to a clean slate, a constant running theater of incessant bullshit and noise</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That memory — that dream — is drowning in the sudden sensory overload of this diner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The chimey radio</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The smell of coffee and the acrid stench of stale cigarettes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The coyote waitress who clearly wants nothing to do with you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The feeling that you’re being watched and appraised</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Think, you motherfucker!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Grab hold of a memory like a comet’s tail and hold on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’d have an easier time holding smoke</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can only remember a few things: This girl named Jesse, and these two carnivores, and she…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look up with a blank stare, mouth working but no sound coming out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Alright, I’ll just bring some coffee back.” The waitress spins on her heels and starts walking back towards the kitchen, every footstep like glass shattering against the (relative) quiet of the diner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;SHIT</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lost it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were so close to retrieving that memory-dream-thing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, whatever. It was probably just a dream, anyway</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You remember once when you woke up from a nightmare where you swallowed your tongue</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The first thing you did was jam your hand in your mouth and try to keep it from slipping down your throat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Of course, you ignored your very obvious REAL tongue, at the time, fat and in the way</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This was life or death</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The point is: these types of dreams happen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They can feel real, but… they just aren’t</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is one of those dreams</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull out your camera and start poking through the pictures, none of them catch your interest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mostly just shots of campus, some pictures you took from the bus window</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just gotta occupy yourself until the waitress comes back, because when she parks her plump, anthro butt right in front of you, you’re going to order some food</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You need some right about now with how heavy your body feels</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And when she leaves, you’re going to take a picture of her FAT ass</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What? Nobody ever said you had good taste</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Creepy, too, but you consider it revenge for her acting like a bitch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As if on cue, the waitress reappears with a steaming ceramic mug of coffee and a lording, venomous smile</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Here ya’ go, hun. This’ll wake you right up.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When she sets the coffee down your enthusiasm deflates</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s loaded with so much cream and sugar that it’s practically white</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She slaps her hands on her hips</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Anything else I can get you, Mr. news man?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With the way she cocks her head, you’re certain that there’s more than just cream and sugar in this coffee</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You paint on a wide smile and thank her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“No, I think I’m okay.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Good!” She brightens her tone to a high shine. “I’ll be back in a bit to grab your order.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Great, thanks.” You sink in your chair</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You flick through your camera’s LCD screen and ready a shot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And then you pause on something</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The waitress is on the screen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You blush</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well it’s not specifically her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s a shot of her sauntering away from your table, her fat ass on full-display</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But the thing is</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You just met the waitress</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t remember taking this shot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Is it cliché to say that ‘ideas start as small seeds buried in the mind’?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The bell over the door chimes a happy little sound, like the tiniest of hammers banging on a silver sheet of metal</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear the waitress brighten her tone again. “Hey you two, need a table?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You poke your head above the dividers between tables</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A crocodile and coyote — both of them juvenile and covered in dirt/dust — saunter through the door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The coyote locks eyes with you for a steady second</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It makes you feel uncomfortable, but you can’t place why</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still, you drop your body into your seat, camera strapped around your neck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to ignore the collision of neurons in your brain</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You a reporter from the city?” A voice from behind you causes you to nearly drop your camera (good thing you were wearing the neck strap)</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A Blue Heeler is peeking over the top of the booth behind you, her (and she is most definitely a woman, not a man) light blue eyes curiously watching as you find the words to answer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have none, but that’s okay, this kid is leading the conversation like a child steering a race car</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Can I see your camera?” She asks, extending a thin arm over the booth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well gee, that’s really fucking forward</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Ummmm, no...” you offer in return. “I’m just taking some photos of some stuff before I head back home.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Oh, where you from?” Her eyes light up, and a friendly smile widens across her face. “You from the city or something? You out here to write a story about the meth?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What the hell is up with this kid?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you’re just a college student from the city, out on a solo photo project</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you leave out the part about getting cold feet and wanting to go home, because that’s not intrepid</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you’re finished with the explanation, the kid, who tells you her name is Jesse, practically leaps into the chair opposite of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You introduce yourself as Anon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s… Well, a little too friendly, and it makes you uncomfortable</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She might be trying to rob you, or she might be retarded</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Heelers: friendly, intelligent, high energy, usually find good work out in agriculture due to their heritage and breeding standards</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She must not have gotten the intelligence genes the breed is known for</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s wearing a heavy flannel buttoned all the way up, some loose and dirty jeans, a pair of work shoes, and she smells like he’s been rolling around the fields for a few days, so she definitely is doing some kind of manual labor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She leans eagerly across the table, extending the length of her thin body in order to peek at what you’re doing, and if it weren’t for the table separating you two, you’re sure she’d be touching you by now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re assaulted by her seemingly innocuous questions of ‘what’s this, how’s that work, you ever taken photos for magazines before?’ And you do your best to answer all of them, leaving you practically out of breath by the time she finishes up grilling you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This girl is really reminding you of the fact that you’re an introvert</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You know, I really want to go visit the city someday. Maybe I’ll visit your school,” she says, kind of absentmindedly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I need to put some miles between me and this shitty little town, and I always wanted to be on a college campus.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I’m sure you do. People here are kind of… rude?” You probe</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Only just to outsiders, humans especially,” Jesse says. She looks around briefly for theatrical effect, and then leans in close, narrowing her shoulders</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You picked the wrong town to stop off in,” she says in a whisper. “I’m tellin’ you this cause you seem like alright guy. You need to leave here as soon as possible.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“What are you talking about?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And right at that perfect moment, that croc and coyote wander up to the table</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Jesse.” The crocodile’s voice is heavy with abuse. “You making new friends?” He raises an eyebrow. “Human friends?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The coyote eyes you up and down, his cold, appraising eyes causes the hair on the back of your neck to stand up. “What’s with the camera? He a reporter?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”No, he ain’t a reporter. He’s just a-“ she turns to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel her kick you underneath the table</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her powerful boots collide off your shin bone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nearly yelp</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”What’re you here for again?” She says with a modicum of urgency</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You start to speak, but the look that Jesse gives you tells you that you need to choose your next words care-fully</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I’m a college student. From Fairmount?” You toss out your college like bait, hoping one of them will bite and this conversation will turn to pleasant, intellectual things</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Which is obviously never going to happen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why do they seem so familiar though?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Something about them makes your heart start to race</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You desperately want to leave the diner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But why?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fragments of that dream start to come back to you, but the tense silence is cut by the crocodile</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Sure you are, friend. We get lots of ‘college students’ out here in the sticks,” he says, leaning in close</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s something strange about both of their eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Their dark pupils are outlined in blood</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They look like they’ve been awake for days</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The coyote’s rust-colored fur is completely tossed and unkempt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s even white powder sticking to it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The croc on the other hand has a white foam accumulating around his jaws, a sign of exhaustion in reptiles</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They make even Jesse seem clean by comparison</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At least her salt-and-pepper fur is brushed and her coat is shiny</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The pair don’t seem to care much about you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Instead they focus their attention all on Jesse</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Looking for another handout, Jesse?” The coyote says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The heeler shakes her head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Nope, just making friends with someone. Says he’s skipping out tonight, so I figured I’d get to know our guest over a cup of coffee.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She kicks you again under the table</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You notice that her ears are plastered against her skull</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Says he’s skipping out tonight. Ain’t that right?” She repeats in no uncertain words</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod for all you’re worth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Good work, that might have been the least natural thing you’ve ever done</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No way they believed that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The crocodile gives you a devil’s grin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”We’ll be seeing you,” he says, before pacing off. “Have a safe trip home.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The coyote lags behind</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Jesse,” he says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The heeler paints on a winning smile and even goes as far as tipping her head. ”Can I help you hun?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Come see us later tonight.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The smile never leaves her face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Can I come see you some other time? How about tomorrow morning? Over bacon?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Tonight.” The coyote says, his voice firm, leaving no room for further bargaining</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For a pup he sure puts on quite a show</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He joins his partner on the other end of the diner, tail swishing aggressively behind him</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You switch focus to your camera</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s a total crapshoot, but you think you remember why these guys creep you out so much</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You flick through photos</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse scoots to your side of the booth, unconsciously crowding you into the corner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her thin, rounded shoulder bumps into yours, and you can feel the heat her tight body is throwing off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s… a lot </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She must sweat a ton</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or she’s really nervous</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You sure take a lot of pictures,” she remarks, clearly no longer worried about the two anthros who are just tucking in to their dinners. ”You should take one of me, I ain’t never had a proper picture taken of me.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Shhhh, I’m looking for a specific on-“</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And there it is</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The last one in the camera roll</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A night shot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;An anthro crocodile one-handing a shotgun</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A ratty looking coyote with a wrench, trying to block the camera’s flash from his sensitive eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Their pickup truck in the background</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And at the bottom of the picture?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse’s body in a blood heap</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, we are floating in

I know my way ‘round.

Ya know,” she says with a slight pause, “my house is just a few more miles down the road-“</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“MILES?” You say, though you’re too winded to make more than a gasping sound</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”What’s wrong?” Need a drink? Some food?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe you do. The last thing you had to drink was that shitty coffee. You’re running on empty</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The heeler pauses, narrows her eyes, and glances around</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I think I know where we are,” she says, surveying the cornfield. “’Least, I think so.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Oh, well that’s reassuring.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Don’t you get all dispargin’ on me now, we got plenty of road to go. But you’re right — I’m starting to get some cotton mouth myself. And if I’m correct, there should be a water spigot ‘round here.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;How in the hell can she tell? It’s corn as far as you can see</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I think it’s… right over here.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She weaves her fingers into yours, and before you even have a chance to protest, you’re practically slung through the field</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s a good few paces ahead of you, dragging you behind her like a child drags a toy behind her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Hey, hold on for a fucking second!” You protest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her laughter booms throughout the cornfields. A handful of crows wing off into the sky</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Honestly, you have no fucking idea where you’re going. You can’t see anything ahead of you except her backside and… well… corn</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She must have not heard you, but you’re too tired to fight</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You let Jesse tug you through the veritable forest of corn, until you come to a clearing — a crop circle of some kind</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And at the center of it all is a small shed, which is buzzing with noise — probably an engine of some kind to pump water around the filed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Attached to the edge of the shed is life itself: a small faucet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse’s eyes lock on almost instantly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”See, didn’t I tell you? Spigot. Right there.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse lowers her head and uses a free hand to crank the faucet on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She laps greedily at the water as it waterfalls into the dust and dirt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You whip your camera out of your bag and swing it into your hands</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Hold still,” you command, aiming down the viewfinder</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You crank up the aperture to compensate for the darkness</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse stiffens up, water still trickling into her hungry mouth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”W-What the hell are you doing?” She says, spilling a mouthful of water</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Don’t worry about, just keep drinking.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She giggles as you snap a few pictures…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;…And then wretches and gags, spewing water out of her throat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You check the LCD screen at the back of the camera and you’ve got a few great shots of blue heeler lapping at some water, her over-sized flannel shirt slipping past her shoulders, jeans barely clinging to her thin body…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;…and then you’ve got a great many shots of water geysering out of her nose, eyes pinched shut, body retching forward</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Laughter explodes out of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fuck it, you don’t care who hears you right now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse clutches the side of the shed and sputters water like an engine failing to kick over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You laugh even harder</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She throws a middle finger (paw?) over her shoulders while you bust a gut</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Sounds like you’ve got a… DRINKING problem,” you say, as the audience hurls tomatoes at you for making such a shitty joke</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I can handle my liquor, this water here jus’ caught me off guard’sall”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Alright alright, I’m just teasing.” You flip your camera around your back and approach the shed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still coughing, Jesse steps to the side</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You notice she’s managed to absolutely soak the shit out of her shirt — turning it nearly translucent</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Silvered in the moonlight she looks…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like a goddess</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She wears the night so well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And, soaking wet, you can see the way it outlines her delicate curves, tracing her shape with powdered light</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s feminine to be sure</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She just stands there, perfectly slouched, leaning one arm against the shed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You finish taking a long, careful drink</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you notice she’s not looking in your direction anymore</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s taken her hand off the shed, and instead has wrapped both arms around her shivering frame</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stand tall in the twinkling darkness and focus your gaze on her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Jesse-“ you start</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks at you, her blush glowing crimson in the darkness, like a spangled banner of red stars against the blackening night sky</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”What!?” She barks. “I’m c-cold’s’all.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You slacken, unsure of what to do with yourself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s a silence between you two Jesse trembles in the darkness, and you let the water drain out of the spigot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Wanna see some pictures that I took?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her face lights up despite the cold</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”SURE!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You click through your camera roll, which is like a stop-motion film</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;First it begins on campus, last fall</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bright colors</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Auburn and gold</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You remember when you took this one</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were exploring campus for the first time, so it’s a series of shots of you making your way from your dank dorm room to the quad</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse leans in intently, the smell of wet dog radiating off of her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s still shivering, so you let your shoulder bump into yours</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Holy crap,” she says, as you scroll through pics of your quad</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s people — anthros and humans all mingling with one another as easy as fish breathe water</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She settles on a panorama of the quad, which is encased in red brick buildings on all sides</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In the center of the shot there’s a huge oak tree</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The leaves of fall drift on the autumn breeze</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s one of your favorite shots, actually</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I took this on my first day up at uni.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”No kidding? What was it like?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You throw your gaze upwards and search the clear skies for an answer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I guess… it’s kind of like constantly feeling like you have to throw up.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Oh, like when you’re sick. I get it.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yeah. You’re entering a new stage in your life and leaving everything else behind so that you can grow and — hopefully — make some decent cash on the side. It’s scary.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse lets out a puff of air</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Not like I’d know. I was born and raised in this little town.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“No kidding? You didn’t move out here?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She rolls her eyes, but you get the feeling the gesture wasn’t directed at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Move out here from where? Another Podunk shitheap little town? Yeah. I been stuck here all my life. All I know is corn, meth, and speciesm, in that order.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel… uncomfortable</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What do you say?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You flick through more pictures on your camera, desperately trying to find meaning and significance in them so as to distract from the sudden somber atmosphere</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They’re mostly of college life</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shots of parties you didn’t want to be at</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some work from class</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A low whimper escapes Jesse</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“What’s wrong?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She hesitates</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”It- It’s just… damnit,” she exhales loudly and forces her eyes upward, latching on to the full moon. “You don’t know how good you got it.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I know I got it good. I got it too good, actually.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse puffs a jet of air from her chest. “Whaddya mean by ‘too good’? No such thing as too good.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“God damn right I got it too good. I’m too insulated where I’m at in life. Too comfortable to change.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You don’t want what we got out here, Anon. Trust me, you stay comfortable and happy in your little bubble.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“You want to know what the bravest thing I’ve ever done is?” You say, speaking over Jesse</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Fuck someone without wrapping it?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“It was coming out here on my own. No plan, vague goals and very little money. And now I fucked myself over.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You barely planned things as it is, but now that you hear it out loud…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Man, it was really stupid to come out here</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You turn your focus back on your camera</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And out of the corner of your eye?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You see Jesse fidgeting with something</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You turn your head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse is halfway out of her oversized flannel</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“What the hell are you doing?!” You say, but all she does is give you a curious glance before returning to fiddling with her buttons</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’m getting cold and this shirt is wet,” she says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A shameful blush creeps over your face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Now what were you saying? About doing something stupid?” She says, flinging her shirt out in front of her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you look over at her again she’s only in her pair of jeans and her bra</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s plain and dark, but stands out nicely against her gray fur</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Seeing the gentle heave of her chest, you wonder why you first mistook her for a boy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or for someone that gives a shit about social grace</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She slides comfortably against the shed and into the trampled corn stalks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see her panting hard and heavy, thick pick tongue lopping out of her mouth and hanging between her teeth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;How can someone simultaneously be hot and cold?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“I-I guess I did something stupid by coming out here… without a plan or anything. Getting myself involved in God knows what.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Yeah but if ya think about it, it wasn’t all that bad.” She nudges you with her shoulder. “You got to meet me. And you got some funny pictures.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Yeah but I only got like a handful.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Three good ones from what I saw.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shit, she’s right</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You thumb through your photos again, and stop when you get to Jesse choking on water</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can see the artistic value there — it’s kind of a statement, right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The plight of-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Hey Anon, can I ask you a favor?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Probably a good thing that Jesse cut off your pseudo-intellectual ravings</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Sure, what’s up?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”C-Can you…” she points at the camera. “Can you take some more photos of me? I ain’t never had a photo taken of me before you come along.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Seriously?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”C’mon!” She throws her hands up in the air. “You think we got photo people out here? You’re probably the only person in miles with an actual camera. C’mon, I wanna be famous,” she says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You think for a second, holding the camera at chest level</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Should you really be doing this right now?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What, with being hunted down and all</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For ambiguous reasons</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fuck it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Jesse, before I do this, I have questions I need answered.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Questions?” She tilts her head. “What kinda questions?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“Why?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Why what?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“No, that’s my question. Why are we being hunted? Why me? What’s this all about?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Oh, right.” Her tone slowly deflates as her eyes lower</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She digs her feet into the trampled dirt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A warm summer breeze cuts through the stalks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It lightly tosses the shag of her fur</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”It’s easier when I tell it like this: you were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Thems two fucktards and their buddies and everyone they ‘work’ with? They all got their ideas mixed ‘round. They think you’re some kinda city reporter here to crack open their meth operation they run outta the diner.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”But I’m not. I’m just a reporter. I’m,“ you clench your fists, “just a dumb fucking college kid. I’m not capable of even turning in a school project on time, let alone busting open a drug operation.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jesse puckers her cheeks up and launches a wad of spit across the field</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I told you, they’re too fuckin’ stupid to understand that. I’m pretty stupid myself, but these two make even me seem like I could go to college. Like you.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“It’s not that hard,” you say, though you’re not speaking loud enough for her to hear you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“There’s only two sides in this shitheap town of ours,” she continues, “Mammals on crank and mammals makin’ it. There ain’t no room for a third.” She turns her head to face you, her eyes heavy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”That means you.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Of course it means you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Otherwise they wouldn’t be out looking for you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">“It’s so funny.” You stand up and shake your head lightly. “I remember waking up in the diner from the strangest dream.

Summary: A picture is worth a thousand words, and someone’s life.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&gt;You are Anonymous
&gt;You are a bland featured human, a pretentious college-student that’s the scourge of every parent’s bank account
&gt;You’d like to think you’re here today on some kind of soul-searching journey, Chris McCandles style (minus the dying)
&gt;What with your camera bag, your meager toiletries, and solitary change of clothes
&gt;But really, you’re on a bus, coasting out to the middle of fucking nowhere at 60 miles-per-hour (Speed limit is 75), you’ve got about $36 in cash, your phone is almost out of battery, and the fat lady next to you keeps farting loudly in her sleep
&gt;As the barren landscape slides by, endless cornfield after endless cornfield after endless cornfield, you begin to think that your solo photography trip out into the country was a mistake
&gt;With no planned route, no idea of what you want to photograph, and with the fading sunlight at your back, you hop off at the next stop, bag and all, the idea of calling your parents and taking a bus back home looming large in your mind
&gt;The bus put you right outside a gas station with a small diner attached at the far end, almost like an after-thought
&gt;Signs hint at a town just a few miles down the road
&gt;You walk through the doors and a wall of cool air washes over you
&gt;Feels good man, another hour on that bus and you would have smothered that fat lady to death with her own retarded ‘travel pillow’
&gt;Tired and kind of sore, you shamble weakly towards the diner and plop yourself and your gear down in an empty booth
&gt;You shut your eyes for a bit, just listening to the distant country moan of the in-store radio
&gt;Okay Anonymous, when you open your eyes, you’re going to start thinking of the next step. No more un-planned photographic adventures to bumfuck-nowhere
&gt;Secretly you hope you’ll be back in bed at home, but the shameful hope that this is all a really mundane dream only makes you feel less like a 22-year-old and more like a scared little kid
&gt;You really don’t want to open your eyes. The comforting bliss of darkness is all that’s keeping you from cry-ing like a kid
&gt;Well, here goes nothing
&gt;On 3, okay?
&gt;1
&gt;2

&gt;”Can I get you some coffee, or a pillow?”
&gt;Your eyelids peel open
&gt;A waitress, a real fucking movie-ass waitress in a blue uniform with a notepad and all is looking impatiently down at you, her canine eyes half-open
&gt;She’s an older looking Coyote, a little bored, wearing a purple bowtie in her rust-colored fur, like a super-model who had just cat-walked out of Wal-Mart
&gt;You blink a few times
&gt;Thought that waitresses only looked like this in movies?
&gt;”So, should I come back or…?”
“No, no, I think I’m ready to order something to drink,” you stammer, snapping back to reality. “Can I uhhh… have some coffee?”
&gt;She feigns delight. “Sure can. Cream, sugar?”
&gt;You shake your head and smile nervously
&gt;”Just black is fine.”
&gt;She raises a questioning stare at you, as if to ask if you can ‘actually handle black coffee’
&gt;After a few seconds, she swivels on her heels and sashays towards the kitchen
&gt;You can’t help but watch her go, her tail swishing fluidly over her nicely padded butt, made all the more captivating by her hour-glass frame
&gt;She’s kind of sexy, in like, a really trashy, milfy kind of way
&gt;You’re not that kind of photographer, but if she offered, you’d have a hard time saying no
&gt;Ah, speaking of
&gt;You haul your camera out onto the table, hoping to at least take some artsy shots of the diner. It’d suck to come all this way and have nothing to show for it
&gt;Your camera is a cheap one (by camera standards at least), and because you’re fairly stingy, you still only have the kit lens for it
&gt;Which, on reflection, was probably a bad idea, because you have no idea what conditions you want to shoot in
&gt;Okay, take a few shots, check the bus schedule on your (almost) dead phone, and head home

&gt;You pop your head out over the booth to get a look around for a good subject
&gt;Your gaze flicks around the cleanly-lit diner, scanning for someone...
&gt;And you come up empty
&gt;Wow, you’re really the only person here right now. That’s an odd feeling
&gt;”You a reporter?”
&gt;The waitress asks in a flat tone as she glares down at you, mug of coffee in hand
&gt;Startled, you shake your head
“No, no. Just a college student out on a road trip, trying to see what I can see, you know?”
&gt;She says nothing and continues to cast silent judgement down on you
&gt;Without a dissatisfied grunt, she sets the coffee down and walks back towards the kitchen
&gt;You wonder what that was about? She seemed awfully pissed off about the camera thing
&gt;You quietly take a sip of coffee, but nearly spray it across the table when the painfully sweet taste of way too much cream and sugar passes your lips
&gt;She put so much in this mug that it’s practically white
&gt;You’re beginning to get the feeling that she doesn’t like you a whole lot
&gt;You snap a quick photo of her sweet, sweet backside as she saunters back over to the kitchen
&gt;The viewfinder renders in glorious HD the pear-shape of her body, dress tight against her frumpy butt, the rust-colored tail protruding just above the slope of her ass
&gt;It feels like you got some semblance of justice, and you still try drinking the shitty cream coffee just because you paid for it
&gt;Fuck you, you sexy milfy coyote lady. Fuck you

&gt;After that you spend some time flicking through your photos
&gt;Bored with that, You start taking shots of everything, from artful compositions of the booth you’re in, to shitty blog shots of the “coffee” sitting half-consumed on your table
&gt;You’re so busy spitefully and boldly taking photos of everything, you don’t notice how much time slips away from you
&gt;Or that you’re no longer alone
&gt;”You a reporter from the city?” A voice from behind you causes you to nearly drop your camera (good thing you were wearing the neck strap)
&gt;A blue heeler is peeking over the top of the booth behind you, his light blue eyes curiously watching as you find the words to answer
&gt;You have none, but that’s okay, this kid is leading the conversation like a child steering a racecar
&gt;”Can I see your camera?” He asks, extending a thin arm over the booth
&gt;Well gee, that’s really fucking forward
“Ummmm, no...” you offer in return. “I’m just taking some photos of some stuff before I head back home.”
&gt;”Oh, where you from?” His eyes light up, and a friendly smile widens across his face. “You from the city or something? You out here to write a story about meth?”
&gt;What the hell is up with this kid?
&gt;You tell him that you’re just a college student from the city, out on a photo project
&gt;And you leave out the part about getting cold feet and wanting to go home
&gt;When you’re finished with the explanation, the kid, who tells you his name is Jesse, practically leaps into the chair opposite of you
&gt;He’s… Well, a little too friendly, and it makes you uncomfortable
&gt;He might be trying to rob you, or he might be retarded
&gt;Heelers: friendly, intelligent, high energy, usually find good work out in agriculture due to their heritage and breeding standards
&gt;This guy must not have gotten the intelligence genes his breed is known for
&gt;He’s wearing a heavy flannel buttoned all the way up, some loose and dirty jeans, a pair of work shoes, and he smells like he’s been rolling around the fields for a few days
&gt;He leans eagerly across the table, extending the length of his thin body in order to peek at what you’re do-ing, and if it weren’t for the table separating you two, you’re sure he’d be touching you by now
&gt;You’re assaulted by his seemingly innocuous questions of ‘what’s this, how’s that work, you ever taken photos for magazines before?’ And you do your best to answer all of them, leaving you practically out of breath by the time the waitress comes back over
&gt;This guy is really reminding you of the fact that you’re an introvert

&gt;The waitress returns, bearing an appraising scowl, especially when she finds you’ve suddenly gained a meal partner
&gt;”Jesse, you bothering my customers again?” She asks with a cold tone
&gt;The Heeler cocks his head, seemingly confused by the question
&gt;”Naw Lee Anne, my friend here...” he looks at you, suddenly remembering he forgot to ask you your name
“Anon,” you answer, with a tone that says ‘I want to die’
&gt;Jesse completely ignores your verbalized plea for death
&gt;Yep, definitely retarded
&gt;”My friend Anon and I were just catching up over dinner.”
&gt;Wait, hold the fuck up, you didn’t say anything about dinner
&gt;Lee Anne shakes her head with disapproval
&gt;”Not if you ain’t got money this time. You got money darlin’?”
&gt;Jesse smiles
&gt;”Well, yeah, but my friend Ayynon said he was treatin’ me. So can I have a cup of coffee, some eggs n some bacon please? And uhhh, get my buddy Anon here a fresh cup of coffee, he looks like he mighta’ put too much cream into his. Clumsy hands. You know humans.”
&gt;Lee Anne glares daggers at you
&gt;”What a pal, a human buying a meal for Jesse. Ain’t you just so generous?”
&gt;You can’t be sure, but you can almost sense some heavily veiled sarcasm from your waitress
&gt;God you want to fucking die right now
&gt;Lee Anne sighs before sauntering off, muttering something about ‘Making friends with humans is gonna get you shot round’ here hun.’
&gt;The bell above the door chimes, but you pay it no attention
&gt;It’s going to take all of your focus to get through this uncomfortable encounter

&gt;As Lee Anne takes her sweet time in putting the order in, Jesse turns back to you and grins, obviously very pleased with the way this whole evening is shaping up
&gt;You’re not grinning, you’re between strangling him and crying from the awkwardness
&gt;But who should you be mad at? The anthro who just invited himself to dinner on your dime, or yourself, for not saying a damn word about it?
&gt;Jesse smiles again, scrunching up his face
&gt;That dopey look with his tongue partly out makes you wanna punch his lights out
&gt;Guess you get to be mad at someone other than yourself for a change
“Hey, that wasn’t cool, dude. I didn’t say I would buy you dinner,” you hiss at him
&gt;The dopey grin dissipates quickly
&gt;”Yeah but you didn’t stop me or say no, so-”
“That’s not the point! The point is you don’t do that shit to people, especially if you don’t even know them!”
&gt;Jesse still looks confused as the words leave your mouth
&gt;Aren’t Heelers supposed to be an intelligent breed?
&gt;The words finally register, and he nods, already ready with an answer for you
&gt;”Well, we got dinner to get to know each other, right? No big deal. Out here mammals is a lot friendlier than you think.”
“Yes big deal,” you sigh. “You get your food and then I’m leaving, okay? I gotta catch a bus back home.”
&gt;The Heeler cocks his head, trying to process your statement
&gt;”Back home? The buses don’t run this time of night out here. You heading west? You’re gonna have to wait at least a few days I bet.”
&gt;Your jaw drops
“Are you fucking me?”
&gt;Jesse, who was taking a sip out of your coffee cup, practically chokes
&gt;”Fuck you? I hardly know you!” He says through sputters, ears flattening back against his skull
&gt;You swear you can almost see a crimson blush in his otherwise dark fur
&gt;“And just what kind of girl do you think I am?”

“Wait, what do you mean by that?”
&gt;”You know damn well what I mean. Look, I know I don’t have a lot of money, but if you think I’m doing any of that shit with you just because you bought me dinner, then I hope you’re into pain, college boy!”
&gt;His- You mean, HER hands tighten into fists
&gt;What the fuck is going on? He is a she? Is this crazy bitch about to assault you? Is a tranny about to kill you in some podunk little diner?
&gt;You look at the anthro across the table again, this time really studying hi- HER
&gt;She’s got black and gray fur that reminds you of salt and pepper, soft blue eyes, that are staring daggers at you, but that are alight with small traces of feminine charm and intrigue
&gt;And suddenly you can start to see ‘him’ as a ‘her’
&gt;Her facial features are soft and somewhat rounded (though to be fair you can’t tell most anthros apart), and her arms, when you last remember seeing them, were thin and wiry, either from a lack of nutrition, muscle mass, or both
&gt;Her clothes are NOT doing her any favors. They look two sizes too big, and they’re fucking filthy
&gt;Maybe she’s just really flat?
&gt;But you could maybe start to see her naked underneath
&gt;Your mind starts to wander to what this anthro-dog would look like disrobed
&gt;Hmmm, small pink nubs on her chest where her tits ought to be, boyish, almost stick-thin frame, bright pink slit between her legs-
&gt;You shake the thoughts violently from your head
&gt;Now is not the time to be fantasizing! This bumpkin might stab you! Or claw your face off! Or worse,
&gt;Your dick!
“Shit, no, I didn’t mean...” your voice drops to a whisper, “fucking, like...actual sex… It’s just an expression that we use at school.”
&gt;Her shoulders drop, and she cocks her head a little
&gt;”Wait, you just say that stuff to random people?” She questions, scratching a spot behind her ears. “That’s the most retarded thing I ever heard, and I can’t even go to college.”
“I guess it is,” you reply sheepishly. Now it was your turn to start blushing
&gt;She suppresses a laugh behind her palm
&gt;Yep, definitely a girl
&gt;”Besides, if anyone out here found out I was shacking up with a human, they’d drag us both down to the creek and shoot us like frogs without a second thought.”
&gt;Shoot us like frogs!?
”Are you fucking me?”
&gt;”Didn’t we just go over this? No, I’m not fucking you!” Her voice echoes in the empty diner, barely compet-ing with the shitty drone of the radio
“No, no, that’s not what I meant!” You slap your head
&gt;You want to find the people who wrote your ‘Human-Anthro Relations&#039; textbook and strangle them
&gt;They were dead wrong about heelers
“What I mean is: are things that… bad out here? Like, humans and anthros still can’t associate?”
&gt;Nodding, She takes another sip of your ‘coffee’
&gt;”I suppose so. It depends on where you are and what kinda skin you’re wearing. There’s towns out here where I wouldn’t dare visit, and there’s towns where you wouldn’t visit had you known’ little better. And then there’s places like Meeker, that are just… in between. This here is one of those towns where you’re probably better off not visiting, if I do say so myself.”
“What do you mean by ‘in between?’”
&gt;Jesse nods and tilts your ‘coffee’ mug towards you
&gt;”You think that Lee Anne accidentally put too much cream in your coffee? Naw, she did that on purpose, and she’d probably do much worse if she didn’t think you had money.”
&gt;Which reminds you: You really don’t have any money
&gt;You open your mouth to tell her that you probably won’t be able to afford a bus ticket AND her meal, but she’s not listening
&gt;She rests her chin on her palm and stares off into the empty diner
&gt;”Things aren’t like your fancy college out here. People aren’t as kind, and nobody’s tip-toeing around no-body. Kindness is as rare as the rain these days. It’s easy to get lonely out here. Been dreamin’ of leavin’, but I know I’d never make it outside of this lil’ shitheap.”
&gt;You look around the diner, half expecting a pack of feral anthros to bust through the door and beat the piss out of you for not having fur
&gt;Christ, what kind of mess did you get yourself into? This isn’t exactly Deliverance shit, but you’re starting to feel like you’re way out of your element
&gt;You lean across the table, as close as you can get to her
“Psst, is it true about the busses this time of night?”
&gt;She nods slowly
&gt;”Yeah, you’re stuck here until at least tomorrow, and it feels like it’s getting late,” she remarks, picking up your ‘coffee’ again and downing the last of it
&gt;You silently cringe as you watch it go down her gullet
&gt;Good god that must have be like drinking pure syrup
&gt;”Hope that food gets here soon, could use a good bite to eat,” she says as she digs her tongue into what’s left of the mug
&gt;”And some coffee. I need a pick-me-up.”

&gt;As if on cue, your favorite trailer slut waitress appears, a plate of food and two mugs of coffee at the ready
&gt;Jesse hardly waits until Lee Anne is done setting the food down before practically stuffing her face
&gt;”Christ hun, at least let me put the plate down first,” Lee Anne groans. “When’s the last time you ate?”
&gt;Jesse looks up towards Lee Anne, her cheeks bulging, egg yolk running down her chin
&gt;She swallows hard (nice) and holds up two fingers
&gt;Lee Anne’s face twists up with disgust
&gt;”Ain’t your tweaker momma feeding you? Or she spending all that government cheese on more crank?”
&gt;Jesse stops her ravenous assault on the plate and stares down at the table
&gt;Oooh boy this is getting awkward
&gt;You want to say something, but you’re not sure what you could say in this instance
&gt;A look of confusion and hurt plays out across her usually cheerful and excitable face
&gt;The Heeler says nothing, just stares down at the table
&gt;Lee Anne clears her throat, and you open your mouth to call her a fucking bitch, but she’s too quick, and you’re too beta
&gt;”Well, if you ever need anything else to eat, try to bring another human by, maybe he’ll cover your meal too,” She smirks at you and hands you the check. ”Here Mr. Moneybags, bring that up when you’re ready or when she’s taken you for another ride.”
&gt;And with that crushing performance, the coyote spins on her heels and saunters off, a very proud and caus-tic grin spreading across her rust colored fur
&gt;You don’t know what to say, or what you could say
&gt;Jesse just sits there, looking hurt
&gt;You sit there in stunned silence, feeling conflicted
&gt;On one hand, that felt completely uncalled for on Lee Anne’s part, and on the other hand, you wonder if you’ve just been taken for a ride, as if this is something Jesse does all the time
&gt;You check the bill
&gt;$24, so basically you can’t afford to get back home if you pay this
&gt;Fucking hell
&gt;Your start to say something, but Jesse grabs you by the hand and drags you out of the diner
&gt;You try to say something when she drags you round back to where the dumpsters are, but as you open your mouth she clumsily shoves her tongue in
&gt;For a solid 15 seconds there’s this confusing silence where you, profoundly awkward, and her, profoundly inexperienced, tongue wrestle
&gt;It feels like you’re having a breathing contest, seeing who can go the longest without opening their eyes
&gt;You don’t know where to put your hands either, and neither does she, so you two basically just stand there like weird statues, trying to imitate what you think making out is supposed to be like
&gt;Do you…
&gt;Do you grab her butt or something? How does this work?
&gt;You’re about to make a move, but she pulls away quickly, leaving you breathless
&gt;She quickly wipes a trail of spit from her lips, her face bright red with heat
&gt;She clenches her eyes shut, sending tears rolling down her cheeks
&gt;”T-That’s for dinner, and… and whatever else you want, because I owe you, and…”
&gt;She’s trembling, and you’re not sure if it’s from embarrassment, sadness, or adrenaline considering she just forced herself on you
&gt;Maybe it’s all three?
&gt;”And I- I ain’t some kind of whore or anything, but I o-owe you for dinner tonight, and for being so k-kind...”
&gt;You can tell that she’s trying very hard to hold back tears, given that she pretty much won’t look you in the eyes
&gt;”We can go back to my place, or… wherever… My mom won’t care nothing, or about who I bring home,” she says, trying to wear a brave smile. “Besides, I swear I ain’t using you. I ain’t that type’a gal.”
&gt;Another moment of indecision
&gt;You realistically could say yes, because you haven’t gotten laid in like two years, and the last time was an awkward drunken hookup at a party you didn’t want to be at
&gt;And she tasted like vomit
&gt;But this feels almost wrong
&gt;And her on the verge of crying doesn’t help
&gt;You’ve never been great with women, so you just blurt the first thing that comes to mind
“I want to go home.”

&gt;She ends up fully sobbing, and whispers something about how she wants to go home too, but you’re too paralyzed with the feels to actually say something comforting
&gt;Does ‘there there’ even comfort anyone?
&gt;Before you can actually do or say anything, she gently presses her head into your chest and grabs you by your shirt collar
&gt;For the first time in what you imagine is a few years, you imagine, she allows herself to sob
&gt;You go for a hug, but settle for a hover hand
&gt;Jesus fuck why are you like this?
&gt;”I’m sorry,” she chokes out, unaware of your awkward attempt at comforting her
&gt;”I’m sorry for kissing you, and for using you, and for...”
&gt;This time you actually just hug her, because you honestly can’t stand to hear her like this anymore
&gt;You can feel a metaphorical pair of testicles drop into your literal sack
&gt;She hushes up, and you let her sob silently into your ratty old college shirt

&gt;A few minutes pass, and when she’s finally done, she blows her nose on the collar of her old shirt
&gt;Ew
&gt;She buttons up her crusty denim jacket and steps back, trying not to look you in the eyes
&gt;”S-Sorry bout that,” she stammers
&gt;You tell her it’s okay. Not the first time an anthro dog has cried into your shirt
&gt;”Wait, are you kidding?” She slaps her head in disbelief. “In all the hurry I forgot to ask if you even had a girl-friend.”
&gt;”Or a boyfriend?” She says cautiously, “I don’t judge much. If you can’t tell, I’m not really in a position to be judging others.”
“No, no,” you smile and shake your head. “I’m single as hell, and probably will be for the rest of my days.”
&gt;”You ‘n me both, Anon. You ‘n me both,” she sighs, rubbing her palm on the back of her neck
&gt;You can still feel the tension of what just happened between you two, but it feels somewhat dissipated by now
&gt;The moon is already well into the night sky, and with the crickets chirping a summer symphony, you decide that it’s at least 8 or 9 p.m.
&gt;Jesse notices too, and stifles a yawn
&gt;”Normally I don’t do this, but since I made you miss your bus home, would you like to stay the night with me?”

&gt;Come home? With her?
&gt;Stay the night at a strange anthro woman’s ‘home’?
&gt;What could go wrong
&gt;No, fuck this, you’re going to see if you can sleep in the diner and wait for the next bus
&gt;You open your mouth to issue your declaration of independence, but the roar of an engine clips your speech
&gt;A pair of headlights open up on you, outlining your shapes in gold
&gt;Pressed against the dumpster, Jesse blocking the source of the light with her back, you can only see two thin shadows piling out of a shitbeater truck
&gt;Digitride feet
&gt;Heaving tails
&gt;Broad shoulders
&gt;Ears like black knives standing atop predatory skulls
&gt;These aren’t just anthros
&gt;They’re carnivores
&gt;You open your mouth to say something to Jesse
&gt;There’s a heavy crack that pounds off the diner’s back walls, like lightning striking on a clear day
&gt;Gunfire
&gt;Jesse gasps, squeals, and then tumbles forward, crashing into you
&gt;You manage to catch her in your arms
&gt;…
&gt;Holy shit

&gt;”The bitch blocked my shot!” A deep voice groans
&gt;”Best body armor he’s ever had,” another voice adds with a hateful chuckle
&gt;You’re frozen
&gt;Jesse isn’t moving
&gt;This isn’t real
&gt;And there’s blood leaking out of her ratty flannel
&gt;And her tail is flat and limp
&gt;And this can’t be real

&gt;How does someone die so quickly and so senselessly?

&gt;”Knew we’d find Jesse hanging around the human.”
&gt;A heavy-set coyote wearing light jeans, a dark red flannel and sporting a trucker’s hat steps into the light
&gt;Judging by the set of his shoulders, his height, and the youthful snarl etched into his pubescent face, he’s still a teenager, maybe just barely older than a pup
&gt;You imagine that if he were human he’d be sporting a fresh crop of acne
&gt;”Smelled your scent from a mile away, pinkie.” He narrows a scowl at you
&gt;He’s got a heavy wrench dangling from his right arm
&gt;A similarly young crocodile trundles into the light, cradling a double barrel shotgun
&gt;You swear your heart is going to leap out of your chest
“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?!” You scream at them
&gt;You don’t know — the noise just exploded out of you
&gt;The anthros flinch at your voice, their sensitive hearing spiking
&gt;There’s a puddle of blood collecting beneath Jesse
&gt;She’s starts to feel heavy in your arms — like a bag loaded with buckshot
&gt;But you don’t want to let go
&gt;You can’t let go
&gt;You barely know this person and yet… you feel tied to her
&gt;At the very least, she saved your life
&gt;The croc cracks the barrel in half
&gt;A spent red shell jumps out into the air
&gt;You watch it arc in the headlights and crash onto the ground
&gt;”We’re just having some fun is all-“
“FUN!?” You fire back. “You just killed her! What’s your idea of fun!?”
&gt;The two predators narrow their eyes on Jesse’s limp body
&gt;Her muzzle rests on your shoulder, and her blood is starting to get on your own shirt
&gt;”Ain’t nobody gonna miss her.” The coyote says with finality and not a hint of remorse
“Fuck you, she had a family,” you say, choking back tears
&gt;”Barely,” the croc adds. “Shane’s right. Ain’t nobody going to miss her. Her mamma’s probably OD’d by now anyway.”
&gt;”She don’t do nothin&#039; round here ‘cept cheat and steal from people. We’re doing the town a favor.” ‘Shane’ the Coyote says. He spits into the dirt and stamps it out with the heel of his ratty tennis shoes
&gt;The two predators take a step forward
&gt;The crocodile, Bill, sets the barrel of his shotgun against his shoulder and aims down at you
&gt;His narrow maw curls into a smile
&gt;”You got five seconds to drop her and make this easy on yourself.”
“Fuck you!” you sputter. “This is murder, don’t you care?!”
&gt;Okay, this time your actually crying
&gt;And why shouldn’t you be?
&gt;You never thought you’d go like this
&gt;You hold Jesse even tighter in protest
&gt;The coyote inches forward
&gt;”Nobody’s gonna care about a little human gone missing. Not in this town. You and Jesse’s all the same — trash that someone’s gotta take out.”
&gt;Big talk from two murderers
&gt;Shane thumps his wrench into his palms as a show of force
&gt;”Mister either you let Bill take care of you, or I’m going to handle you with my wrench here. Now you got FOUR FUCKING SECONDS to drop the heeler and take it like a man.”

&gt;A shotgun blast to the head is peaceful in its own way, you guess
&gt;It’s one millisecond of agony, and then darkness
&gt;Not so bad, right?
&gt;You feel your grip on Jesse loosening
&gt;And you’re about to drop her weight, when you hear her say, weakly, with a throat full of blood:
&gt;”Go. Run.”

&gt;You drop Jesse into a puddle of her own blood
&gt;You don’t need any further instruction
&gt;Satisfied, Bill takes aim at you

&gt;You swing your camera out of the bag right as Bill’s scaly fingers tense around the trigger
&gt;You hope to fucking God this works
&gt;You press down on the shutter
&gt;Anthros have sensitive eyes, right?
&gt;There’s a white flash from your camera, a blinding, digital explosion
&gt;And, right then and there, you duck, and roll to the side
&gt;The shotgun barks
&gt;The brickwork of the diner explodes above you, riddled with spray
&gt;And when the light fades, you hit the dirt, feet pounding, heart hammering, excess adrenaline surging in your veins
&gt;You set your sights on hiding in the tall cornfields, just a few feet from the diner
&gt;A quick check over your shoulders shows that Bill and Shane are stumbling about, half-blind, pinching their blinded eyes with their forefingers

&gt;Did it work?
&gt;Did you get away?
&gt;Another shotgun blast
&gt;Did he reload that fast?
&gt;You feel something sting the back of your legs
&gt;Then that stinging pain becomes a fierce, gripping agony
&gt;You stumble, trip, and are down for the count
&gt;When you look down at your leg, outlined in silver by the light of the moon, it’s pretty much shredded to shit and geysering blood
&gt;Shit
&gt;You fumble for your camera again when you see the wrench-wielding coyote bounding towards you
&gt;He leaps into the air with one powerful pulse of his legs
&gt;Shane brings the wrench over his head
&gt;Maybe you can-
&gt;He lands on your chest
&gt;And brings the wrench down on skull, shattering bone and-

&gt;”Can I get you some coffee, or a pillow?”
&gt;Your eyelids peel open
&gt;A waitress, a real fucking movie-ass waitress in a blue uniform with a notepad and all is looking impatiently down at you, her canine eyes half-open
&gt;She’s an older looking Coyote, a little bored, wearing a purple bowtie in her rust-colored fur, like a super-model who had just cat-walked out of Wal-Mart
&gt;You blink a few times
&gt;Thought that waitresses only looked like this in movies?
&gt;”So, should I come back or…?”

&gt;What the fuck

&gt;”You a reporter?” She asks, eyes narrowing. “Because we don’t have need of a reporter in our town.”
&gt;Seconds ago you were getting your brain evicted from your skull outside the diner
&gt;And now you’re here, back in the diner
&gt;And it’s day time now
&gt;But how
&gt;Was it all a dream?
&gt;It’s starting to fade in your grainy imagination, wiping back to a clean slate, a constant running theater of incessant bullshit and noise
&gt;That memory — that dream — is drowning in the sudden sensory overload of this diner
&gt;The chimey radio
&gt;The smell of coffee and the acrid stench of stale cigarettes
&gt;The coyote waitress who clearly wants nothing to do with you
&gt;The feeling that you’re being watched and appraised
&gt;Think, you motherfucker!
&gt;Grab hold of a memory like a comet’s tail and hold on
&gt;You’d have an easier time holding smoke
&gt;You can only remember a few things: This girl named Jesse, and these two carnivores, and she…
&gt;You look up with a blank stare, mouth working but no sound coming out
&gt;”Alright, I’ll just bring some coffee back.” The waitress spins on her heels and starts walking back towards the kitchen, every footstep like glass shattering against the (relative) quiet of the diner
&gt;SHIT
&gt;You lost it
&gt;You were so close to retrieving that memory-dream-thing
&gt;Well, whatever. It was probably just a dream, anyway
&gt;You remember once when you woke up from a nightmare where you swallowed your tongue
&gt;The first thing you did was jam your hand in your mouth and try to keep it from slipping down your throat
&gt;Of course, you ignored your very obvious REAL tongue, at the time, fat and in the way
&gt;This was life or death
&gt;The point is: these types of dreams happen
&gt;They can feel real, but… they just aren’t
&gt;This is one of those dreams

&gt;You pull out your camera and start poking through the pictures, none of them catch your interest
&gt;Mostly just shots of campus, some pictures you took from the bus window
&gt;Just gotta occupy yourself until the waitress comes back, because when she parks her plump, anthro butt right in front of you, you’re going to order some food
&gt;You need some right about now with how heavy your body feels
&gt;And when she leaves, you’re going to take a picture of her FAT ass
&gt;…
&gt;What? Nobody ever said you had good taste
&gt;Creepy, too, but you consider it revenge for her acting like a bitch

&gt;As if on cue, the waitress reappears with a steaming ceramic mug of coffee and a lording, venomous smile
&gt;”Here ya’ go, hun. This’ll wake you right up.”
&gt;When she sets the coffee down your enthusiasm deflates
&gt;It’s loaded with so much cream and sugar that it’s practically white
&gt;She slaps her hands on her hips
&gt;”Anything else I can get you, Mr. news man?”
&gt;With the way she cocks her head, you’re certain that there’s more than just cream and sugar in this coffee
&gt;You paint on a wide smile and thank her
“No, I think I’m okay.”
&gt;”Good!” She brightens her tone to a high shine. “I’ll be back in a bit to grab your order.”
“Great, thanks.” You sink in your chair

&gt;You flick through your camera’s LCD screen and ready a shot
&gt;And then you pause on something
&gt;The waitress is on the screen
&gt;You blush
&gt;Well it’s not specifically her
&gt;It’s a shot of her sauntering away from your table, her fat ass on full-display
&gt;But the thing is
&gt;You just met the waitress
&gt;You don’t remember taking this shot
&gt;Is it cliché to say that ‘ideas start as small seeds buried in the mind’?
&gt;The bell over the door chimes a happy little sound, like the tiniest of hammers banging on a silver sheet of metal
&gt;You hear the waitress brighten her tone again. “Hey you two, need a table?”
&gt;You poke your head above the dividers between tables
&gt;A crocodile and coyote — both of them juvenile and covered in dirt/dust — saunter through the door
&gt;The coyote locks eyes with you for a steady second
&gt;It makes you feel uncomfortable, but you can’t place why
&gt;Still, you drop your body into your seat, camera strapped around your neck
&gt;You try to ignore the collision of neurons in your brain

&gt;”You a reporter from the city?” A voice from behind you causes you to nearly drop your camera (good thing you were wearing the neck strap)
&gt;A Blue Heeler is peeking over the top of the booth behind you, her (and she is most definitely a woman, not a man) light blue eyes curiously watching as you find the words to answer
&gt;You have none, but that’s okay, this kid is leading the conversation like a child steering a race car
&gt;”Can I see your camera?” She asks, extending a thin arm over the booth
&gt;Well gee, that’s really fucking forward
“Ummmm, no...” you offer in return. “I’m just taking some photos of some stuff before I head back home.”
&gt;”Oh, where you from?” Her eyes light up, and a friendly smile widens across her face. “You from the city or something? You out here to write a story about the meth?”
&gt;What the hell is up with this kid?
&gt;You tell her you’re just a college student from the city, out on a solo photo project
&gt;And you leave out the part about getting cold feet and wanting to go home, because that’s not intrepid
&gt;When you’re finished with the explanation, the kid, who tells you her name is Jesse, practically leaps into the chair opposite of you
&gt;You introduce yourself as Anon
&gt;She’s… Well, a little too friendly, and it makes you uncomfortable
&gt;She might be trying to rob you, or she might be retarded
&gt;Heelers: friendly, intelligent, high energy, usually find good work out in agriculture due to their heritage and breeding standards
&gt;She must not have gotten the intelligence genes the breed is known for
&gt;She’s wearing a heavy flannel buttoned all the way up, some loose and dirty jeans, a pair of work shoes, and she smells like he’s been rolling around the fields for a few days, so she definitely is doing some kind of manual labor
&gt;She leans eagerly across the table, extending the length of her thin body in order to peek at what you’re doing, and if it weren’t for the table separating you two, you’re sure she’d be touching you by now
&gt;You’re assaulted by her seemingly innocuous questions of ‘what’s this, how’s that work, you ever taken photos for magazines before?’ And you do your best to answer all of them, leaving you practically out of breath by the time she finishes up grilling you
&gt;This girl is really reminding you of the fact that you’re an introvert
&gt;”You know, I really want to go visit the city someday. Maybe I’ll visit your school,” she says, kind of absentmindedly
&gt;”I need to put some miles between me and this shitty little town, and I always wanted to be on a college campus.”
“I’m sure you do. People here are kind of… rude?” You probe
&gt;”Only just to outsiders, humans especially,” Jesse says. She looks around briefly for theatrical effect, and then leans in close, narrowing her shoulders
&gt;”You picked the wrong town to stop off in,” she says in a whisper. “I’m tellin’ you this cause you seem like alright guy. You need to leave here as soon as possible.”
“What are you talking about?”
&gt;And right at that perfect moment, that croc and coyote wander up to the table
&gt;”Jesse.” The crocodile’s voice is heavy with abuse. “You making new friends?” He raises an eyebrow. “Human friends?”
&gt;The coyote eyes you up and down, his cold, appraising eyes causes the hair on the back of your neck to stand up. “What’s with the camera? He a reporter?”
&gt;”No, he ain’t a reporter. He’s just a-“ she turns to you
&gt;You feel her kick you underneath the table
&gt;Her powerful boots collide off your shin bone
&gt;You nearly yelp
&gt;”What’re you here for again?” She says with a modicum of urgency
&gt;You start to speak, but the look that Jesse gives you tells you that you need to choose your next words care-fully
“I’m a college student. From Fairmount?” You toss out your college like bait, hoping one of them will bite and this conversation will turn to pleasant, intellectual things
&gt;Which is obviously never going to happen
&gt;Why do they seem so familiar though?
&gt;Something about them makes your heart start to race
&gt;You desperately want to leave the diner
&gt;But why?
&gt;Fragments of that dream start to come back to you, but the tense silence is cut by the crocodile
&gt;”Sure you are, friend. We get lots of ‘college students’ out here in the sticks,” he says, leaning in close
&gt;There’s something strange about both of their eyes
&gt;Their dark pupils are outlined in blood
&gt;They look like they’ve been awake for days
&gt;The coyote’s rust-colored fur is completely tossed and unkempt
&gt;There’s even white powder sticking to it
&gt;The croc on the other hand has a white foam accumulating around his jaws, a sign of exhaustion in reptiles
&gt;They make even Jesse seem clean by comparison
&gt;At least her salt-and-pepper fur is brushed and her coat is shiny

&gt;The pair don’t seem to care much about you
&gt;Instead they focus their attention all on Jesse
&gt;”Looking for another handout, Jesse?” The coyote says
&gt;The heeler shakes her head
&gt;”Nope, just making friends with someone. Says he’s skipping out tonight, so I figured I’d get to know our guest over a cup of coffee.”
&gt;She kicks you again under the table
&gt;You notice that her ears are plastered against her skull
&gt;”Says he’s skipping out tonight. Ain’t that right?” She repeats in no uncertain words
&gt;You nod for all you’re worth
&gt;Good work, that might have been the least natural thing you’ve ever done
&gt;No way they believed that
&gt;The crocodile gives you a devil’s grin
&gt;”We’ll be seeing you,” he says, before pacing off. “Have a safe trip home.”
&gt;The coyote lags behind
&gt;”Jesse,” he says
&gt;The heeler paints on a winning smile and even goes as far as tipping her head. ”Can I help you hun?”
&gt;”Come see us later tonight.”
&gt;The smile never leaves her face
&gt;”Can I come see you some other time? How about tomorrow morning? Over bacon?”
&gt;”Tonight.” The coyote says, his voice firm, leaving no room for further bargaining
&gt;For a pup he sure puts on quite a show
&gt;He joins his partner on the other end of the diner, tail swishing aggressively behind him

&gt;You switch focus to your camera
&gt;It’s a total crapshoot, but you think you remember why these guys creep you out so much
&gt;You flick through photos
&gt;Jesse scoots to your side of the booth, unconsciously crowding you into the corner
&gt;Her thin, rounded shoulder bumps into yours, and you can feel the heat her tight body is throwing off
&gt;It’s… a lot 
&gt;She must sweat a ton
&gt;Or she’s really nervous
&gt;”You sure take a lot of pictures,” she remarks, clearly no longer worried about the two anthros who are just tucking in to their dinners. ”You should take one of me, I ain’t never had a proper picture taken of me.”
“Shhhh, I’m looking for a specific on-“
&gt;And there it is
&gt;The last one in the camera roll
&gt;A night shot
&gt;An anthro crocodile one-handing a shotgun
&gt;A ratty looking coyote with a wrench, trying to block the camera’s flash from his sensitive eyes
&gt;Their pickup truck in the background
&gt;And at the bottom of the picture?
&gt;Jesse’s body in a blood heap

&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, we are floating in space

&gt;Of all the pictures you don’t remember taking, this one is the most damning
&gt;Dream or not, this one is… fucked
&gt;Jesse’s breathing turns hard and heavy
&gt;Her blue eyes widen as her ears droop like leaden folds
&gt;”W-Where did you get this?” She asks
&gt;…
“I just… I don’t know.”
&gt;”Anon what the FUCK is this?” She’s shaking now, scooting out of the seat. “What the fuck is wrong with you?”
&gt;Your free hand shoots out and clasps onto her wrist
&gt;She struggles
&gt;”Let go of me you fucking weirdo!”
&gt;You instinctively tighten your grip
&gt;Sure, not suspicious at all, right?
&gt;Your eyes meet for a quick second
&gt;You communicate all that you cannot in words with a quick glance over your shoulder…
&gt;…At the two anthros — the croc and the coyote — who are now staring over at your table
&gt;She sneaks her own glance, and then one back at you
&gt;You can physically see the internal monologue going on in her head
&gt;The play of words between the heartbeat and the synapse
&gt;And, thankfully, she elects to sit back down in your booth
&gt;You release your grip on her wrist
&gt;…
&gt;Why did you do that?
&gt;What did you get yourself involved?
&gt;What happens in that ‘dream’ that you’re so scared of?

&gt;”Ya better a good fucking explanation for what that is.” She jabs the camera with a clawed finger
&gt;The ‘dream’ is starting to crystallize
&gt;Pieces coming together, like the torn remnants of a photograph of some unhappy moment forever immortalized in digital and kinetic space 
”I don’t have one,” you reply, trying to keep your voice a low hiss
&gt;”I don’t know much ‘bout photos. I know I’m a dumb hick from nowherseville. But that don’t give you the right to just… make creepy photos of me, okay?”
“Think about it Jesse — I just met you. There’s no possible way I could have made this up. And look, it’s night in the photo!”
&gt;You point out the details on your LCD screen
&gt;Jesse, still struggling, purses her lips and furrows her brow
&gt;There’s a slight pause
&gt;You hear the sound of forks and knives playing off a nearly empty plate
&gt;The tinkling sound of ice in a glass, like bones rattling together
&gt;Whatever happened in that ‘dream’ it ended with you and Jesse dying
&gt;And those two predators now nearly finished with their meals?
&gt;They were the ones who killed you both
&gt;”So now what in the hell am I supposed to do? Are you saying this isn’t something you made up?”
&gt;That’s a good point
&gt;What ARE you supposed to do now that your dream is starting to bleed into reality?
&gt;You don’t have a plan
&gt;But you do have a choice:
&gt;Fight?
&gt;or flight?
&gt;You look down at the untouched coffee cup, isolated on the table
&gt;It’s so loaded with cream and sugar that it’s pale

&gt;Flight

&gt;You know what you’re going to do?
&gt;Put a million fucking miles between yourself and this hick town
&gt;And especially between you and this dumb heeler
&gt;TONIGHT
&gt;Let the chips fall where they may
&gt;This ain’t about you
&gt;Whatever’s going to happen will have to happen to Jesse and Jesse alone
&gt;But how do you get out of here without a car?
&gt;You hop out of the booth, bags slung over your shoulder
&gt;Jesse follows quick behind you
&gt;Shit, gotta ditch her FAST
&gt;The sun is starting to go down, draining golden light out through the diner’s windows
&gt;…
&gt;Windows
&gt;An idea rattles around in your brain, having to do with windows and your escape

&gt;”You never answered me and- hey! Where the hell do you think you’re going?”
&gt;She’s quick behind you, following in your footsteps
&gt;”You ain’t even paid for that coffee yet.”
“I’m just going to bathroom,” you say in a rushed breath
&gt;”Bathroom? Mister this ain’t the time to go listenin’ to your bladder. I wanna see that photo again.”
&gt;FUCK, why is she still behind you?
&gt;You walk into the gas station portion of the diner and scan for the bathroom
&gt;The plan is simple: go to the john. If there’s a window, climb out of it and see if you can hitch a ride back to town 
&gt;If there’s not a window, just take a piss, come out, reevaluate
&gt;A blue sign above the doors lets you know there is indeed a restroom at this gas station
“Seriously, I’ll let you take a look after I’m done, okay? I just wanna go pee.”
&gt;”Fine! Go piss! But I’ll be waiting. And when we’re done we’re gonna talk about what’s on that camera!” Her voice booms in the small gas station
&gt;You blush hard
&gt;Fuck, people are going to think you’re a pervert
&gt;And worse
&gt;They’re going to know where you went

&gt;The bathroom is… cleaner than you expected
&gt;Guess it doesn’t get used much
&gt;As for its layout, it’s got one stall, two urinals and…
&gt;A frosted window at far end of the bathroom, the orange light of sunset pouring out onto the floor
&gt;It’s as if the heavens have opened up and a host of heavenly angels have conspired together to offer you this one-way portal to freedom from Hicksville
&gt;You start to pull open the window, but it’s stuck from years of disuse
&gt;You dig your whole body into the effort, channeling all 150 pounds of your being into your grip
&gt;The window starts to budge, just a crack though
&gt;But it’s enough to let in a slant of light
&gt;And that’s enough to give you hope

&gt;Until you hear noise outside the bathroom door
&gt;”Hey, Bill, LET GO YOU ASSHOLE!”
&gt;It’s Jesse
&gt;”You’re hurting me!”
&gt;Heavy footsteps approaching the door
&gt;The sounds of struggle sharp against your ears
&gt;Heart beating in the tin drum of your chest
&gt;The door flies open
&gt;And you duck into the stall, hitching the lock
&gt;”Where’d he go, Jesse?” A gruff voice commands
&gt;Definitely reptilian. Definitely Bill
&gt;There’s the sound of boots scuffling on the dirty floor
&gt;”Where’s your reporter friend?”
&gt;You jump up onto the toilet and keep low, so it looks like the stall is empty
&gt;And yet locked?
&gt;God this is bad
&gt;All you can do is… wait and watch
&gt;And listen 
&gt;”He’s not a reporter,” Jesse says, taking deep gulps of air. “How many times do I gotta say that!?”
&gt;She sounds winded
&gt;Then there’s a dull thud, the sound of bruised scales pounding into soft flesh
&gt;Jesse yelps, her voice reaching an octave that sends your heart plummeting
&gt;From your vantage, standing on the toilet, you look under the stall divider 
&gt;You see Jesse go down, head pounding off the bare floor
&gt;One bounce
&gt;Then two
&gt;A trail of crimson carves its way down her muzzle
&gt;Blood
&gt;”Don’t FUCK with me, mutt. I know a reporter when I see one, and I know why he’s here.”
&gt;Jesse tries to sit up
&gt;The crocodile, Bill, stamps his heavy boots into Jesse’s chest, pinning her to the floor
&gt;You watch as the heeler wheezes and struggles, having a lungful of air expelled in one cruel motion
&gt;She reminds you of a bug with its legs ripped off
&gt;The way she squirms, desperate, feral, trying so hard to comprehend her own pain
&gt;”You squealed about the ice, didn’t you? You told that reporter what we got going on here and now he’s going to bust the whole thing open.” Bill seethes. “All so you can get outta town. But you ain’t gonna leave, little girl. You’re stuck here, just like the rest of us.”
&gt;The sound of Jesse choking…
&gt;It’s making you shake, isn’t it?
&gt;That’s right
&gt;You can feel yourself start to vibrate and pulse, tension and terror running in equal measure throughout your wired body
&gt;And this is all before you saw the knife in Bill’s hands, gripped so hard that his knuckles are glowing white
&gt;”You stupid bitch,” he says. “You stupid, stupid bitch. You’ve put us all at risk. Just give him up to us. You know what’s in it for you if you just tell us where he went.”
&gt;The heeler struggles and kicks her legs, but Bill is too sturdy
&gt;You can see the jagged edge of his hunting knife dangling just above her throat
&gt;Holy fucking shit
&gt;You’re about to witness a murder
&gt;Holy
&gt;Fucking
&gt;Shit
&gt;If you stay silent, they might not hear you
&gt;You might still be able to get out of this
&gt;He’ll kill her and leave
&gt;You escape out the window and book it
&gt;Even that makes your stomach turn
&gt;”So I’m going to ask again, doggie. Where the hell is the reporter?”
&gt;Jesse sucks down a fragmented gulp of air and rolls her bloody head to the side, facing under the stall 
&gt;Her eyes open up
&gt;And your terrified gaze meets her own
&gt;….
&gt;There’s a quiet second, punctuated only by the rapid beating of your heart, where the two of you stare down each other
&gt;You, too shocked to even communicate anything
&gt;And her, wide-eyed and confused
&gt;You can see something flitting behind her eyes
&gt;More than just the brunt spark of recognition
&gt;Gears are turning
&gt;Gears that power a mechanism so vast and incomprehensible that it has no physical form
&gt;In just a second you can see a quick mind spring into action
&gt;But that second ends as abruptly as it came about
&gt;”ANSWER ME,” Bill growls.
&gt;She blinks twice at you, turns her head up at Bill, and says with a cough:
&gt;”I have no idea where he went.”

&gt;In life we’re given choices
&gt;Handfuls of diverging paths that span a person’s timeline, some converging, some collapsing, like old abandoned buildings in factory towns run dry
&gt;All choices, for as diverse as they might seem, with their infinite outcomes, reduce down into two options:
&gt;Fight
&gt;Or
&gt;Flight
&gt;Right?
&gt;Can things be that simple?
&gt;Can you separate the human experience into two camps with just the edge of a knife?
&gt;Are you flight?
&gt;Or are you fight?
&gt;There is no third option

&gt;You’re quick on the latch
&gt;Bill never saw you coming
&gt;With a feral yell, you cut loose and leap off the toilet like a madman
&gt;You explode out of the stall, careening through the air
&gt;Your target?
&gt;A big, dumbfuck crocodile
&gt;Who could probably snap your neck with his jaws
&gt;Forward you fly, into the jaws of death

&gt;You are Fight

&gt;You wrap your arms around him as your momentum carries you through the air
&gt;You knock Bill off of his feet
&gt;Good GOD this guy is huge
&gt;His torso must be twice yours
&gt;Still, you caught him off-guard, and so this roughly 300-pound lizard goes down with you, the knife swinging wildly in his right arm
&gt;Jesse gasps, sucking air into her lungs now the croc’s weight is off her chest
&gt;There’s a solid *thump* as the back of Bill’s head slams into the sink, chipping the porcelain
&gt;His eyes collapse in on themselves, like two bloodshot stars suddenly going dark
&gt;Lights out
&gt;His tremendous body comes to rest on the floor with you sprawled out on top of him
&gt;”Anon?” Jesse coughs as she tries to stand
&gt;It takes her a few shaky seconds, but with your help, she’s on her feet
&gt;”Thank you kindly,” she says with another choking cough. “But you didn’t have to do that.”
“What the hell do you mean? He was going to kill you!”
&gt;”I had the situation handled,” she adds with a sheepish smile
“So that’s what you call handling the situation?”
&gt;”Well now we’re really up shit creek. I had it handled.”
“And I’m here to tell you, you did not have this handled.”
&gt;“If he ganked me they woulda’ left and you coulda’ gotten away. But now we try to go out and Shane’ll probably crack open your skull like a peanut. And,” she points down at Bill, who is still down and out, “he’s going to come ‘round here pretty soon.”
&gt;She picks Bill’s hunting knife off his body and mounts his body
&gt;“Let’s light this candle.”
&gt;Wat
&gt;She raises the knife over her head, light blue eyes set on Bill’s padded throat
&gt;Instinct forces your hand
&gt;You catch her arms mid stab
“Jesus, wait a second,” you say in a low, urgent voice
&gt;”Wait? Why wait? This prick tryda’ cut my throat. Was just ‘boutta return the favor.”
“Because… shit. We can still get out of this without murder charges. How about that?”
&gt;She shakes you free
&gt;”I reckon that in about 30 seconds this scaly bastard is going to wake up, or his tweaker pal is going to barge in on us. I may not be smart enough for your’ colleges, but I don’t see any alternatives other than to cut this green bastard’s throat and get the jump on Shane.”
&gt;You clutch your head
&gt;Holy fuck
&gt;You need to think
&gt;She’s crazy
&gt;Everyone’s crazy
&gt;This is crazy
&gt;Wasn’t this supposed to be a dream?
&gt;You feel the sun at your back
&gt;A bird song floats in through the barely-cracked window
&gt;Ah
&gt;Right
&gt;You tap Jesse on the shoulder and point towards the window
&gt;She puts two and two together almost before you do
&gt;”But I’m keeping the knife,” she declares
&gt;And that’s fine with you
&gt;Self-defense? That’s fine
&gt;Straight up murder? Leave that to the universe

&gt;With the window open you toss your bags out first
&gt;Jesse slips out with anthropomorphic grace
&gt;You throw one last look at your shoulder for reassurance
&gt;Bill is still down for the count
&gt;Satisfied, you climb out the window and put two feet on solid dirt
&gt;Jesse is waiting for you
&gt;She pockets the knife
&gt;Alright, plan-
&gt;Jesse grabs you by the arm and rushes you around the back of the gas station/diner
&gt;You hardly have time to grab your bags before she’s got you pressed up against the brick construction of the gas station
“This is your idea of a hiding spot? Just a few feet away from those lunatics?” You say with a hiss. “We need to get back on the road and flag down a car-“
&gt;She hushes you
&gt;”You’re talkin’ too loud there city boy. Just hush up for a second while I think of sumthin’.”
“I already did the thinking for us: we start walking down the road and flag down a car-“
&gt;”Where do you reckon you think you are Anon? Ain’t nobody stopping for hitchhikers out here, specially not a human. Less they’re trynna skin ya.”
&gt;She does have a point
&gt;The wildlife — save for Jesse — hasn’t been all that friendly since you arrived
&gt;Come to think of it, why is she being so friendly?
&gt;What the hell does she get out of protecting you?
&gt;…
&gt;Her grip on you tightens, sending live wires of pain running up your arm
&gt;You can feel her claws burrowing their way into your skin
&gt;You flinch
“Jesse, relax. You’re hurting me,” you say
&gt;Like a bear trap springing open, she releases her vise grip on you
&gt;”S-Sorry,” she says. “Just a nervous habit.”
“You’re fine,” you say, rubbing your arm
&gt;She actually managed to leave impressions in your skin
&gt;You guess that she was a few more seconds from drawing blood
“Think of a solution?”
&gt;She nods earnestly, ears springing up
&gt;She points towards a cornfield just a few feet away
&gt;Its green stalks are nearly twice your height, and dense as well
&gt;They sway in the blue dusk pulled by the gentle wind
&gt;You flatten your tone
“Got any better ideas?”
&gt;”What’s wrong with hiding out in the corn fields? I know my way ‘round. There’s a country road nobody uses just on the other side of this field.” 
“And then what, just live off corn?”
&gt;”We jus’ lay low for awhile, that’s all I’m saying.”
&gt;It’s not ideal, of course, but it beats getting stabbed
&gt;Or shot

&gt;Summer brings spiced winds, even at night
&gt;You glance about you, drinking in the length of the corn stalks, the rolling hills, the empty road, the stars pinholing the night sky like a scattering of winking diamonds
&gt;Your trip through the corn fields was short-lived and left you with bugs all over your skin, so you’re glad to be out in the open, secluded by the waving shoots of corn
&gt;It’s just you, Jesse, and the light of the silver moon to keep you chattering as the two of you trek down this dusty country road
&gt;”Getting tired college boy?” Jesse swings her head over her shoulders
&gt;You’re starting to lag behind, the weight of your bag and camera gear holding you down
&gt;She gives you a toothy smirk
&gt;”Us heelers, we don’t get tired. We just run all day and all night, like a truck on the highway.”
&gt;You jog up behind her, sweat pinning your shirt to your back
”Even an engine has to stop for gas sometime,” you wheeze
&gt;That’s enough to get her to slow her roll
&gt;”Well, you got a point there. Ya know,” she says with a slight pause, “my house is just a few more miles down the road-“
“MILES?” You say, though you’re too winded to make more than a gasping sound
&gt;”What’s wrong?” Need a drink? Some food?”
&gt;Maybe you do. The last thing you had to drink was that shitty coffee. You’re running on empty
&gt;The heeler pauses, narrows her eyes, and glances around
&gt;”I think I know where we are,” she says, surveying the cornfield. “’Least, I think so.”
“Oh, well that’s reassuring.”
&gt;”Don’t you get all dispargin’ on me now, we got plenty of road to go. But you’re right — I’m starting to get some cotton mouth myself. And if I’m correct, there should be a water spigot ‘round here.”
&gt;How in the hell can she tell? It’s corn as far as you can see
&gt;”I think it’s… right over here.”
&gt;She weaves her fingers into yours, and before you even have a chance to protest, you’re practically slung through the field
&gt;She’s a good few paces ahead of you, dragging you behind her like a child drags a toy behind her
“Hey, hold on for a fucking second!” You protest
&gt;Her laughter booms throughout the cornfields. A handful of crows wing off into the sky
&gt;Honestly, you have no fucking idea where you’re going. You can’t see anything ahead of you except her backside and… well… corn
&gt;She must have not heard you, but you’re too tired to fight
&gt;You let Jesse tug you through the veritable forest of corn, until you come to a clearing — a crop circle of some kind
&gt;And at the center of it all is a small shed, which is buzzing with noise — probably an engine of some kind to pump water around the filed
&gt;Attached to the edge of the shed is life itself: a small faucet
&gt;Jesse’s eyes lock on almost instantly
&gt;”See, didn’t I tell you? Spigot. Right there.”

&gt;Jesse lowers her head and uses a free hand to crank the faucet on
&gt;She laps greedily at the water as it waterfalls into the dust and dirt
&gt;And…
&gt;You whip your camera out of your bag and swing it into your hands
“Hold still,” you command, aiming down the viewfinder
&gt;You crank up the aperture to compensate for the darkness
&gt;Jesse stiffens up, water still trickling into her hungry mouth
&gt;”W-What the hell are you doing?” She says, spilling a mouthful of water
“Don’t worry about, just keep drinking.”
&gt;She giggles as you snap a few pictures…
&gt;…And then wretches and gags, spewing water out of her throat
&gt;You check the LCD screen at the back of the camera and you’ve got a few great shots of blue heeler lapping at some water, her over-sized flannel shirt slipping past her shoulders, jeans barely clinging to her thin body…
&gt;…and then you’ve got a great many shots of water geysering out of her nose, eyes pinched shut, body retching forward
&gt;Laughter explodes out of you
&gt;Fuck it, you don’t care who hears you right now
&gt;Jesse clutches the side of the shed and sputters water like an engine failing to kick over
&gt;You laugh even harder
&gt;She throws a middle finger (paw?) over her shoulders while you bust a gut
“Sounds like you’ve got a… DRINKING problem,” you say, as the audience hurls tomatoes at you for making such a shitty joke
&gt;”I can handle my liquor, this water here jus’ caught me off guard’sall”
“Alright alright, I’m just teasing.” You flip your camera around your back and approach the shed
&gt;Still coughing, Jesse steps to the side
&gt;You notice she’s managed to absolutely soak the shit out of her shirt — turning it nearly translucent
&gt;Silvered in the moonlight she looks…
&gt;Like a goddess
&gt;She wears the night so well
&gt;And, soaking wet, you can see the way it outlines her delicate curves, tracing her shape with powdered light
&gt;She’s feminine to be sure
&gt;She just stands there, perfectly slouched, leaning one arm against the shed
&gt;You finish taking a long, careful drink
&gt;But you notice she’s not looking in your direction anymore
&gt;She’s taken her hand off the shed, and instead has wrapped both arms around her shivering frame
&gt;You stand tall in the twinkling darkness and focus your gaze on her
&gt;”Jesse-“ you start
&gt;She looks at you, her blush glowing crimson in the darkness, like a spangled banner of red stars against the blackening night sky
&gt;”What!?” She barks. “I’m c-cold’s’all.”
&gt;You slacken, unsure of what to do with yourself
&gt;There’s a silence between you two Jesse trembles in the darkness, and you let the water drain out of the spigot
&gt;…
“Wanna see some pictures that I took?”
&gt;Her face lights up despite the cold
&gt;”SURE!”

&gt;You click through your camera roll, which is like a stop-motion film
&gt;First it begins on campus, last fall
&gt;Bright colors
&gt;Auburn and gold
&gt;You remember when you took this one
&gt;You were exploring campus for the first time, so it’s a series of shots of you making your way from your dank dorm room to the quad
&gt;Jesse leans in intently, the smell of wet dog radiating off of her
&gt;She’s still shivering, so you let your shoulder bump into yours
&gt;”Holy crap,” she says, as you scroll through pics of your quad
&gt;There’s people — anthros and humans all mingling with one another as easy as fish breathe water
&gt;She settles on a panorama of the quad, which is encased in red brick buildings on all sides
&gt;In the center of the shot there’s a huge oak tree
&gt;The leaves of fall drift on the autumn breeze
&gt;It’s one of your favorite shots, actually
“I took this on my first day up at uni.”
&gt;”No kidding? What was it like?”
&gt;You throw your gaze upwards and search the clear skies for an answer
“I guess… it’s kind of like constantly feeling like you have to throw up.”
&gt;”Oh, like when you’re sick. I get it.”
“Yeah. You’re entering a new stage in your life and leaving everything else behind so that you can grow and — hopefully — make some decent cash on the side. It’s scary.”
&gt;Jesse lets out a puff of air
&gt;”Not like I’d know. I was born and raised in this little town.”
“No kidding? You didn’t move out here?”
&gt;She rolls her eyes, but you get the feeling the gesture wasn’t directed at you
&gt;”Move out here from where? Another Podunk shitheap little town? Yeah. I been stuck here all my life. All I know is corn, meth, and speciesm, in that order.”
&gt;You feel… uncomfortable
&gt;What do you say?
&gt;You flick through more pictures on your camera, desperately trying to find meaning and significance in them so as to distract from the sudden somber atmosphere
&gt;They’re mostly of college life
&gt;Shots of parties you didn’t want to be at
&gt;Some work from class
&gt;A low whimper escapes Jesse
“What’s wrong?”
&gt;She hesitates
&gt;”It- It’s just… damnit,” she exhales loudly and forces her eyes upward, latching on to the full moon. “You don’t know how good you got it.”
“I know I got it good. I got it too good, actually.”
&gt;Jesse puffs a jet of air from her chest. “Whaddya mean by ‘too good’? No such thing as too good.”
“God damn right I got it too good. I’m too insulated where I’m at in life. Too comfortable to change.”
&gt;”You don’t want what we got out here, Anon. Trust me, you stay comfortable and happy in your little bubble.”
“You want to know what the bravest thing I’ve ever done is?” You say, speaking over Jesse
&gt;”Fuck someone without wrapping it?”
“It was coming out here on my own. No plan, vague goals and very little money. And now I fucked myself over.”
&gt;You barely planned things as it is, but now that you hear it out loud…
&gt;Man, it was really stupid to come out here
&gt;You turn your focus back on your camera
&gt;And out of the corner of your eye?
&gt;You see Jesse fidgeting with something
&gt;You turn your head

&gt;Jesse is halfway out of her oversized flannel
“What the hell are you doing?!” You say, but all she does is give you a curious glance before returning to fiddling with her buttons
&gt;”I’m getting cold and this shirt is wet,” she says
&gt;A shameful blush creeps over your face

&gt;”Now what were you saying? About doing something stupid?” She says, flinging her shirt out in front of her
&gt;When you look over at her again she’s only in her pair of jeans and her bra
&gt;It’s plain and dark, but stands out nicely against her gray fur
&gt;Seeing the gentle heave of her chest, you wonder why you first mistook her for a boy
&gt;Or for someone that gives a shit about social grace
&gt;She slides comfortably against the shed and into the trampled corn stalks
&gt;You can see her panting hard and heavy, thick pick tongue lopping out of her mouth and hanging between her teeth
&gt;How can someone simultaneously be hot and cold?
“I-I guess I did something stupid by coming out here… without a plan or anything. Getting myself involved in God knows what.”
&gt;”Yeah but if ya think about it, it wasn’t all that bad.” She nudges you with her shoulder. “You got to meet me. And you got some funny pictures.”
“Yeah but I only got like a handful.”
&gt;”Three good ones from what I saw.”
&gt;Shit, she’s right
&gt;You thumb through your photos again, and stop when you get to Jesse choking on water
&gt;You can see the artistic value there — it’s kind of a statement, right?
&gt;The plight of-
&gt;”Hey Anon, can I ask you a favor?”
&gt;Probably a good thing that Jesse cut off your pseudo-intellectual ravings
“Sure, what’s up?”
&gt;”C-Can you…” she points at the camera. “Can you take some more photos of me? I ain’t never had a photo taken of me before you come along.”
&gt;…
“Seriously?”
&gt;”C’mon!” She throws her hands up in the air. “You think we got photo people out here? You’re probably the only person in miles with an actual camera. C’mon, I wanna be famous,” she says
&gt;You think for a second, holding the camera at chest level
&gt;Should you really be doing this right now?
&gt;What, with being hunted down and all
&gt;For ambiguous reasons
&gt;Fuck it
“Jesse, before I do this, I have questions I need answered.”
&gt;”Questions?” She tilts her head. “What kinda questions?”
“Why?”
&gt;”Why what?”
“No, that’s my question. Why are we being hunted? Why me? What’s this all about?”
&gt;”Oh, right.” Her tone slowly deflates as her eyes lower
&gt;She digs her feet into the trampled dirt
&gt;A warm summer breeze cuts through the stalks
&gt;It lightly tosses the shag of her fur
&gt;”It’s easier when I tell it like this: you were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Thems two fucktards and their buddies and everyone they ‘work’ with? They all got their ideas mixed ‘round. They think you’re some kinda city reporter here to crack open their meth operation they run outta the diner.”
&gt;”But I’m not. I’m just a reporter. I’m,“ you clench your fists, “just a dumb fucking college kid. I’m not capable of even turning in a school project on time, let alone busting open a drug operation.”
&gt;Jesse puckers her cheeks up and launches a wad of spit across the field
&gt;”I told you, they’re too fuckin’ stupid to understand that. I’m pretty stupid myself, but these two make even me seem like I could go to college. Like you.”
“It’s not that hard,” you say, though you’re not speaking loud enough for her to hear you
“There’s only two sides in this shitheap town of ours,” she continues, “Mammals on crank and mammals makin’ it. There ain’t no room for a third.” She turns her head to face you, her eyes heavy
&gt;”That means you.”
&gt;Of course it means you
&gt;Otherwise they wouldn’t be out looking for you
“It’s so funny.” You stand up and shake your head lightly. “I remember waking up in the diner from the strangest dream. One where you and I both died. I hope it’s not prophetic.”
&gt;”How’d we bite it?” She stands up with you and stretches out her spindly arms
&gt;A yawn that morphs into a near-howl escapes her
&gt;You won’t admit it, but your eyes are drawn to her smooth and shiny coat, especially her stomach
&gt;The minute she looks over at you, you pry your eyes off her glossy coat and force them back onto the camera
&gt;You click through a number of shots of potato chips and floor tiles that Jesse obviously took while she was in the bathroom
&gt;Then one catches your eye
&gt;It’s a selfie of Jesse, the last on the roll
&gt;She’s smiling wide, her eyes are half shut, teeth polished and clean
&gt;…
&gt;You feel sick to your stomach
&gt;You can’t believe you were going to ditch her back there in the bathroom
&gt;After she stuck out her neck (literally) for you
&gt;Are you really scum, and she is the perfect center of the universe?
&gt;No
&gt;She has to be getting something out of this
&gt;But what?
&gt;You open your mouth to ask, but catch yourself
&gt;Her eyes are sparkling as you wield your camera about 
&gt;It’s not love, or affection
&gt;You look down at your screen
&gt;And it’s on that photo you took, of Jesse’s body, of Bill and Shane
&gt;You clench your teeth
&gt;That look is blind loyalty
&gt;She has a reason, but maybe she doesn’t know it yet
&gt;”So? In that dream of yours?” She begins
&gt;You step out into the middle of the field
&gt;You aim the camera at her, a lump swelling in your throat
“Ready?” You say, silently thanking the moon above
&gt;Everything has a bone-white glow
&gt;She strikes a quick pose
&gt;”Ya never answered me,” she adds with a giggle
&gt;You focus your lens on her
&gt;She splays herself out against the shed in a faux dramatic pose
&gt;Tonight you bury that picture
&gt;It was just a dream
&gt;All it was
&gt;”How’d we die?”
&gt;Just a dream
&gt;But you still see her dead in a heap, blood leaking from her body
&gt;The look on those two predator’s faces
&gt;Some pain you cannot shake, real or not
&gt;So you tell yourself
&gt;You press the shutter</textarea>
