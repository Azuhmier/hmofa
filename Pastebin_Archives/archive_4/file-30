Whatareyoudoingtomorrow?” she shouted into your ear during a phone call</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Probably hanging out with her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”EEEE-GREAT! The new Rumble Mates comes out tomorrow, and I want to do the co-op campaign with you! It’s my favorite series!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Guess you better get an early night’s sleep</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Marsu’s ready to play the moment you arrive at her place</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She had raced over to the game store the second it opened to pick up her reservation, knowing you probably wouldn’t be so eager to join her so early</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Hey”, she says breathlessly as you make your way to her “battle station”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You do a double take when you first see her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s wearing a pretty small hooded sweatshirt and loose shorts, but her gut is bulging out obscenely</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It takes a moment for you to notice she’s just using her pouch to carry all the snacks and drinks she isn’t able to carry in her arms</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She unloads everything next to the couch and hands you your controller</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It basically is “your” controller, because even though she bought it herself she got it just for you to use</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”A little something for my number one ‘player two’!” Marsu said with a smile when she handed you the package</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;[RUMBLE MATES]!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Marsu is bouncing in her seat anxiously</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t know too much about Rumble Mates, but true to her word it definitely looks like the kangaroo’s favorite series</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It dominates the motif of the room, with more posters and figurines than any other two games combined</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’ll be Chrome Wolf, and you can be Knight Lion,” she says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’ve long since learned to let Marsu call the shots when it comes to playing with her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You each take your respective heroine and the game starts to load</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s hard to tell if the loud humming is coming from the console or her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The characters jump onto the screen and Marsu squeals in anticipation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s a pretty bog-standard beat ‘em up, though Rumble Mates has always been known for being difficult</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Very difficult</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Marsu tries explaining all the advanced moves she knows from the series in rapid secession</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”...And if you have baddies in the 180-degree arc behind you BUT we’re both facing each other with enough Energy for at least a first level Super Stunt...”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You never get to apply this knowledge since she cleans up all the bad guys on the screen before you can hit anything</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your skill slowly improves, but you still get the impression Marsu has to carry you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She scowls when you do something fatal for both characters</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And when your Lion Knight is the only one left you can see her look at your controller longingly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask if maybe she’d be better off doing the solo mode while you just watch her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”What? No! The heart of Rumble Mates is in the co-op!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her long ears fold back in shame</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’m sorry, Anon. I didn’t mean to be so pushy. Please, you’ll get better!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, at least she’s not yanking the controller out of your hands yet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Marsu calms down a bit, and the lower tension actually makes things go smoother</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you get into a steady rhythm, overcoming the game’s increasingly harder challenges</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You scarf down food during cutscenes or loading times, building a small pile of bags and wrappers on the carpet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bathroom breaks only come when a major chapter is over</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have to time your trips with Marsu’s, though, since she is too absorbed in the game to care much about her own bladder, let alone yours.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a few hours you hear a loud chirping noise coming from the kangaroo’s phone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She glances at it with a whine, but continues playing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Must not be that important of a call?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”No, it’s...I’ll explain in a sec.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It takes a little longer than “a sec” to beat the next key boss battle, but when it’s over Marsu puts down her controller</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Do you want to come with me for a quick walk?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re a little surprised by her sudden lack of attention for the game</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But as you stretch your stiff muscles the chance for a walk sounds wonderful</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The walk is more like a brisk jog (or hop), so it seems that Marsu’s definitely eager to play the game some more</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Honestly you’re amazed she didn’t want to just power through the whole thing in one sitting</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”They say you should take a break after every hour of play,” she says as if reciting a script</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The kangaroo sighs heavily</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”A few years ago I had to go to the emergency room because I passed out from exhaustion after playing a day straight. My parents threatened to take everything away from me unless I promised to take frequent breaks. I still probably don’t get nearly enough exercise...”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a few minutes, she slows down her pace a bit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You know, I always feel obligated to take these walks, but...it’s kind of nice to have you with me, Anon.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel the same way with her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Seems you’re also making some headway in getting her to open up more</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Marsu looks to her pouch and fishes around in it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pulls out a granola bar in shock</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”O-oh, that’s embarrassing,” she says sheepishly, thrusting the snack into her sweatshirt pocket. “I thought I cleaned everything out.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You suppose it’s natural for even anthros to feel self-conscious about their own biological quirks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Must be pretty nice to have a pouch like that, though</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Yeah, it’s super useful. I mean, when you’re not needing it to hold little joeys or anything.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you circle back around and start heading toward her place again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Heh, you know how some humans and anthros stretch their ears out? There are kangaroos who do that to their pouches. Pretty crazy, huh?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She tugs at her own as though she were snapping a waistband</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You could fit a grown adult in there like that. Imagine if I could carry you around on walks, or wrap you up like a blanket.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Marsu stumbles over at her own words</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I-I mean, not YOU specifically, but just...hypothetically, you know? H-ha ha…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She goes quiet for the rest of the walk</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Marsu is back on the couch with a single bound</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Getting some fresh air certainly helped clear your mind from stress</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It also made you aware of the funk from sweat and food litter everywhere</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The kangaroo probably has a tolerance to this kind of thing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The game continues getting more difficult, but once you learn each other’s strengths you get into a synchronous groove</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It also means you start messing with each other a little more</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Hey!

        <textarea class="textarea">Gamer-oo [Kangaroo; Gaming, Shyness]: The best way to a kangaroo&#039;s heart is through her gaming console, as one Anon has to learn to get her to open up more.

&gt;You may like video games, but it’s nothing compared to Marsu’s obsession
&gt;The red kangaroo’s apartment is wall-to-wall game cases, boxes, and memorabilia, with some impressively rare findings
&gt;She’s not just a collector, but also pretty good at them to boot
&gt;Growing up with several brothers meant she always had someone to play with
&gt;But as she got older and moved out she began to isolate herself
&gt;You’ve always been good friends, so when one of her brothers asked you to get her to be more social you knew you couldn’t leave her all alone
&gt;Of course, this meant getting through to her using the thing she loves most
&gt;You’ve gone to spectate at local competitions for her
&gt;You’ve waited in lines for midnight releases with her
&gt;You’re always her go-to partner for multiplayer games
&gt;At first you were a little worried she was just seeing you as a training target or a body to hold her spot in lines
&gt;After a while you started to think she might actually enjoy your company
&gt;”Anon! Whatareyoudoingtomorrow?” she shouted into your ear during a phone call
&gt;Probably hanging out with her
&gt;”EEEE-GREAT! The new Rumble Mates comes out tomorrow, and I want to do the co-op campaign with you! It’s my favorite series!”
&gt;Guess you better get an early night’s sleep

&gt;Marsu’s ready to play the moment you arrive at her place
&gt;She had raced over to the game store the second it opened to pick up her reservation, knowing you probably wouldn’t be so eager to join her so early
&gt;”Hey”, she says breathlessly as you make your way to her “battle station”
&gt;You do a double take when you first see her
&gt;She’s wearing a pretty small hooded sweatshirt and loose shorts, but her gut is bulging out obscenely
&gt;It takes a moment for you to notice she’s just using her pouch to carry all the snacks and drinks she isn’t able to carry in her arms
&gt;She unloads everything next to the couch and hands you your controller
&gt;It basically is “your” controller, because even though she bought it herself she got it just for you to use
&gt;”A little something for my number one ‘player two’!” Marsu said with a smile when she handed you the package
&gt;[RUMBLE MATES]!
&gt;Marsu is bouncing in her seat anxiously
&gt;You don’t know too much about Rumble Mates, but true to her word it definitely looks like the kangaroo’s favorite series
&gt;It dominates the motif of the room, with more posters and figurines than any other two games combined
&gt;”I’ll be Chrome Wolf, and you can be Knight Lion,” she says
&gt;You’ve long since learned to let Marsu call the shots when it comes to playing with her
&gt;You each take your respective heroine and the game starts to load
&gt;It’s hard to tell if the loud humming is coming from the console or her
&gt;The characters jump onto the screen and Marsu squeals in anticipation
&gt;It’s a pretty bog-standard beat ‘em up, though Rumble Mates has always been known for being difficult
&gt;Very difficult
&gt;Marsu tries explaining all the advanced moves she knows from the series in rapid secession
&gt;”...And if you have baddies in the 180-degree arc behind you BUT we’re both facing each other with enough Energy for at least a first level Super Stunt...”
&gt;You never get to apply this knowledge since she cleans up all the bad guys on the screen before you can hit anything
&gt;Your skill slowly improves, but you still get the impression Marsu has to carry you
&gt;She scowls when you do something fatal for both characters
&gt;And when your Lion Knight is the only one left you can see her look at your controller longingly
&gt;You ask if maybe she’d be better off doing the solo mode while you just watch her
&gt;”What? No! The heart of Rumble Mates is in the co-op!”
&gt;Her long ears fold back in shame
&gt;”I’m sorry, Anon. I didn’t mean to be so pushy. Please, you’ll get better!”
&gt;Well, at least she’s not yanking the controller out of your hands yet
&gt;Marsu calms down a bit, and the lower tension actually makes things go smoother
&gt;The two of you get into a steady rhythm, overcoming the game’s increasingly harder challenges
&gt;You scarf down food during cutscenes or loading times, building a small pile of bags and wrappers on the carpet
&gt;Bathroom breaks only come when a major chapter is over
&gt;You have to time your trips with Marsu’s, though, since she is too absorbed in the game to care much about her own bladder, let alone yours.
&gt;After a few hours you hear a loud chirping noise coming from the kangaroo’s phone
&gt;She glances at it with a whine, but continues playing
&gt;Must not be that important of a call?
&gt;”No, it’s...I’ll explain in a sec.”
&gt;It takes a little longer than “a sec” to beat the next key boss battle, but when it’s over Marsu puts down her controller
&gt;”Do you want to come with me for a quick walk?”
&gt;You’re a little surprised by her sudden lack of attention for the game
&gt;But as you stretch your stiff muscles the chance for a walk sounds wonderful

&gt;The walk is more like a brisk jog (or hop), so it seems that Marsu’s definitely eager to play the game some more
&gt;Honestly you’re amazed she didn’t want to just power through the whole thing in one sitting
&gt;”They say you should take a break after every hour of play,” she says as if reciting a script
&gt;The kangaroo sighs heavily
&gt;”A few years ago I had to go to the emergency room because I passed out from exhaustion after playing a day straight. My parents threatened to take everything away from me unless I promised to take frequent breaks. I still probably don’t get nearly enough exercise...”
&gt;After a few minutes, she slows down her pace a bit
&gt;”You know, I always feel obligated to take these walks, but...it’s kind of nice to have you with me, Anon.”
&gt;You feel the same way with her
&gt;Seems you’re also making some headway in getting her to open up more
&gt;Marsu looks to her pouch and fishes around in it
&gt;She pulls out a granola bar in shock
&gt;”O-oh, that’s embarrassing,” she says sheepishly, thrusting the snack into her sweatshirt pocket. “I thought I cleaned everything out.”
&gt;You suppose it’s natural for even anthros to feel self-conscious about their own biological quirks
&gt;Must be pretty nice to have a pouch like that, though
&gt;”Yeah, it’s super useful. I mean, when you’re not needing it to hold little joeys or anything.”
&gt;The two of you circle back around and start heading toward her place again
&gt;”Heh, you know how some humans and anthros stretch their ears out? There are kangaroos who do that to their pouches. Pretty crazy, huh?”
&gt;She tugs at her own as though she were snapping a waistband
&gt;”You could fit a grown adult in there like that. Imagine if I could carry you around on walks, or wrap you up like a blanket.”
&gt;Marsu stumbles over at her own words
&gt;”I-I mean, not YOU specifically, but just...hypothetically, you know? H-ha ha…”
&gt;She goes quiet for the rest of the walk

&gt;Marsu is back on the couch with a single bound
&gt;Getting some fresh air certainly helped clear your mind from stress
&gt;It also made you aware of the funk from sweat and food litter everywhere
&gt;The kangaroo probably has a tolerance to this kind of thing
&gt;The game continues getting more difficult, but once you learn each other’s strengths you get into a synchronous groove
&gt;It also means you start messing with each other a little more
&gt;”Hey! You didn’t need the health pack! You have a freaking LANCE, and I have to get up there with a claw!”
&gt;You pull the, “I don’t know how to play” card, and that sets her off even more
&gt;”No, stop! Cut it out!”
&gt;She’s too preoccupied to grab your controller, so instead she uses her feet
&gt;A large paw is shoved into your face as she tries to distract you
&gt;It works, but more from the tickle of her furry toes than from having your vision obstructed
&gt;Even when you aren’t at each other’s throats anymore, Marsu keeps her leg up on you in a trance
&gt;It can’t be that comfortable for her, right?
&gt;You almost want to take a peek now that her shorts have ridden up a bit
&gt;You know she’d sooner chastise you for taking your eyes off the game than sneaking a look at her underwear
&gt;Or lack thereof
&gt;The end is in sight, and it’s obvious you’re nearing the final boss
&gt;You try to take a swig of your drink, but Marsu’s leg drops at the worst possible moment
&gt;She knocks it out of your hand and soon your side of the couch is soaked
&gt;”Crap!” she says. “I’m so sorry!”
&gt;You look around for some napkins or towels, but she points urgently at the screen
&gt;”No time, I’ll just clean it up later!”
&gt;You still need some place to sit
&gt;The floor?
&gt;”No, wait, it’s too gross to sit down there!”
&gt;She’s not wrong; you two kind of made the floor disappear under all the junk food
&gt;”Um, uh...here, just sit here!”
&gt;The kangaroo scoots back in her seat as far as she can, leaving you some room to sit down
&gt;On her lap
&gt;Knowing Marsu, she’s dead serious about it
&gt;Whatever it takes to save the world, right?
&gt;You take your position and Marsu wraps her arms around you so she can still hold her controller, looking over your shoulder
&gt;It’s the ultimate showdown, and as much as you’re trying to focus on the boss battle you’re too aware of the senses around you
&gt;The vibration of the controllers, Marsu’s deep breathing on your neck…
&gt;Your goal extends beyond just beating the game
&gt;You want to impress her, to make her happy
&gt;When it all comes down to you to deliver the final blow, she’s leaning into your back
&gt;You can feel her heartbeat
&gt;And you don’t even realize you’ve won by the time she drops her controller and gives you a spine-crushing victory hug
&gt;”We did it!”
&gt;Marsu’s rocking you side to side
&gt;The ending credits go largely ignored, until they end unceremoniously
&gt;”So, that’s it...” she says dejectedly. “We beat the whole thing in a single day.”
&gt;You can’t see her face from the way you’re sitting, but you imagine it’s full of disappointment
&gt;”I thought it would last longer. I...really wanted it to. I was looking forward to this day for a while now.”
&gt;You try to twist your head, but there’s only so far it can go with her muzzle stopping you
&gt;”I just wanted to spend the whole day with you, Anon.”
&gt;It’s already mid afternoon, you still thought the two of you would be playing late into the night
&gt;You put one hand over her interlocking arms and the other on her sturdy thigh
&gt;That’s all the encouragement she needs to turn you around and plant her lips on yours
&gt;She’s still an awkward, nerdy ‘roo at heart, but even her inexperienced kisses are full of the same drive as any game she plays
&gt;She gives little squeaks as she digs into your mouth, but it’s endearing to listen to
&gt;The two of you pull away with a little embarrassment, but also relief
&gt;Now you know what kind of feelings she really has for you
&gt;And already you can feel the years of isolation break away
&gt;”Um, Anon.”
&gt;Marsu shifts her legs around, hanging them off the couch
&gt;”Maybe we can go for another walk? And...”
&gt;She takes your hand and slowly brings it back
&gt;To her pouch
&gt;”I know we’ve been on the couch all day, but when we can back maybe we can try something different...”
&gt;Your hand slides into her stomach fold, and then…
&gt;Hits something hard and plastic?
&gt;”Maybe we could watch a movie instead!”
&gt;You pull out the DVD case
&gt;[Rumble Mates: THE MOVIE]
&gt;Wow
&gt;What a nerd



[[ Gamer-oo Two ]]

&gt;With a little coaxing, you’ve finally managed to get your red kangaroo gamer girlfriend Marsu out of the house more often
&gt;A chance to go to new places and try new things
&gt;Predictably, she just wants to go and play games
&gt;So the two of you are heading to Buck and Blaster’s for a day of arcade fun
&gt;At the very least it has a variety of interactive and physical games to get her off her (cute) butt and be more active
&gt;It seems cruel to push her like that, but it’s also entirely her idea
&gt;She has good intentions, just not the willpower to act on them yet
&gt;She has admitted several times she needs more exercise, and you’re willing to help her out
&gt;Even if that means taking VERY small steps to get her there
&gt;The place is just as much of a bar and restaurant as it is an arcade
&gt;The beeps and chimes of the game machines mix with the rowdy merriment of the diners
&gt;This is Marsu’s element
&gt;She’s hopping on her heels in excitement as you pay for your cover fees
&gt;It’s a good thing you had a filling lunch, because it’s obvious the kangaroo isn’t going to sit and eat until she gets some entertainment in first
&gt;It’s so overwhelming she can’t even decide what to start with first
&gt;When she does, it isn’t even a game
&gt;It’s the prize counter
&gt;Hunting for the perfect trophy and making a goal to get it 
&gt;Sitting on the top shelf is a small all-in-one game console, preloaded with an assortment of classic games
&gt;Her eyes sparkle and her mouth hangs open
&gt;”That!” she squeals. “That’s what I’m working for!”
&gt;Why that?
&gt;Marsu already owns the real copies of all those included games
&gt;Multiple copies, too
&gt;”B-but…this is more compact! And it’s a collector’s item!”
&gt;Alright, whatever
&gt;It’s only...400,000 tickets!?
&gt;”I’m already almost halfway there!” she says, stifling a whine and holding up a plastic card stamped with the Buck and Blaster’s logo
&gt;You’re a little concerned how long it took her to even get “almost halfway”
&gt;”Well…if we, um, pool our tickets it’ll go faster. And we’ll share it anyway!”
&gt;It still seems like a bit of a waste
&gt;But as long as she has something to motivate her, then you’ll throw your earnings in as well to help her get it
&gt;Marsu lunges forward and pulls you into a hug
&gt;She’s acting like you already won the game system
&gt;”It’s as good as ours!” she laughs
&gt;She skips over to a reload machine and slips some money inside
&gt;The number of bills she puts in makes you even more worried now
&gt;When she returns to you she thrusts a plastic card into your chest
&gt;”Don’t lose this,” she says sternly
&gt;Yikes
&gt;Her expression softens back to her eager cheer
&gt;”What are we waiting for? Let’s go!”

&gt;Marsu drags you around the arcade as she analyzes the machines
&gt;Many of them display their current “jackpot” payouts and she’s on the prowl for the biggest winners
&gt;Unfortunately, many of the games are already filled up
&gt;The kangaroo girl makes frustrated noises as she tries to find a vacant game
&gt;”Let’s start with that one!”
&gt;It’s a simple light game; stop the lights on the right bulb to win big
&gt;The jackpot is up to a few hundred, which doesn’t seem all that impressive considering how far you have to go
&gt;”Yeah, but this will be a fast win,” Marsu says. “I’m great at these! You’ll win almost every time once you have the technique down…”
&gt;She slams the butter down, just one bulb shy of the jackpot
&gt;A few pity tickets spit out
&gt;”Just a warm-up…”
&gt;She slides her card in to pay more credits and hits the button again
&gt;And again
&gt;5 tickets
&gt;4 tickets
&gt;4 tickets
&gt;2 tickets…
&gt;Every time she tries, she gets a little angrier and a little worse
&gt;”Crap it all!” she pouts. “Why don’t you try it?”
&gt;Now you’re almost afraid what will happen if you win instead of her
&gt;”Use your fingertips, not your palm. The light is slightly behind the computer trigger, so it’s better to hit it too soon rather than too la—“
&gt;*WHOOP WHOOP WHOOP*
&gt;First try
&gt;The machine flashes wildly as the stream of tickets pours out
&gt;Ooh, she doesn’t look happy
&gt;Marsu grabs you tightly, rubbing her body against yours
&gt;A…victory hug?
&gt;”I’m taking back the good luck I accidently gave you,” she mutters
&gt;When the tickets stop coming out you grab them and begin to hastily fold them into a neat little stack
&gt;Marsu rips off a chunk from your stream
&gt;”That’s going to take forever!”
&gt;She lifts up her sweatshirt far enough for you to see her bare stomach
&gt;Then she stuffs the tickets into her pouch and gives them a pat for safekeeping
&gt;Guess she can hang onto them for the both of you
&gt;There are still more light games with some respectable jackpots, and you make your rounds harvesting them all
&gt;Marsu manages to score the big wins more often than you now
&gt;She sticks her tongue out with each victory
&gt;Wasn’t this supposed to be a joint effort?
&gt;”These are still GAMES, duh. There has to be a winner, after all!”
&gt;Good lord, this is Rumble Mates all over again
&gt;Speaking of which, Marsu eyes an arcade cabinet for her favorite game series lined up among other “legacy machines”
&gt;”Anon! How about a few quick levels?”
&gt;You have to remind the kangaroo what your mission is
&gt;These types of games don’t even give out tickets
&gt;Marsu tugs on her ears
&gt;”Ooohhh, fine.”
&gt;She looks around and another old machine catches her eye
&gt;Before you can stop her, she’s already bounding over to it in large paces
&gt;”I remember this one!” she gasps
&gt;It’s a simple whack-a-dino game
&gt;The mallet looks pretty badly damaged, and one of the dinosaur heads can’t go back down the hole all the way
&gt;”My dad was a pro at this one. He could get the high score with a slice of pizza in the other hand! Then he’d put me on top and I’d stomp on all the dinos with my feet!”
&gt;No wonder they look broken
&gt;Marsu swipes her card to load on the credits
&gt;Up pop the dinos, and down comes the mallet
&gt;Her efforts seem to be held back by some childhood nostalgia
&gt;Rather than fast, calculated motions she’s flailing around like crazy
&gt;She does a little jump each time she strikes a dino
&gt;Her total is nowhere near the high score after the last dino burrows back down
&gt;Only a short strip of tickets comes out
&gt;Marsu gives you an embarrassed look as she tucks them into her pouch
&gt;”Maybe we should find some other games to play…”

&gt;It’s hard to keep Marsu from getting sidetracked
&gt;She keeps gravitating back to the high-risk, low-payout games
&gt;Skee ball, roulette, button-tapping games…
&gt;You’re never going to get all the tickets you need at this rate
&gt;But after a while you realize something
&gt;She’s having fun, and that’s what you came here for
&gt;Getting that game system was technically HER goal, but you’ve been more focused on it than she has
&gt;You already met your own goal by getting her out of the house
&gt;”Anon, we have to try it!”
&gt;Your gaze follows where she’s pointing: a “Stompin’ Beat Beat” machine
&gt;Arrows on the floor glow invitingly
&gt;Again, no prize tickets for playing this sort of thing
&gt;But at least it’ll be good exercise
&gt;”I got in pretty good shape when I was younger playing SBB,” Marsu says, wiggling her hips
&gt;That’s one way to get fit, you guess
&gt;Marsu puts a paw on her belly
&gt;”Yeah, I...was kind of a chubby kid. Getting a workout from the arcades was easier than going to a gym. Not as many people to judge you...”
&gt;She swipes her card and the playlist scrolls by
&gt;There’s a lot of music you’ve never heard of
&gt;That’s not the case for Marsu
&gt;She oohs and ahhs with each press of the button
&gt;Finally she settles on some obscure pop group and picks her difficulty
&gt;It’s a bit higher than what you pick
&gt;You’re not even sure her difficulty is possible for a human’s anatomy
&gt;Marsu zips herself up to keep everything in her pouch from flying all around, then hops in place for the countdown
&gt;The game starts, and the screen is flooded with arrows
&gt;At least on half the screen
&gt;You can still see the background as your cluster of arrows fly upward, while Marsu’s side is completely filled
&gt;Her long legs thump furiously on the platform, hitting each arrow flawlessly
&gt;It’s a little distracting, and most of the challenge for you comes from trying to drown out her commotion
&gt;A few times you feel a gush of wind as the kangaroo’s tail whips by
&gt;You dodge out of the way just as a powerful swipe nearly takes out your legs
&gt;The music subsides and the last arrow floats off
&gt;That…could have gone better
&gt;Your failing score kicks you out of the next round while Marsu takes the center of the platform
&gt;”You did…h-hah…you did good,” she pants. “Now let me…let me show you how it’s done!”
&gt;The next round begins and the screen fills up with arrows once more
&gt;This time, Marsu’s tackling both sides at once
&gt;Dancing and grooving with expert precision
&gt;An audience starts to form around you to watch Marsu hit note after note
&gt;Your attention is focused less on the game and more on Marsu
&gt;Her thighs flex, her chest bounces around, and her tail seems to lift up whenever she has her back to you
&gt;You’re the only one not looking at the screen
&gt;Sudden applause snaps you out of the trance
&gt;The onlookers are cheering Marsu on as she wheezes for air
&gt;You manage to grab her just in time as she stumbles back against you
&gt;She squirms around in your arms, a little startled by her fall until she realizes it’s just you
&gt;She rubs her snout against your face, babbling incoherently
&gt;Might be a good time for a break…

&gt;You and your kangaroo girlfriend refuel in the restaurant side of Buck and Blaster’s
&gt;She scarfs down nachos and chugs down a really colorful, fruity drink
&gt;Marsu is a major lightweight when it comes to alcohol, and it doesn’t take her long to loosen up
&gt;She’s flicking chip crumbs and blowing straw wrappers at you
&gt;Once she expends all of her ammunition, she resorts to other antics
&gt;At first she just smiles dreamily at you as distraction
&gt;Then you feel her fuzzy toes work their way up your legs to your stomach
&gt;You grab her foot and she begins laughing as you tickle it
&gt;”N-no! S-stop!” she snorts
&gt;Anyone who doesn’t see what’s going on under the table is probably thinking the kangaroo girl has just gone crazy
&gt;When she settles down and sobers up a bit, Marsu takes out her pile of tickets and untangles them
&gt;”Seems like we still have a ways to go,” she sighs. “I guess we should probably get back out there soon...”
&gt;It’s not like you’re under a time constraint though, right?
&gt;It’s only early in the evening, and she can always just load the tickets up on her card again to hang on to for next time
&gt;Marsu looks like you just told her you’re taking all her games away for good
&gt;”B-b-but...the system! What if it’s not there the next time we come?”
&gt;With a ticket cost that steep, you doubt there’s anyone who’s going to be cashing in on it in the next few days
&gt;The two of you can always come back later in the week
&gt;Marsu fidgets in her seat
&gt;”Alright, but let’s at least make a good effort tonight, okay?”
&gt;So you and the ‘roo return to the gaming floor after clearing your tab
&gt;The bill alone is a pretty convincing incentive to not have to come back another day
&gt;The food isn’t even THAT good...
&gt;You take a lap around the arcade again to check on any machines that have their jackpots built up again
&gt;Many of the games are getting filled up with other guests again now that the evening rush has arrived
&gt;Marsu has a look on her face that you recognize from your most intense moments with Rumble Mates
&gt;It’s a determination she exhibits when she has a clear goal in her sights
&gt;The ultimate prize guarded by a boss battle she’s confidant she can beat
&gt;You suggest splitting off so you can clean up on as many machines as possible, but she clings tightly to you
&gt;There’s no separating you two tonight
&gt;You massage her shoulders while she plays, and she leans over yours when it’s your turn
&gt;Marsu stuffs every large ticket payout into her pouch while you collect the little stubs
&gt;Eventually her belly takes on a lumpy shape as the wads of tickets visible distend her pouch
&gt;You suggest that she run to the card reloader to cash in the tickets before something happens to them, but she waves you off
&gt;”No time! We’re so close!”
&gt;Looks like she’s been mentally counting every ticket you’ve earned since the beginning
&gt;What began as a goal of over 200,000 tickets has shrunk to a few thousand
&gt;Though now with all of the popular machines either occupied or completely expended, the hunt becomes even more nerve-wracking
&gt;At one point, Marsu spots a stream of tickets seemingly abandoned at one of the machines
&gt;She eyes it like it’s a legendary treasure and hops toward it
&gt;But before she can get there a little koala boy runs over and snatches them up
&gt;Marsu has fire in her eyes, and you have to grab her tail to stop her from chasing down the child and tackling him
&gt;Tensions are running a little high, apparently
&gt;Just then, an open opportunity
&gt;One of the game machines that’s been constantly occupied since you arrived clears out
&gt;You have never seen Marsu jump so far before in a single bound
&gt;She practically lands on her rump as she claims the vacant seat, patting the spot next to her for you to sit
&gt;It’s a betting game
&gt;You don’t use normal credits; you use actual tickets
&gt;Probably the worst type of game to play with the two of you being so close to your goal
&gt;She’s so desperate for that final little stretch she’s willing to risk it all
&gt;And Marsu is fully aware of the gamble she’s about to make
&gt;She keeps you away from her pouch with her leg as she fishes out a particularly long strand
&gt;”Just trust me on this one!” she growls
&gt;All you can do now is be her support
&gt;Her Player Two
&gt;Which is probably for the best, because you haven’t the slightest idea what’s going on as cards and dice and weird arcane ruins fill the already busy screen
&gt;Though what you DO understand is when she’s winning or losing, both from the appropriate graphics on the screen and from the various grunts she makes
&gt;It’s a good thing the speakers are shot, because the accompanying sounds from the game would probably just add to the anxiety
&gt;By the time you pick up on what the stakes are for each move she makes, you’re at the “big one”
&gt;And not by choice
&gt;Marsu’s haste leads her to pressing the wrong button and going all-in for one more bet
&gt;”There’s no going back now,” she croaks, knowing full well how badly she screwed up
&gt;You can’t watch this one
&gt;The inevitable disappointment is going to be too much
&gt;Her nails click on the buttons, and you hear the game sounds make their beeps and chirps
&gt;Then, all goes quiet
&gt;You’re afraid to look
&gt;You hear Marsu inhale sharply
&gt;”No...”
&gt;Oh boy...
&gt;You slowly open your eyes, expecting the worst
&gt;But Marsu is smiling broadly and pointing to the game screen
&gt;[[ YOU ARE WINNER! ]]
&gt;She did it
&gt;”I did it! Sorry, didn’t mean to make you worry!”
&gt;You almost had a heart attack because of her
&gt;She presses her snout against your cheek and gives you little kisses as the tickets come flooding out

&gt;The crowd is starting to thin out as Buck and Blaster’s goes full “bar mode”
&gt;The place starts closing up to anyone not old enough to drink, meaning a lot of the younger gamers are heading out
&gt;Kind of a shame in a way, since you already hit your goal just as the competition for getting to the best machines subsides
&gt;Whatever
&gt;Marsu takes out the massive pile of tickets from her pouch while you gather up your own pitiful number from a cup
&gt;She doesn’t even need the little stubs she entrusted to you after that last major winning
&gt;”What a night, huh?” she giggles
&gt;The two of you make your way over to the ticket counter to cash everything in
&gt;That’s when Marsu stops cold
&gt;Ahead of you is the young koala boy and what you assume to be his father
&gt;There are tears in the kid’s eyes as he looks up at the prize wall
&gt;”I’m sorry, buddy,” the father says. “It wasn’t 10,000. There was an extra zero in there...”
&gt;The koala boy is staring at a toy gun set with foam bullets
&gt;The poor kid must have seen the 100,000 ticket cost sign and though it was only a tenth of that
&gt;Neither the father nor the prize cashier looks comfortable with the crying boy on their hands
&gt;It’s enough to get Marsu to start sniffing
&gt;She looks at the mass of tickets in her arms
&gt;Before you can say anything to her, she’s already padding over to the koala and the two adults
&gt;All three of them look at her with surprise
&gt;The kangaroo girl snaps off part of the ticket mass and hands it to the boy
&gt;You don’t know how much it is, but it’s clearly enough to cover the full cost for the gun set
&gt;The koala boy looks up at Marsu like she’s a superhero
&gt;The father is speechless at first, then he clears his throat
&gt;”Miss, are you sure...?”
&gt;Marsu shrugs
&gt;”Well, he’s got them now! I got all the fun I wanted tonight anyway.”
&gt;Marsu looks back at you with a knowing smile
&gt;All in all, it really was a good night
&gt;The koala boy hugs Marsu’s legs before him and his father head out with the prize in tow
&gt;You congratulate your ‘roo girl for her generosity
&gt;Admittedly, you’re pretty proud of her
&gt;She may have her goals and her ambitions, but at least she’s learning to play games just for the enjoyment rather than to make everything about the winning
&gt;Marsu gives you a funny look
&gt;”What are you talking about?”
&gt;You ask her the same question
&gt;”We’re not done here...”
&gt;Come again?
&gt;Marsu laughs, then slides a furry paw underneath your shirt
&gt;”We’re old enough to be here, you and me,” she whispers
&gt;She rubs your back slowly and nibbles on your ear
&gt;”And the place is still open for another couple of hours. More than enough time to replace that hundred grand.”
&gt;Your stomach knots up
&gt;You might have jumped the gun in thinking she was going to head home with just the satisfaction of an altruistic deed
&gt;Marsu takes the cup of tickets from your hand and dumps them into her pouch
&gt;”Not a bad start. C’mon! If we get that system soon, maybe we can even plug it in tonight and have a few quick games before bed!”
&gt;Wonderful
&gt;Spend hours in a brightly lit arcade staring at glowing screens just so you can go home to a dimly lit living room and stare at a glowing screen for hours
&gt;It’s going to be a long night...</textarea>
