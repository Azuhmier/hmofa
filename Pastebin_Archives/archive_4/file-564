wish?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You desperately close your eyes, waiting for the end.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or at least you hope there is a end for this.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All those people...Looking... laughing... talking bad of you...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t know them, but they

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You think ignoring all of your life would change something?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to open a bit your eyes as you hear familiar

too?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Mom...Why?&quot; You said, with a almost non-existent voice.</div></li><li class="li1"><div

more...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;These figures...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some familiar figures you met on your life and others you don&#039;t even recognize.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe...these aren&#039;t your friends after all...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are facing now the puddle of your tears left on the floor.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Seeing a familiar reflection...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A Feline face, long whiskers, big tip in the ears...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A lynx?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh wait..its you!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But... with something weird.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your face...Its very different...like more tired...and grown up...For your age.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your hair, it has a more gray color now.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s basically you, but with sixty more years.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;What...I..?!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You don&#039;t get it?&quot; a calm voice on the crowd.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look up to see a figure with a white hood.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The person who said that is now walking directly to you from the crowd.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But keeping some distance from you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With tears still flowing, you narrow your eyes to see the figure.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No matter how much you tried, you couldn&#039;t see his or her face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But for the tone of voice, you could guess it&#039;s a man.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You wasted your entire life worrying about what everyone thinks of you&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Every action, every word you said, without even a reason of why...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;...You don&#039;t understand...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now, the crowd has just stopped.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Silent.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Its because of what you said now?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The silence remains for what is like years.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The hooded figure leans more close to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now that he is more close, you can see more of this &quot;thing&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;His clothes are...Like a normal boy from the school?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Normal clothes, yes.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But his head is what attracts your attention.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The only part covered with his white and angelical hood is his eyes and top of his face.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now you realize...Is that...skin?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Is he...a human?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;he is starting to giving you a warm but not devil smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So do you?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to think about this</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You know the answer, but you keep it for yourself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Instead, you return to him with a question too.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Wh..Who are you?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The figu- human walks to you, with enough proximity to even touch you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;he kneels in front of you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel a warm and slightly light coming from him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Embracing your now old fur.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You noticed your heart has stopped racing and your tears stopped flowing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ve never had this feeling from something like this in your life.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With confidence, you ask.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Are you...An angel...?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He slowly shakes his head to prove disagree.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Death?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He repeats the same action, all this conserving his smile.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...Someone who can help you...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t know what to do more at this point other than look at him, confused.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;...But not without your help...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a shiny light behind him shining brightly and the wind speeding up, he gently grabs your chin.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;His hairless paw, or more correct, his hand, runs through your chin, giving you a heavenly feel.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You now touch his hand, in a some desperate way for begging to not stop while you close your eyes to taste more of this celestial feeling.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;How long have you been without physical contact of another person? you ask yourself.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But eventually, you open your eyes to see his next action.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With his other hand, he slowly raises his hood.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Really slowly.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The shiny light behind him is becoming more intense, to the point of it almost blinding you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you still try to focus on his face, with a big of curiosity on how his eyes looks like...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m...&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Is he your hero?</div></li><li

through his window, he noticed you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He try to open a little his eyes, locked now on yours.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He throws his

class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I know mondays are awful, but not that kind of awful&quot; he said giving a little chuckle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He surely noticed your red-eyes of crying and still marks of wet fur.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You break contact with his eyes and you enter the bus up the small stairs.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Shivers ran down your spine as the first thing you see there is no one in this bus, except the driver and you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to ignore that and get a seat.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you finally get a seat and sit, you take out your phone and and headphones from your backpack.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You put your headphones on your ears and chose some comfy music to travel.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This are some of those things that make you forget about everything and feel happy.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You noticed the bus has started to move, even when you were the only one and the driver on it.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ignore it again and looks through the window next to you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Trees, fields and houses are racing away on the outside.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And now, the only thing flowing in your mind is peace.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But a sudden thought fills your mind with intrigue.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;About the dream.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;About what you said in the bathroom without realizing.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;About what your mother said.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;About that human...</div></li><li class="li1"><div

idea.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And if you don&#039;t wake up, the driver surely would do.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You readjust yourself in your seat to be more comfortable and let your headphones still playing the music in your ears.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And now, you let your eyelids finally win this battle.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Staring at the void inside your eyes, you find peace.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Floating in the darkness.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Still flying in the dark place and with your eyes closed, you feel a sensation on your left cheek.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like a really smooth hairless

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|Description about the story|
You get in the role of &quot;Kitty&quot;, a shy antisocial female anthro lynx who is depressed in life and have low self esteem, but one night, she dreams about someone who wants to make her realize that the future can be change to one more pleasant, but all miracles requires sacrifice and it&#039;s not gonna be so easy for her.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|Note from the Author|
Expect a lot of errors of grammar in this story, my english it&#039;s not my first language, sorry.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;...

&gt;Silent.
&gt;That&#039;s your favorite word.
&gt;If someone asked you to describe yourself with one word.
&gt;That would be the only correct answer for you.
&gt;Or maybe not..at all.
&gt;But right now, the echoes of the people... screech in your ears.
&gt;Your heart its channeling all the energy of this universe to not explode inside your chest.
&gt;They will not stop to scream.
&gt;You know it.
&gt;Your knees feels weak as they touch the floor.
&gt;Like your hope.
&gt;You cover your ears with your paws and look down in a pathetic way to make this less painful.

&quot;s-stop... please...&quot;

&gt;That was a whimper from you?
&gt;A wish?
&gt;You desperately close your eyes, waiting for the end.
&gt;Or at least you hope there is a end for this.
&gt;All those people...Looking... laughing... talking bad of you...
&gt;You don&#039;t know them, but they know about you.
&gt;They know you are useless.

&quot;S-ST..&quot;

&gt;You manage to say something again.
&gt;But its feels like your throat doesn&#039;t want you to waste more air.
&gt;This is what you get now, what you deserved.
&gt;You think ignoring all of your life would change something?
&gt;You try to open a bit your eyes as you hear familiar voices.
&gt;I-It&#039;s that your mother?

&quot;M..Mom?&quot;

&gt;Is...
&gt;Is she laughing too?

&quot;Mom...Why?&quot; You said, with a almost non-existent voice.

&gt;You expected to her to help you on every problem you will have?
&gt;How big can your innocence get?
&gt;Tears are now flowing on your cheeks.
&gt;The crowd around you is growing more...and more...
&gt;These figures...
&gt;Some familiar figures you met on your life and others you don&#039;t even recognize.
&gt;Maybe...these aren&#039;t your friends after all...
&gt;You are facing now the puddle of your tears left on the floor.
&gt;Seeing a familiar reflection...
&gt;A Feline face, long whiskers, big tip in the ears...
&gt;A lynx?
&gt;Oh wait..its you!
&gt;But... with something weird.
&gt;Your face...Its very different...like more tired...and grown up...For your age.
&gt;Your hair, it has a more gray color now.
&gt;It&#039;s basically you, but with sixty more years.

&quot;What...I..?!&quot;

&gt;&quot;You don&#039;t get it?&quot; a calm voice on the crowd.
&gt;You look up to see a figure with a white hood.
&gt;The person who said that is now walking directly to you from the crowd.
&gt;But keeping some distance from you.
&gt;With tears still flowing, you narrow your eyes to see the figure.
&gt;No matter how much you tried, you couldn&#039;t see his or her face.
&gt;But for the tone of voice, you could guess it&#039;s a man.
&gt;&quot;You wasted your entire life worrying about what everyone thinks of you&quot;
&gt;&quot;Every action, every word you said, without even a reason of why...&quot;

&quot;...You don&#039;t understand...&quot;

&gt;Now, the crowd has just stopped.
&gt;Silent.
&gt;Its because of what you said now?
&gt;The silence remains for what is like years.
&gt;The hooded figure leans more close to you.
&gt;Now that he is more close, you can see more of this &quot;thing&quot;
&gt;His clothes are...Like a normal boy from the school?
&gt;Normal clothes, yes.
&gt;But his head is what attracts your attention.
&gt;The only part covered with his white and angelical hood is his eyes and top of his face.
&gt;Now you realize...Is that...skin?
&gt;Is he...a human?
&gt;he is starting to giving you a warm but not devil smile.
&gt;&quot;So do you?&quot;
&gt;You try to think about this
&gt;You know the answer, but you keep it for yourself.
&gt;Instead, you return to him with a question too.

&quot;Wh..Who are you?&quot;

&gt;The figu- human walks to you, with enough proximity to even touch you.
&gt;he kneels in front of you.
&gt;You feel a warm and slightly light coming from him.
&gt;Embracing your now old fur.
&gt;You noticed your heart has stopped racing and your tears stopped flowing.
&gt;You&#039;ve never had this feeling from something like this in your life.
&gt;With confidence, you ask.

&quot;Are you...An angel...?&quot;

&gt;He slowly shakes his head to prove disagree.

&quot;Death?&quot;

&gt;He repeats the same action, all this conserving his smile.
&gt;&quot;...Someone who can help you...&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t know what to do more at this point other than look at him, confused.
&gt;&quot;...But not without your help...&quot;
&gt;With a shiny light behind him shining brightly and the wind speeding up, he gently grabs your chin.
&gt;His hairless paw, or more correct, his hand, runs through your chin, giving you a heavenly feel.
&gt;You now touch his hand, in a some desperate way for begging to not stop while you close your eyes to taste more of this celestial feeling.
&gt;How long have you been without physical contact of another person? you ask yourself.
&gt;But eventually, you open your eyes to see his next action.
&gt;With his other hand, he slowly raises his hood.
&gt;Really slowly.
&gt;The shiny light behind him is becoming more intense, to the point of it almost blinding you.
&gt;But you still try to focus on his face, with a big of curiosity on how his eyes looks like...

&gt;&quot;I&#039;m...&quot;

&gt;Is he your hero?
&gt;Your saviour?
&gt;Or your...
&gt;Oh gosh...

&gt;...
&gt;What&#039;s up with the goddamn light?
&gt;*beep* *beep* *beep* *beep*
&gt;The sound of the alarm broke your sleep like someone throwing a brick to your head.
&gt;&quot;Good morning, kitty!&quot; said your mom while opening the curtains of your room.
&gt;Even on winter, you can feel the sweat on your fur after that drea-
&gt;Wait...was all that a dream...?
&gt;You were a bit sad for not seeing the full face of that human...
&gt;And not knowing really who was him.
&gt;The person who gave you some hope for a momen-
&gt;&quot;Rough night again, right?&quot;
&gt;You were still half-sleep, so you rub your eyes and try to sit up on your bed.
&quot;Uh...no, just a bit hot here..&quot;
&gt;&quot;My god, don&#039;t worry sweetie, I&#039;m bringing the pills right n-!&quot;
&quot;Mom, I&#039;m not in that days of the month&quot;
&gt;Your mother stop running right at your door when you tell that.
&gt;&quot;Oh, well...sorry then, I&#039;m preparing breakfast, want some before school?&quot;
&gt;School?
&gt;God dammit...You forgot today the school start again.
&gt;You were about to say no, but seems your stomach woke up with you.
&quot;Sure&quot;
&gt;&quot;Alright, also, you should take a bath, you are sweating like a human after running 3km&quot;
&gt;That comment make you remember the human from that dream again.
&gt;Well, those dreams will most likely forget in 5 minutes...
&gt;Right..?

&gt;...
&gt;With a big sigh you get up from your bed and heads to the bathroom.
&gt;While you went to the bathroom, you see your mother in the living room.
&gt;You were facing her back, so she still didn&#039;t notice you was there.
&gt;She is holding and looking an object that you can&#039;t see.
&gt;And you were quiet seconds later...Until...
&quot;Mom?...You okay?&quot;
&gt;She jumps a bit in surprise and quickly put the object she was holding on the table.
&gt;&quot;Hey kitty, sorry, I got a bit...distracted...I&#039;m gonna make you now your breakfast&quot; While putting a really bad fake smile.
&quot;Mom, were yo-&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh Jesus, look at the time, you&#039;re gonna be late for school!&quot;
&quot;But I still have some hours more until the first class&quot;
&gt;Before you even realize, she was already in the kitchen and you were talking alone.
&quot;*Sigh*...Anyways...&quot; said you, almost returning your way to the bathroom.
&gt;But your eyes snapped to the object held by your mother.
&gt;Where you were standing now, you recognize a photo.
&gt;You would pass and ignore it, but...
&gt;God dammit, it touch your feline curiosity.
&gt;You lean close to this photo until you were near enough.
&gt;With a paw you grabbed it and take a good look.
&gt;It&#039;s a familiar photo.
&gt;You saw yourself.
&gt;Your mom.
&gt;And...Your father.
&gt;It&#039;s a really old photo, you were still a cub and your parents more young.
&gt;Where was this photo all this time?
&gt;Then your eyes catch the box under the table.
&gt;&quot;Old things&quot; it say with big letters on the top of the box.
&gt;Was your mother feeling nostalgic or something to bring this box here?
&gt;Surely...Your mother forgot to put the photo back to the box because of her little &quot;panic&quot; when you surprised her.
&gt;So you try to put it back to the box, not before you look at it one last time.
&gt;On your right, was your mother, standing there and with a paw on your head.
&gt;And on the middle, was you with a big smile, almost laughing, like if some invisible person was tickling you.
&gt;You focus on the figure of your left, your father, who were behind you with a big smile as yours.
&gt;...
&gt;You sometimes think he had more balls than you on do it...
&gt;Now you regret to saw this photo again.
&gt;But you know what some people say.
&gt;The curiosity killed the cat.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Update 2-
 
&gt;You put the old photo and the box where it belongs and heads to the bathroom.
&gt;Ugh, with some luck, the rest of the day should be a bit better...
&gt;With the glorious sound of the door indicating you closed it, you waste no time on throwing your clothes out.
&gt;Black tank top out? Check.
&gt;Black panties out? Check.
&gt;Become a furball? Checked too!
&gt;And now you would seriously kill anyone who says that every cat hates water.
&gt;Slowly you enter in the bath.
&gt;After going inside, you let the water embrace all your fur.
&gt;This is one of the best sensations you love...after...
&gt;...You know...
&gt;You close your eyes to taste this even more.
&gt;And clear your mind from everything.
 
&quot;Mmmmmh&quot;
 
&gt;...
 
&quot;...Someone who can help you...&quot;
 
&gt;HOLY FUCK.
&gt;With a big gasp, you quickly open your eyes.
&gt;Paw on chest, you can feel how fast its your heart beating right now.
&gt;How the hell those words escaped from your lips without you realizing?
&gt;You stay in shock for minutes before you heard the voice of your mother from the kitchen.
&gt;&quot;Kittyyyyyyyyy, are you still alive?! Your breakfast its going to get cold!&quot;
&gt;You snapped to reality and give her a response.
 
&quot;Yes mom, just give me some more minutes!&quot;
 
&gt;You know that&#039;s not the best answer.
&gt;Its a pain in the ass to dry all the fucking fur on your body.
&gt;Gosh, you sometime wish to be a human for thi-
 
&quot;Human...&quot;
 
&gt;&quot;Okay! but if you don&#039;t see your breakfast on your plate, it&#039;s not my fault!&quot; you heard her laughing a bit.
 
&gt;You are going to kill your mom one of these days...
&gt;...
&gt;After the bath, you put a foot out and feels the cold in the air.
&gt;Geez, you&#039;re shaking like a mouse after seeing you.
&gt;Where are the god damn towels?
&gt;Ah, there they are!
&gt;Now comes one of the worst part of the day.
&gt;Drying yourself
&gt;Seriously, you never will get used to this.
&gt;Facing the mirror and dryer in hand, you start.
&gt;Wasting like half an hour with this shit you decide its enough.
&gt;You went to your room searching for some clothes.
&gt;Still wearing the towel on your body and hair, you try to find something warm to wear.
&gt;It was winter after all.
&gt;But not something heavy, you don&#039;t want to suffocate yourself in middle of the school.
 
&quot;Hm...Maybe something like this...or this...or...&quot;
&quot;Uh...?!&quot;
 
&gt;A sharp sound catch your ears.
&gt;You get out your head of the closet and try to find the source of that sound.
&gt;After a half-second you find it, it was your computer.
&gt;Looks like you left it on last night.
&gt;Great, your mother will make you pay the rent of this house if she come and see this.
&gt;&gt;Before putting something on your dried fur, you went to your computer and try to set it off.
&gt;You turn on the screen to find you left the page /hmofa/ in Furchan still without closing.
&gt;Oh well...lets just close i-
&gt;You have the auto-update activated and saw more posts on the thread.
&gt;Two more greentexts to read now.
&gt;Fucking great...I will read it later after scho-
&gt;You keep scrolling down and see forty more images about Hmofa (Human Male x Female Anthro) porn.
&gt;A familiar feeling a little down of your belly is starting to tell you to do something.
&gt;Something...d-dirty?
&gt;Your face is burning up from blush.
 
&quot;M-maybe...If I do this q-quickly...&quot;
 
&gt;NO!
&gt;Stop fucking thinking with your clit, you pervert bitch.
&gt;You have to get dressed.
&gt;You have to eat your breakfast.
&gt;AND YOU have to go to school.
&gt;NOW.
&gt;...
&gt;After closing the page and turning off your computer, you went to the closet to get some clothes.
&gt;When you finally decided on what you want to wear, you dress up with something almost &quot;normal&quot; and not &quot;heavy&quot;.
&gt;You don&#039;t like to attract bad attention from people.
&gt;And a scarf of course, not even your fur can protect you from this winter.
&gt;That&#039;s what your grandmother said a lot of times before she died of hypothermia last year in the mountains.
&gt;Great...kitty, you have now made yourself a little sad.
&gt;Welp, time for breakfast.
 
&gt;...
&gt;Entering the kitchen, you saw your mom with her bowl of cereals already empty and watching TV.
&gt;She then puts her gaze on you.
&gt;&quot;Some more minutes, uh?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah...Just happen to had..Some problems..Sorry...&quot;
 
&gt;She looks at you with a face of regret.
&gt;&quot;Oh sweetie...why do you apologize like that? you go through this every morning&quot;
&quot;Yes, but this morning was a bit different&quot; You said while sitting on the chair in front of her.
&gt;&quot;You know, I can give you if you want some of those pills of depr-&quot;
&gt;Again with the pills...
&gt;*Sigh*
 
&quot;Mom I&#039;m fine, just give me the breakfast, I have to take the bus and I don&#039;t have so much time now&quot;.
 
&gt;She worries a lot for you...But sometimes its too much.
&gt;&quot;Okay, just to be sure you are always fine!&quot;.
&gt;She give you the plate of toasts and orange juice while she snuggled her snout with yours.
&gt;Her long whiskers colliding on your face, giving you a good laugh.
&gt;She did that a lot when you were a cub.
 
&quot;Muum, staaph haha&quot;
 
&gt;Guess it&#039;s tradition...
&gt;She is sitting now on the chair in front of you.
&gt;&quot;So....&quot;
&gt;You talked with her like five minutes about future and shit until...
&gt;&quot;hahaha, yeah! and she was like-...&quot;
 
&quot;Hey mom...&quot;
 
&gt;You cut her words.
&quot;I wanted... to talk something about the thing that happened to us in the living room&quot;
&gt;She then looks down, deleting her smile a bit.
&gt;&quot;I knew you would ask about that, swettie...Its just...&quot;
&quot;Mom, I&#039;m not a little cub now, you don&#039;t have to worry about telling me those things...just let it out&quot;
&gt;&quot;I knooow...but I was cleaning the room until I stepped on that box and...&quot;
&gt;...
&gt;An uncomfortable silence fills the kitchen for some seconds.
 
&quot;I miss him so much as w-&quot;
 
&gt;Your mother get up from her chair with a weird smile like almost about to scream and hits the table.
&gt;&quot;LET&#039;SNOTBEDEPRESSEDTODAYANDLET&#039;STALKABOUTHAPPYTHINGS!&quot;
&gt;wtf did she sai-
&gt;She then sit again and says...
&gt;&quot;How many new friends are you going to meet in the school today?&quot;
&quot;Well...I didn&#039;t have really planned to me-&quot;
&gt;&quot;And what about a handsome boyfriend?!&quot;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Update 3-
 
&quot;A....boyfriend?&quot; You repeat those words to yourself.
 
&gt;Is she joking again?
&gt;&quot;Yeah, just think in that! someone who you can always talk...&quot;
 
&quot;Mom I...&quot;
 
&gt;&quot;walking in the park...playing videogames...&quot;
 
&quot;Mom...&quot; She cut your words again.
 
&gt;&quot;Watching together those &quot;chinese cartoons&quot; you see on your computer...&quot;
 
&quot;Are you even lisening to m-?&quot; You try to raise your voice, but she keep talking.
 
&gt;&quot;And even do that kind of...Uh &quot;love&quot; stuff...! As long as you use the condo-&quot;
 
&gt;Enough
&gt;You stand up from your chair and you are now who hits the table&quot;.
 
&quot;For the love of god, can you listen to me for just one second?!&quot;.
 
&gt;You swear your neighbours heard you.
&gt;She dropped her ears a bit and stare at you without saying any word.
&gt;I guess it&#039;s time to tell her the &quot;truth&quot; again.
 
&quot;You know...I can&#039;t...&quot;
 
&gt;&quot;What?!&quot; She replies Instantly.
 
&quot;What I said&quot;
 
&gt;&quot;Not with that attitude&quot;
&gt;You frown.
 
&quot;Excuse me?&quot;
 
&gt;She then get up from her chair and stand in front of you with crossed arms.
&gt;Staring at you with her old and intimidating eyes of a mother.
&gt;Here we go again.
&gt;&quot;Tell me what you can&#039;t&quot;.
 
&quot;Do I have to tell you again why?&quot;.
 
&gt;&quot;Yes&quot;.
 
&quot;...You don&#039;t understand...&quot;.
 
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s all you are going to say? That&#039;s not a excuse&quot; she stay calmly, but not breaking in any moment contact with your eyes.
&gt;You should have kept your mouth shut, but you know this will be even worse if you do that now.
&gt;The kitchen it&#039;s filled by a uncomfortable feel that is hard to breathe.
&gt;You are now obliged to give her a response.
 
&quot;Just... look at me Mom, who the hell would like a weird cat like me...&quot;
&gt;She stopped crossing her arms, now putting her paws on hips.
&quot;I can&#039;t even talk to other person without staying nervous or making something weird for a minute and...&quot;
&gt;She is closing her right fist now with fury, while you keep talking.
&quot;And...I don&#039;t even have something special to share...I am...&quot;
&gt;You can see now her fangs and the feeling of anger on her face.
&quot;I am...boring...to talk, to do anything...&quot;
&gt;You know if you keep talking and throwing those things to yourself, she would try to shut your mouth.
&gt;Or even slap you.
&gt;But you don&#039;t care, you want to let it all out.
&gt;To let her know that life has been a bitch to you.
 
&quot;...And eventually, everyone gets tired of me, and so will you t-...!&quot;
 
&gt;As if time is moving slowly, you see her open paw approaching to your face with strength.
&gt;You don&#039;t even try to dodge it.
&gt;You just close your eyes, let it happen.
 
&gt;...
 
&gt;Uh?
&gt;What is this feeling?
&gt;Like...someone stroking your cheek?
&gt;The feeling of fingers flowing gently between your long whiskers makes you confused.
&gt;Didn&#039;t she...?
&gt;You open your eyes slowly, trying to understand what happened.
&gt;The first thing you see, it&#039;s your mother being very close to your face, you can even feel her breath.
&gt;The second one is...a smile...not like a normal one...
&gt;A smile filled with love, and some tears coming from her eyes.
&gt;Where went all her fury...?
&gt;You and your mother stayed like this for some more seconds, until she breaks the silent.
 
&gt;&quot;Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind&quot;
 
&gt;These words echoes on the kitchen.
&gt;And with a single tear crossing now your cheeck, she continue.
 
&gt;&quot;And someone can find love in this cold and hard stone that you call...heart&quot; She put a paw in your chest while the other was now on your furry chin.
 
&gt;&quot;...But not without your help...&quot;
 
&quot;Mom you...wait, what?&quot;
 
&gt;This...I already lived this...?
&gt;A flashback from that dream hits your head like a bullet.
&gt;You were shocked for two seconds, until you came back to your mother, still with her face close and tears in her eyes.
&gt;Before you can say something, she gave you a hug.
&gt;A strong hug.
&gt;Your face now on her chest.
&gt;While embracing the warm hug from your mother, you were almost to say her about the dream.
&gt;But you bite your lips and say nothing.
&gt;Maybe it&#039;s not the moment now.
 
&gt;&quot;And... I would never get tired of the best gift that life could make me...&quot;
 
&gt;You&#039;re not a crybaby, but....
&gt;Still deep in her chest, you burst out in tears, while she keep stroking your head.
 
&quot;M-Mom...I..I love you&quot; You hear your own voice under sobs.
 
&gt;&quot;I love you too, my kitty, my life...&quot;
 
*Ring* *Ring* *Ring* *Ring*
&gt;You both heard the alarm from your phone, indicating it&#039;s time to leave.
&gt;&quot;I guess is time to start a new day now, kitty&quot;
&gt;It&#039;s hard, but you let your mother go.
&gt;You nods to her.
&gt;Heading to your room once more, you get your backpack and phone and went to the main door of the house.
&gt;Before touching the knob of the door, you feel a paw on your shoulder, stopping you.
&gt;You turn around and see your mother with a handkerchief in hand.
 
&gt;&quot;So you are going to leave without saying something?&quot;.
 
&quot;Uh...Well...&quot;.
 
&gt;&quot;Ah, youngers...&quot;.
&gt;She then use the handkerchief to clean a bit your wet fur of your cheeks and your eyes.
&gt;&quot;I hope you didn&#039;t think to start school with those red-eyes, right?&quot;.
 
&quot;I was going use a towel, but I forgot it and had to rush a bit if I want to catch the bus on time&quot;.
&gt;When you think she has finished to clean your face, she put one paw on each side of your face and says.
&gt;&quot;I think you are ready now to blow up this day, have you checked you have everything?&quot;.
&quot;Yes mom, don&#039;t worry...&quot;.
&gt;&quot;You suuuure? I think you forgot something&quot;.
&quot;My lunch? Books? Phone? My way of lif-?
&gt;&quot;Nuu uh&quot; She responds with a silly voice.
 
&quot;Then what? You ask with a high curiosity.
 
&gt;With her paws still on your face, she stretch it.
&gt;&quot;A big smile!&quot;
&gt;Uh...
&gt;While she keep stretching your face, you rolls your eyes and sigh.
 
&quot;Mom, I have to go...&quot;.
 
&gt;&quot;Hey, I at least tried...I&#039;m not gonna make you wait more sweetie, go&quot;.
&gt;You return to the door and grab the knob to open it.
&gt;&quot;And one more thing...&quot;.
&gt;You stop without looking back.
&gt;I know you do not like me to mention this, but I had put in your backpack some of &quot;those&quot;...uh...you know...just in case...if something goes wrong..and...&quot; She looks a bit nervous saying this.
&gt;Oh, she means the...&quot;
&gt;You hope you don&#039;t have to use it.
 
&quot;Relax, I have more control of that now&quot;.
 
&gt;You wish that would be true.
&gt;You turn back to give her a huge smile.
&gt;Now going back with your way.
 
&gt;&quot;Have a good day, swettie!&quot; She said and waving her paw.
 
&gt;When you are out of your house, the first thing you do is giving a big and large deep breath.
&gt;Letting all the bad inside you out and breathing fresh air.
&gt;But even with that, you feel there is something that still bother you and you still don&#039;t know what is and why.
&gt;Anyways.
&gt;You look around to see a very sunny day and not even a cloud in sight.
&gt;You are very grateful now to feel some sunlight on your fur after your &quot;rough&quot; breakfast.
&gt;There are some other young fur people with backpacks too.
&gt;Looks like they are starting school like you.
 
&quot;Time to go&quot;
 
&gt;You don&#039;t waste more time and heads to the nearest bus.
&gt;It takes you five minutes.
&gt;Standing in front of the door as it opens, you saw the driver.
&gt;You met and knows many of the drivers who took you to school every day, but this one...
&gt;Is new.
&gt;It&#039;s a Jackal.
&gt;A very old almost entirely black Jackal.
&gt;The wrinkles and old age on his face indicate it.
&gt;You guess he&#039;s between fifty and seventy years old.
&gt;You stay outside the door for a good time, inspecting him with curiosity.
&gt;While he is smoking through his window, he noticed you.
&gt;He try to open a little his eyes, locked now on yours.
&gt;He throws his cigarette out and start to speak.
 
&gt;&quot;Woah&quot;
&gt;Fuck, he maybe spotted you watching him so much.
 
&quot;...uh?&quot;
 
&gt;&quot;I know mondays are awful, but not that kind of awful&quot; he said giving a little chuckle.
&gt;He surely noticed your red-eyes of crying and still marks of wet fur.
&gt;You break contact with his eyes and you enter the bus up the small stairs.
&gt;Shivers ran down your spine as the first thing you see there is no one in this bus, except the driver and you.
&gt;You try to ignore that and get a seat.
&gt;When you finally get a seat and sit, you take out your phone and and headphones from your backpack.
&gt;You put your headphones on your ears and chose some comfy music to travel.
&gt;This are some of those things that make you forget about everything and feel happy.
&gt;You noticed the bus has started to move, even when you were the only one and the driver on it.
&gt;You ignore it again and looks through the window next to you.
&gt;Trees, fields and houses are racing away on the outside.
&gt;And now, the only thing flowing in your mind is peace.
&gt;But a sudden thought fills your mind with intrigue.
&gt;About the dream.
&gt;About what you said in the bathroom without realizing.
&gt;About what your mother said.
&gt;About that human...
&gt;But...Maybe You are overthinking a lot those things.
&gt;And are just coincidences, that happens sometimes, right?
 
&quot;Mmmmmh...&quot;
 
&gt;Resting your head between the seat and the window, you are starting to feel very tired.
&gt;All this morning has left you with almost zero energy.
&gt;And what time you went to sleep the last night?
&gt;Great...
&gt;Your eyelids are starting to feel heavy.
&gt;Maybe...resting a bit in this peaceful bus while you arrive at school would be a good idea.
&gt;And if you don&#039;t wake up, the driver surely would do.
&gt;You readjust yourself in your seat to be more comfortable and let your headphones still playing the music in your ears.
&gt;And now, you let your eyelids finally win this battle.
&gt;Staring at the void inside your eyes, you find peace.
&gt;Floating in the darkness.
&gt;Still flying in the dark place and with your eyes closed, you feel a sensation on your left cheek.
&gt;Like a really smooth hairless paw.
&gt;Caressing you and...
 
*GASP*
 
&gt;You woke up, looking at all the directions possible inside the small bus.
&gt;Your paw touch your left cheeck where you felt that sensation.
&gt;It&#039;s...warm.
 
&gt;&quot;Hey kiddo, Something wrong?&quot;
 
&gt;You wonder for a moment where that voice come from, but you remember you wasn&#039;t alone in this bus.
&gt;The driver, still with his paws on the steering wheel, was looking at you with the mirror.
&gt;You at first have no intention of answering.
&gt;But your lips do it for you.
 
&quot;N..no...nothing, just tired&quot;
 
&gt;&quot;Just making me sure, with all the respect, you didn&#039;t have a good face when you did enter here&quot;
&gt;If he knew...
&gt;&quot;Also, name&#039;s Sibuna&quot;
&gt;Sibuna? What kind of name is that?
&gt;You try to be respectful and respond.
 
&quot;Kitty&quot;
 
&gt;He raises a brow and looks at you again on the mirror.
&gt;&quot;Uhh....Kitty?&quot;
&gt;You explained to him &quot;Kitty&quot; is the name that everyone who knows about you calls you instead of your real name.
&gt;Still focusing on driving, he asks.
 
&gt;&quot;And why is that?&quot;
&gt;You shrug your shoulders and said.
 
&quot;I don&#039;t know...and don&#039;t mind...so much...&quot;
 
&gt;&quot;Oh, and do you care to tell me your real name? I don&#039;t like to call people by weirds &quot;Nicknames&quot; hehe&quot;.
&gt;The only answer your mouth let escape...is nothing.
&gt;Is not something you like to tell...At least not right now.
&gt;He seems to notice your silence and lets out a small &quot;Oh...&quot;
&gt;&quot;I understand, maybe is something you don&#039;t like to tell to strangers&quot;.
&gt;You stare at the window next to you, wondering how much time is left to reach the school.
 
&gt;&quot;So...Kitty...How&#039;s life?&quot;
&gt;You didn&#039;t expect him to talk you again.
&gt;Why is he asking that?
 
&quot;Good...? I guess&quot;
 
&gt;&quot;Sure? Your eyes didn&#039;t said the same before&quot;.
&gt;Your body shiver a bit when you saw the jackal&#039;s eyes reflecting in the mirror next to him.
&gt;Looking at you.
&gt;Or better said, looking at your soul.
&gt;But your problems are not a topic of conversation.
&gt;Not with him.
&gt;&quot;Hell, I would consider myself like a therapist at this point...You can talk with me anything&quot;.
&gt;You&#039;ve had enough therapists in your life.
 
&quot;Sorry, I don&#039;t want to talk about it&quot;.
 
&gt;&quot;Well I&#039;m just trying to set a conversation...How do you think I have not gone crazy with this job yet?&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t have idea of what to respond to that.
&gt;Your paws felt the sensation of something vibrating.
&gt;The phone?.
&gt;Sliding your finger to unlock the screen you found a new message on PawApps.
&gt;A new contact?.
&gt;You try to read the number and the name of this person.
&gt;It have the same number as yours.
&gt;And the name is...
 
&quot;Dark...Kitty?!&quot;
 
&gt;Unintentionally you said it with a low voice.
&gt;Is this some prank or a bad joke from someone?
&gt;You were starting to get uncomfortable about this.
&gt;But you didn&#039;t read the message yet.
&gt;Your finger touch the soft screen of your phone, revealing the message.
 
---AVOID HIM---
 
&gt;The hell...?
&gt;This has to be a joke.
&gt;&quot;Kitty, you still alive in there?&quot;
&gt;Sibuna said, Trying to catch your attention again.
&gt;You redirect your eyes to him, but you feel your paws vibrating again.
&gt;More messages came from this unknown person.
 
---DON&#039;T RESPOND---
---SIBUNA IS DEVIL---
---SIBUNA IS DEATH---
---GET OUT---
 
&gt;How the...
&gt;You quickly delete this contact from your PawApps and blocked him.
&gt;Cleaning your throat, you finally answered him.
 
&quot;Yeah, yeah, just was reading...a message...from my mother&quot;
 
&gt;&quot;Aaah... Mothers, always worrying for their cubs...&quot;
&gt;You had to improvise with something.
&gt;&quot;Hey kitty, we&#039;re almost close of the school, but let me tell you a little story before we arrive&quot;
&gt;Oh great...The &quot;grandfather&quot; surely is feeling nostalgic now.
 
&quot;Okay...&quot;
 
&gt;You will not take away the illusion from this old man.
&gt;You adjust your headphones to your ears and try to look like you are interested.
&gt;And he starts.
&gt;&quot;You know...Every day, some fortunate or unfortunate person step up here, in my bus&quot;
&gt;You raised the volume.
&gt;&quot;Some youngers...Others more olders, but everyone with a big &quot;Issue&quot; flowing in their lifes&quot;
&gt;You close your eyes, in a way to keep all the sound from outside away of you, except your music.
&gt;&quot;All of them...Refused to learn with words&quot;
&gt;Wait...You are starting to realize something...
 
&gt;&quot;Instead...&quot;
 
&gt;Reopening your eyes, you felt your heart dropping to the floor, when you noticed in his mirror that his lips aren&#039;t even moving
&gt;He was talking...Inside your head?
 
&gt;&quot;...They learned with actions...&quot;
 
&gt;The bus was shaken violently by a unknown force, as if stepped on some big rock.
&gt;Your phone fly away from your hands, you tried to catch it without success.
&gt;Now dropped on the floor, broken.
&gt;You look at it for seconds and trying to understand this whole situation.
&gt;The gift from your father...
&gt;Your only way to escape from everything and everyone...
&gt;Now gone...
 
&gt;&quot;Kiddo...&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 4-

&gt;The words of Sibuna are bouncing on the walls repeatedly until it reaches your ears.

&gt;&quot;D͍͚̤̤̮̈́͌̚idn&#039;t your mother tell you it&#039;s rude to ignore when people talk to you?&quot;

&gt;With still the shock inside your mind, unintentionally you grab your broken phone and hide it in your right pocket.
&gt;Your ears go flat and you snap to reality when you heard a big &quot;boom&quot;
&gt;There are voices and horn sounds from outside.
&gt;Giving a quick glance to the window you saw something that almost made you panic.
&gt;The view of cars colliding and some people screaming fills your eyes with horror.
&gt;You stick your head against the window, trying to find out what&#039;s going on here.
&gt;The first thing you notice is...the bus was going on the opposite direction of the road, dodging every car it finds in his way.
&gt;The second...It was not going to the High school, that was clear.
&gt;Now your head is leading you to a only and proper movement to this situation.
&gt;ACT.

&quot;Hey, What the hell are you doing?!!&quot;

&gt;The jackal, still in his seat, driving without saying nothing, not even looking at you with the mirror or doing some action
&gt;Are him pretending to be deaf now?
&gt;With all the force of your lungs, you yell

&quot;HEY!&quot;

&gt;...
&gt;Nothing, but the noise of cars braking outside is all your ears catch now.
&gt;Enough of this, you thought without a doubt.
&gt;You stand up from your seat and slowly you heads to him.
&gt;While moving through the small hall to him, the fears are starting to crack your head.
&gt;Is he a convicted who steal people?
&gt;Is he armed?
&gt;Or even... a killer?
&gt;No...
&gt;For some reason, something inside it&#039;s telling you he is more than that.
&gt;Almost near of him, you call for the last time.

&quot;Sibuna...are you hearing me?&quot;

&gt;Still loking forward and driving, he grins, giving you a sharp feel on your spine.
&gt;You are still impressed how this vehicle has not had a accident yet.
&gt;Not even looking at you, he speaks.

&gt;&quot;So...Looks like I got yo̰͈̺͍̭̹ur attention now, eh?&quot;

&gt;Your blood get cold with his response.

&gt;&quot;W-what do you mean?&quot;

&gt;You see him closing the windows next to him with still one hand on the steering wheel.
&gt;Probably to keep low all the annoying sound from outside?
&gt;&quot;You suuurely know really well what I mean, little cub&quot; The old jackal said, standing up from his seat and forgetting to drive like if nothing bad would happen to this bus.
&gt;Your eyes go wide open when you see the steering wheel moving alone without any help.
&gt;Sibuna is standing in front of you, you notice now he is more taller than you, like fifty centimeters more.
&gt;&quot;Well, looks like you build a &quot;wall of music&quot; to every person that doesn&#039;t interest you, right?&quot; his voice is becoming a little bit severe.

&gt;&quot;RIGH̲̺̑ͧͪ̓͌̊T?!&quot;

&gt;A blow of wind passes through you, moving your fur and hair like if you were standing in front of a explosion, but you still keep standing on there, without moving.
&gt;Your body feel the need of scream for help, but it would surely be useless anyways.
&gt;In an instant, you are starting to make question to yourself.
&gt;What is happening now and what is this person?
&gt;Your consciousness automatically responds for you, with your heart going at hundred for hour.

&quot;...You don&#039;t understand...&quot;

&gt;He does the same, close his eyes and think in your answer.
&gt;After a few seconds, he finally looks decided.
&gt;Crossing his arms he looks at you with a smug face.
&gt;He respond to you.

&gt;&quot;That&#039;s all?&quot;

&gt;Your silence indicates it.
&gt;&quot;Fine, but I will let you know a thing, little kitty...&quot;
&gt;You frown of curiosity.
&gt;&quot;This bus is heading right now to the gas station outside the city...at one hundred kilometers per hour...&quot;
&gt;He took out from his back a pocket watch, you give it a quick glance to it and saw how really old was that thing.
&gt;&quot;And If my maths doesn&#039;t fail me, we&#039;ll be there in...more or less...five minutes&quot;
&gt;A single drop of your sweat collide with the floor when you hear his next words.

&gt;&quot;Do I have to tell you what would happen ǹ̬̰͓̣e̮͎̲̳̲͘xt͠...?&quot;

&gt;Adrenaline is rushing through your veins, you had enough of this, you don&#039;t wanted to be in this!
&gt;How the hell your life would be on the verge of finishing after a little and peaceful little nap?
&gt;With perseverance you ask him to go straight to the point.

&quot;What...do you want from me...?&quot;

&gt;He breathes deeply the uncomfortable air inside this bus and turns his back on you, while looking at the window he just has closed a few moments ago.
&gt;You fear for his answer.

&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not the man who likes to take things with brute force...&quot;
&gt;He bends over his seat and is searching for something.
&gt;&quot;And let&#039;s say my age does not help either...&quot;
&gt;After searching for a bit, he finally find a cigar box
&gt;&quot;But...&quot;
&gt;He takes out a cigarette and with the other hand takes a lighter from his pocket.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m gonna be a gentleman and give you one opportunity, kitty...&quot;
&gt;Lighting the cigarette and taking a big breath of the smoke he extends a paw to you.

&gt;&quot;Give it to me&quot;

&gt;Your eyes are concentrated in his hand while you do not know what to answer.
&gt;Maybe is he asking for...

&quot;Money?&quot;

&gt;His expression changed quickly to a one more amused.
&gt;With a weird smile he corrects you.
&quot;Oh no no, it&#039;s something more...Hmm...How can I tell you...&quot;dangerous&quot; than money&quot;
&gt;Putting a paw to scratch the back of your neck you try to think in all the things you are carrying.
&gt;The first thing coming to your mind it&#039;s your backpack, still above the seat where you sat.
&gt;Turning your head to it, you analyze what is inside of your backpack, like if you had X-ray vision.
&gt;Books, notebooks, pen case, and just school stuff.
&gt;And of course those...
&gt;...
&gt;No...It doesn&#039;t have nothing especial there, at least of what you know.
&gt;Still thinking of what this old crazy Jackal wants, he seems to be losing his patience, and now walking slowly to you.
&gt;Each step of him seems synchronized with the beats of your heart.
&gt;Think kitty...THINK! What else do you carry?
&gt;Your paws try to sneak in every pocket or hole your pants have.
&gt;You feel the bulge of something inside of your right pocket.
&gt;It was your phone, now broken and useless, for now.
&gt;He is getting close...
&gt;This hasn&#039;t to be, why he would want a broken phone?
&gt;Without you realizing it, he was already in front of you, still smoking that filthy air of a bad mark of cigarette.
&gt;Leaning a little, he approaches his face to yours.
&quot;Well?&quot;
&gt;He takes out his pocket watch and brings it to your face.

&gt;&quot;You are running out of time, kitty͍̤̝̺ͥ̃̄̈́̏&quot;

&gt;His smug face was so close to you that a good punch would have been a good answer.
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s the matter? Has the cat got your tongue?&quot;.
&gt;You&#039;re going to be honest with him.

&quot;S..Sorry, I do not have anything that interests you&quot;

&gt;Breathing heavyly, you look at the tired face of Sibuna, that does not seem satisfied with your answer.
&gt;He close his eyes and raising his face toward the ceiling, while he speaks.
&gt;Looks like he&#039;s trying to keep his patience.

&quot;I&#039;ll give you a little...help...W̷̵͜h͢o was talking to you before?&quot;

&gt;Rewinding in time, you tried to remember.
&gt;What persons talked to you on this day?
&gt;Your mother, him...and...who more...?
&gt;In that moment, you felt your right leg vibrating with force, more precise, in your pocket,  where you kept your phone now broken
&gt;But wait...that means it&#039;s not broken?
&gt;Alright kitty...don&#039;t distract yourself on this moment, think!
&gt;After a few seconds feeling your heart in the throat, you finally know the answer.

&quot;I....I..&quot;

&gt;But for some weird reason, just few words came out of you.
&gt;Before you can even say more, he explodes in fury, his smug face now gone and showing his sharp teeths.

&gt;&quot;E̎̂̉ͬͤ̇N͂̀̏̅OͭUGH OF THI̙͓͕͚S̺̻͕̘̼͓̹!&quot;

&gt;You expected the worst.
&gt;And here he comes.
&gt;Without even seeing it, he grabs your wrist hard.
&gt;You forget how it was to be in a fight, surely we all pretend how tough we are, saying what we would or wouldn’t do in such scenario.
&gt;Nobody knows what they would do, until you are there, at the point, where it’s relevant.
&gt;Your body is overheated with panic, shaking it to freedom, you tried with your other arm still free do something.
&gt;In the way of your panicking limb, you manage to hit him in the hand that held you, making him back a few steps back with pain.
&gt;You also back a few steps back with the momentum and making some space between you and him.
&gt;You look up to him and watch how he is grabbing his own wrist now, blood coming out of it.

&gt;&quot;FUCK!&quot; he shouts

&gt;Wait...how...?
&gt;You raise your left paw to your own sight, watching your own claw covered in blood.
&gt;Claws...
&gt;Your mother, since you was a cub, you were taught to not use them, either your sharp fangs, made to separate meat from bones.
&gt;In a society where it can be considered a real weapon, like a gun.
&gt;You were a animal after all, evolved since your feral ancestors, a predator even.
&gt;They were taught to survive, defend their cubs and themselves from others predators like wolves, foxes or...jackals?
&gt;You were not sure...He had a good foot on you but he was just hungry skeleton.
&gt;Overdose of adrenaline is traveling through your body like you never felt before, you were angry right now, you are not going to deny that, of course.

&gt;&quot;D́͛͗̀̓̄ͥ̌Õ̂N̎̎̓ͮ̑&#039;̇̂̃̈ͥͬ̌ͭT̎̎ͧ...don&#039;t make this more hard, kitty...I&#039;m doing a favor to everyone&quot; Still grabbing his wrist to stop the bleed, it looks like you maybe left him a deep wound.

&gt;Wanting to say something, but it’s hard to articulate with your upper lip curl around fangs.
&gt;Surprised with a unknown feel, you &quot;hiss&quot; to him like a feral feline.
&gt;A feeling you couldn’t describe, all your claws out, muscles tightened...
&gt;You are prepared to attack.
&gt;Your target.
&gt;No, better yet...
&gt;Your PREY was there, waiting for the hunter, only him in your sight and not other thing.

&gt;&quot;I guess...you don&#039;t leave me with another choice...&quot;

&gt;This is your chance to strike back, and finally stop this madness.
&gt;You run straight to him, almost in four-legs like if you were no more a person but a animal again, feeling sick just thinking on it, but it not stopped you.
&gt;Running a velocity you wouldn&#039;t believe, inside your head, the time pass slowly, thinking of why he isn&#039;t responding at any actions you are doing right now, just grabbing his injured hand, and looking at you with a poker face.

&gt;&quot;Uh?!&quot;

&gt;This feel like a trap, but your animal instinct don&#039;t care, you keep running.

&gt;&quot;STOP RIGHT THERE, YOU LITTLE SH-AH!&quot;

&gt;When your body feel it&#039;s enough close from him, he commands you to jump in direccion between his neck and chest.
&gt;You need to take your prey down before tearing him apart.
&gt;And so you do, you achieve to take him down on the floor, with you on top of his chest, seeming the advantage is on your side.
&gt;Is this how your ancestors felt? the feeling of survival? Risking your own life...?
&gt;You don&#039;t hesitate, without wasting a second, the wind of your claws try to make a way into his head.
&gt;Logically, he try to use his arms to protect his face, still receiving marking of your claws in it.
&gt;You don&#039;t have in mind of what you should do to him now, try to leave him unconscious in some way would be a good idea?
&gt;The confusion embrace your mind, still clawing and sending him all your hatred that went through your whole life, you are starting to see your results.
&gt;The fabric of his clothes in the arms are tearing apart in a disgusting trail of fresh scars and blood coming out.
&gt;Stopping now would be a option? No...
&gt;If you do that now, you may...

&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not playing... children games A̾ͩ̇̃̐ͧNYMORE͎̙̟͚̘̫ with you, kiddo!&quot;

&gt;Nani?!
&gt;Between your frenetic and uncontrolled claws, he somehow reached your neck with one paw.
&gt;With a MASSIVE force, he now brings you down on the floor, making you yelp of surprise.
&gt;How the hell a old guy like this with almost zero muscle doing this?.
&gt;You feared at the thought of don&#039;t know if this guy was a golf player or professional boxer.
&gt;Of course, that doesn&#039;t make you to stop nailing him and make him the star of a bloodfest.
&gt;But it was like he wasn&#039;t feeling pain anymore, no matter how a new wound you raise to him, appears to be null.
&gt;He gets up, still grabbing you by your neck, like if he was a child playing with a doll.
&gt;The feeling of your lungs flattening was a signal for your body to stop shaking.
&gt;Maybe your blood contains hundred of your warrior ancestors, but what did you expected from you?
&gt;Your feets wasn&#039;t even touching the floor, you were literally flying by his hand on your neck.

&gt;&quot;You know...Good little kittens learn to cut their nails&quot;

&gt;He knew you wouldn&#039;t give him a response with your throat locked by the pressure of his hand.
&gt;&quot;Look...I&#039;m going to do a favor to you...and make this less painful&quot;
&gt;Darkness is trying to take your sight off, the lack of oxygen in your lungs makes you feel like if you was leaving your body, your soul falling from it.
&gt;A unknown scream inside your mind is crying desperately to you, trying to encourage you to keep fighting.
&gt;But you has given up?
&gt;Until.
&gt;&quot;Hmmmm...&quot; it&#039;s what your ears can barely catch from his lips.
&gt;Then, a wind pass through you, like if you were moving.
&gt;You could feel yourself moving brutally by his hand.
&gt;With his unbelievable strength, he send your body flying to the bottom of the bus, the back seats could stop some part of your fall but bouncing you to the ground.
&gt;Poisoned with pain, you were enough tired to even crawl or stand up.
&gt;You deserved all this? it&#039;s your only thought.
&gt;Still lying on the floor, you tried to raise your head up with the little strength you have left to see what&#039;s coming next from this...monster.

&gt;Played college ball, ya know&quot;

&gt;He is regressing again to his seat, and then he bent up to it, looks like he is trying to search something again.
&gt;While he is still searching, he gave you a quick glance.
&gt;&quot;Hmm...Why the long face, kitty, rough morning?&quot;
&gt;You can barely feel your chest, you feared may the fall have hit you hard in one of your lungs, because it&#039;s painful to breath right now.
&gt;Without hesitation you ask.

&quot;You...What are you...?&quot;

&gt;&quot;Uh? oh well...&quot; he finally find a bag, under his driver&#039;s seat.
&gt;He open it, taking out a cigar, then lighting the cigarette and throwing back the lighter to the bag.

&gt;&quot;You should forgive me, sometimes I lose my patience with children like you&quot;

&gt;He inhales the smoke deeply with a big breath, still holding the cigar in his mouth, he it&#039;s not done yet with his bag.
&gt;Even with big distance from you to him, the light of the sun bounces on the clean and shiny revolver he pulls out.
&gt;Taking out some bullets too, he stands up while taking the cigar out of his mouth and blow the smoke through his nose.

&gt;&quot;Or should I call you...an animal?&quot;

&gt;he start walk to you at a slow pace, reloading every chamber he can in his revolver with the bullets.
&gt;You...you scream to yourself inside, trying to command your body to move, to do something.
&gt;Putting a paw to support you on the floor, you try to get up, but you can not stand more than a second on your feets and you fall kneeling on the floor.
&gt;It useless, as it refuses, you have no energy to move your body anymore, not even energy to cry.
&gt;Hugging yourself, you feel the pain increasing more inside.
&gt;The lack of oxygen invades you, believing in any second you would faint up to death.
&gt;You wish this all was only a bad dream.
&gt;He is standing like one meter in front of you, checking if every bullet in the chambers are ready.
&gt;Your heartbeats are heard when he spins the barrel and points the gun at you.
&gt;This is not fair...why would you die without even knowing the reason?
&gt;No...you have to know that.

&quot;Why...&quot;

&gt;Furrowing his brow while he puts a bit his weapon away from you, ask.
&gt;&quot;Hmm?&quot;
You repeat to him clearly.
&quot;Why...are you doing this to me&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh, was that...Well, it&#039;s hard to explain this to you, but...&quot; he then takes another breath from his cigar, still in the other hand while putting the gun away in his pocket &quot;Do you ever feel something...no...someone controlling your life?&quot;
&gt;Confused, you shake your head.
&gt;Again, you don&#039;t know what is he talking about.
&gt;&quot;Better, you shouldn&#039;t find out&quot;
&gt;That is not a valid answer for you.

&quot;And killing me...It&#039;s a solution?&quot;

&gt;Expelling all the smoke from the mouth with the smell in the air, he bends over to you a bit.
&gt;&quot;Maybe...but let me ask something to you, kitty...&quot; closing his eyes &quot;You have a family, right?&quot;
&gt;You nod to him.
&gt;&quot;And you love them?&quot;
&gt;You nod again, it&#039;s something you would never disapprove.
&gt;&quot;Then stick this in your mind, you are saving their lives doing this&quot; he extend his paw rubbing your long whiskers with his fingertips
&gt;But you abruptly slap his paw away of you.
&gt;&quot;Hey! don&#039;t be like that, I know I was a little foolish before, I should know violence brings violence after all, and we ended like this&quot;

&quot;Bullshit...it doesn&#039;t matter if...you were planning pointing me with a gun from the start&quot;

&gt;&quot;And that&#039;s why I told you to not hide what I asked for, but since looks like you don&#039;t know nothing about the problem, we took this by the hard way&quot; he stand up and returns to its position.
&gt;&quot;Enough&quot; Finishing his cigar, he throw it to the floor, stepping on it.
&gt;Taking out his shiny revolver again, points at you.
&gt;You do not even want to look, you put down your sight, closing your eyes for the inevitable.
&gt;Is this how it ends your life? witouth even a clear reason? by a crazy old jackal without telling you why?
&gt;Your arms still wrapped around you with the little force you have, you wish to see your mom again...feeling her presence again.
&gt;Hug her again...the only person who stayed all your whole life with you, protecting you, helping you, even would give her life for you.
&gt;Now...she&#039;ll even know that you will be dead? disappeared? or that you would have committed suicide...throwing away all the effort she has dedicated to you?
&gt;These thoughts cease as you heard the hammer of the gun, ready to fire.

&gt;&quot;I&#039;m really sorry, who knows, may so̝̠͒̌͊ͪ̈ͬ...someone is waiting for you in the other side&quot;

&gt;You couldn&#039;t help but shed some tears for her.
&gt;At least, you are grateful to have told your mother that you love her, at the morning...
&gt;For the last time.

*BANG!*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Update 5-

&gt;Something you couldn&#039;t believe, death, a &quot;thing&quot; no one has achieved to describe with words.
&gt;Your time has come here, it feels...scary? weird? but at the end...nothing matters anymore.
&gt;Your heart stopped to fight for your life and then, the world ended for you.
&gt;...
&gt;Or is that what you thought?
&gt;Paw in chest you feel your heart still beating with hatred, it takes time to pass away? you think.
&gt;No...He was pointing directly to your head, but how can you still be here?
&gt;You don&#039;t wanted but you remembered...nothing matters anymore.
&gt;Confedence makes you do it, you re-open your eyes once more to see the cruel world that you thought you would never see again.
&gt;It takes time your eyes to get used to the light again, and when you finally get it, the inevitable mark of something cylindrical cross your sight buried between your knees on the floor.
&gt;He...he missed the shot? Why?
&gt;You are starting to feel your body again, the pain comes to your nerves making you scream inside you.
&gt;The presence of something familiar return to you, but you don&#039;t know what it is.
&gt;And then you saw it, drops of blood that began to splash on the floor, filling the air with a disgusting metallic smell.
&gt;It wasn&#039;t yours, you were clearly sure, but calling blood at that liquid with an appearance between black and red would be correct?
&gt;Just a few seconds passed, and what was some drops now is a fresh puddle of gore.
&gt;You are confused, curious, and what makes the curiosity after all? of course...
&gt;You lift up slowly your sight, trying to understand what happened, it nulls, as the light from the windows almost blind you, so you raise your left paw to cover it a bit.

&gt;Sibuna, the old jackal who was pointing at you with a gun and shot, stand there, looking at you with a face of full of regret, eyes wide open like plates, the gun he was holding now on the floor, dropped on the pool of his...own blood?
&gt;A metallic and sharpening object sticking out from his chest, more or less where his heart should be, is the last thing you notice from him, he looks at his owns hands now, with blood coming out now from his mouth and nose.
&gt;Unwittingly, your ears flick a few times, trying to catch any sound from him, but it&#039;s weird, he does not emit any sound except heavy breaths, a normal person would freak up or even scream, but he don&#039;t, he clenches his fists with fury at once, trying to not fall.
&gt;Unexpectedly with a sound you would describe disgusting, the sharp object from his chest recedes of him.
&gt;A deadly wound arose from there, deep and big, traversing it from his back, even the light could penetrate it.
&gt;He couldn&#039;t stand up anymore, his knees touch the floor first, blood splashing everywhere and washing the seats around him in crimson.
&gt;The smile of Sibuna overflow with sadness your eyes, giving his last breath, he falls completely to the ground.
&gt;But how...?

&gt;Behind of his body, you see it, a familiar figure you thought that was just a lucid dream.
&gt;Light shines bright in his hood like a clean mirror thanks to the light outside, even making his silhouette more visible for you, you stare at him with your mouth open.
&gt;A furless face with eyes covered stand there, looking down with a neutral expression, at the corpse of what you thought it was a monster from hell.
&gt;His left pa- hand is holding a sharp object from the hilt, if you had to guess, it has to be some kind of big knife or machete.
&gt;The human appears once more, it&#039;s feels a bit intimidating seeing him in real life.
&gt;And now, the only sound are the blood drops that can be heard splashing from his blade.
&gt;Until...He raises his head and realize you was there, scared and confused.
&gt;Your body was still in shock by the immense pain from before, you can&#039;t do nothing but watch him in fear, at least you believe your sanity was almost intact after all this.
&gt;But your vision goes dark, lungs are giving all they can to hold you in life, looks like that you had your seconds counted now.
&gt;Weak steps are rarely heard in the in the background, one more strong than the last, like if something or someone is approaching to you.
&gt;Your senses were slowly fading...
&gt;...

&gt;What...What is this?
&gt;Where is this warm feeling coming from...?
&gt;You feel your body being gently wrapped, you can&#039;t see nothing, but it...feel good.
&gt;Good? No...It feels...great
&gt;A radiant strength it&#039;s starting to fill you inside, and with with the help of that, you can open your eyes again.
&gt;The human wasn&#039;t there anymore, disappeared again and...
&gt;Wait...
&gt;No... he was there, in front of you with his arm wrapped around you.
&gt;He is hugging you?
&gt;You don&#039;t remember the last time someone did that, except your mother...
&gt;Suddenly a tug of acceleration invades your body and then your lungs being filled.
&gt;You gasp with new lungs that clean old air, swallowing and cleaning your throat again.
&gt;The air around you it&#039;s intoxicated by his aura...like if it was healing you in somehow.
&gt;Or could be just the hug...
&gt;You could move your arms once more, and without resisting it, they wrapped him, making you bury your face in his chest, listening his heartbeat beating passionately.

&gt;&quot;Sorry...&quot;

&gt;&quot;You are surprised, you didn&#039;t expect him to talk...but wait.. Why is he apologizing?

&quot;Why? You...you saved me&quot;

&gt;&quot;I...I should have come sooner...&quot; He replies while scratching gently the back of your left ear.

&gt;Comfy can&#039;t be enough to describe this situation, his touches feel so smooth that makes you hold on him like a cub with a mother.
&gt;And the pain was no more...still you feel very weak to move right now.
&gt;But what do he mean with &quot;should have come sooner&quot;?
&gt;You don&#039;t know if you believe in mytological creatures, but is he...some kind of guardian angel?
&gt;Your guardian angel?

&gt;&quot;I know you must be confused right now, and you want to know what is happening...&quot;

&gt;You told him all fight and the strange &quot;request&quot; Sibuna wanted from you.
&gt;He just take out a little sigh and respond.
&gt;&quot;Hmm...I&#039;m not really sure as well, but the only thing that I know...&quot; he takes your head off his chest and grabs you by the shoulders and follow with...
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t let to anyone grab your phone, okay? Especially him, and if that happen, I&#039;m afraid I can not guarantee your safety&quot;
&gt;Your phone? what it&#039;s the matter with your phone? even now it&#039;s broken?
&gt;And why especially him? Sibuna is dead now.
&gt;So many question and not a single answer without being encrypted.

&quot;It doesn&#039;t matter anymore, it&#039;s broken&quot; You take it out from your pocket to show him what is now a piece of junk...  missing parts of the screen.

&gt;He looks at it, but with the eyes covered you don&#039;t really know what expression he is taking right now.
&gt;Suddenly a furless hand grab your paw with the phone, in that moment you feel blood rushing to your head and more appropriately to your cheeks.
&gt;I-it&#039;s a weird feeling...someone touching your paw softly a-and...
&gt;Seriously kitty stop, this is not the moment to think in that.

&gt;&quot;We&#039;ll figure out all this, alright? I promise&quot; While taking down your paw, commanding you to hide the phone

&gt;And now all seems over, it&#039;s time to get out of here.
&gt;But now you mention it...This bus is still driving?! You raise your eyes a little and saw how the steering wheel was still moving on his own.
&gt;And if Sibuna was right, you do not have much time until it reaches to the gas station and then...
&gt;...

&quot;Oh god...Human, we have to get out of here before...!&quot;

&gt;&quot;...ha...&quot;
&gt;W-what was that?
&gt;You both turn your heads abruptly to the origin of that strange voice.
&gt;&quot;...ha̲̣̺̻...hah͆ͯ̔ͮa͋͂́H͖́ͨ̑̄A͕͐H͓͚̊A̻̜̓͊ͣ&quot;
&gt;A maniacal demonic laugh travels countless time, colliding on the walls and reaching back to your ears.
&gt;It was...Sibuna?!
&gt;He is still lying on the floor, but the trails and the pool of his blood are gone, how the hell dried or disappear all that in less than a minute? That&#039;s imposibble...
&gt;&quot;...I..don&#039;t know who are you, humie...&quot; Your throat can&#039;t avoid to gasp when you saw him moving on the floor, putting a paw to raise himself a little &quot;And don&#039;t know how you got here...&quot;
&gt;The human quickly redirect your sight to him and whisper &quot;Kitty remember, hold on tight your phone and don&#039;t let him grab it, we&#039;ll be okay&quot;
&gt;Your heart race again, almost in state of panic, your words can hardly be understood.

&quot;A-and what are you going to do?!&quot;

&gt;He smile to you like the first time you saw him, a warm and radiant smile filling you with safety.
&gt;Your paws resist a bit, but letting him go, he stands up.
&gt;Meanwhile Sibuna is already on his feets again, looking very exhausted like if any moment he would fall again.
&gt;Is seriously this monster came back from...death?
&gt;And right now, your mind is filled with throughs, how is this human able to stop him? You already saw his unbelievable strength to bring you down, and the human if you has to guess, he is almost the same size and weight like you.

&gt;&quot;But whatever you are doing...YOU WILL N̘̭̜O̲T̼͉̘-&quot; Sibuna sharp teeths show his hate at his full glory.
&gt;Your eyes catch a shiny object almost next to you, the revolver...was shaking on the floor and then, it flies just directly in the hand of Sibuna.
&gt;&quot;-S̱̻̻U̫̙͎C̬̫CE̻S̞̬͖S̫̼&quot; Sibuna raises the revolver in direction to the human, but before he could even aim, the human with full of determination throws that weird machete at his hand holding the gun, making the revolver fly away with blood.

&gt;&quot;You little C̬͔̙*N̫̼̪Ṯ̯͇!&quot; He shouts with fury.

&gt;The human doesn&#039;t lost a second in be prepared again, and so he runs towards him while he was still hurt.
&gt;Something you noticed from your fight with him, it&#039;s that Sibuna is slow to reaction, and before he could even do more right now, the human leave him on the floor again with a punch in the chest, coughing blood in the act.
&gt;The sounds of &quot;sirens&quot; and the blades of a helicopter catch your ears and the human too, as he look in the nearest windows next to him, coming from outside.
&gt;A ray of hope illuminates your eyes.
&gt;Oh god yes! more help is incomi-
&gt;&quot;THIS IS THE POLICE, YOU HAVE THIRTY SECONDS TO STOP THE VEHICLE OR WE MAY OPEN FIRE!&quot;
&gt;Great... just great.

&gt;&quot;HAH̛͙͈̠̟̖AHAH͞A&quot; A loud laugh embrace the ambient again, but this time more intense that makes you to cover your ears as some windows exploded from the pressure too.
&gt;You tried to warn the human between all the mess, but only a faint sound escape from your lips.
&gt;The human was standing there, in middle of the hall, in front of sibuna.
&gt;And from nowhere, hundred if it&#039;s not of thousands of golden and black beetles were coming for him, covering and traping his legs, the human however tried to use his machete to make them stay away but without success, making him motionless and defenseless.
&gt;Sibuna take advantage to this and rushed to him, letting all his scary and more sharp claws than yours out of his paws.
&gt;The eyes of Sibuna was injected in a rotten red and black colors, looking for revenge.
&gt;Your heart shrink when you see him striking the human with his fierce claws...In one hit he reached his chest, letting blood fly from the human and leaving him a beautiful crimson scar.

&quot;Human!&quot;

&gt;I have to help him! you thought.
&gt;It&#039;s hard to move your weak body right now, you tried to stand up... It&#039;s useless as you fall miserably on the floor.
&gt;The beatles has already disappeared like smoke, but he was already in fate of Sibuna.
&gt;The human is lying on the floor, with Sibuna on top of him holding the machete and trying to buried it in his heart.
&gt;You are surprise in how the human it&#039;s resisting and making force to stop the machete from the hands of Sibuna.
&gt;But it doesn&#039;t look like he will resist for so long.

&gt;&quot;Foolish human, if you were acting like a fucking hero YOU WO̦̼̱̥ULDN̺͕͓&#039;T BE PRO̯̳̯TECṮ͚̪͚IN̾̂G HE͒͌̉͋͂̃̈R!&quot; He said to him.
&gt;You try to crawl to him, but you stopped at the first second as how your bones beg you to stop in the form of pain.
&gt;And the only thing you can do now...Is watch. Watch how Sibuna is trying to kill the human, the person who saved your life, your guardian angel.
&gt;Your guardian angel, about to die for you.
&gt;Maybe...the real monster here after all was you.
&gt;You wanted to scream, you wanted to laugh, you wanted to cry as anxiety strikes...again.
&gt;Useless, it&#039;s the word to describe you right now.

&quot;FUCK!&quot; Your fist hit the ground with torment.

&gt;Yeah...waste more the little energy you have left.
&gt;And yet again, you look down and lose all your hope.
&gt;...

&gt;&quot;OPEN FIRE, OPEN FIRE!&quot;

&gt;Between the police sirens from outside, you three heard these words, Sibuna stop for a second making force with the machete on the human, looking at the window next to him and letting out a soft &quot;Wut?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Kitty, TAKE COVER!&quot; senses are activated again as you heard the human shouting.
&gt;When Sibuna was clueless for a second, the human achieved to win the fight and pushing off the machete in the neck of the Jackal.
&gt;And with a kick to take him away while Sibuna was screaming and coughing of pain, the human found a spot, crawling under the nearest seats from him.
&gt;Your body it&#039;s inject in adrenaline once more and does the same like him, rolling under the first seat you see, raising your paws to your head and covering your big ears down.
&gt;And the inevitable happens, a iron rain of bullets fall from above of the vehicle like a storm.
&gt;Even when you couldn&#039;t see nothing from the smoke that was showing up, you close your eyes, praying to not be the prey of those bullets.
&gt;...

&gt;You wonder how many seconds have passed from the shooting of the police.
&gt;The sounds of the bullets colliding on the floor seems that it has stopped.
&gt;Is..Is it safe to leave? you asked yourself.
&gt;You open your eyes to see...nothing.
&gt;Everything is full of smoke.
&gt;This nightmare never seems to end...
&gt;You coughed several times while rising from under the seat, slowy.
&gt;Looks like your legs are now in position to not fall.
&gt;You wanted to check if the human is still okay.
&gt;But all this smoke...you shield your eyes while trying to move forward in the fog.
&gt;Suddenly...

*GASP*

&gt;A hand appears from the nothing, touching you and...your left breast.
&gt;What the...?
&gt;&quot;Ah, you still there!&quot; The voice of the human almost light up your heart.
&gt;Almost.
&gt;He was still touching your breast.
&gt;You slap his hand away and then cover your chest with your paws, making a pouty face.
&gt;&quot;Hey! Uh oh...&quot; He quickly understands what has happened and apologizes &quot;S-sorry!&quot;

&quot;Mmmmmh...&quot; Still not convinced, you focus your half-closed eyes to him.
 
&gt;&quot;I didn&#039;t see nothing with all the smoke, I-I swear!&quot; While scratching the back of his hood.
&gt;But seriously, what are you going to do now? calling him pervert? even after saved your life?
&gt;You sighed.
&gt;Okay understood, still...that felt good tho.
&gt;*ehem*
&gt;You are even surprise your lips left escape a small giggle from his reaction.
&gt;The smoke is beginning to dissipate, and you can see more clear all around you.
&gt;Holes of bullets are everywhere, windows shattered and the seats destroyed, nothing was intact anymore inside the bus.
&gt;But the bus itself has not stopped yet.
&gt;You both have to get out of here.
&gt;LIKE NOW.
&gt;You clear your throat and spoke.

&quot;Okay human, I would like to ask hundreds of questions right now, but we have to get out of this bus before blowing up with a gas station, understood?&quot;

&gt;You make it clear, you don&#039;t know how much time is left but you were sure that almost three or four minutes had already passed when Sibuna told you that.
&gt;The human stay silent, with a hand on his chin, like thinking in something important.
&gt;He was a about to open his mouth again to talk, but you realize one thing and cut his words.

&quot;How the hell did you get on this bus?&quot;

&gt;You quickly grab his attention.
&gt;&quot;Welp, I could say it&#039;s a...eh...large story&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t hesitate in ask again.

&quot;Could you do...uh...that &quot;&quot;Angel magic&quot;&quot; to get us out of here?&quot;

&gt;Now it&#039;s his turn to let go a little giggle.
&gt;&quot;Angel...Magic?&quot; he repeat.
&gt;He talks like he doesn&#039;t know nothing.

&gt;&quot;Yeah! I mean... you came here from nowhere, can you do that again but this time, out of here?&quot;

&gt;He shrugs.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m afraid that&#039;s not how works...&quot;
&gt;What.
&gt;&quot;I tought you would do that&quot;
&gt;WHAT.
&gt;You grab your ears and stretch them down in despair.

&quot;Why can&#039;t you do that?!&quot;

&gt;He shrugs again.
&gt;What kind of guardian angel is him?!
&gt;Maybe is he still a beginner?

*Ring* *Ring* *Ring* *Ring*

&gt;You shuddered and feel something vibrating in your pocket of your pants.
&gt;The sound seems familiar, it was your alarm clock?
&gt;Maybe unintentionally you left it on, but this is not important now.
&gt;&quot;Hum...Kitty, I don&#039;t want to appear intelligent or something but what if we go to the steering wheel and... change the course?&quot; 
&gt;Actually...that&#039;s not a bad idea.

&quot;Alright&quot;

&gt;Grabbing his shoulder, he advances first and you both run through the hall, carefully between all the mess.
&gt;The smoke was still coming out, so it was still a bit hard to see something.
&gt;Maybe the engine was damaged.
&gt;Still walking, your legs seemed to stop.
&gt;Now that you think about it...Where is Sibuna? at least what&#039;s left from him.
&gt;He was in the middle of those bullets and with a knife or that weird thing nailed in his neck by the human.
&gt;Looking in several directions, you try to see if you find something of him, no corpse... nothing.
&gt;But he wouldn&#039;t survive from that, that was sure!
&gt;Or...

&gt;You snapped.
&gt;&quot;Still with me?&quot; He looks over you and you return the look.
&gt;And suddenly, your heart went a bit fast.
&gt;But not fast of scary, hatred...or a bad feel...
&gt;It&#039;s difficult to explain.
&gt;&quot;Kitty!&quot; He gently shakes you by your arm.

&quot;Ah-ah yes, yes! sorry...&quot; Looking away from him quickly while your ears went flat.

&gt;What was you thinking, silly lynx? You thought with shame.
&gt;&quot;Heh...you worried me for a second, I thought I lost you&quot;
&gt;W-worried, him?
&gt;He is still your guardian angel after all, but hearing that from someone...It feels...
&gt;...
&gt;No.
&gt;keep your focus up, this madness it&#039;s not over.
&gt;You have to stop this vehicle first and now, and then you can fantasize about other things later.
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s go&quot; He said.
&gt;You nod to him and grab his shoulder again to continue.

&gt;You two finally achieved to pass through the smoke and arrive to the driver&#039;s seat.
&gt;The Human quickly sits on it and grabbed the steering wheel that was still moving on his own.

&gt;&quot;Okay okay, I got this!&quot;

&gt;And with a lighy movemnt, he just ended pulling the steering wheel out... breaking it.
&gt;He just stay inmovil with the wheel in his hand, looking at you.
&gt;&quot;Well...erh...sh*t&quot;
&gt;Words cannot describe how hard you are pulling your whiskers right now while you are looking at him with eyes wide open.

&quot;D-DUDE!&quot; You groaned.

&gt;He repeatedly stomped the brake pedal, but it doesn&#039;t seems to work too.
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t panic, time for plan E!&quot;
&gt;With one hand he reach the emergency brake and tried to pull it back, but it&#039;s stuck.
&gt;So he grabbed it with two hands and said.
&gt;&quot;Can you help me here with that “feline force”?&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t know if you should feel flattered with that.
&gt;Grabbing the lever with your paws, you both are ready.
&gt;&quot;Okay, at the one... two...wait Wait WAIT...! 

&quot;Wa... What now?!&quot; you ask

&gt;&quot;We pull at three or after three?&quot;
&gt;FOR FUCK&#039;S SAKE HUMAN.

&quot;Are you kidding me JUST... PUUUULL NGGGGAAH!&quot;

&gt;With the force of one thousand of cats, you both try to pull it back.
&gt;The lever seems to be moving a little now.

&quot;We...almost...there!&quot; You said while grinding with your teeths.

&gt;&quot;Keep... pulling!&quot;
&gt;After 5 seconds of brute force, it almost reach the other side.
*CRACK*
&gt;&quot;G-great...&quot; He whispers.
&gt;You didn&#039;t see it coming, but from the pressure you flied and ended on the floor.
&gt;Still on the ground you shake your head a bit and raise your sight.

&quot;Geez...that hurts!... Uh?&quot;

&gt;You feel something in your paw, so you lift it up to find the lever you and the human were pulling.
&gt;Broken.
&gt;And the bus didn&#039;t stop.

&gt;&quot;You alive?&quot;
&gt;The human rushes to you and extend his hand to help you.
&gt;You grab it and he lift you up to your feets again.
&gt;You can&#039;t contain the fury now and threw the lever with strength.

&quot;Goddammit!&quot;

&gt;&quot;Ah c&#039;mon, don&#039;t be like that&quot; he replies.
&gt;What? why the hell you shouldn&#039;t be like that in this situation?

&quot;Dude how can you say that?! we are going to die!...or you are just going to make a “plan J” and jump through one of the windows?&quot;

&gt;&quot;MAYBE!- I just meant to say that you stress easily, kitty&quot;
&gt;He is right, but that does not justify that you both are going to die.
&gt;You give your back to him while you wrap your arms around you and lower your head.
&gt;With a big *sigh* you explain your repentance for him.

&quot;You...You shouldn&#039;t have came for me...human&quot;

&gt;&quot;...&quot;

&quot;You have to know...I&#039;m not worth anything...&quot; 
&gt;Tears are forming in your eyes and you let out a hurt sob.
&gt;But it was the truth, your truth...

&gt;&quot;...&quot;

&quot;I gave up...a long time ago&quot;
*sob*

&gt;You two stayed in silence for seconds, waiting for the inevitable death.
&gt;But at the same time, you was grateful that someone cared and tried to save you, even if it was in vain.
&gt;You was about to thank him for trying, but he spoke first.

&gt;&quot;That&#039;s not true...&quot;
&gt;You snap and turn your gaze to him, with tears still flowing out.
&gt;&quot;...And I will show you how wrong you are&quot;
&gt;Even in this dark moment, the human was still showing his radiant heart of absolute purity.
&gt;He extend a hand to you, making you stare at it.

&quot;Human...&quot;

&gt;With a smile that you couldn&#039;t believe you made, you abruptly accept his hand, and pulled him in a hug.
&gt;Your last hug? You should taste it all you can.
&gt;&quot;Heh, see? you looks beautiful with a smile like that&quot; he points.
&gt;Giving a small *eep* as you couldn&#039;t resist to blush a bit and smile even more.

&quot;Idiot...&quot;

&gt;You both give a weakly small laugh.
&gt;You coulnd&#039;t see it, but you can feel his feathery thick wings of angel embracing you from behind and all around you, warming you and the coldness of this nightmare.
&gt;And now, only thoughts comes to your brain at the speed of light.
&gt;In all the moment after the fight with Sibuna, the human never seemed to lose hope, not even entered in panic or an attack of schizophrenia like you surely would did.
&gt;He was peaceful, a calm emanating from him that you couldn&#039;t describe and toxicating you, in a good way 
&gt;Do he is always like that?
&gt;Once time, your mother told you that guardian angels guide people to heaven when they die.
&gt;Maybe he wasn&#039;t trying to save you, but guiding you.

&gt;&quot;Hey...&quot;
&gt;Eventually he attracts your attention again as your arms were unintentionally wrapped around his neck, like don&#039;t wanting to separate from him, though honestly, you kinda don&#039;t want him to let go.
&gt;And now that you are face to face, you see him in his full glory, well not all, his hood was still shielding his eyes and almost the rest of his face.
&gt;How his eyes looks like? full of desire? It would be rude to ask him to show you his real nature?
&gt;And his lips with a expression of confusion... they looks so soft, how would they...taste?
&gt;You can&#039;t avoid to look away in shame, surely he has noticed already your blush through all your fur.
&gt;But there shouldn&#039;t be shame or secret to hide now, not at least in your last moments of life.
&gt;Even with the little you know him, it&#039;s like if he had been there in your whole life, waiting for the moment to appear in front of your eyes.
&gt;And the most important, he have name?
&gt;So many questions to ask him, but maybe they will be answered when you will be up there.

&gt;&quot;Kitty...?&quot;
&gt;It&#039;s time to be sincere with him.

&quot;You know...I rather want to die in the arms of someone who worries for me a bit... than a bullet between the eyes...AndIwantedtosaythatImaylikeyo-&quot;

&gt;But before you could end your unintelligible phrase, a hairless finger cross your mouth, marking silence
&gt;&quot;Die? Didn&#039;t I told you I would show how wrong you are with yourself?&quot;

&quot;Uh?&quot;
&gt;You furrowed your brow and down your ears with curiosity.
&gt;What does he mean? How would he able to stop the bus from its course?

&quot;And what are we going to do now? We&#039;ve tried everything...&quot;

&gt;&quot;...Now? we wait&quot;

&quot;Wait?... wait for wha-?&quot;

*Ring *Ring *Ring* *Ring*
