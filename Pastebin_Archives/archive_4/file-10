manages to be a hero for someone who needs it most.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">[[CHAPTER 1: R0uga ]]</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are 4N0N</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Data courier, milk runner, and occasional decoy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get your off-the-books jobs from a network of spies, assassins, hackers…you name it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All thanks to your indispensible abilities</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The most valuable of which is being completely indiscreet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’ve all but waltzed into hostile territories because you’re so ignorable and non-menacing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’ve also felt there’s little chance your employers will turn on you, considering they can barely remember your name</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then again, that just might be what they WANT you to think</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Currently you’re in a chain of errands sending you all over the city</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Get money from a hotel concierge, use it to buy a specific “gift” from a little old lady, deliver said “gift” to an office janitor…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s usually no negotiation required, as your contacts are so widely known (or rather, feared) that just name-dropping them is enough to get a client on your side</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The power is honestly a little exhilarating</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But even though you’re almost never in any real danger, you’re still prepared for the day you might get whacked by someone</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or left holding the bag like a patsy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So, you’re a little worried when you’re sent a package by a handler you’ve never met before and instructed to take it to a locked-down research lab</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A lock you can only bypass by first going to a fast food joint and specifically getting the “Runner’s Sliders” that come in a “kid’s meal”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like any youth ordering a kid’s meal, you’re more interested in the toy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s a bulky “Wreckball” card with some holographic rhino athlete on it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You peel the image off to reveal the keycard underneath</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The research lab isn’t hard to find, but it’s been abandoned and derelict for so long nobody wants to go inside and get some kind of mutation or something</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The credentials on the keycard work out, and the door slides open for you to wander the empty lab looking for any kind of dead drop</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What you find in a room deep within the facility makes your heart stop</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bodies</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Everywhere</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Most have started decaying, while others are fresher</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some scientists, some gangsters, some that look like SWAT</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sitting at the end of the room is a figure unlike the rest, slumped over and distant from the rest of the bloodbath</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You carefully move through the carnage until you’re a stone’s throw away from the lone figure</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s a female anthro similar to a lupine…maybe…with a russet pelt and wearing pretty standard tactical gear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her head snaps upright, revealing two bionic eyes of powder blue that glow brightly, though one is slightly dimmer and shows what looks to be a pupil</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One of her pointed ears is entirely cybernetic while the other is just torn in places</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The lower half of her muzzle is metal, as are her narrow ankles</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If she had a tail, as most anthros do, it’s completely gone now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her left arm is biotic and muscular, but the right one is something out of nightmares</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s a vicious chrome apparatus, bent in more joints than what’s natural for an animal, and the “claws” are miniature scimitars with immaculate sharpness</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’ll aff0rd y0u 0ne w0rd,” she says.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her voice might have had a beautifully melodic quality if not for the distortion sounding like speaking through a radio</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Inside a metal grate</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Underwater</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She flexes her metal claw and you return your focus to her declaration</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If old action flicks taught you anything, it’s that your final word shouldn’t be something damning like, “wait”, or “stop”, or “please”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If she’s going to kill you, maybe she’ll have some kind of conscious if she knows your name</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;4N0N</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her claw relaxes, and she sticks out her good arm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”T0ss it here,” comes her next command in the same twisted manner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You

class="de1">&gt;You’re led into the bathroom, the brightest room in the place</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The light coming down on the shower stall looks as though it’s presented by the gods</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;R0uga grabs her mechanical arm with her “good” one, pulling hard</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A blood-curdling scream

ridges of metal follow her spine</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But apart from the modifications you’ve already seen on her, she is otherwise a stunning individual</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Downy russet fur</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Toned thighs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And some weighty breasts that definitely aren’t “augmented”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She pushes against the tiled wall with her lone arm and lets the water drip over her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s motionless for almost half an hour</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Showers and rain make everyone cry, but something tells you she’s genuine about it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Finally the water is shut off, and she grabs a towel</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”W0uld y0u?” her voice warbles</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take the cloth and delicately dry her off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’m very damp,” she says. “Y0u’re g0ing t0 have t0 be m0re

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She walks out of the bathroom with the towel still draped around her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s a bed in the corner, enough room for her and the space she beckons you over to</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">It’s hard not to look at her naked form, but whenever you avert her eyes she tries to position herself into your sight</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I repulse y0u,” she whines</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you’re just trying to be polite</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She wraps her arm around your head and buries it into her chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’m still flesh and b0ne, I swear,” R0uga says, pulling you deeper into her bosom</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s a soft droning sound inside, but you can feel her heartbeat all the same</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She lets you catch some air, looking into your eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s a pitiful expression, and her cybernetic features on such a soft form make her look like a much-loved stuffed toy that was vainly repaired to prolong its life</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reach up to touch her muzzle, cupping the metal half with your palm but stroking the organic half with your fingers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s heartbreaking to hear such a deadly creature reduced to a whimpering wreck before you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Careful of her sharp fangs, you kiss the upper lips of her mouth, running down the whole length on both sides</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every touch and caress that would be simple foreplay for anyone else puts a disarming shiver throughout her body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She definitely doesn’t allow herself to be this vulnerable, ever</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now that you’ve made that fissure, she’s powerless to keep her body from betraying her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She deserves this, you tell yourself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lower down to her tender vulva and spread it with your fingers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It takes only a single glide of your tongue to get her to cry out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her one paw clenches your scalp, and even the shoulder on her empty side tenses up with its phantom limb</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You give her a moment to recover before diving in for a more vigorous effort</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her legs wrap over your back, the metal in her ankles clinking together as they cross</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And she convulses with her climax</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You give her only a pause, then you&#039;re back at it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get a pretty decent tally going of how many times you make her orgasm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And yet, she slowly builds up a tolerance, able to last a little longer each round</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But eventually she’s had enough, feebly trying to keep you away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her body spasms with strain and fatigue, her limbs splayed out over the bed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her chest heaves with her panting, and her tongue lolls from her muzzle</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Ha…ha…” she tries to speak</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lie beside her, immediately pulled into her one-arm embrace</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”H-ha…h0w…h0w much?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hmm?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You give her a confused look</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Y0ur payment.

y0u everything I can.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That’s all you need to hear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nobody else’s voice would sound right to you

you the container</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Be careful with this,” he muttered. “Just got an upgrade to my own package, if ya’ know what I mean, and I don’ want it ripped off if

from what you recognized to be a high-class, luxury apparel chain</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ah, maybe kind of like hiding a gun in a box of roses?</div></li><li class="li1"><div

posters</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Each one advertising some gorgeous celebrity or performer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;R0uga puffs her chest out to look

and ruins</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The doorman gives R0uga a once-over, but you’re admitted in without a fuss as the wolf adds a little extra to the cover fee</div></li><li

in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She doesn’t even touch alcohol for a while, and her dancing is just a reserved bob of the head and slight leaning from side to side</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s a pup at a prom, and you’re happy to be there with her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You eventually grab some refreshments and lounge at the bar</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;R0uga orders her drink with a straw</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The bartender is a young human woman with the same neon, half-shaven haircut that no rebellious punk can be without these days</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Your girl’s outfitted pretty nicely there,” she says, flipping around a cocktail shaker</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;R0uga looks down to her dress with a grin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Thank y0u.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div

snorts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He jabs you in the chest with his fat knuckles</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”This your bitch for the night?”</div></li><li

highly sensitive, but not in a harmful way</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She needs this</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not just the attention, but also your

been a long day for you and R0uga</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Three separate jobs, and three deals that fell through</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Go deliver a nondescript “special package” from Point A to Point B?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, gotta be intercepted by an interloping gang along the way</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They weren’t even going after the correct target either</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Go escort a young woman to a designated location and be her protection for the trip?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, you got roped into a quarrel between two rival street factions</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Which meant twice as many casualties</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Go to a gas station and simply tell the cashier he needs to come home early tonight?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, now someone’s going to have to clean up all the bloodstains in addition to the pools of soda and snack debris everywhere</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You still don’t even know how that all escalated so quickly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In all three situations, it was the oxen gangers “The Meat Beaters” who were the antagonists</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So after the third altercation, R0uga personally tracked down their ringleader and snapped both his horns off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You never saw where they ended up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And on top of everything else, it rained the entirety of the day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you are dripping as you return to the apartment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;R0uga starts screaming in her discordant, modulated wail</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She normally does this after yanking her cyber arm out of its socket, but you can tell this is mainly out of frustration from the chaotic day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So when the arm is actually disconnected you can’t tell when the screaming from the physical pain starts and the emotional pain ends</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Freed from her lethal augment, R0uga proceeds to strip herself down to nothing and toss her sopping clothes into a corner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Rem0ve y0urs t00,” she commands. “We will sh0wer t0gether.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Good way to save water</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s not a lot of room to move around with the two of you sharing the shower, but there never needs to be</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re pressed up against one another, washing the other’s back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The frigid rains are rinsed off so soothing heat can replace them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;While you try to be gentle with R0uga to placate her, it has little effect</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s still a little agitated from it all, scrubbing you aggressively without thinking</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your skin’s going to be pretty raw in the morning</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But her stress swirls down the drain as you cleanse the unpleasantness out of her pelt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’ve shared intimate moments together while bathing, but tonight it’s more of a typical routine</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Something to be over and done with, much like the day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Perhaps R0uga wants to save the intimacy for bed?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not likely</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re guessing tonight isn’t going to progress very far beyond some cuddling</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re both wiped out and sleep is priceless</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;R0uga’s long yawn sounds like a mix between a whale’s singing and the hum of a turbine</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you dry her fur off she sways in your arms</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have to physically keep her upright so she doesn’t pass out on the floor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Race y0u t0 bed, 4n0n,” she mumbles, hanging onto your back as you shuffle out of the bathroom</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If there’s one thing you make sure the derelict apartment always has when you leave for the morning, it’s clean, tidy sheets for when you return</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s the least you can do to reward the two of you after whatever hardships the day throws your way</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You lay the russet cyberwolf down and tuck her in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Aaaaahhhhh-00000hhhhh…” R0uga croons as she tries to wiggle deeper into the mattress</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She has an ensemble of noises she makes when she settles down for a particularly peaceful slumber</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Little squeaks and buzzes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A howl or two that ends with a pop-like hiccup</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The faintest rattle of her jaw as she inhales deeply, followed by a soft whistling as she sighs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s hard not to listen to the symphony and be amused</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was concerning and a little hard to get used to at first, but it’s something you’ve grown to expect and even appreciate</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Any noise is good noise; it means you’re still alive</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”4n0n, c0me to bed already,” she huffs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She tries scooting over to demonstrate there’s more than enough room for you, but she’s too tired to move much</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”If y0u d0n’t get under here s00n, I w0n’t be awake l0ng en0ugh t0 tell y0u h0w much I l0ve y0u.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, that’s motivation enough</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shut the lights off and slip under the sheets with her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”That’s m0re like it.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her good arm—her strong arm—wraps over you and pulls you tightly into her clean fur</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You manage to get your own arm around her head so you can stroke her torn ear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her cybernetic one folds into place and her eyes dim as they slowly close</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;L0ve y000uuu…” R0uga trails off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You give her ear attention for a little while before you drift off yourself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Did you even fall asleep, or where you only out for a few minutes?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look to R0uga, whose glowing eyes are looking right back at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Among all her nighttime noise, you hear another familiar one</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The gurgling of her stomach</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”We didn’t have an 0pp0rtunity to eat much t0day,” she laments</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She tries to go back to sleep, but every rumble makes her shift around uncomfortably</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Maybe just a snack t0 tide me 0ver until m0rning.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The cyberwolf rolls out of bed and scavenges through the kitchen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her stash of Insta-Din is completely empty</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As is much of the fridge</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”We didn’t g0 get gr0ceries either,” she sighs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe she should have grabbed some ox when she had the chance, you joke</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I kn0w…” R0uga says, a bit too seriously</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She can be a little scary sometimes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Maybe we can 0rder in f0r delivery?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The only place crazy enough to deliver out here at this time at night is D’jammin’ Hut</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And that’s only because they have armored vehicles</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not to mention it’ll practically be morning by the time they arrive</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All that you can make is what you call “Terminal Sandwiches”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Basically any leftover condiments on top of crackers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh, and a single pack of dry noodles</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So essentially one big cracker because of the way R0uga chomps into it without boiling the noodles first</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s not a luxurious meal, but it’s enough to satiate her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”F0r n0w,” she says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She licks your face as you head back into bed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A little too much, maybe</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When she nips your ear, then you get a little worried</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Y0u d0n’t need b0th 0f them,” she says with a hollow chuckle. “I g0t used t0 it.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiles devilishly up until you fall asleep again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Several loud bangs jolt you awake</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nearby gangers, unsurprisingly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s a sad reality how close you live to their petty turf wars</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;On any other night, R0uga would eagerly pop her arm back in and go out to give them a deadly lesson</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tonight, however, she doesn’t want to put up with that shit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But it’s more than enough to wake her to a nasty mood</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her cyber ear stands up and her eyes flash with blinding anger</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to comfort her, but she wrenches herself from your grip</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Over to the window she goes, throwing it open and leaning outside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Without warning she lets out a deafening bellow that covers the entire neighborhood</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And probably a good ways into the city</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s enough to make your ears ring</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The echo dies out, and you can hear the frightened shouts of the encroaching gangers as they scramble off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even those who don’t know R0uga’s reputation know not to stick around when they hear her threats</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The cyberwolf hangs her head long after the commotion dies down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Idi0t…” she growls</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She turns to you with a defeated look on her face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”My adrenaline dispenser went 0ff,” she whines.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh boy…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I w0n’t be able t0 get t0 sleep…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s happened a few times in the past, always triggered by some kind for combative response or high tension</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For her, it’s like guzzling an entire pot of coffee right before bed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you don’t have any sedatives to counter it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The only thing you can really do is ride it out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Y0u sh0uld get s0me rest,” she says. “I w0n’t make any s0und.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It wouldn’t be easy to sleep knowing R0uga’s so miserable</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or still hungry</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you tell her you’ll try to stay up with her as long as you can</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Which might not be too long with how the day went</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You start by helping her exercise a bit to help deplete that extra energy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s amazing how many one-paw pushups that cyberwolf can do</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even adding extra weight to her back doesn’t stop her from powering through dozens of sets</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Unfortunately, it seems to make the situation worse</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now she’s hyperactive AND sore</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her arm quivers with strain</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”H0w ab0ut s0me vide0 games next?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That would have been a much better way to spend such a rainy, miserable day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All your more modern systems with sophisticated one-handed controllers have broken over the last few weeks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ironically it’s just the ancient one-stick, one-button system you have left</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;R0uga’s pretty adept at maneuvering those with her fingers, though</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even using her toes if need be</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You play games for about an hour with little success</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The strain in her arm makes her accuracy shaky, putting her at a disadvantage</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In turn, it just makes her get competitive</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Resulting in making her more feisty</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have to stop her from breaking this system as well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Next she tries to calm down with some meditation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Deep breathing and stillness</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sitting rigid and droning deeply from her chest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a body as busy as hers, you wouldn’t think she’s capable of ignoring her inner distractions</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Quite the opposite, according to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”It helped me get used t0 my b0dy after all the m0difications…” she says. “S0 n0w I barely n0tice them anym0re.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The meditation only goes so far, however</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her cyber ear swivels at every little noise</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And she fidgets relentlessly with the adrenaline still lingering</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to massage her shoulders to remove the tension in her body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Maybe we can bl0w 0ff s0me steam?” she coos</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You know what she’s suggesting, but neither of you are really in the right condition to go at it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just moving around is agonizing for her now after a day’s worth of struggles and countless pushups</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two of you just sit and watch TV for a while</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Bobcat Roscoe’s painting show is pretty good for relaxation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s well into the witching hour when a yawn is finally coaxed out of the cyberwolf</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I think I’m ready…at l0ng last,” she says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What a relief</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You support the cyberwolf’s weathered body back to the bed and tuck her in once more</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stroke her fur and give kisses where they’re needed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;R0uga holds you tightly again, fighting off slumber longer than you do</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Please, rest. Y0u’ve d0ne all y0u can f0r me.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nuzzles your face with the top of her snout</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I l0ve y0u, 4n0n.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sleep finally takes you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s almost sunrise, but that means nothing when you plan on sleeping in to make up for a long night</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;R0uga finally found her own peace</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you soon hear whimpering from her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The leftover energy and the lack of sleep must be giving her some vivid dreams</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not good ones either</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She clutches you painfully every few minutes, which is probably what woke you in the first place</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s not uncommon for her dreams to be plagued with bad memories</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’ve delved into her psyche a few times in conversations, and it’s understandable what you’ve learned troubles her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The pain of multiple surgeries and shoddy treatments</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The rejection and ostracizing from most “civilized” social groups</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The carnage from endless battles with foes, even if the fighting was completely justified</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That poor girl</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Do you wake her and risk her being unable to fall back asleep?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or do you shake the nightmares from her?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The discomfort of her claws on your chest urges you to do the latter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She twitches when you rouse her from her sleep, then grabs hold even tighter as she tries to figure out what’s happening</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;4n0n?” she says groggily</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You reassure her, hoping she won’t be too mad</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”N0…I was having r0tten dreams.

[[CHAPTER 1: R0uga ]]

&gt;You are 4N0N
&gt;Data courier, milk runner, and occasional decoy
&gt;You get your off-the-books jobs from a network of spies, assassins, hackers…you name it
&gt;All thanks to your indispensible abilities
&gt;The most valuable of which is being completely indiscreet
&gt;You’ve all but waltzed into hostile territories because you’re so ignorable and non-menacing
&gt;You’ve also felt there’s little chance your employers will turn on you, considering they can barely remember your name
&gt;Then again, that just might be what they WANT you to think
&gt;Currently you’re in a chain of errands sending you all over the city
&gt;Get money from a hotel concierge, use it to buy a specific “gift” from a little old lady, deliver said “gift” to an office janitor…
&gt;There’s usually no negotiation required, as your contacts are so widely known (or rather, feared) that just name-dropping them is enough to get a client on your side
&gt;The power is honestly a little exhilarating
&gt;But even though you’re almost never in any real danger, you’re still prepared for the day you might get whacked by someone
&gt;Or left holding the bag like a patsy
&gt;So, you’re a little worried when you’re sent a package by a handler you’ve never met before and instructed to take it to a locked-down research lab
&gt;A lock you can only bypass by first going to a fast food joint and specifically getting the “Runner’s Sliders” that come in a “kid’s meal”
&gt;Like any youth ordering a kid’s meal, you’re more interested in the toy
&gt;It’s a bulky “Wreckball” card with some holographic rhino athlete on it
&gt;You peel the image off to reveal the keycard underneath
&gt;The research lab isn’t hard to find, but it’s been abandoned and derelict for so long nobody wants to go inside and get some kind of mutation or something
&gt;The credentials on the keycard work out, and the door slides open for you to wander the empty lab looking for any kind of dead drop
&gt;What you find in a room deep within the facility makes your heart stop
&gt;Bodies
&gt;Everywhere
&gt;Most have started decaying, while others are fresher
&gt;Some scientists, some gangsters, some that look like SWAT
&gt;Sitting at the end of the room is a figure unlike the rest, slumped over and distant from the rest of the bloodbath
&gt;You carefully move through the carnage until you’re a stone’s throw away from the lone figure
&gt;It’s a female anthro similar to a lupine…maybe…with a russet pelt and wearing pretty standard tactical gear
&gt;Her head snaps upright, revealing two bionic eyes of powder blue that glow brightly, though one is slightly dimmer and shows what looks to be a pupil
&gt;One of her pointed ears is entirely cybernetic while the other is just torn in places
&gt;The lower half of her muzzle is metal, as are her narrow ankles
&gt;If she had a tail, as most anthros do, it’s completely gone now
&gt;Her left arm is biotic and muscular, but the right one is something out of nightmares
&gt;It’s a vicious chrome apparatus, bent in more joints than what’s natural for an animal, and the “claws” are miniature scimitars with immaculate sharpness
&gt;”I’ll aff0rd y0u 0ne w0rd,” she says.
&gt;Her voice might have had a beautifully melodic quality if not for the distortion sounding like speaking through a radio
&gt;Inside a metal grate
&gt;Underwater
&gt;She flexes her metal claw and you return your focus to her declaration
&gt;If old action flicks taught you anything, it’s that your final word shouldn’t be something damning like, “wait”, or “stop”, or “please”
&gt;If she’s going to kill you, maybe she’ll have some kind of conscious if she knows your name
&gt;4N0N
&gt;Her claw relaxes, and she sticks out her good arm
&gt;”T0ss it here,” comes her next command in the same twisted manner
&gt;You obey
&gt;She catches the package and slices it open with her claw
&gt;”Turn ar0und. Y0u peek, y0u die.”
&gt;You obey
&gt;There’s clicking and whirring and the sickening grinding of metal, with grunts and gasps interspersed
&gt;You can hear her stand up and approach you
&gt;You expect her metal claw to touch you, or your innards, but not the gentle weight of her “real” paw on your shoulder
&gt;”Y0u sh0uld g0,” she says.
&gt;Even with the haunting voice mask, you can still pick up concern in her tone
&gt;She leaves the way you came, the only way out
&gt;You trail her at a distance, keeping your hands in sight to not provoke her
&gt;Once back at the sliding entrance door, she pauses
&gt;”Were y0u f0ll0wed?”
&gt;You begin to say “no”, but stop yourself
&gt;You may be ignored pretty often, but it’s always possible you’re being stalked
&gt;”At least y0u’re h0nest,” she says
&gt;Her claw digs into the door like paper, causing screams on the other side
&gt;She wrenches the door off its track and shoves it forward, bowling over more victims
&gt;Those were the lucky ones
&gt;You see her dance of death but not the ambushers getting torn to ribbons on flanking sides of the doorway
&gt;When she’s finished, she looks at you inquisitively
&gt;”Friends of y0urs?”
&gt;No
&gt;”G00d. Y0u have en0ugh insight to kn0w wh0 y0ur allies are, but n0t enough to make y0ur life a liability.”
&gt;She flicks the gore from her claw and turns to leave
&gt;”If I were y0u, I’d seek new empl0yment.”
&gt;You nod to yourself and continue following her
&gt;Part of you warns you not to go after her, but the other tells you not to hastily run off and make yourself easy prey
&gt;”R0uga, 4N0N,” she says to break the silence. “N0, there isn’t m0re y0u need to kn0w.”
&gt;Fine by you. 
&gt;This whole city has enough shady, tragic backstories

&gt;The two of you walk through the neon-pulsing streets
&gt;Though intimidating, an anthro sporting some combat chrome isn’t entirely out of the question
&gt;That doesn’t stop a few gawkers, though
&gt;Her movement only halts in front of a boarded up theater
&gt;Its letters are scrambled and missing in several places, but several posters in decent condition are plastered on the walls
&gt;Valencia Vix
&gt;Tubby Whiskers
&gt;The Tomfoolery Twins
&gt;All wealthy, all talented, all gorgeous
&gt;R0uga growls
&gt;The claws flex and slice through the posters
&gt;Brick and all
&gt;A few passerby run off as R0uga is left to stew in her anger
&gt;”D0 y0u need m0ney?” she blurts out after a while
&gt;You ARE unemployed now, apparently
&gt;Those glowing eyes look through you, shaded by a furrowed brow
&gt;”I need….”
&gt;She tries to find a word
&gt;”…Supervis0n”
&gt;Her bionic eyes seem to work just fine, so-
&gt;Oh, THAT kind of supervision
&gt;”What d0 y0u want? F0ur grand? Seven? Nine!?”
&gt;Her voice becomes more hysteric with each number, and there’s subtle feedback ringing in it as she gets louder
&gt;You tell her you usually don’t take a job before you know all the criteria
&gt;She winces, and you get a taste of the serrated fangs she’s outfitted with
&gt;Well, you’re open to negotiations, anyway
&gt;”Please, c0me with me.”

&gt;You’re led to a dim apartment flat, the kind you always imaged those who run the shadows would squat in
&gt;It’s surprisingly well furnished, if you ignore the claw marks in the walls and all the furniture being bisected
&gt;You’re led into the bathroom, the brightest room in the place
&gt;The light coming down on the shower stall looks as though it’s presented by the gods
&gt;R0uga grabs her mechanical arm with her “good” one, pulling hard
&gt;A blood-curdling scream comes from her modulated throat
&gt;The arm pops free, leaving a small socket almost entirely hidden by her fur
&gt;”Never…gets easier…” she huffs”
&gt;The shower is kicked on and steam soon fills the room
&gt;It’s a little impressive how fluidly she disrobes with one arm, almost distracting you from her full nudity
&gt;You turn away, remembering her threat from the lab
&gt;”Y0u might as well, n0W,” she says. “Y0u’ll have t0 st0mach me anyway a little later.”
&gt;She steps into the shower as you examine her further
&gt;Her tail indeed looks as though it had been forcibly removed at some point, and ridges of metal follow her spine
&gt;But apart from the modifications you’ve already seen on her, she is otherwise a stunning individual
&gt;Downy russet fur
&gt;Toned thighs
&gt;And some weighty breasts that definitely aren’t “augmented”
&gt;She pushes against the tiled wall with her lone arm and lets the water drip over her
&gt;She’s motionless for almost half an hour
&gt;Showers and rain make everyone cry, but something tells you she’s genuine about it
&gt;Finally the water is shut off, and she grabs a towel
&gt;”W0uld y0u?” her voice warbles
&gt;You take the cloth and delicately dry her off
&gt;”I’m very damp,” she says. “Y0u’re g0ing t0 have t0 be m0re vig0r0us.”
&gt;The towel is so old and ratty that nothing is left to the imagination when you glide over her curves
&gt;Now you’re curious what that thing was you gave her, and where she stuck it
&gt;Not curious enough to ask, obviously
&gt;She walks out of the bathroom with the towel still draped around her
&gt;There’s a bed in the corner, enough room for her and the space she beckons you over to
It’s hard not to look at her naked form, but whenever you avert her eyes she tries to position herself into your sight
&gt;”I repulse y0u,” she whines
&gt;You tell her you’re just trying to be polite
&gt;She wraps her arm around your head and buries it into her chest
&gt;”I’m still flesh and b0ne, I swear,” R0uga says, pulling you deeper into her bosom
&gt;There’s a soft droning sound inside, but you can feel her heartbeat all the same
&gt;She lets you catch some air, looking into your eyes
&gt;It’s a pitiful expression, and her cybernetic features on such a soft form make her look like a much-loved stuffed toy that was vainly repaired to prolong its life
&gt;You reach up to touch her muzzle, cupping the metal half with your palm but stroking the organic half with your fingers
&gt;It’s heartbreaking to hear such a deadly creature reduced to a whimpering wreck before you
&gt;Careful of her sharp fangs, you kiss the upper lips of her mouth, running down the whole length on both sides
&gt;Every touch and caress that would be simple foreplay for anyone else puts a disarming shiver throughout her body
&gt;She definitely doesn’t allow herself to be this vulnerable, ever
&gt;Now that you’ve made that fissure, she’s powerless to keep her body from betraying her
&gt;She deserves this, you tell yourself
&gt;You lower down to her tender vulva and spread it with your fingers
&gt;It takes only a single glide of your tongue to get her to cry out
&gt;Her one paw clenches your scalp, and even the shoulder on her empty side tenses up with its phantom limb
&gt;You give her a moment to recover before diving in for a more vigorous effort
&gt;Her legs wrap over your back, the metal in her ankles clinking together as they cross
&gt;And she convulses with her climax
&gt;You give her only a pause, then you&#039;re back at it
&gt;You get a pretty decent tally going of how many times you make her orgasm
&gt;And yet, she slowly builds up a tolerance, able to last a little longer each round
&gt;But eventually she’s had enough, feebly trying to keep you away
&gt;Her body spasms with strain and fatigue, her limbs splayed out over the bed
&gt;Her chest heaves with her panting, and her tongue lolls from her muzzle
&gt;”Ha…ha…” she tries to speak
&gt;You lie beside her, immediately pulled into her one-arm embrace
&gt;”H-ha…h0w…h0w much?”
&gt;Hmm?
&gt;You give her a confused look
&gt;”Y0ur payment. H0w much…d0 y0u want?”
&gt;The thought hadn’t even occurred to you
&gt;But as you lie with R0uga and drift to sleep, there’s only one thing you hope she’ll give you

&gt;The morning sun brightens the flat, showing you the full extent of R0uga’s loneliness and rage
&gt;”Careful,” she warns as you help her reattach her weaponized arm
&gt;She sharply inhales as you slot it in, eliciting a pained groan
&gt;”It takes time t0 feel the arm when it g0es in,” she says, “but taking it 0ut is like ripping y0ur arm 0ff all 0ver again.”
&gt;She’s once again the cybernetic lupine warrior you found her as
&gt;But maybe a little tougher this time
&gt;”I can’t pr0mise y0u safety in this kind of life, and the last thing I want is t0 put y0u in harm’s way. But….”
&gt;She places her good paw on your chest
&gt;”If I can always find y0u waiting f0r me here, I will give y0u everything I can.”
&gt;That’s all you need to hear
&gt;Nobody else’s voice would sound right to you anymore



[[ CHAPTER 2: L0ve in a Gorge0us Dress ]]

&gt;4n0n the courier on another delivery
&gt;Your russet, cybernetic wolf companion R0uga is the client once again
&gt;Like last time, you have no idea what’s in the parcel
&gt;It’s a much larger box, though fairly light
&gt;Whatever it is, it’s cause for R0uga to threaten you for the first time since you met her
&gt;”D0n’t let it get damaged, n0 matter what y0u d0,” she warns you in that stern, modulated voice
&gt;Her glowing eyes and half-artificial muzzle don’t faze you in the slightest anymore, but disappointing a close friend?
&gt;A lover even?
&gt;That’s the biggest fear imaginable
&gt;You retrieved the objective in an alley half blocked by an inconspicuous truck
&gt;A horse with an excessive number of piercings and several data jacks along his neck handed you the container
&gt;”Be careful with this,” he muttered. “Just got an upgrade to my own package, if ya’ know what I mean, and I don’ want it ripped off if the goods don’ get to her in mint condition.”
&gt;Way too much information there, buddy
&gt;The box itself was from what you recognized to be a high-class, luxury apparel chain
&gt;Ah, maybe kind of like hiding a gun in a box of roses?
&gt;You’ve gotten a couple of those types of deliveries in your career
&gt;But it seemed a little dangerous to hide the objective in a container from such an expensive, reputable department store
&gt;Not that you can’t handle a few muggers, but R0uga is usually more conscious of things like that
&gt;When you return to the grungy little apartment the wolf’s eyes light up
&gt;Literally
&gt;But when you present the box she backs away
&gt;”Put it d0wn,” her voice warbles, “and help me take this 0ff first.”
&gt;She holds out her vicious, razor-equipped arm
&gt;You pull it from its shoulder socket, and the wolf screams in pain
&gt;It hasn’t gotten much less difficult to remove the augment, but you do believe there’s a tiny bit more ease to it
&gt;Not because of an increase of tolerance on R0uga’s part, but because you’re there to comfort her
&gt;Or so you like to think
&gt;As you set down the clawed weapon she snatches up the box with her good arm and shuts herself in the bathroom
&gt;Silence
&gt;Minutes go by
&gt;You hear faint ruffling, then a click
&gt;More silence
&gt;Then sobbing
&gt;You knock, but there’s no response
&gt;Worried, you open the door
&gt;Standing in front of the mirror is R0uga, wearing a beautiful strapless dress that flows down past her metal ankles
&gt;Inserted into her empty shoulder socket is a decorative corsage designed like a blooming flower or a firework’s explosion
&gt;A silky gorget is wrapped around her neck and several sparkling bands occupy her solo arm
&gt;Even with cyber eyes she manages to shed a few tears
&gt;The organic lip on the top half of her mouth quivers over the metal jaw beneath
&gt;She shifts her gaze to you in the reflection and gives a timid smile
&gt;You put your hands on the cyber wolf’s shoulders
&gt;Her throat makes a melodic whining sound
&gt;Her ears, both natural and prosthetic, fold back
&gt;’T-thank y0u, 4n0n.”

&gt;R0uga spends extra time cleaning herself up before the two of you head out for a night on the town
&gt;She keeps the hem of her dress pulled up slightly to keep it off the dirty concrete
&gt;If you covered up the manufactured pieces, she’d look like quite the well-groomed, aristocratic wolf
&gt;But it’s the whole bundle you love about her, flaws and all
&gt;You pass a familiar theater with the outside walls covered in posters
&gt;Each one advertising some gorgeous celebrity or performer
&gt;R0uga puffs her chest out to look dignified, but your gentle touch reminds her of whose judgment means the most
&gt;The fanciest club on this side of town is like a haven amidst the ghettos and ruins
&gt;The doorman gives R0uga a once-over, but you’re admitted in without a fuss as the wolf adds a little extra to the cover fee
&gt;Without a single drink or dance she already looks like she’s fulfilled her life’s biggest goal
&gt;Fitting in
&gt;She doesn’t even touch alcohol for a while, and her dancing is just a reserved bob of the head and slight leaning from side to side
&gt;She’s a pup at a prom, and you’re happy to be there with her
&gt;You eventually grab some refreshments and lounge at the bar
&gt;R0uga orders her drink with a straw
&gt;The bartender is a young human woman with the same neon, half-shaven haircut that no rebellious punk can be without these days
&gt;”Your girl’s outfitted pretty nicely there,” she says, flipping around a cocktail shaker
&gt;R0uga looks down to her dress with a grin
&gt;”Thank y0u.”
&gt;”Actually, I meant your chrome.”
&gt;R0uga’s luminous eyes go wide, and she chuckles shyly
&gt;You wrap an arm around her waist
&gt;There’s a subtle way she fidgets in her seat, as though she’d be wagging her tail furiously if she still had one
&gt;The night can’t go without a hitch, sadly
&gt;A small posse of boars and their boar-like human leader come stomping up to the bar
&gt;”Never thought you’d bother showing your ugly muzzle around a ritzy place like this, R0uga,” the leader snorts
&gt;He jabs you in the chest with his fat knuckles
&gt;”This your bitch for the night?”
&gt;”D0n’t y0u t0uch him!” she growls
&gt;You’re ready to grab a bottle to smash over his head if given the chance
&gt;Even the bartender reaches behind the counter for a little “backup” if the situation goes south
&gt;The thug sneers at the wolf
&gt;”Never mind the dress, you’re not so intimidating without that nasty claw of yours. Did ya’ leave it in your purse tonight?”
&gt;He reaches over and grabs a handful of the petals on her corsage
&gt;And she grabs his wrist
&gt;You hear the snapping of bone as the man wails in pain
&gt;”I d0n’t need it. I’m still str0nger than y0u.”
&gt;The wolf sweeps the man’s legs and uses the momentum to throw him against the bar
&gt;It leaves an impressive dent in the surface, but clearly outdone by the one on his head
&gt;The boar lackeys back off in fear
&gt;Several other clubbers look shocked and worried, though a few look relieved to have such an obnoxious brute taken out
&gt;R0uga looks to the bartender in shame
&gt;”I’m s0rry….”
&gt;The punkish girl takes out a tablecloth and wipes the spot the thug slammed into with a smirk
&gt;”I didn’t see shit.”

&gt;You and R0uga find a private, enclosed booth to get away from the crowd for a while
&gt;She strokes the damaged corsage as though it were a dying pet
&gt;It’s crumpled a bit and a few petals were torn out in the scuffle
&gt;”It wasn’t t00 cheap either,” she laughs morosely
&gt;You take her paw in your hands
&gt;You tell her you like it better this way
&gt;”D0 y0u…h0nestly mean it?”
&gt;Absolutely
&gt;The extravagant clothes aren’t who she is
&gt;Even the bartender appreciated the wolf for her imperfections
&gt;Now her clothes start to better match the rest of the rugged, asymmetrical look of the one-of-a-kind wolf you truly care for
&gt;”In that case, I supp0se I w0n’t need this dress n0w.”
&gt;R0uga takes the bottom of her dress and slowly rolls it up with her one arm
&gt;You think she’s going to stop at her legs, or even her thighs
&gt;But when she keeps going you see she wasn’t keeping anything hidden underneath
&gt;Her glistening lips, spared from the cyber-surgery that adorns other parts of her body, are swollen and inviting
&gt;She moves to where you’re sitting and relieves you of the painful growth being restricted by your pants
&gt;”Y0u have given me s0 much l0ve I can’t pay y0u back f0r. I want t0 change that.”
&gt;She eases down onto your lap, warming you with her lustful heat
&gt;R0uga certainly doesn’t need you to hold her up for support, but she leans into you nonetheless with her arm wrapped around your neck
 &gt;She’s pressed up against you so closely you can hear the humming of her bionic insides
&gt;Her hips pump on your shaft, riding her dress up enough for you to reach in and stroke her back
&gt;Kissing is still a little too awkward for her, but you plant one on her furry muzzle and give her the attention she deserves
&gt;She doesn’t feel like a damaged, worn out creature
&gt;Rather, an experienced, well-loved queen
&gt;R0uga could break you in an instant, and there are some days you see the bad side of her
&gt;Well, YOU aren’t on the receiving end, but you don’t envy the souls of those who are
&gt;However, it’s moments like this that make you power through the dangers
&gt;Her growls are whirs and her squeaks are chirps, unafraid of how you’ll react to her noises
&gt;The bucking becomes fevered
&gt;Her tightness even more electrifying than you could dream of
&gt;Maybe she DID enhance something down there…
&gt;You reach your edge and her howling pushes you over with her
&gt;Your climax rings in you ears along with her voice and she brings the two of you down with a metallic coo
&gt;If you weren’t blinded by the stars of the afterglow, her piercing eyes do the trick as they shine directly into yours
&gt;When your vision returns, R0uga’s paw is reaching for your cheek
&gt;”4n0n…”
&gt;She leans in close to your ear
&gt;”I love you.”
&gt;The volume of her voice is so hushed you can’t hear the feedback or the modulation added to it
&gt;You think she’s doing it to please you, as though she were a regular wolf
&gt;You tell her to say it again
&gt;Not because you’re THAT conceited, but because you want to hear her words the way you love
&gt;”4n0n, I l0ve y000u!”
&gt;The only thing restrictive and out of place on your cybernetic wolf at this point is the dress
&gt;And it’s getting boxed up the second you get back to the apartment, right before you continue the passion well into the morning



[[ CHAPTER 3: The G00d D0cter ]]

&gt;It’s a serene moment in your squalor of an apartment
&gt;Though your living conditions haven’t improved much since you moved in with R0uga, having her around is all you need most days
&gt;You get the sense she feels the same way about you
&gt;You’ve gotten a glimpse at how many credits the russet cyberwolf has stashed away, and it’s no small sum
&gt;But with how much tech and chrome she has to maintain, you can understand why she’d hoard her wealth for special circumstances
&gt;Such is the life of one who runs the shadows just to make ends meet
&gt;Still, she enjoys cheap comforts having little to do with being frugal
&gt;When the two of you return from a long or rough day—like getting jumped by a dozen tweaking gangers—she just wants to sit down with a nice box of Insta-Din
&gt;You even get it ready for her as she cleans off all the ganger blood
&gt;R0uga sits happily in front of the television, chomping away at her food
&gt;Watching college Wreckball intently
&gt;She’s a completely different person when she’s not out on the streets fighting for her life
&gt;When she isn’t outfitted with her razor-claw limb, she wears decorative prosthetic caps
&gt;Like the corsage she wore on your date
&gt;It’s incredible how dexterous she can be with just one good arm
&gt;In more ways than one
&gt;The weathered cyberwolf gives you a friendly smile
&gt;So much about her is flawed, but none of the well-groomed or cosmetically augmented anthros do anything for you
&gt;And what R0uga lacks in organic parts she makes up for with affection
&gt;Her glowing eyes close with blissful contentment, but they suddenly snap back open
&gt;In the brighter of the two eyes, a fleck of red flashes in the corner
&gt;No doubt some kind of HUD icon alerting her to something
&gt;Something that scares her
&gt;R0uga never shows fear, but now she’s shaking in her seat
&gt;You try to console her, but it just makes the shaking worse
&gt;Her voice warbles in its modulated way
&gt;”It’s alm0st time for r0utine maintenance,” she whines. “I have t0 g0 t0 the d0ct0r f0r a checkup and repairs.”
&gt;Well, fear of doctor visits is understandable
&gt;You can only imagine what they mean for someone like R0uga
&gt;”Please, 4n0n,” she says to you, “I d0n’t want to g0 al0ne. Will y0u c0me with me?”
&gt;You technically never stopped being hired by R0uga to be her supervisor
&gt;Her guardian and caretaker
&gt;In exchange for a place to live and a share of her credits, you’re obligated to assist her however she needs it
&gt;But all that is irrelevant when you would do anything she asks purely out of love
&gt;You’d never think to leave her, even if it means putting your life on the line for whatever mission she has to deal with
&gt;You give R0uga your promise to go along with her
&gt;Her shaking lessens
&gt;”Thank y0u…”
&gt;She looks glumly to her weaponized arm sitting in the corner of the room
&gt;Not exactly an eager look on her face as she removes the corsage and places it gingerly on the couch beside her

&gt;Even with the amount of wealth R0uga has, she still can’t afford top-of-the-line enhancements
&gt;Most of her augments help her perform better than any human by far, but the models are outdated and the wear on them is significant
&gt;Licensed medical facilities won’t even touch her at this point, no matter how much money she’d throw at them
&gt;When the world is steeped in litigation and red tape, your life exists in its own separate world
&gt;You’re effectively classless, even below wage slaves
&gt;Hell, it’s been ages since you’ve gone to a “formal” doctor yourself
&gt;It’s just too costly, and when you run the shadows not a lot of clinics will take your insurance card
&gt;Not your legal one, anyway…
&gt;So rather than get her gear at an authorized seller, R0uga has to settle for a more “independent” distributor
&gt;Skirting the city limits is a bar you’ve since grown to be familiar with
&gt;The Dive and Dunkle
&gt;True to its name, it’s the definition of a dive bar
&gt;Dark by intention, and by the character of its patrons to boot
&gt;R0uga takes you here from time to time, but it’s not for a few drinks this evening
&gt;The cyberwolf’s eyes glow especially bright in the dim ambiance
&gt;The two of you make your way to the bar counter, where a minotaur is scrubbing the inside of a glass with his littlest finger
&gt;”Little early for you to be drinking, R0uga,” the minotaur grumbles. “I expect you’re lookin’ for Snippet?”
&gt;The cyberwolf nods silently
&gt;”A’right.”
&gt;The minotaur leans in and lowers his voice to a bassy whisper
&gt;”It’s 1, 14, 15, 14 tonight. Inner, outer, outer, inner.”
&gt;R0uga nods again, then heads toward the very back of the bar
&gt;You follow her into a game room, where lumpy billiard tables and flickering arcade machines go unused
&gt;Along the far wall is an inconspicuous dartboard
&gt;To a seasoned hired hand like yourself, “inconspicuous” is the first place you look for something hidden
&gt;R0uga taps the spaces of the dartboard with her good arm
&gt;After putting in the sequence she presses the bull’s-eye
&gt;The wall swings open, leading to some downward stairs
&gt;Things like this rarely catch you off guard, but it’s a little surprising that R0uga has never taken you here before
&gt;Though if she’s not looking forward to whatever it is, then you’re not so sorry about being left in the dark
&gt;The two of you descend to an underground mall of sorts
&gt;Not very spacious, but packed with anything one would need for any kind of shadowy “service”
&gt;A wall of guns behind impenetrable glass
&gt;A drug store for heavily discounted pharmaceuticals
&gt;A forgery station for any document, physical or electronic
&gt;And finally, a clinic
&gt;Basically a glorified chop shop and secondhand augmentation fence
&gt;[The Doctor Is In], a small sign reads outside the door next to a waiting bench
&gt;You’re a little tense not knowing what’s in there
&gt;R0uga’s tense knowing exactly what’s in there
&gt;With a deep breath from both of you, you enter the doctor’s office
&gt;There’s no formal reception here, just a desk with nearby examination table
&gt;And a pretty heavily locked closet
&gt;Behind the desk is a homely looking female opossum, puffing away at an electronic cigar
&gt;She looks from R0uga to you, then back to her with little beetle eyes
&gt;”You came faster than usual, R0uga” she croaks. “Definitely didn’t think you’d show up tonight. I was just going to head home.”
&gt;”I have s0me0ne with me for m0ral supp0rt,” the cyberwolf says
&gt;The opossum’s eyes are back on you
&gt;”To…wait for you? You know I can’t let you have someone in here during the examination.”
&gt;”Please, Dr. Snippet,” R0uga says, “he w0n’t be any tr0uble. I give y0u my w0rd.”
&gt;The opossum takes one last draw of her cigar and sighs the smoke out
&gt;”Alright, fine. Up on the table with you.”
&gt;You pull up a chair next to R0uga while Snippet snaps some gloves on
&gt;The doctor grabs R0uga’s chrome arm near the shoulder
&gt;”You ready?” she coughs
&gt;R0uga’s other paw finds your hands
&gt;You clench it tightly with a quick kiss
&gt;”Three…two…one…”
&gt;The arm is wrenched out with a sickening jerk
&gt;R0uga howls in pain, but it’s a short-lived cry
&gt;Snippet looks shocked, nearly fumbling the arm as though it has a mind of its own
&gt;”You’re full of surprises today, girl,” she laughs in disbelief. “That’s the easiest I’ve ever seen you take it.”
&gt;The cyberwolf pants softly and looks to you with relief
&gt;She’s not wrong
&gt;Though it’s not a process she enjoys, R0uga gets better at handling the removal each time
&gt;”Alright, you’re going to have to strip down next, so you might want to ask your friend to—“
&gt;R0uga removes her clothes down to her underwear without hesitation
&gt;Snippet blinks in amusement
&gt;”So…you’re just for moral support, huh?” the opossum says to you
&gt;You continue to hold R0uga’s paw as the doctor begins the examination
&gt;She pokes and prods around R0uga, making verbal notes as she goes
&gt;”Heart rate nominal. The adrenaline dispenser battery has good life to it still. Spinal reinforcements decent…might need to pop this one back into alignment…a…bit…there!”
&gt;R0uga grunts through the procedure, but she doesn’t look to be in too much pain
&gt;”Cyber-optics looking fine, though it doesn’t look like there’s much I can do about the glow on this one. No effect on vision, though, from what I can tell.”
&gt;Snippet cleans out the wolf’s shoulder socket, checks her jaw for any loose screws, and calibrates the cybernetic ear
&gt;”Prosthetic arm connection looks a little stripped. Might have to get that changed out someday. Honestly, I wish you’d just get a regular arm instead of that hideous looking thing. I could get you a decent price on something thrice-used.”
&gt;The cyberwolf just shakes her head
&gt;”I’m fine with0ut anything in there when I’m n0t using it. 4n0n is my sec0nd arm.”
&gt;”Yeah, that much I got.”
&gt;Snippet grabs a tray after the examination is over
&gt;There are several needles and bottles arranged haphazardly on it
&gt;R0uga’s breathing gets faster
&gt;”You know the drill. Gotta get the fluids running well and the spots ‘round the chrome vaccinated. You, uh, may want to hold her still a while longer.”
&gt;R0uga’s paw is practically crushing your hand, but you stay strong for her sake
&gt;Her pelt is assaulted with shots and burning tinctures
&gt;It only takes a few minutes to apply everything, but time stretches on as you watch the wolf’s duress
&gt;Finally, the chrome arm is snapped back on
&gt;When the job’s all done, Snippet pats R0uga on the leg
&gt;”Maybe it was for the best to let your friend help out. You did an amazing job keeping your cool this time. I got to walk away without any slashes, too.”
&gt;R0uga looks at the opossum sheepishly
&gt;She gets dressed and hands over a credstick to the doctor
&gt;”You’re good to go. I’ll send a reminder for your next checkup as usual.”
&gt;The cyberwolf looks to Snippet expectantly
&gt;The opossum chuckles roughly
&gt;”Fine, you big baby.”
&gt;She digs through her desk and pulls out a stick of rock candy
&gt;R0uga munches away at it with glee as you both head back up to the bar

&gt;When you reach the apartment, R0uga looks a little woozy
&gt;”I feel s0 s0re every time I c0me h0me from that.”
&gt;Despite her condition, she still wants that arm out of her
&gt;The anesthetics make it a much simpler chore for both of you
&gt;You lead R0uga to the bed and ease her down
&gt;”I’ll have t0 rest a while…while the drugs w0rk thr0ugh my system.”
&gt;She went through a lot today, for sure
&gt;The least you can do now is make her feel comfortable
&gt;You massage her neck and shoulders
&gt;R0uga hums loudly as you work your fingers into her fur
&gt;Your thumbs travel downward and dig into the muscles opposite her metal spine
&gt;Then you return to her head and stroke her cheeks and the top of her muzzle
&gt;She’s in complete rapture
&gt;But there’s still one more spot to tend to
&gt;Her torn, organic ear
&gt;Ever since you’ve found her biggest weakness, it’s become her favorite spot for you to play with
&gt;You delicately rub the back of her ear and gently squeeze the folds
&gt;Your fingertips glide over the ridges, following the motion of the ear as she swivels it around
&gt;You even give it a playful bite with your lips
&gt;R0uga shudders with pleasure
&gt;Not every intimate moment with her needs to be sexual
&gt;Most of the time, this is more than enough for her
&gt;The parts of her not plated or screwed in are highly sensitive, but not in a harmful way
&gt;She needs this
&gt;Not just the attention, but also your devotion
&gt;”If I had g0tten the aut0-v0cals, I w0uld tell y0u h0w much I l0ve y0u 0ver and 0ver again…all night l0ng.”
&gt;She turns to face you and wraps her good arm around your body
&gt;Her strength allows her to give you the firmest, warmest hug you’ve ever had
&gt;”But I’ll say it anyway f0r as l0ng… as I stay awake…”
&gt;You lay her back against the pillows, then tuck her under the sheets
&gt;Only her smiling head is visible
&gt;”I l0ve y0u… I l0ve y0u… I l0ve y0u…4n0n…”
&gt;Just like she said, she repeats those words to you until fatigue lulls her to sleep
&gt;You give R0uga a kiss on the top of her muzzle
&gt;It’s probably going to be Insta-Din again when she wakes up, but you’ll be there to make it for her
&gt;With R0uga at peace, you join her under the covers
&gt;You clutch her paw and intertwine your fingers
&gt;You’ll be there for her



[[ CHAPTER 4: G00dnight R0uga ]]

&gt;It’s been a long day for you and R0uga
&gt;Three separate jobs, and three deals that fell through
&gt;Go deliver a nondescript “special package” from Point A to Point B?
&gt;Well, gotta be intercepted by an interloping gang along the way
&gt;They weren’t even going after the correct target either
&gt;Go escort a young woman to a designated location and be her protection for the trip?
&gt;Well, you got roped into a quarrel between two rival street factions
&gt;Which meant twice as many casualties
&gt;Go to a gas station and simply tell the cashier he needs to come home early tonight?
&gt;Well, now someone’s going to have to clean up all the bloodstains in addition to the pools of soda and snack debris everywhere
&gt;You still don’t even know how that all escalated so quickly
&gt;In all three situations, it was the oxen gangers “The Meat Beaters” who were the antagonists
&gt;So after the third altercation, R0uga personally tracked down their ringleader and snapped both his horns off
&gt;You never saw where they ended up
&gt;And on top of everything else, it rained the entirety of the day
&gt;The two of you are dripping as you return to the apartment
&gt;R0uga starts screaming in her discordant, modulated wail
&gt;She normally does this after yanking her cyber arm out of its socket, but you can tell this is mainly out of frustration from the chaotic day
&gt;So when the arm is actually disconnected you can’t tell when the screaming from the physical pain starts and the emotional pain ends
&gt;Freed from her lethal augment, R0uga proceeds to strip herself down to nothing and toss her sopping clothes into a corner
&gt;”Rem0ve y0urs t00,” she commands. “We will sh0wer t0gether.”
&gt;Good way to save water
&gt;There’s not a lot of room to move around with the two of you sharing the shower, but there never needs to be
&gt;You’re pressed up against one another, washing the other’s back
&gt;The frigid rains are rinsed off so soothing heat can replace them
&gt;While you try to be gentle with R0uga to placate her, it has little effect
&gt;She’s still a little agitated from it all, scrubbing you aggressively without thinking
&gt;Your skin’s going to be pretty raw in the morning
&gt;But her stress swirls down the drain as you cleanse the unpleasantness out of her pelt
&gt;You’ve shared intimate moments together while bathing, but tonight it’s more of a typical routine
&gt;Something to be over and done with, much like the day
&gt;Perhaps R0uga wants to save the intimacy for bed?
&gt;Not likely
&gt;You’re guessing tonight isn’t going to progress very far beyond some cuddling
&gt;You’re both wiped out and sleep is priceless
&gt;R0uga’s long yawn sounds like a mix between a whale’s singing and the hum of a turbine
&gt;When you dry her fur off she sways in your arms
&gt;You have to physically keep her upright so she doesn’t pass out on the floor
&gt;”Race y0u t0 bed, 4n0n,” she mumbles, hanging onto your back as you shuffle out of the bathroom
&gt;If there’s one thing you make sure the derelict apartment always has when you leave for the morning, it’s clean, tidy sheets for when you return
&gt;It’s the least you can do to reward the two of you after whatever hardships the day throws your way
&gt;You lay the russet cyberwolf down and tuck her in
&gt;”Aaaaahhhhh-00000hhhhh…” R0uga croons as she tries to wiggle deeper into the mattress
&gt;She has an ensemble of noises she makes when she settles down for a particularly peaceful slumber
&gt;Little squeaks and buzzes
&gt;A howl or two that ends with a pop-like hiccup
&gt;The faintest rattle of her jaw as she inhales deeply, followed by a soft whistling as she sighs
&gt;It’s hard not to listen to the symphony and be amused
&gt;It was concerning and a little hard to get used to at first, but it’s something you’ve grown to expect and even appreciate
&gt;Any noise is good noise; it means you’re still alive
&gt;”4n0n, c0me to bed already,” she huffs
&gt;She tries scooting over to demonstrate there’s more than enough room for you, but she’s too tired to move much
&gt;”If y0u d0n’t get under here s00n, I w0n’t be awake l0ng en0ugh t0 tell y0u h0w much I l0ve y0u.”
&gt;Well, that’s motivation enough
&gt;You shut the lights off and slip under the sheets with her
&gt;”That’s m0re like it.”
&gt;Her good arm—her strong arm—wraps over you and pulls you tightly into her clean fur
&gt;You manage to get your own arm around her head so you can stroke her torn ear
&gt;Her cybernetic one folds into place and her eyes dim as they slowly close
&gt;L0ve y000uuu…” R0uga trails off
&gt;You give her ear attention for a little while before you drift off yourself
 
&gt;Did you even fall asleep, or where you only out for a few minutes?
&gt;You look to R0uga, whose glowing eyes are looking right back at you
&gt;Among all her nighttime noise, you hear another familiar one
&gt;The gurgling of her stomach
&gt;”We didn’t have an 0pp0rtunity to eat much t0day,” she laments
&gt;She tries to go back to sleep, but every rumble makes her shift around uncomfortably
&gt;”Maybe just a snack t0 tide me 0ver until m0rning.”
&gt;The cyberwolf rolls out of bed and scavenges through the kitchen
&gt;Her stash of Insta-Din is completely empty
&gt;As is much of the fridge
&gt;”We didn’t g0 get gr0ceries either,” she sighs
&gt;Maybe she should have grabbed some ox when she had the chance, you joke
&gt;”I kn0w…” R0uga says, a bit too seriously
&gt;She can be a little scary sometimes
&gt;”Maybe we can 0rder in f0r delivery?”
&gt;The only place crazy enough to deliver out here at this time at night is D’jammin’ Hut
&gt;And that’s only because they have armored vehicles
&gt;Not to mention it’ll practically be morning by the time they arrive
&gt;All that you can make is what you call “Terminal Sandwiches”
&gt;Basically any leftover condiments on top of crackers
&gt;Oh, and a single pack of dry noodles
&gt;So essentially one big cracker because of the way R0uga chomps into it without boiling the noodles first
&gt;It’s not a luxurious meal, but it’s enough to satiate her
&gt;”F0r n0w,” she says
&gt;She licks your face as you head back into bed
&gt;A little too much, maybe
&gt;When she nips your ear, then you get a little worried
&gt;”Y0u d0n’t need b0th 0f them,” she says with a hollow chuckle. “I g0t used t0 it.”
&gt;She smiles devilishly up until you fall asleep again
 
&gt;Several loud bangs jolt you awake
&gt;Nearby gangers, unsurprisingly
&gt;It’s a sad reality how close you live to their petty turf wars
&gt;On any other night, R0uga would eagerly pop her arm back in and go out to give them a deadly lesson
&gt;Tonight, however, she doesn’t want to put up with that shit
&gt;But it’s more than enough to wake her to a nasty mood
&gt;Her cyber ear stands up and her eyes flash with blinding anger
&gt;You try to comfort her, but she wrenches herself from your grip
&gt;Over to the window she goes, throwing it open and leaning outside
&gt;Without warning she lets out a deafening bellow that covers the entire neighborhood
&gt;And probably a good ways into the city
&gt;It’s enough to make your ears ring
&gt;The echo dies out, and you can hear the frightened shouts of the encroaching gangers as they scramble off
&gt;Even those who don’t know R0uga’s reputation know not to stick around when they hear her threats
&gt;The cyberwolf hangs her head long after the commotion dies down
&gt;”Idi0t…” she growls
&gt;She turns to you with a defeated look on her face
&gt;”My adrenaline dispenser went 0ff,” she whines.
&gt;Oh boy…
&gt;”I w0n’t be able t0 get t0 sleep…”
&gt;It’s happened a few times in the past, always triggered by some kind for combative response or high tension
&gt;For her, it’s like guzzling an entire pot of coffee right before bed
&gt;And you don’t have any sedatives to counter it
&gt;The only thing you can really do is ride it out
&gt;”Y0u sh0uld get s0me rest,” she says. “I w0n’t make any s0und.”
&gt;It wouldn’t be easy to sleep knowing R0uga’s so miserable
&gt;Or still hungry
&gt;So you tell her you’ll try to stay up with her as long as you can
&gt;Which might not be too long with how the day went
&gt;You start by helping her exercise a bit to help deplete that extra energy
&gt;It’s amazing how many one-paw pushups that cyberwolf can do
&gt;Even adding extra weight to her back doesn’t stop her from powering through dozens of sets
&gt;Unfortunately, it seems to make the situation worse
&gt;Now she’s hyperactive AND sore
&gt;Her arm quivers with strain
&gt;”H0w ab0ut s0me vide0 games next?”
&gt;That would have been a much better way to spend such a rainy, miserable day
&gt;All your more modern systems with sophisticated one-handed controllers have broken over the last few weeks
&gt;Ironically it’s just the ancient one-stick, one-button system you have left
&gt;R0uga’s pretty adept at maneuvering those with her fingers, though
&gt;Even using her toes if need be
&gt;You play games for about an hour with little success
&gt;The strain in her arm makes her accuracy shaky, putting her at a disadvantage
&gt;In turn, it just makes her get competitive
&gt;Resulting in making her more feisty
&gt;You have to stop her from breaking this system as well
&gt;Next she tries to calm down with some meditation
&gt;Deep breathing and stillness
&gt;Sitting rigid and droning deeply from her chest
&gt;With a body as busy as hers, you wouldn’t think she’s capable of ignoring her inner distractions
&gt;Quite the opposite, according to her
&gt;”It helped me get used t0 my b0dy after all the m0difications…” she says. “S0 n0w I barely n0tice them anym0re.”
&gt;The meditation only goes so far, however
&gt;Her cyber ear swivels at every little noise
&gt;And she fidgets relentlessly with the adrenaline still lingering
&gt;You try to massage her shoulders to remove the tension in her body
&gt;”Maybe we can bl0w 0ff s0me steam?” she coos
&gt;You know what she’s suggesting, but neither of you are really in the right condition to go at it
&gt;Just moving around is agonizing for her now after a day’s worth of struggles and countless pushups
&gt;The two of you just sit and watch TV for a while
&gt;Bobcat Roscoe’s painting show is pretty good for relaxation
&gt;It’s well into the witching hour when a yawn is finally coaxed out of the cyberwolf
&gt;”I think I’m ready…at l0ng last,” she says
&gt;What a relief
&gt;You support the cyberwolf’s weathered body back to the bed and tuck her in once more
&gt;You stroke her fur and give kisses where they’re needed
&gt;R0uga holds you tightly again, fighting off slumber longer than you do
&gt;”Please, rest. Y0u’ve d0ne all y0u can f0r me.”
&gt;She nuzzles your face with the top of her snout
&gt;”I l0ve y0u, 4n0n.”
&gt;Sleep finally takes you
 
&gt;It’s almost sunrise, but that means nothing when you plan on sleeping in to make up for a long night
&gt;R0uga finally found her own peace
&gt;But you soon hear whimpering from her
&gt;The leftover energy and the lack of sleep must be giving her some vivid dreams
&gt;Not good ones either
&gt;She clutches you painfully every few minutes, which is probably what woke you in the first place
&gt;It’s not uncommon for her dreams to be plagued with bad memories
&gt;You’ve delved into her psyche a few times in conversations, and it’s understandable what you’ve learned troubles her
&gt;The pain of multiple surgeries and shoddy treatments
&gt;The rejection and ostracizing from most “civilized” social groups
&gt;The carnage from endless battles with foes, even if the fighting was completely justified
&gt;That poor girl
&gt;Do you wake her and risk her being unable to fall back asleep?
&gt;Or do you shake the nightmares from her?
&gt;The discomfort of her claws on your chest urges you to do the latter
&gt;She twitches when you rouse her from her sleep, then grabs hold even tighter as she tries to figure out what’s happening
&gt;4n0n?” she says groggily
&gt;You reassure her, hoping she won’t be too mad
&gt;”N0…I was having r0tten dreams. Thank y0u f0r getting rid 0f them…”
&gt;You ask how she feels
&gt;”Still very w0rn 0ut…”
&gt;You let R0uga know she’s free to sleep as much as she needs
&gt;It might even be a good opportunity to run out and stock up on food
&gt;”N0,” she says firmly, holding you down
&gt;She splays her body over you heavily
&gt;Her neck fur nearly suffocates you as she pins your head to the pillow
&gt;”Y0u are tired, t00,” she says matter-of-factly. “We will g0 0ut t0gether when we’re ready.”
&gt;She’s doing all she can to make you sink into the mattress
&gt;It almost makes you think she’s not as tired as she says anymore
&gt;But instead making up for lost time
&gt;Whatever she wants, you suppose
&gt;She got you through all the mess yesterday, so it’s only fair to repay her
&gt;Even though it’s still kind of difficult to breathe this way…
&gt;You try to shift R0uga over to the side, but she won’t budge
&gt;She just makes the fakest snoring imaginable
&gt;You stroke her back and comb through her fur with your fingers
&gt;Hoping to find some kind of safety latch to save yourself</textarea>
