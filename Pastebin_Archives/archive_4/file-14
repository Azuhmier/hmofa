Don’t worry about it. Just take a break for a few days and we’ll give it another shot, deal?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s heartbreaking to imagine the bird so stressed out like this</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The casualties weren’t even too severe, and you’re more concerned over the nasty collision she took</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re leaving the offices when you hear your name</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Anon, wait!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For how choked up she is, Perchia definitely has a beautiful voice to match her stunning plumage</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”A-Anon, I’m so, so sorry!

But…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She sniffles and wipes her eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I think they considered it. Between the accident and flubbing those rings, they weren’t too happy with me. I think I’d be out the door by now if they weren’t so impressed with how I dove in after you.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That’s right, you remember that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was a pretty nice dive (from what you could see), and she probably saved your life</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Thank you,” she chuckles, rubbing her neck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’m better with water than I am with fire, I guess.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s a long, awkward pause</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You thank Perchia for her help and concern</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Wait! Look, I want to make things right, and since we both have some time off I was hoping you’d…let me…take care of you?””</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She hides her face in her wings</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Either she’s embarrassed or already expecting rejection</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t want to crush the poor girl’s spirits, but she really doesn’t need to do THAT much for you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”It’s really no trouble, honest! I’d feel really bad if you got hurt again because of your arm.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her eyes well up with tears</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You give in, if nothing else than just to keep her from crying again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not far from the showground is an apartment tower where Perchia lives</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s available to both humans and anthros, and you can a see a few other birds flying up to the balconies of their homes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Unsurprisingly, her place is one of the highest up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”It’s not often I have to use the elevator,” she says. “This is kind of exciting!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’ve never paid much attention to how the bird anthros go about their daily lives</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So it’s a surprise to you when Perchia has to unlock her place with her feet, using a keyhole in the floor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Immediately it feels like walking into an oversized nest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Fabrics and cloths of all shapes and sizes are hung around the place for no particular rhyme or reason</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few lamps are visible through the open spots in the crisscrossing decoration, making beams of light pour in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Egg-like beanbags litter the floor, most of them untouched</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s a cozy space no doubt, and there’s a deliberate sort of “lived in” feeling adding to the comfort</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’m sorry for the mess,” Perchia says. I didn’t have much time to clean up.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t see a bed anywhere, just chairs with blankets and sheets draped over them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Perchia walks over to one and drops the back into a reclining position</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I knew this would come in handy someday!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Doesn’t look like she shares the space with anyone, so it can’t be seeing much use</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Yeah, it’s just me,” she says. “I don’t…have a lot of friends.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She rubs her shoulder with her wing, which is more of a fanning motion that makes a slight breeze</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Don’t get me wrong, a lot of the people in the show are nice, but the other birds can be a little snobbish. I had to get in really good shape just so they’d stop looking down on me.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She lets out a sigh that sounds like a whistle</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”And it’s just not easy making friends with mammals sometimes.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t see how it’s NOT easy for her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She seems so sweet and her performance so far is wonderful</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Perchia covers her face, her beak poking through her feathers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Well, m-make yourself at home!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Perchia is like a doting mother</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Any time you move to reach something, even with your good arm, she rushes over to help</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re not even allowed to stand without her trying to hold you down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You futility try convincing her your only injury is in your arm, and even then it’s not that bad</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When she needs to go to the store, you worry she might strap you down so you won’t get in trouble</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’ll be right back! Don’t…right back!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She heads out to the balcony and locks the sliding door behind her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The beautiful kingfisher gives one quick peek to you before making a graceful dive off the ledge</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s definitely not heading in the direction of any store at first, as she circles back into full view</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Checking up on you already?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe showing off a little bit?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;True to her word though, she has a satchel of groceries with her in minutes of leaving</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A lot of chopped veggies, grains, noodles, and very lean slices of fish and meat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Guess birds don’t like to carry a lot of canned foods or heavy bags when they make these kinds of trips</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Perchia sings as she cooks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s shockingly good at it to boot</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Oh, hehe, you’re too kind, Anon.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Why wouldn’t she go into a musical field with that kind of voice?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Every bird thinks she can sing, unfortunately, and there’s a lot of competition out there. You can’t even get work unless you join some kind of agency.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not many birds go into performing, then?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Theater and movies? Of course! But just the kind of stuff that’s safe and shows off their plumage. Not many want to be flying through rings of fire.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All the more reason you think Perchia is such a talented one</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She covers her face yet again, flinging soup splatter off her spoon everywhere</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Perchia is pretty fond of noodle dishes, and she serves you ramen for lunch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, it IS the food of choice for a young bachelor(ette)</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s pretty damn good ramen as well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Perchia waits until you’re practically done with your bowl before even making a dent in her own</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you’re finished she tries to get you to take some of hers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not like there isn’t more in the pot…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Eventually you have to get some blood flowing in your legs, putting Perchia on edge</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You’re not leaving already, are you?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t think she’s the type who cries to manipulate people, but man is she easy to upset at times</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell her you just want to go for a walk and stretch a bit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Oh, great! I’ll come with you!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She hurries to clean up a bit, noticing the blankets covering the reclining chair</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You know, you’re welcome to stay a few nights.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Things are moving pretty quickly now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe a little too much</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But Perchia seems to sense this, and she waits for your answer without the tears or pushing you too hard</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well the place is cozy, the food’s good, and she seems like a really cool friend </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sure, you’d be hap-</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”EEEEEEAAAAA! Great! We can swing by your place if you need anything!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So, you end up stopping at home, having to take a bus part of the way to get there</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t want to impose, so you ask how long she’s comfortable having you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Just take everything you can pack!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That’s the greatest, creepiest non-answer you could get</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You return from the excursion a few hours later carrying several bags of your stuff</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re a little worried how much space your things are going to take up in such a cramped little abode</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stack your belongings neatly into a corner</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Perchia immediately spreads them around on the floor casually and waves dismissively</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”What I have is even too big for me. Besides, I don’t like to spend much time here anyway.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You would have never guessed that from how shut in she kept you today</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;By now it’s getting late in the evening</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Perchia at least gives you enough privacy to get ready for sleep</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Goodnight, Anon,” she says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The bird sits up in one of the other chairs, as though meditating</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She must sleep like this, because you never see her change positions even in the middle of the night</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even if she accepted you into her home with open wings, you don’t want to burden the poor girl to exhaustion</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s already awake before you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Breakfast is waiting as well</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hash browns, waffle sticks, fruit…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Sorry, I didn’t cook any eggs.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yeah, that might have been a bit of a problem for her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Tell me about it. They’re so hard to carry safely from the store when you’re flying.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Hehe, you haven’t met a lot of birds, huh?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Guess not, or at least enough to know about their egg-laying culture</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s another meal where you’re offered part of her food on top of your own, giving her more time to plan the day’s events</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”So, anything you’d like to do? Did you still want to go over to the waterpark?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait, “still”?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”O-oh? I guess that conversation must have been part of my dream last night.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Freak-out in 3…2…1…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I-I-I MEAN, uh, you were in the dream, but I wasn’t, we didn’t, ngghh…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s hard to console with just words, so you try a different approach</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hold out your arms for a hug</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This actually works, as Perchia creeps closer to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Careful, your arm…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It feels much better already thanks to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even though it might be a few days before you can go to the waterpark, what with the brace and all</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”So you won’t need me soon, then?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If she’s happily offering her home to you, you’re not going to spurn her help for a bit longer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Plus, you need to make it up to her for her hospitality</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”No! I was repaying YOU. I don’t feel like I’ve done enough….”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe being a friend would be a good start?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Honestly, you never knew just how much you liked birds before holding one in your arms</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Everything is soft, but in a different way than a “furry” anthro is</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She has an incredibly athletic physique, yet she feels much lighter than you’d expect</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s a remarkable warmth radiating from her body, especially with her wings folded over you like a cape</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Perchia laughs nervously</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I-I don’t want to sound like I’m blaming you or anything but…when I miss a cue or don’t fly fast enough, it’s because I get distracted by you, Anon.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The last thing you’d believe is that a beautiful performer has the same feelings for you as you do her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’d feel bad if anyone got hurt or…worse…because of me, but it was even harder to watch it happen to YOU.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask if it was because of you that she had trouble with the fire rings</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”No! Well, no, I mean…a little bit. I just didn’t want you to see me mess up, and I ended up doing it anyway. The heat only makes it worse when you’re already a bit flustered….”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s a bit of guilt in her eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But it could be a reflection of your own</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were holding her back, technically speaking</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Would she even be able to perform if she knew you were watching?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Actually….”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her voice has a budding speck of confidence you haven’t seen much so far</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Knowing a good friend is watching would put me at ease. I was afraid you’d judge me before, but….”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You give her a tight squeeze, patting her on the back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have enough time off to see all of her opening shows, if she wants you there</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She responds with a giggling tweet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s a fair amount to do around the city apart from the water shows and Flood Frontier</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You spend most of the day with Perchia just milling about the streets, checking out the shops, and getting to do things unfit for a loner or too intimate to do with a large group</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like taking scenic pedicab rides, or getting cheesy pictures at photo booths</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The bird obviously spends much more time than you do here when she’s not practicing for performances, but still rarely gets to experience everything the city can offer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Between the excitement and caring for you at her place, she’s absolutely spent when it starts getting late</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re preparing for bed while she sits on her chair, fidgeting to get comfortable</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ask if she always sleeps like that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Well, I don’t HAVE to, but it’s just natural to me.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It could be the fatigue talking, or it could just be her way of warming up to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But Perchia’s certainly getting bolder when her wings spread open and she scoots back into her seat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Would you…like to try it?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You sit on her lap, and her wings wrap around you like a cloak</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You can lean back, if you want.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her chest, shoulder, and neck are downy touches better than any pillow you’ve ever felt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her breathing is slow and hypnotic, gently rocking you into relaxation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She coos a soft lullaby, barely passing out of her beak and into your ear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can only imagine this is what it feels like to be a bird’s young chick, encased in a feathery protection</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’d love for you to stay here with me,” Perchia says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s clever, you’ll give her that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She waited until you were too tired to say “no”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And now she’s swaying you to sleep with the idea planted into your dreams</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s definitely the most refreshing rest you’ve had in years</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A cloudless day over the lake</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The amphitheater is jammed with humans and anthros of all kinds</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There are a surprising number of them in bathing suits, whether they’re just coming back from the waterpark or expecting to get drenched here</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The show has it all: water skiers and paragliders, watercraft pulling synchronized pyramids of balancers, high divers and even stuntmen shot from cannons</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s not too long before the “air and water show” introduces some heat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Lanes of flame streak across the lake surface and a fiery curtain rises close to the front row, drawing everyone’s attention skyward</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Intense drumming sounds from the speakers, and Perchia appears on her perch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a proud flourish, the kingfisher leaps from her tower and soars through the flaming rings</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Each one she flies through is snuffed out in her wake</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She moves with an ethereal precision even more awe-inspiring than her rehearsals</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Finally comes the “tunnel” of shrinking rings aimed at the audience</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She told you there was a surprise added on at the last minute, inspired by the day the two of you were brought together</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Coming through the final ring she sails at the water right before the amphitheater</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some of the crowd recoils in fear of the incoming bird</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Perchia plunges under the surface like a dart</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The higher seats lean forward to try to find her, while those in the front keep their distance from the screen of fire</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before the ripples have a chance to settle, a teal-and-gold missile shoots back into the air</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She twirls above the audience, tossing glistening droplets in every direction</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The crowd screams and cheers as they’re sprinkled</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That’s the cue for the fire curtain to recede, as if doused by the graceful kingfisher</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Perchia climbs higher and out of sight, getting the biggest applause you’ve heard in the show</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Especially from you, clapping with two good arms until they both become sore</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She doesn’t show up again until after the performance is over, where a line of entertained guests are getting pictures and her autograph</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You expect this will go on for quite some time, every day of the show</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you patiently wait for her to finish with a smile on your face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After all, she’s your ride back home</div></li></ol>        </div>

&gt;Otto Barker’s Air and Water Show
&gt;One of the biggest tourist destinations in the city, second only to Flood Frontier Waterpark
&gt;An amphitheater rests on the edge of a grand lake
&gt;Empty now, but soon to be packed with visitors from across the country
&gt;Ramps, rings, and other obstacles float on the water’s surface, while perches and even more rings stand tall for the aerial stunts
&gt;You’re Anon, the part-time stagehand
&gt;You’re up on the scaffolding helping to set up the lights and speakers in preparation for the show
&gt;Many of the performers are also here, doing their rehearsals
&gt;One bird in particular has been distracting you from work for the last hour
&gt;She’s a gorgeous teal and gold kingfisher, lean and dexterous with a cute, narrow beak
&gt;Needless to say, she’s part of the sky team
&gt;She’s been doing swoops and corkscrews through the series of rings with unbelievable precision
&gt;She eventually lands on a roost to take a break, and a stumpy muskrat calls out to her on a megaphone
&gt;”Nice job, Perchia. When you’re ready we’ll get the fire going.”
&gt;You don’t need eagle eyes to see Perchia’s hesitation
&gt;She stares at the obstacle course glumly for a while, with the muskrat tapping his foot as time crawls on
&gt;Not a second passes after she gives the A-OK are the rings ignited
&gt;You can feel the heat even from your spot
&gt;”Ready?”
&gt;The music starts again, with Perchia waiting for her cue
&gt;You stop your work completely to watch her practice
&gt;The music swells, and Perchia dives through the first ring
&gt;But unlike the previous runs, her rotations and speed aren’t as stellar
&gt;Halfway through the course she’s missing some rings completely
&gt;Skipping whole segments…
&gt;Banking her turns too widely…
&gt;Uh oh
&gt;You barely have time to brace yourself before Perchia crashes into the scaffolding
&gt;A chunk of the support breaks, and your walkway turns into a slope
&gt;You’re thrown down the incline, trying to grab hold of something as best as you can
&gt;A shooting pain goes through your arm as your grip is jerked away by gravity
&gt;You’re banged up even more as you tumble downward
&gt;Then the scaffolding ends, and you’re in a free fall to the lake below
&gt;Your back slams against the water’s surface, immobilizing you with the shock
&gt;With your arm useless and your spine numb, you start sinking
&gt;You hold on to what little breath you had before it was beaten out of you
&gt;Getting…lightheaded…
&gt;You begin to black out
&gt;The last thing you see is a teal missile plunging into the water toward you

&gt;You come to your sense lying down with paramedics circling you
&gt;Just over their shoulders is Perchia, weeping heavily
&gt;She’s bandaged up a bit, but nothing too series
&gt;Still, you’re a bit worried about the crash she took
&gt;You aren’t given a chance to move much before you’re loaded into the ambulance
&gt;Perchia is still sobbing as she tries to get one last look at you before the doors close

&gt;A few examinations and a day of rest later you’re released with a small arm brace and little fanfare
&gt;There’s a sprain in your arm, but nothing that won’t heal eventually
&gt;You’re called in by management early in the morning to file an accident report 
&gt;Liabilities and insurance stuff…
&gt;Luckily, you get some time off with the promise of a little injury compensation for the incident
&gt;Emphasis on “little”
&gt;What troubles you most is what you overhear from the muskrat in the next room
&gt;And broken hiccupping from Perchia
&gt;”…Again, we’re not firing you, alright? Don’t worry about it. Just take a break for a few days and we’ll give it another shot, deal?”
&gt;It’s heartbreaking to imagine the bird so stressed out like this
&gt;The casualties weren’t even too severe, and you’re more concerned over the nasty collision she took
&gt;You’re leaving the offices when you hear your name
&gt;”Anon, wait!”
&gt;For how choked up she is, Perchia definitely has a beautiful voice to match her stunning plumage
&gt;”A-Anon, I’m so, so sorry! I didn’t mean for you to get hurt!”
&gt;That part’s a given; it WAS an accident, after all
&gt;You tell her you’re glad she’s okay, and apparently still has her job
&gt;”Oh, you heard that?”’
&gt;She sounds pained more from that than any injury
&gt;”Well, we’re going live in a few weeks, and it’s too late to train someone totally new. But…”
&gt;She sniffles and wipes her eyes
&gt;”I think they considered it. Between the accident and flubbing those rings, they weren’t too happy with me. I think I’d be out the door by now if they weren’t so impressed with how I dove in after you.”
&gt;That’s right, you remember that
&gt;It was a pretty nice dive (from what you could see), and she probably saved your life
&gt;”Thank you,” she chuckles, rubbing her neck
&gt;”I’m better with water than I am with fire, I guess.”
&gt;There’s a long, awkward pause
&gt;You thank Perchia for her help and concern
&gt;”Wait! Look, I want to make things right, and since we both have some time off I was hoping you’d…let me…take care of you?””
&gt;She hides her face in her wings
&gt;Either she’s embarrassed or already expecting rejection
&gt;You don’t want to crush the poor girl’s spirits, but she really doesn’t need to do THAT much for you
&gt;”It’s really no trouble, honest! I’d feel really bad if you got hurt again because of your arm.”
&gt;Her eyes well up with tears
&gt;You give in, if nothing else than just to keep her from crying again

&gt;Not far from the showground is an apartment tower where Perchia lives
&gt;It’s available to both humans and anthros, and you can a see a few other birds flying up to the balconies of their homes
&gt;Unsurprisingly, her place is one of the highest up
&gt;”It’s not often I have to use the elevator,” she says. “This is kind of exciting!”
&gt;You’ve never paid much attention to how the bird anthros go about their daily lives
&gt;So it’s a surprise to you when Perchia has to unlock her place with her feet, using a keyhole in the floor
&gt;Immediately it feels like walking into an oversized nest
&gt;Fabrics and cloths of all shapes and sizes are hung around the place for no particular rhyme or reason
&gt;A few lamps are visible through the open spots in the crisscrossing decoration, making beams of light pour in
&gt;Egg-like beanbags litter the floor, most of them untouched
&gt;It’s a cozy space no doubt, and there’s a deliberate sort of “lived in” feeling adding to the comfort
&gt;”I’m sorry for the mess,” Perchia says. I didn’t have much time to clean up.”
&gt;You don’t see a bed anywhere, just chairs with blankets and sheets draped over them
&gt;Perchia walks over to one and drops the back into a reclining position
&gt;”I knew this would come in handy someday!”
&gt;Doesn’t look like she shares the space with anyone, so it can’t be seeing much use
&gt;”Yeah, it’s just me,” she says. “I don’t…have a lot of friends.”
&gt;She rubs her shoulder with her wing, which is more of a fanning motion that makes a slight breeze
&gt;”Don’t get me wrong, a lot of the people in the show are nice, but the other birds can be a little snobbish. I had to get in really good shape just so they’d stop looking down on me.”
&gt;She lets out a sigh that sounds like a whistle
&gt;”And it’s just not easy making friends with mammals sometimes.”
&gt;You don’t see how it’s NOT easy for her
&gt;She seems so sweet and her performance so far is wonderful
&gt;Perchia covers her face, her beak poking through her feathers
&gt;”Well, m-make yourself at home!”

&gt;Perchia is like a doting mother
&gt;Any time you move to reach something, even with your good arm, she rushes over to help
&gt;You’re not even allowed to stand without her trying to hold you down
&gt;You futility try convincing her your only injury is in your arm, and even then it’s not that bad
&gt;When she needs to go to the store, you worry she might strap you down so you won’t get in trouble
&gt;”I’ll be right back! Don’t…right back!”
&gt;She heads out to the balcony and locks the sliding door behind her
&gt;The beautiful kingfisher gives one quick peek to you before making a graceful dive off the ledge
&gt;She’s definitely not heading in the direction of any store at first, as she circles back into full view
&gt;Checking up on you already?
&gt;Maybe showing off a little bit?
&gt;True to her word though, she has a satchel of groceries with her in minutes of leaving
&gt;A lot of chopped veggies, grains, noodles, and very lean slices of fish and meat
&gt;Guess birds don’t like to carry a lot of canned foods or heavy bags when they make these kinds of trips
&gt;Perchia sings as she cooks
&gt;She’s shockingly good at it to boot
&gt;”Oh, hehe, you’re too kind, Anon.”
&gt;Why wouldn’t she go into a musical field with that kind of voice?
&gt;”Every bird thinks she can sing, unfortunately, and there’s a lot of competition out there. You can’t even get work unless you join some kind of agency.”
&gt;Not many birds go into performing, then?
&gt;”Theater and movies? Of course! But just the kind of stuff that’s safe and shows off their plumage. Not many want to be flying through rings of fire.”
&gt;All the more reason you think Perchia is such a talented one
&gt;She covers her face yet again, flinging soup splatter off her spoon everywhere
&gt;Perchia is pretty fond of noodle dishes, and she serves you ramen for lunch
&gt;Well, it IS the food of choice for a young bachelor(ette)
&gt;It’s pretty damn good ramen as well
&gt;Perchia waits until you’re practically done with your bowl before even making a dent in her own
&gt;When you’re finished she tries to get you to take some of hers
&gt;Not like there isn’t more in the pot…
&gt;Eventually you have to get some blood flowing in your legs, putting Perchia on edge
&gt;”You’re not leaving already, are you?”
&gt;You don’t think she’s the type who cries to manipulate people, but man is she easy to upset at times
&gt;You tell her you just want to go for a walk and stretch a bit
&gt;”Oh, great! I’ll come with you!”
&gt;She hurries to clean up a bit, noticing the blankets covering the reclining chair
&gt;”You know, you’re welcome to stay a few nights.”
&gt;Things are moving pretty quickly now
&gt;Maybe a little too much
&gt;But Perchia seems to sense this, and she waits for your answer without the tears or pushing you too hard
&gt;Well the place is cozy, the food’s good, and she seems like a really cool friend 
&gt;Sure, you’d be hap-
&gt;”EEEEEEAAAAA! Great! We can swing by your place if you need anything!”
&gt;So, you end up stopping at home, having to take a bus part of the way to get there
&gt;You don’t want to impose, so you ask how long she’s comfortable having you
&gt;”Just take everything you can pack!”
&gt;That’s the greatest, creepiest non-answer you could get
&gt;You return from the excursion a few hours later carrying several bags of your stuff
&gt;You’re a little worried how much space your things are going to take up in such a cramped little abode
&gt;You stack your belongings neatly into a corner
&gt;Perchia immediately spreads them around on the floor casually and waves dismissively
&gt;”What I have is even too big for me. Besides, I don’t like to spend much time here anyway.”
&gt;You would have never guessed that from how shut in she kept you today
&gt;By now it’s getting late in the evening
&gt;Perchia at least gives you enough privacy to get ready for sleep
&gt;”Goodnight, Anon,” she says
&gt;The bird sits up in one of the other chairs, as though meditating
&gt;She must sleep like this, because you never see her change positions even in the middle of the night
&gt;Even if she accepted you into her home with open wings, you don’t want to burden the poor girl to exhaustion

&gt;She’s already awake before you
&gt;Breakfast is waiting as well
&gt;Hash browns, waffle sticks, fruit…
&gt;”Sorry, I didn’t cook any eggs.”
&gt;Yeah, that might have been a bit of a problem for her
&gt;”Tell me about it. They’re so hard to carry safely from the store when you’re flying.”
&gt;Oh
&gt;”Hehe, you haven’t met a lot of birds, huh?”
&gt;Guess not, or at least enough to know about their egg-laying culture
&gt;It’s another meal where you’re offered part of her food on top of your own, giving her more time to plan the day’s events
&gt;”So, anything you’d like to do? Did you still want to go over to the waterpark?”
&gt;Wait, “still”?
&gt;”O-oh? I guess that conversation must have been part of my dream last night.”
&gt;Freak-out in 3…2…1…
&gt;”I-I-I MEAN, uh, you were in the dream, but I wasn’t, we didn’t, ngghh…”
&gt;She’s hard to console with just words, so you try a different approach
&gt;You hold out your arms for a hug
&gt;This actually works, as Perchia creeps closer to you
&gt;”Careful, your arm…”
&gt;It feels much better already thanks to her
&gt;Even though it might be a few days before you can go to the waterpark, what with the brace and all
&gt;”So you won’t need me soon, then?”
&gt;If she’s happily offering her home to you, you’re not going to spurn her help for a bit longer
&gt;Plus, you need to make it up to her for her hospitality
&gt;”No! I was repaying YOU. I don’t feel like I’ve done enough….”
&gt;Maybe being a friend would be a good start?
&gt;Honestly, you never knew just how much you liked birds before holding one in your arms
&gt;Everything is soft, but in a different way than a “furry” anthro is
&gt;She has an incredibly athletic physique, yet she feels much lighter than you’d expect
&gt;There’s a remarkable warmth radiating from her body, especially with her wings folded over you like a cape
&gt;Perchia laughs nervously
&gt;”I-I don’t want to sound like I’m blaming you or anything but…when I miss a cue or don’t fly fast enough, it’s because I get distracted by you, Anon.”
&gt;The last thing you’d believe is that a beautiful performer has the same feelings for you as you do her
&gt;”I’d feel bad if anyone got hurt or…worse…because of me, but it was even harder to watch it happen to YOU.”
&gt;You ask if it was because of you that she had trouble with the fire rings
&gt;”No! Well, no, I mean…a little bit. I just didn’t want you to see me mess up, and I ended up doing it anyway. The heat only makes it worse when you’re already a bit flustered….”
&gt;There’s a bit of guilt in her eyes
&gt;But it could be a reflection of your own
&gt;You were holding her back, technically speaking
&gt;Would she even be able to perform if she knew you were watching?
&gt;”Actually….”
&gt;Her voice has a budding speck of confidence you haven’t seen much so far
&gt;”Knowing a good friend is watching would put me at ease. I was afraid you’d judge me before, but….”
&gt;You give her a tight squeeze, patting her on the back
&gt;You have enough time off to see all of her opening shows, if she wants you there
&gt;She responds with a giggling tweet

&gt;There’s a fair amount to do around the city apart from the water shows and Flood Frontier
&gt;You spend most of the day with Perchia just milling about the streets, checking out the shops, and getting to do things unfit for a loner or too intimate to do with a large group
&gt;Like taking scenic pedicab rides, or getting cheesy pictures at photo booths
&gt;The bird obviously spends much more time than you do here when she’s not practicing for performances, but still rarely gets to experience everything the city can offer
&gt;Between the excitement and caring for you at her place, she’s absolutely spent when it starts getting late
&gt;You’re preparing for bed while she sits on her chair, fidgeting to get comfortable
&gt;You ask if she always sleeps like that
&gt;”Well, I don’t HAVE to, but it’s just natural to me.”
&gt;It could be the fatigue talking, or it could just be her way of warming up to you
&gt;But Perchia’s certainly getting bolder when her wings spread open and she scoots back into her seat
&gt;”Would you…like to try it?”
&gt;You sit on her lap, and her wings wrap around you like a cloak
&gt;”You can lean back, if you want.”
&gt;Her chest, shoulder, and neck are downy touches better than any pillow you’ve ever felt
&gt;Her breathing is slow and hypnotic, gently rocking you into relaxation
&gt;She coos a soft lullaby, barely passing out of her beak and into your ear
&gt;You can only imagine this is what it feels like to be a bird’s young chick, encased in a feathery protection
&gt;”I’d love for you to stay here with me,” Perchia says
&gt;She’s clever, you’ll give her that
&gt;She waited until you were too tired to say “no”
&gt;And now she’s swaying you to sleep with the idea planted into your dreams
&gt;It’s definitely the most refreshing rest you’ve had in years

&gt;A cloudless day over the lake
&gt;The amphitheater is jammed with humans and anthros of all kinds
&gt;There are a surprising number of them in bathing suits, whether they’re just coming back from the waterpark or expecting to get drenched here
&gt;The show has it all: water skiers and paragliders, watercraft pulling synchronized pyramids of balancers, high divers and even stuntmen shot from cannons
&gt;It’s not too long before the “air and water show” introduces some heat
&gt;Lanes of flame streak across the lake surface and a fiery curtain rises close to the front row, drawing everyone’s attention skyward
&gt;Intense drumming sounds from the speakers, and Perchia appears on her perch
&gt;With a proud flourish, the kingfisher leaps from her tower and soars through the flaming rings
&gt;Each one she flies through is snuffed out in her wake
&gt;She moves with an ethereal precision even more awe-inspiring than her rehearsals
&gt;Finally comes the “tunnel” of shrinking rings aimed at the audience
&gt;She told you there was a surprise added on at the last minute, inspired by the day the two of you were brought together
&gt;Coming through the final ring she sails at the water right before the amphitheater
&gt;Some of the crowd recoils in fear of the incoming bird
&gt;Perchia plunges under the surface like a dart
&gt;The higher seats lean forward to try to find her, while those in the front keep their distance from the screen of fire
&gt;Before the ripples have a chance to settle, a teal-and-gold missile shoots back into the air
&gt;She twirls above the audience, tossing glistening droplets in every direction
&gt;The crowd screams and cheers as they’re sprinkled
&gt;That’s the cue for the fire curtain to recede, as if doused by the graceful kingfisher
&gt;Perchia climbs higher and out of sight, getting the biggest applause you’ve heard in the show
&gt;Especially from you, clapping with two good arms until they both become sore
&gt;She doesn’t show up again until after the performance is over, where a line of entertained guests are getting pictures and her autograph
&gt;You expect this will go on for quite some time, every day of the show
&gt;But you patiently wait for her to finish with a smile on your face
&gt;After all, she’s your ride back home</textarea>
