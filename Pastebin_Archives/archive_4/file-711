        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;I come home from the bar, and I feel good
&gt;The drink was nice and plentiful, as always
&gt;The door is being a pain, and I keep fumbling with the keys
&gt;Calling for my hubby, he opens the door
&gt;&quot;Honey, you were supposed to be home two hours ago, what happened?&quot;
&gt;&#039;You don&#039;t need to know.&#039;
&gt;He sighs and walks over to the couch, sitting down
&gt;&quot;Why are you drunk?&quot;
&gt;&#039;I&#039;m not.&#039;
&gt;&quot;Bullshit.&quot;
&gt;I give a grunt, to tell him off
&gt;Stumbling to the kitchen, I open the fridge, grabbing some leftover pork
&gt;&quot;Why are you doing this? You know I hate to see you like this.&quot;
&gt;&#039;It&#039;s my life, my choice.&#039;
&gt;&quot;I know that, but I&#039;m worried.&quot;
&gt;&#039;Then stop.&#039;
&gt;&quot;Fine.&quot;
&gt;He walks away in a huff, annoyed
&gt;When he&#039;s gone, I sneakily drink some rum I had saved over
&gt;Walking to the bathroom, I look in the mirror
&gt;I was a drunk hyena that looked like shit, the drink had messed with me
&gt;He walks behind me, and frowns
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s wrong?&quot;
&gt;&#039;Nothing.&#039;
&gt;&quot;Dear, I know something is up.&quot;
&gt;&#039;You&#039;re wrong.&#039;
&gt;&quot;Why are you being so hostile?&quot;
&gt;&#039;Shut up.&#039;
&gt;He doesn&#039;t take to that kindly, and he runs up to me, pointing a finger at me
&gt;&quot;You know, over the last week, you&#039;ve been drinking more, and spending less time with me? Why?&quot;
&gt;&#039;Fuck off, I don&#039;t want to talk about it!&#039;
&gt;&quot;No, you&#039;re being a complete bitch!&quot;
&gt;That does it
&gt;Turning around, I sock him in the head
&gt;He falls back and hits the ground
&gt;Picking him up, I throw him into the living room
&gt;I have to make an example for him not to do this shit ever again
&gt;As he moans on the floor, I hold myself above him
&gt;And I start to strike
&gt;Hitting him over and over
&gt;&quot;Zahra, please stop!&quot;
&gt;He needs to learn
&gt;&quot;Plea-agh!&quot;
&gt;With me swinging my fists into his face, he slumps down
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re gonna k-&quot;
&gt;And I kick him full force, into his back
&gt;He writhes in pain
&gt;To end the lesson, I slam his head into the floor
&gt;I hear a loud crack
&gt;I must of broken the wood, that&#039;ll teach him
&gt;But, why was I so violent?
&gt;He was my love, I wasn&#039;t supposed to beat him up!
&gt;Wait, that&#039;s a lotta blood flowing...
&gt;Fuck, I&#039;ve hurt him!
&gt;That realization sobers me immediately
&gt;What did I do?
&gt;Oh god baby, please be fine
&gt;Please please please
&gt;I turn him over, I already beat him, I hope it won&#039;t be too bad
&gt;I&#039;ll do everything to make it up, I&#039;ll make him breakfast in bed for the rest of his life
&gt;I&#039;ll take him to the Bahamas like he always wanted
&gt;I&#039;ll never hurt him again, and I&#039;ll stop drinking, and spend more time with him
&gt;He slumps over
&gt;His head flops down
&gt;He isn&#039;t breathing...
&gt;Oh god
&gt;No
&gt;No
&gt;No
&gt;His neck...
&gt;It&#039;s broken
&gt;God no
&gt;&#039;Will? Wake up!&#039;
&gt;I start to shake him around
&gt;&#039;Babe, please, wake up!&#039;
&gt;I can&#039;t stop the tears from flowing
&gt;&#039;Please!&#039;
&gt;He doesn&#039;t move
&gt;He&#039;s gone
&gt;&#039;No...&#039;
&gt;The guilt crushes me
&gt;I just killed my lover
&gt;I beat him to death
&gt;A innocent human man who loved me
&gt;Who just wanted the best for me
&gt;I pick up his body and walk to the bed, laying down, with him on top of me
&gt;I wrap an arm around him, and shove my face into his right shoulder
&gt;I&#039;m sobbing uncontrollably
&gt;&#039;I&#039;m sorry, I&#039;m so sorry, please, I didn&#039;t mean to...&#039;
&gt;&#039;Just wake up, I need you...&#039;
&gt;Nothing happens
&gt;What did I expect, I killed him
&gt;He didn&#039;t deserve this
&gt;He was so good
&gt;And he&#039;s gone, because of me
&gt;I&#039;m a monster
&gt;Why is he dead?
&gt;Why am I alive?
&gt;I can&#039;t do anything about it, I&#039;m a piece of filth
&gt;I can&#039;t bring him back to life
&gt;I want to be with him
&gt;And with him I will go
&gt;My left paw goes to my right wrist
&gt;It&#039;s scary, but I can&#039;t live knowing what I&#039;ve done
&gt;The pain is sharp, sliding down my arm
&gt;The blood flows, staining my fur and the bed
&gt;I repeat that with my left arm
&gt;And I lie there, with my dead husband
&gt;The world is fading away
&gt;And all I can do is apologize
&gt;&#039;I&#039;m sorry...&#039;
&gt;And I leave this world

&gt;&quot;Jones?&quot;
&gt;&#039;What?&#039;
&gt;&quot;You think this is gonna be bad?&quot;
&gt;&#039;A Hyena, and it&#039;s domestic troubles. It isn&#039;t gonna be good. Hopefully, the poor guy doesn&#039;t get any scars.&#039;
&gt;Me and Alda knock on the door, the station got a call not too long ago, hearing screaming and banging
&gt;&quot;Zahra? Will? This is the police, can you open the door?&quot;
&gt;After some time, there&#039;s still no response.
&gt;&#039;Fuck, not good. Kick that door down, taser ready, this could be bad.&#039;
&gt;&quot;Got it.&quot;
&gt;Alda steps in front of the door, and readies herself
&gt;&quot;Stand back from the door, we&#039;re coming in!&quot;
&gt;Alda kicks it down easily, her Dragon legs destroying the hinges
&gt;&#039;Come out with your hands up!&#039;
&gt;Oh fuck
&gt;Theres blood on the floor, and some damaged wood
&gt;Shit
&gt;&quot;Jones, get ready for anything.&quot;
&gt;&#039;I&#039;ll guard the door, to make sure nobody gets out, check the rooms.&#039;
&gt;&quot;Understood&quot;
&gt;Alda runs from room to room, not finding much of interest except for a broken bottle of rum in the bathroom
&gt;Eventually, I hear her, and in a terrified voice
&gt;&quot;Jones! Get over here, I&#039;m calling for EMT&#039;s!&quot;
&gt;I run fast as I can, making it to the bedroom
&gt;It&#039;s a horrible sight
&gt;Will was lying on top of Zahra, blood coming down his head, and his neck was obviously snapped
&gt;Zahra was on the bed, with blood staining her arms
&gt;Her face is one of anguish
&gt;Will&#039;s is one of fear
&gt;God in heaven...
&gt;&#039;Christ.&#039;
&gt;&quot;They aren&#039;t breathing, and no pulse.&quot;
&gt;&#039;Zahra&#039;s claws are stained red. Possible murder-suicide?&#039;
&gt;&quot;It seems like it.&quot;
&gt;&#039;I&#039;ve never seen something like this.&#039;
&gt;&quot;Neither have I.&quot;
&gt;As we wait for the ambulance, we check the house
&gt;Hidden camera&#039;s lie in each room, probably to catch burglars
&gt;&#039;We need to see this.&#039;
&gt;Taking the footage, I play it on a tablet I have
&gt;And it scares me
&gt;Zahra came home drunk, and got into an argument
&gt;Then, she starts to beat Will
&gt;And with a loud snap, he dies
&gt;Zahra quickly notices it, and becomes despondent
&gt;As she carries his body to the bed, she cries and asks for him to come back
&gt;But of course, he doesn&#039;t
&gt;Zahra is broken, and with her own claws, she slices her arms
&gt;Her death is fast but painful
&gt;&quot;I-I can&#039;t believe what I just saw.&quot;
&gt;I feel the same
&gt;&#039;I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever forget this.&#039;
&gt;As I sit on the bed, Alda sits next to me
&gt;&#039;Honey, can you promise something?&#039;
&gt;&quot;Yes?&quot;
&gt;&#039;I know that our job is dangerous, but no matter what, don&#039;t ever start drinking. Not after that.&#039;
&gt;&quot;I won&#039;t.&quot;
&gt;Alda hugs me, and we both wait for the ambulance
&gt;Zahra&#039;s mistake won&#039;t ever leave my mind



(not canon part 2, electric boogaloo)


&gt;Beeping
&gt;It&#039;s all I hear
&gt;My sense of smell is overwhelmed by alcohol
&gt;I can&#039;t see
&gt;My body feels numb
&gt;What is happening?
&gt;&quot;Hey, She&#039;s awake!&quot;
&gt;&#039;W-Where am I?&#039;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re in St.Paul&#039;s hospital, don&#039;t worry.&quot;
&gt;&#039;What happened? Is Will alright?&#039;
&gt;&quot;Shit...&quot;
&gt;&#039;What?&#039;
&gt;&quot;We&#039;ll t-tell you later, you need to rest.&quot;
&gt;&#039;Okay...&#039;
&gt;Time passes, I feel as if I was in a dream
&gt;It all feels so weird
&gt;Eventually, the sound of footsteps comes to me, along with an opening door
&gt;&quot;In here, officers.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Thanks.&quot;
&gt;&#039;Who&#039;s there?&#039;
&gt;&quot;Zahra, we will be restraining you for both our safety and our own.&quot;
&gt;&#039;Why, I&#039;m not dangerous?&#039;
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s incorrect, now stay still.&quot;
&gt;As the restraints are slipped on, I cannot move my limbs
&gt;&quot;Now, we know that you do not remember what happened last night.&quot;
&gt;&#039;What was it, and where&#039;s Will?&#039;
&gt;&quot;Will... is dead. You killed him. Claw marks, brusing on the head and body, and a snapped neck.&quot;
&gt;&#039;What? I would never hurt him!&#039;
&gt;&quot;Zahra, you did. I don&#039;t exactly know why, but we found you in a sorry state. You slashed your arms in an attempt at suicide on your bed. Will&#039;s body was lying on top of you, and a shitton of alcohol was in your system.&quot;
&gt;&#039;No, that isn&#039;t possible! You&#039;re lying!&#039;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m sorry, but it&#039;s the truth. We don&#039;t want to be so blunt, but would you be able to remember any of it?&quot;
&gt;Nothing comes to mind
&gt;This is some elaborate hoax, Id never lay a finger on Will
&gt;As I feel anger brewing at the lying men, a sense of deja vu hits me
&gt;It all comes back
&gt;The drinking
&gt;The arguing
&gt;Killing him
&gt;The suicide attempt
&gt;I killed my lover
&gt;It&#039;s too much
&gt;&#039;I-I&#039;m a fucking monster, he loved me...&#039;
&gt;&quot;Christ...&quot;
&gt;&#039;I was so drunk, I didn&#039;t even realize it, he was begging me to stop, oh god why...&#039;
&gt;&#039;He didn&#039;t deserve this, I should be the one dead!&#039;
&gt;&#039;Will, I&#039;m so sorry...&#039;
&gt;&quot;Damn, this is bad.&quot;
&gt;&#039;I just want you back baby, please...&#039;
&gt;&quot;Get the boys, we&#039;re moving her to the slammer.&quot;
&gt;I didn&#039;t care that I was going to jail
&gt;That was nothing
&gt;What hurt was what I did
&gt;And the pain doesn&#039;t go away

--------

&gt;It&#039;s late at night, I was falling asleep
&gt;Moving to the jail didn&#039;t faze me
&gt;I already felt dead
&gt;As sleep takes hold, I feel uneasy

--------

&gt;I&#039;m walking home from work, happy to see my husband
&gt;It&#039;s been a long hard day, so seeing his bright smile will make everything better
&gt;He was so caring and kind, he was a complete keeper
&gt;Thank god you had him, he kept you sane in your job
&gt;Fucking cocksuckers at the office could go get stuffed
&gt;As I walk up the steps to the front door, I pull out the keys
&gt;Unlocking the door, I walk in
&gt;&#039;Honey, I&#039;m here!&#039;
&gt;No answer
&gt;You sneaky boy, I&#039;ll find you!
&gt;Looking around the house, Will is nowhere to be seen
&gt;&#039;Will?&#039;
&gt;Ah, of course, he&#039;d be waiting in the bedroom
&gt;He has to take care of the girl after all
&gt;Opening the door, you see Will facing away from you, on the bed
&gt;You hear something wet hitting the ground
&gt;Is he crying?
&gt;I walk over to the bed, crawling onto it
&gt;&#039;Are you alright honey?&#039;
&gt;&quot;How could I be alright?&quot;
&gt;&#039;Well, we have eachother.&#039;
&gt;&quot;Used to.&quot;
&gt;His head turns completely around, his neck twisted and torn, with lifeless eyes
&gt;Recoiling back, I crawl away to a wall
&gt;&quot;I just wanted to love you, why did you do it?&quot;
&gt;&#039;What are you talking about?&#039;
&gt;&quot;YOU KILLED ME.&quot;
&gt;Oh god, the memory comes back
&gt;&#039;I-I&#039;m sorry Will, I never meant to hurt you.&#039;
&gt;&quot;YOU SNAPPED MY NECK. TELL ME, DID YOU LIKE WATCHING ME DIE? YOU SICK FUCK.&quot;
&gt;He stands up, and with a blink of my eyes, he&#039;s right in front of me
&gt;&#039;OH GOD WILL PLEASE I&#039;M SO SORRY, PLEASE DON&#039;T HURT ME!&#039;
&gt;&quot;Oh, it&#039;s fine having me die, huh? You are scum. You killed your husband, the person who cared for you. You know how painful it felt?&quot;
&gt;What was he talking about?
&gt;&quot;You fucking beat me like I was filth. I was in horrible pain, and then you killed me. Why?&quot;
&gt;&#039;I was drunk, and angry, I lost control, I-I wish I was who died, not you...&#039;
&gt;&quot;And yet, here you are, talking to a walking corpse.&quot;
&gt;&#039;I&#039;m sorry...&#039;
&gt;&quot;Burn in hell.&quot;
&gt;He vanishes, and I am left alone
&gt;That scares me more than anything
&gt;Not dying
&gt;Not jail
&gt;It&#039;s that he&#039;s gone
&gt;And it&#039;s all because of me

-------

&gt;I awake in a cell, restrained
&gt;They think I&#039;m mad
&gt;They&#039;re right
&gt;The worries about what you did flows back
&gt;And you can&#039;t stop laughing
&gt;It&#039;s not funny
&gt;It&#039;s horrible
&gt;I killed my love
&gt;I&#039;m in jail, and probably deemed mentally unwell
&gt;And not even in sleep can I calm down
&gt;This is hell
&gt;The worst part is that I made it this way
&gt;All I had to do was put down the bottle
&gt;But I ignored him and kept drinking
&gt;That was such a mistake

-------

(Alternate timeline, fuck your feelings, this ain&#039;t canon)

-------

&gt;My eyes are open, only seeing darkness, my body bursts upwards from the bed
&gt;Looking around, I turn on the lights
&gt;Oh thank god
&gt;Will is sleeping soundly next to me
&gt;I move over to him, and he awakes
&gt;&quot;Zahra, what is it?&quot;
&gt;&#039;I-I had a nightmare...&#039;
&gt;&quot;Well, don&#039;t worry about it.&#039;
&gt;&#039;Can we talk about it?&#039;
&gt;&quot;Sure.&quot;
&gt;It was horrifying, the thought of him being gone, but having him next to me feels wonderful
&gt;&#039;It was real messed up, please don&#039;t think I&#039;m a psycho.&#039;
&gt;&quot;I have weird dreams every now and then, don&#039;t worry about it.&quot;
&gt;&#039;I-I killed you...&#039;
&gt;&quot;Oh.&quot;
&gt;&#039;I was coming home from the bar drunk, and we got into an argument. I thought I could beat you up to teach you a lesson, but your neck...&#039;
&gt;Even though it was a dream, it felt so real
&gt;I start to tear up
&gt;&#039;And I couldn&#039;t believe what I did, I couldn&#039;t take it, so I... slashed my...&#039;
&gt;And before I start to sob, Will moves over and embraces me in a huge hug
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t worry, it&#039;s not real, and you never hurt me.&quot;
&gt;This is why I love him
&gt;He&#039;s so selfless
&gt;Even when I was stuck to the bottle, she stayed by me and pulled me out
&gt;And with his embrace, I fall back to sleep
&gt;Thinking it was real was such a mistake
