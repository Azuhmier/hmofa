        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;you really fucked things up this time
&gt;you&#039;re flat on your back in the middle of the street
&gt;everything hurts
&gt;your mouth is full of blood
&gt;through your darkening vision you can see the spotlights from the helicopters, and the blinding blue and whites coming off of the cop cars
&gt;god this hurts
&gt;you try and move, but you can&#039;t
&gt;you can&#039;t even turn your head
&gt;you can&#039;t believe everything went wrong so fast
&gt;it&#039;s getting cold now
&gt;there&#039;s someone standing over you
&gt;they&#039;re saying something
&gt;you can&#039;t hear them at all
&gt;everything&#039;s going black
&gt;how did you end up like this?
 
---
 
One year earlier
 
&gt;your day is already off to a bad start since your boss called you into his office
&gt;that never happened unless you did something to piss him off
&gt;you can&#039;t recall beating anyone you weren&#039;t supposed to recently
&gt;you walk into his office, the stench of fur overwhelms your nose
&quot;You wanted to see me?&quot;
&gt;the chief glares at you and slams a newspaper on his desk
&gt;even though he&#039;s getting on in years the look in his eyes still makes your balls shrivel up
&quot;I got another excessive force complaint. That&#039;s the third one in six months isn&#039;t it?&quot;
&gt;you can&#039;t recall, every day some asshole gets fresh with you and you end up having to go upside their head, and then they start crying about &quot;muh civil rights&quot;
&gt;faggots
&quot;I don&#039;t know. Is that the only reason you called me in here?&quot;
&gt;he got this grin on his face
&gt;that kind of grin he only gets when some real fucked up shit is about to happen
&quot;Actually, I wanted to introduce you to your new partner.&quot;
&gt;you&#039;d had one partner for a while, but he&#039;s laid up in the hospital
&gt;you told him to wrap his shit up if he&#039;s gonna spend all his money on those rat hookers
&gt;but no one ever listens to you
&quot;Okay. Who?&quot;
&gt;the door opens and another officer walks in
&gt;a woman
&gt;decent pair on her from what you can see through the uniform
&gt;her fur isn&#039;t bad looking either
&gt;wait what?
&gt;taking a second look she&#039;s an anthro
&gt;judging from the shape of her nose, a wolf
&gt;you would guess dog, but something about how she carries herself screams wolf
&quot;This is Claire Whitfield. She&#039;s a 5 year vet of the Dallas PD. After that whole mess down there she decided to move here.&quot;
&gt;Claire saluted
&quot;I&#039;m looking forward to working here.&quot;
&gt;the chief laughed
&quot;So well mannered. You could learn something from her Anon.&quot;
&gt;you scoff
&quot;Alright. Never worked with one of you people before. LA&#039;s a bit different from Dallas. Think you can handle it?&quot;
&gt;she smiles at you
&quot;I&#039;ve been in worse places.&quot;
 
---
 
&gt;rollin down the street, smokin endo, sippin on gin and juice
&gt;not really, but wouldn&#039;t it be cool if you were?
&gt;right now you&#039;re riding in your squad car working your beat
&gt;nothing interesting yet
&gt;you figure you should use this downtime to get to know your new partner
&quot;Chief said you were from Dallas?&quot;
&quot;I&#039;m from all over. I was born in Chicago, joined the army and spent four years in Afghanistan, then after hopping around for a bit I wound up in Texas.&quot;
&quot;The army huh? See any action over there?&quot; you ask, grinning.
&quot;Not really. I spent most of my time sitting in a tent bored out of my skull.&quot;
&gt;you start laughing
&quot;Promise you won&#039;t be bored here.&quot;
&gt;you turn the corner and see a group of young anthros standing on a street corner
&gt;you pull over and hop out
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Claire asks
&quot;This is called proactive policing.&quot;
&gt;you walk up to the people on the corner and wave
&quot;What&#039;s up my dudes?&quot;
&gt;one of them rolls his eyes at you
&quot;Man, why you fuckin&#039; wit us?&quot;
&quot;You know how it is. Too many of you guys in one place and people get all nervous. All right, you know what to do.&quot;
&gt;they turn around and place their palms on the wall
&gt;you search them all one by one but don&#039;t find anything
&gt;that&#039;s for the best
&quot;Alright, when I come back around you guys are gone, understand?&quot;
&quot;Yeah officer. Yo, who&#039;s that?&quot;
&gt;you look over and see Claire surveying the scene
&quot;That&#039;s my new partner.&quot;
&quot;She&#039;s kinda hot.&quot;
&gt;you can&#039;t help but agree
&gt;back in the car Claire looked like she wanted to say something
&quot;Something on your mind?&quot; you ask her.
&quot;So do we just go around stopping and frisking people all day?&quot;
&gt;you groan
&quot;Don&#039;t tell me you&#039;re one of those bleeding hearts.&quot;
&quot;Is that what you call people who actually care about citizens?&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s what I call people who have a misplaced sense of compassion. City says we need to reduce crime, so if we see a group of furries we go and jack &#039;em up. Crime goes down, but then we&#039;ve got all these activist groups complaining about discrimination, so we stop. Then crime goes back up and we&#039;re right where we started.&quot;
&gt;she looks at you like you just spit on her
&quot;What?&quot; you ask, defensive.
&quot;Did you really just say &#039;furries&#039;?&quot;
&gt;you forgot that &quot;furry&quot; was a less than polite way to refer to anthros
&gt;you might as well have called them a pack of niggers
&gt;it was such in integral part of your vocabulary that you said it without thinking
&gt;having an anthro partner will take some getting used to
 
---
 
&gt;today was another day
&gt;you got a call for a drunk and disorderly in a bar
&gt;what kind of degenerate gets drunk at one in the afternoon
&gt;well, after spending most of your career arresting anthros it&#039;s nice to bust some human skulls for a change
&gt;you walk into the bar and immediately the thick stench of sweat and cigar smoke assaults your nostrils
&gt;Claire looks ready to vomit
&gt;there are two men arguing by a pool table
&gt;you walk up to them and break them apart
&quot;You two get the fuck outta here. I don&#039;t feel like hauling your drunk asses in.&quot;
&gt;one guy punches you in the face and knocks you on your ass
&gt;that&#039;s what you get for trying to be diplomatic
&gt;you see him standing over you
&gt;then a grey streak flies past
&gt;next thing you know Claire&#039;s on top of the guy pounding his head into the floorboards
&gt;the anger in her eyes could kill a man
&gt;you burst into laughter
&quot;Don&#039;t kill him. That&#039;s too much paperwork.&quot;
&gt;Claire drags the bloody drunk to his feet and cuffs him
&gt;you whistle at her
&quot;That was some savage shit. Where&#039;d you learn that at?&quot;
&quot;I got into fights a lot when I was a kid.&quot;
&gt;you drag the man into the back of the squad car and take him back to the station
&gt;you&#039;re still thinking about that beating Claire gave that guy
&gt;every punch was meant to knock his head off
&gt;that kind of brutality isn&#039;t something you see very often
&quot;You know what Claire? You just might be LAPD material after all.&quot;
 
--
 
&gt;you&#039;re riding around on patrol
&gt;today was a more relaxed day than normal
&gt;so of course you had to blast your theme song at max volume
&quot;Y&#039;ALL NIGGAS CAN&#039;T FUCK WIT MY NIGGAS HO. Y&#039;ALL NIGGAS CAN&#039;T FUCK WIT MY NIGGAS HO. Y&#039;ALL NIGGAS CAN&#039;T FUCK WIT MY NIGGAS HO. Y&#039;ALL NIGGAS CAN&#039;T FUCK WIT MY NIGGAS HO&quot;
&gt;Claire had her hands clamped over her ears
&gt;she was obviously in pain, but her pride wouldn&#039;t let her say anything
&gt;if she wanted to be stubborn that was her problem
&gt;this has been a good day so far, all you&#039;ve had to deal with is a couple street hagglers
&gt;nothing that could piss you off
&gt;of course as you were thinking that a car cuts in front of you, forcing you to stomp on the brakes to keep from hitting it
&quot;Oh you mother fucker!&quot; you shout as you turn the lights on
&gt;you mash on the gas and catch up with the errant driver
&gt;he pulls over, and you pull up right behind him
&gt;you and Claire get out the car and walk up to the driver
&gt;looking at the car it&#039;s one of those sleek foreign cars all the street racers are into
&gt;fucking Midnight Club wannabees killed an old man a month ago
&gt;you knock on the window
&gt;the driver rolls it down, revealing himself to be a teenager
&gt;of fucking course
&quot;Do you realize I almost hit you back there?&quot; you say.
&quot;Sorry bro. I didn&#039;t see you.&quot;
&quot;Step out of the car.&quot;
&gt;once he&#039;s out of the car you search him
&gt;you find two joints in one pocket
&quot;Oh would you look at this. This is a DWI right here. I could pull your license, even get this car impounded.&quot;
&gt;the kid&#039;s eyes go wide as saucers
&quot;Shit man I&#039;m still making payments on this. Please don&#039;t tow my car. I&#039;m begging you&quot;
&gt;you&#039;d be lying if you say you weren&#039;t enjoying this
&quot;I&#039;m sorry kid, but the law&#039;s the law.&quot;
&gt;you look at Claire and wink
&gt;she seemed to understand
&quot;Oh come on Anon. He&#039;s just a kid. Why don&#039;t you let him off with a warning.&quot;
&gt;you&#039;re both trying not to laugh
&quot;You hear that? My partner says I should let you go.&quot;
&gt;the relief on his face is palpable
&quot;Say &#039;thank you Officer Whitfield&#039;.&quot;
&quot;Thank you Officer Whitfield.&quot;
&gt;you have to commend Claire for being able to keep a straight face
&quot;Just make sure you pay attention to the road from now on&quot; she says in her most serious voice
&gt;the two of you get back in your car
&gt;it only takes a few seconds before you both burst into laughter
&quot;Man the look on his face&quot; Claire says as she wipes a tear from her eye
&gt;eye. Singular
&gt;that had been bugging you for a while, but you figured now wasn&#039;t the time to bring that up
&quot;Torturing teenagers makes me hungry. Wanna grab a bite?&quot; you ask
&quot;Sure&quot; Claire responds.
&gt;there&#039;s a place you like to go to
&gt;you went there all the time with your last partner
&gt;maybe she&#039;ll like it too
 
---
 
&gt;you&#039;re sitting in a restaurant munching on a burger
&gt;you like this place
&gt;the food&#039;s good, and cops eat free
&quot;So how are you liking LA so far?&quot; you ask
&quot;Way better than Chicago.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, I hear it can get pretty rough over there.&quot;
&quot;Trust me, I know better than anyone.&quot;
&gt;as if to emphasize one of her eyes got that unnatural shine to it
&quot;Hey Claire?&quot;
&gt;she doesn&#039;t seem to hear you
&gt;she turns around in her seat and puts a hand on her holster
&quot;What&#039;s up?&quot; you ask as your hand moves to your own gun.
&quot;Two men with guns heading for that shop across the street.&quot;
&gt;across the street is a pawn shop
&gt;it got robbed a few times last year, but recently it&#039;s been okay
&quot;How can you tell?&quot;
&quot;I can hear them.&quot;
&gt;you both rise from your chairs and head out the door
&gt;just like she said there are two guys wearing ski masks in the pawn shop
&gt;they both have what look to be shitty hi points
&gt;you and your partner open the door
&quot;LAPD! Drop your weapons!&quot;
&gt;without a second of hesitation, one of the robbers points his gun right at your head and pulls the trigger
*click*
&gt;the gun fails to go off
&gt;maybe it was jammed, maybe it was just poorly maintained
&gt;either way you were pissed
&gt;you raise your weapon and fire
&gt;the bullet strikes the gunman in the neck
&gt;he falls to the ground and starts making these choking sounds
&gt;you walk over and kick his gun away from him
&gt;you radio for  an ambulance while Claire cuffs the other robber
&gt;you&#039;re still angry when you drag him back to your car
&gt;you punch him across the face
&gt;and then you do it again
&gt;and again
&gt;and again
&gt;the man&#039;s face is covered in blood and bruises
&gt;you reach back for another punch when Claire grabs your arm
&quot;I think he gets it.&quot;
&gt;you go to the store owner and take his statement
&gt;by the time you&#039;re done you manage to calm down
&gt;back at the station you have to file a report over the shooting
&gt;Claire walks up to you looking concerned
&quot;Are you okay?&quot;
&gt;you sigh
&quot;Yeah. Not the first time I shot someone. Thanks for worrying about me.&quot;
&gt;she smiles at you
&quot;We&#039;re partners. We have to look out for each other.&quot;
&gt;that&#039;s reassuring
&gt;it&#039;s nice to have someone looking out for you
&gt;especially someone so cute

--

&gt;these calls are always the worst ones
&gt;dispatch said that a woman collapsed in her home and is unresponsive
&gt;you pull up to the house and knock on the door
&gt;a small kitten opens it
&gt;her eyes are welled up with tears
&quot;My mom fell down and she won&#039;t get up.&quot;
&gt;ah fuck
&gt;you grab the crying cat and pick her up
&quot;My partner&#039;s gonna check on your mom.&quot;
&gt;Claire walked to the kitchen and found the child&#039;s mother on the ground
&gt;she wasn&#039;t moving
&gt;Claire kneels next to her and checks her pulse
&gt;she places two hands on the woman&#039;s chest and tries to preform CPR
&gt;after what feels like an eternity the woman coughs and greedily sucks in air
&gt;Claire helps the woman to her feet
&quot;Oh god, I thought I was done for&quot; the woman says as she wraps her hands around Claire.
&gt;Claire sighs with relief and guides the woman outside toward the paramedics
&gt;you place a hand on the small kitten&#039;s head
&gt;man, this is some soft fur
&quot;Your mom&#039;s gonna be okay.&quot;
&gt;really soft
&gt;and her ears are so pliable
&quot;Anon&quot;
&gt;you could pinch these small ears all day
&quot;Anon!&quot;
&gt;Claire shouting snaps you out of the trance you were in
&gt;you look down at the kitten, squirming with discomfort in your handso
&quot;Sorry about that&quot; you say, turning red
&gt;you set the kitten down and watch her run off to join her mother
&quot;What was that about?&quot; Claire asks.
&gt;you ignore her question and head back to your car
&quot;Good job by the way. You saved that woman&#039;s life.&quot;
&gt;Claire&#039;s good ear perked up and she grins
&quot;All part of the job isn&#039;t it?&quot;
&gt;something about her smile makes your heart race
&gt;in the back of your mind you wonder if she&#039;s soft too

--

&gt;training inna gym
&gt;punching on a heavy bag to blow off some steam
&gt;your shooting skills are fine, but your hand to hand could use some work
&gt;and judging by the laughter you hear behind you you aren&#039;t the only one who thinks so
&quot;What&#039;s so funny?&quot; you ask.
&gt;Claire tries to stop laughing
&quot;Your form is so shit. Have you ever actually been in a fight before?&quot;
&gt;you&#039;re pretty sure beating handcuffed suspects with a club counts as a fight
&quot;Not really&quot; you answer.
&gt;she walks up to you and grabs your hand
&quot;How about I teach you a few things?&quot;
&gt;she guides you to an empty space near the back and hands you a pair of padded gloves
&quot;Are you sure about this? I don&#039;t wanna hurt you.&quot;
&gt;Claire chokes on her laughter
&quot;Don&#039;t flatter yourself.&quot;
&gt;you move to attack her
&gt;she grabs your arm and next thing you know you&#039;re on the ground with your arm behind your back and Claire&#039;s knee in your spine
&quot;How the fuck did you do that?&quot; you ask, incredulous.
&quot;Try and do that to me.&quot;
&gt;she gets into a fighting stance and attacks you
&gt;you try and copy her movements, but just get punched in the face over and over
&gt;by the time it&#039;s time to leave your face is one giant bruise
&gt;you haven&#039;t been beaten this bad since you were a kid
&gt;surprisingly you&#039;re not angry
&gt;you&#039;re determined
&gt;you&#039;re definitely going to beat Claire at least once
&gt;Claire tosses you a towel to wipe your face off
&quot;Sorry I was so rough with you.&quot;
&gt;you give a dry chuckle
&quot;It&#039;s fine. Guess I&#039;ve got a lot to learn.&quot;
&quot;No shit you do. I leave you like this you&#039;ll be dead in a real fight.&quot;
&gt;at least she cares
&gt;you move your hand toward her head
&gt;she takes a large step back
&gt;you move closer to
&gt;she moves further away
&quot;What?&quot; you ask
&gt;she just shakes her head at you
&gt;you guess wolves are reluctant to being touched 
&gt;oh well
&gt;now you have two goals

--

&quot;Calling all units there is a 211 in progress at the Chase Bank downtown. Be advised, suspect is a gazelle anthro and is to be considered armed and dangerous.&quot;
&gt;that was the dispatch 
&gt;you hit the lights and speed toward the bank 
&gt;the adrenaline is pumping through you 
&gt;finally a reason to get out of bed
&gt;you weave through traffic as fast as possible 
&gt;no sign of the suspect
&gt;Claire shouts in your ear
&quot;I see someone!&quot;
&gt;sure enough out the corner of your eye you see a gazelle sprinting with a bag in one hand and a gun in the other
&gt;there&#039;s a red splotch on his shirt
&gt;that better be an ink packet for his sake
&quot;If he&#039;s on foot he&#039;s not gonna be easy to catch.&quot;
&gt;Claire bails out the car and chases after him
&gt;you decide to try a different method
&gt;you turn the corner and speed up
&gt;you push the patrol car to the limit and catch up with the suspect
&gt;once you&#039;re an ideal distance away you swerve into him and send him bowling over the hood
&gt;in the rear-view you can see Claire grabbing his gun and cuffing him
&gt;one of his legs looks like it&#039;s bent weird
&gt;oh well
&gt;you step out and back her up
&gt;to your surprise Claire grabs you by the collar and growls at you
&quot;What the fuck was that?&quot; she shouted
&quot;What? He was armed and dangerous. I couldn&#039;t let him keep running with that gun in his hand. I took the best course of action to keep the public safe.&quot;
&quot;Listen, whatever cowboy shit you got up to with your last partner, that shit stops. This shit doesn&#039;t stay in a vacuum, it ripples out.&quot;
&quot;God, I get it. The last thing I need is a lecture on how to do my job.&quot;
&gt;what is her problem
&gt;it&#039;s not like you&#039;re on some Rampart shit or anything like that
&gt;if some asshole gets a few bruises is it really that big of a deal?
&gt;it&#039;s not like you&#039;ve done anything really awful

--

&gt;another day spent sparring with Claire
&gt;this wasn&#039;t as bad as usual
&gt;you actually manage to hit her a few times
&gt;of course that was only due to exploiting her limited field of vision
&gt;that&#039;s been bugging you for a while
&gt;it&#039;s such a weird thing to lie about
&gt;she obviously doesn&#039;t want to tell you everything, but aren&#039;t the two of you partners?
&gt;once you were finished you grabbed a towel and wiped the sweat off your face
&gt;Claire helped you to your feet
&quot;You did good this time. You&#039;re not anywhere close to being any good, but at least you don&#039;t totally suck.&quot;
&gt;coming from Claire that was a huge compliment 
&gt;either way there&#039;s still time before you have to go back on duty, so you might as well ask this now
&quot;Hey Claire?&quot;
&quot;What?&quot;
&quot;Something I&#039;ve been meaning to ask you.&quot;
&quot;Don&#039;t leave me in suspense. What is it?&quot;
&quot;How&#039;d you get into the army with only one eye? I know they relaxed the standards a bit but proper vision is still a requirement last I checked.&quot;
&gt;the silence is crushing you
&gt;Claire nervously rubs the back of her head
&quot;You know you&#039;re the first person to bring that up?&quot;
&quot;That&#039;s a weird thing to lie about. Why would you even need to lie about something like that?&quot;
&gt;her ear lays flat against her head
&quot;I didn&#039;t want to tell anyone about my first job.&quot;
&quot;Why not?&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s so embarrassing.&quot;
&gt;you can&#039;t believe what you&#039;re hearing
&gt;the normally calm and composed Claire Whitfield was so fidgeting like an antsy child
&gt;whatever she used to do was so humiliating that she would rather lie about fighting overseas than tell anyone about it
&gt;obviously you had to know more
&quot;Well, don&#039;t leave me in suspense. What happened?&quot;
&gt;Claire sighs
&quot;Like you said, I couldn&#039;t get into the army with only one eye, but the recruiter still had me take a few tests. I passed all of them. He thought just kicking me out would be a waste of talent, so he referred me to a few people.&quot;
&quot;What kind of people?&quot;
&quot;People who need protection. CEOs, politicians, celebrities. Those sorts of people.&quot;
&quot;So you were a bodyguard? That doesn&#039;t sound so bad.&quot;
&quot;Ugh. You have no idea. I was more of a servant than a guard most of the time. I had to help them buy clothes, take care of their kids, help prepare their meals, all sorts of things. One time I had to fix a guy&#039;s car cause he didn&#039;t know how. Oh! Once I had to go on a date with a client. God, I still remember that fat fuck latching on to me like a needy kid.&quot;
&gt;it takes everything you have not to laugh 
&quot;Was the pay good at least?&quot; you ask
Claire laughs. &quot;I made more money than I knew what to do with. I gave most of it away. Never really had much use for money.&quot;
&quot;Of course you&#039;re the altruistic type. How&#039;d you end up becoming a cop?&quot;
&quot;I worked out of Houston for a while. I just sort of felt like it. It was nice being able to help regular people for a change. As far as jobs I&#039;ve had, it was alright for a bit. I&#039;m sure you don&#039;t need to know why I came to LA.&quot;
&quot;I can&#039;t really blame you for wanting to walk away after that, I&#039;m just surprised you still wanted to be a cop after that.&quot;
&gt;her ear wiggled back and forth
&quot;I can&#039;t see myself doing anything else.&quot;
&quot;I can understand not wanting to talk about your old job, but we&#039;re partners. We need to be honest with each other.&quot;
&quot;Gotcha.&quot; 
&gt;you turn to leave when Claire calls out to you
&quot;What about you? Why&#039;d you become a cop?&quot;
&gt;you think for a moment
&quot;So I could carry a gun.&quot;

--

&gt;thinking about it now, this day is probably what started all the shit that happened later
&gt;of course at the time you weren&#039;t thinking about consequences
&gt;hindsight is 20/20 after all
&gt;either way it&#039;s not like it matters now
&gt;you walk into the station at the start of the day like always
&gt;after you change into your uniform you head to your car
&gt;but, to your surprise, you don&#039;t see Claire standing by the passenger side door
&gt;it&#039;s someone different
&gt;a man
&gt;he smiles and waves when he sees you coming
&quot;Hiya. I&#039;m Jimenez. I&#039;ll be riding with you for a while.&quot;
&gt;you shake the man&#039;s hand, but you&#039;re a little confused
&quot;Where&#039;s Claire?&quot; you ask.
&quot;She&#039;ll be out for a few weeks. Some kind of anthro thing. Between you and me I think she&#039;s in heat. Buddy of mine drove by her house, saw that all the doors and windows were barred up.&quot;
&gt;that was kinda hot
&gt;pushing that thought out of your mind you and your new partner hit the town
&gt;for a few hours it&#039;s nothing major
&gt;a few busted taillights, an old woman that needs her medicine, some kids loitering
&gt;then the call came in
&gt;home invasion gone wrong, three dead
&gt;you pull up to the scene and there&#039;s police and reporters everywhere
&gt;that&#039;s no surprise, this is an upscale neighborhood
&gt;not quite one percenter, but still nice
&gt;you get the details from a detective
&gt;three men break into the house, not expecting anyone to be home
&gt;they kill a man, a woman, and their young son, and make off with as much stuff as they can carry
&gt;seems perfectly ordinary
&gt;until you overhear one of the neighbors
&quot;Does anyone know where Kelley is?&quot;
&gt;you walk up to the elderly woman
&quot;Excuse me, ma&#039;am? You mentioned a &#039;Kelley&#039;? Who is that?&quot;
&quot;Johnathan&#039;s daughter. She was there when I went over earlier.&quot;
&quot;You were there earlier today?&quot;
&quot;Yes, I was lending them a sewing machine. I saw Kelley there, and I know she hadn&#039;t left yet. Did something happen to her?&quot;
&gt;oh shit
&gt;you run to a detective
&quot;How many bodies did you find?&quot;
&quot;Three, the parents and the kid.&quot;
&quot;What about the daughter?&quot;
&quot;Didn&#039;t see anyone else. You think she got snatched?&quot;
&quot;Assume the worst.&quot; 
&gt;you walk back to your partner and rack your brain 
&gt;you&#039;ve got no idea who could have done this, or where they might have taken the girl
&gt;of course, sometimes fate gives you a freebie
&gt;you feel something tugging on your pant leg
&gt;you look down and find a small puppy looking at the ground
&gt;he was shaking
&gt;you gently pat his head to help him calm down 
&quot;What is it?&quot; 
&gt;the dog lets out a small whine
&quot;I saw people go in the house.&quot; 
&quot;Do you think you can tell me what you saw?&quot;
&gt;the young boy nods
&quot;I saw some men go into the house, and then I heard people screaming, then I heard shooting.&quot;
&gt;you sigh. This kid&#039;s gonna be fucked up for a while
&quot;Do you know what the people looked like?&quot;
&quot;They were big dogs. They looked really mean. They all had these things wrapped around their faces, but I could tell  they were dogs.&quot;
&gt;Anthros, gangbangers by the sound of it
&gt;this just got a whole lot worse 
&gt;you send the kid off and head back to your car
&gt;time for a trip to the ghetto

--

&gt;the first thing that hits you is the smell
&gt;poor neighborhoods attract a certain type
&gt;anthros mostly
&gt;all these animals packed together is wreaking havoc on your nose
&gt;and this garbage music blaring from a boombox
&gt;you look around and find what you&#039;re looking for
&gt;a group of dogs chilling on a porch, smoking and drinking without a care in the world
&gt;each one with a purple bandanna on them somewhere 
&gt;this is definitely what you were looking for
&gt;even if they didn&#039;t his that house, one of them knows who did
&gt;you walk up and make yourself known
&quot;Wassup dawg?&quot;
&gt;one of them laughs
&quot;Man, I know you didn&#039;t just say some shit like that. The fuck you want?&quot;
&quot;I just came by to see if any of you knew about that little break in earlier.&quot;
&gt;the big dog in the center shrugs
&quot;People get clapped every day, dog.&quot;
&quot;Never mentioned any killing&quot; you say.
&gt;he just laughs
&quot;Word travels fast. Some rich humans get killed, so of course you come to my hood and get up in my shit. That&#039;s downright discriminatory.&quot;
&gt;you look at each one of them
&gt;their eyes have no pity in them
&gt;each one would shoot you dead and not lose a wink of sleep
&gt;you felt a strange sort of kinship with them
&quot;Obviously you all know jack shit so I&#039;m not gonna waste any more time. You all have a nice day.&quot;
&gt;you get back in the car
&quot;What was that about?&quot; Jimenez asks.
&quot;I wanted to feel them out. Those guys are hardcases. No way any of them will flip.&quot;
&quot;You have any ideas?&quot; 
&quot;If they did take the girl, she&#039;s probably with the boss. Those guys know they have to pay tribute to the alpha. Problem is we don&#039;t know who this boss is or where we can find him.&quot;
&gt;Jimenez looks like he&#039;s thinking about something
&quot;Think I might know who the boss is.&quot;
&gt;he opens up the squad&#039;s computer and begins typing
&gt;an inmate file appears on the screen
&gt;Laurence Jackson, adult anthro
&gt;served ten years for armed robbery, had multiple arrests for aggravated assault and burglary
&gt;was a person of interest in three different murder cases, but nothing ever stuck
&gt;and from what Jimenez told you, he had a taste for human girls
&gt;this is definitely not the kind of guy you just walk up on
&quot;No known address, no next of kin, nothing that ties him to anyone. How the fuck do we find this guy?&quot;
&gt;Jimenez ponders for a second and types on the computer again
&quot;I found something. Jackson has a younger brother. Got busted for a DUI so he&#039;s in the system. Goes to a community college if you can believe it. It&#039;s a long shot, but maybe he knows something.&quot;
&gt;a lead is better than no lead
&quot;Let&#039;s go say hello.&quot;

--

&gt;of course a community college is filled with people in the middle of the day
&gt;trying to get him out of there would end badly
&gt;nothing you can do but wait
&quot;So what&#039;s it like working with an anthro?&quot; Jimenez asks.
&quot;Just like working with a human, just with more hair.&quot;
&gt;Jimenez seemed interested in the subject of anthros. He went on and on.
&quot;Dated an anthro chick for a while. She was a cow. Huge tits, bigger than my head. Had to break it off cause she was all religious and started talking about getting married. I wasn&#039;t with that. Funny story: buddy of mine actually adopted an anthro. Raised her like his own kid. Now that I think about it his name was Anon too. Maybe the two of you are related.&quot;
&gt;you wonder if he&#039;ll ever stop talking
&gt;then you see your target
&gt;black Doberman getting into a silver Camry
&gt;you&#039;d taken precautions earlier, now it was simply a matter of getting him alone
&gt;he leaves the school&#039;s parking lot, and you follow
&gt;he doesn&#039;t seem to notice you following him
&gt;as far as he knows there&#039;s no reason to worry
&gt;of course he has no idea that you busted out one of his taillights while he was in class
&gt;you wait until he turns down an empty street and hit the lights
&gt;he pulls over and waits for you
&quot;Cover me.&quot; you say to Jimenez as you get out the car
&gt;as you walk toward the car you look around for anyone else
&gt;no one else around
&gt;that&#039;s for the best
&quot;Do you know why I pulled you over?&quot; you ask the dog.
&quot;Fuck if I know. All my shit is in order.&quot; he responds.
&quot;Actually you&#039;ve got a busted taillight.&quot;
&gt;the dog groans
&quot;Are you fuckin&#039; serious? I just got that fixed.&quot;
&quot;While I&#039;ve got you here, I&#039;m looking for your brother. Any idea where I can find him?&quot;
&quot;Man I don&#039;t fuckin&#039; know.&quot;
&gt;you chuckle
&quot;See, I think you do, and I really need to find him. If you know where he is, it&#039;d be better if you tell me.&quot;
&quot;I don&#039;t know shit. Get the fuck away from me with that shit.&quot;
&gt;you tried being nice
&gt;if he had just cooperated he wouldn&#039;t have a gun pressed to his head
&quot;Get the fuck out the car.&quot; you say
&quot;Yo what the fuck is this?&quot; he asks in a panic
&quot;You heard me.&quot;
&gt;he gets out the car
&gt;you walk him up the street to an abandoned house
&gt;Jimenez is visibly confused by what&#039;s happening 
&gt;you grab the dog by the ear
&quot;Last chance. If you know something tell me.&quot;
&quot;I told you I don&#039;t know shit.&quot;
&quot;I hear anthros, dogs in particular, have really sharp hearing. Is that true?&quot;
&quot;Yeah. Why?&quot;
&gt;you place your gun next to his ear and fire
&gt;to you it was a loud pop
&gt;to him it must sound like a bomb blast
&gt;he falls to the ground clutching his ear
&gt;he&#039;ll probably never hear out of that ear again
&quot;Tell me before I destroy the other ear.&quot;
&quot;He&#039;s got this stash house where he keeps his shit. He&#039;s probably there.&quot;
&quot;Where?&quot;
&gt;he gives you an address and you radio it in
&gt;soon every cop in the city is heading for that house
&gt;you leave the dog in a pool of blood and tears
&gt;all in a day&#039;s work
&gt;of course Jimenez is furious
&quot;What the fuck was that? That was fucking illegal. Do you want to go to prison?&quot;
&quot;What, over him? Who&#039;d believe him anyway? He&#039;s just as guilty, happy to take his brother&#039;s money to pay his tuition knowing damn well where it comes from.&quot;
&gt;Jimenez grabs you by the collar
&quot;We&#039;re supposed to uphold the law.&quot;
&quot;In this job, the law is something you learn to work around.&quot;

--

&gt;they found the girl, and arrested most of the crew for the home invasion
&gt;from what you heard the boss took a few slugs before he was cuffed
&gt;tough shit for him 
&gt;at least now you&#039;re back with your partner
&quot;So how was your vacation?&quot; you ask Claire.
&quot;It was boring as hell. I couldn&#039;t leave my house for a month.&quot;
&gt;you didn&#039;t want to know why
&gt;it&#039;s not like it mattered either way
&gt;as long as she could still do her job after she could take as many sabbaticals as she wanted
&gt;speaking of the job, there&#039;s a young looking anthro standing on a corner
&gt;based on his posture he&#039;s obviously serving
&gt;you know he doesn&#039;t have the product on him, but you should still make your presence known
&gt;you ride on him, barely missing him with the front of your car
&quot;You know the drill. Up against the car.&quot;
&gt;you pat him down, but all you find is some loose change
&quot;Yo aren&#039;t you Anon?&quot; the boy asks
&quot;Yeah.&quot;
&quot;Yo I got a buddy up in County sayin&#039; Jackson put ten stacks on your head. Some people are dyin to collect.&quot;
&gt;you laugh
&quot;I&#039;m a cop. If no one wants to kill me then I&#039;m not doing my job.&quot;
&quot;I&#039;m just tryin&#039; to give you a heads up.&quot;
&quot;Get the fuck outta here.&quot;
&gt;you think about what that guy said
&gt;only ten thousand? 
&gt;for some reason you thought you&#039;d be worth more
&quot;What was that about a bounty on your head?&quot; Claire asks once you get back in the car
&quot;Some guy I busted got pissed off. Guys like that talk shit all the time, doesn&#039;t mean anything.&quot;
&gt;Claire looked like she was worried
&quot;I&#039;ve seen my share of this gang shit. Not all of them are just talk.&quot;
&quot;I appreciate your concern, but I&#039;ll be fine.&quot;
&gt;honestly, what&#039;s the worst that could happen?

--

&gt;late at night
&gt;only a couple hours left in your shift
&gt;nothing&#039;s happened yet, but you notice people have been looking at you weird all day
&gt;word must have spread 
&gt;either way no one&#039;s made a move, so there&#039;s nothing to worry about
&quot;Pretty boring&quot; you say
&quot;What?&quot; Claire asks
&gt;shit, must have said that out loud by mistake
&quot;Not much happened today, that&#039;s all&quot;
&quot;That&#039;s good, boring is a good day as far as I&#039;m concerned.&quot;
&gt;but still, it&#039;s weird 
&gt;you&#039;ve barely seen anyone at all today
&gt;it&#039;s like people are actively avoiding you
&gt;as if they know something is gonna happen
&gt;a call comes in on the radio
&gt;someone called 911 
&gt;it wasn&#039;t too far from where you were at now, so you take the call
&gt;you hit the lights and speed down the street
&gt;it never once occurs to you that whatever has been planned is already in motion
&gt;so you&#039;re caught completely off guard when a car slams into you and sends you spinning
&gt;glass flies into your face 
&gt;you&#039;re too dizzy to see straight
&quot;What happened?&quot; you ask
&gt;Claire got her composure back
&quot;Somebody hit us. Are you okay?&quot;
&quot;Bleeding, other than that I&#039;m fine.&quot;
&gt;Claire&#039;s ear perks up and her eye goes wide
&gt;she grabs you and pushes you down
&gt;before you can ask what&#039;s up you find yourself being shot at
&gt;from the sound they&#039;re all packing automatics
&gt;you&#039;re trapped under a wall of gunfire 
&gt;you feel a bullet hit you in the leg
&quot;Shots fired! Shots fired! Officer needs assistance!&quot; you shout into your radio
&gt;the shooting stops for a moment
&gt;you throw open the door and fall out of the car
&gt;the ground smacks you in the face
&gt;you draw your gun and fire back towards the shooters
&gt;it&#039;s unclear if you hit anyone, but it should hold them back for a bit
&gt;Claire grabs you and the two of you move to find somewhere to hide
&gt;however this is an empty road, and the only nearby building is an apartment complex
&gt;that might as well be a death trap
&gt;but, it&#039;s better than nothing
&quot;What the fuck&#039;s going on?&quot; Claire asks
&quot;Guess they&#039;re coming to collect&quot; you say
&gt;this isn&#039;t exactly how you planned on dying, but beggars can&#039;t be choosers
&gt;on the way to the complex another car pulls up in front of you
&gt;four men with guns in their hands
&gt;you and Claire open fire
&gt;you get hit again
&gt;twice in the chest, once in the shoulder
&gt;it burns 
&gt;you can&#039;t breathe
&gt;ignoring the pain, you keep shooting
&gt;once the four in the car are all dead you collapse 
&gt;your mouth fills up with blood 
&gt;it hurts to breathe
&gt;everything hurts actually
&gt;with what feels like all of your strength you turn over
&gt;Claire crouches over you and places a hand on your face
&quot;It&#039;s gonna be okay. We&#039;ve got backup coming.&quot;
&gt;you can hear sirens in the distance
&gt;fuck, everything&#039;s going dark
&gt;Claire stands back up and goes off somewhere
&gt;where&#039;s she going?
&gt;is she just gonna leave you like this?
&gt;you hear more shooting before everything goes black

--

&gt;it wasn&#039;t long before you were well enough to leave the hospital
&gt;a collapsed lung and a broken shoulder were the worst of your injuries
&gt;but that&#039;s the last thing on your mind right now
&gt;right now you&#039;re sitting in a church surrounded by other cops
&gt;there&#039;s an organ playing in the background
&gt;you can here some women crying
&gt;a priest is saying some words, but you barely hear it
&gt;your parents are in here somewhere, but you&#039;re in no hurry to find them
&gt;you don&#039;t see anyone from Claire&#039;s family
&gt;then again, she never mentioned having a family
&gt;that&#039;s probably the worst part
&gt;looking at the portrait by her casket you&#039;d never guess how alone she really was
&gt;that bright smile of hers had a small hint of sadness in it
&gt;you&#039;re such a fuck up you couldn&#039;t even be there for her when she died
&gt;this is all your fault anyway
&gt;she tried to warn you about what you were doing, but you just wouldn&#039;t listen
&gt;and now she&#039;s dead
&gt;a good woman, a good cop, and a good friend
&gt;even in her last moments all she thought about was keeping you safe
&gt;you get out of your seat and go outside
&gt;you can feel everyone&#039;s eyes on you as you leave
&gt;it&#039;s like they can&#039;t believe that she&#039;s gone but you&#039;re still here
&gt;you can&#039;t believe it either
&gt;once you&#039;re certain you&#039;re alone you fall to your knees
&gt;you don&#039;t know when you started crying, but now you can&#039;t stop
&gt;sadness doesn&#039;t begin to describe this
&gt;it&#039;s like you&#039;re being crushed under a giant weight 
&gt;no matter how hard you try you&#039;ll never be able to make this right
&quot;It should have been me&quot; you say to no one.
&quot;It should have been me.&quot;</textarea>
