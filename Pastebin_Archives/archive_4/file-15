Unfortunately, one in particular is not fond of sharing him.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Man, is he furious</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are working at the Museum of History and Technology as a temp job</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s usually a pretty easy job: pick up trash, hand out maps, yell at kids to get off the displays</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But today the museum director is running all over absolutely steaming</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Most of the museum was shut down for renovations, and the exhibits were taken away for cleaning or repairing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When the various artifacts and dioramas were returned everything had been put back all wrong</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some artifacts were thrown onto the floor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some statues were blocking doorways</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And then there’s exhibit 27C</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In what was supposed to be a section devoted mostly to dinosaurs, a bunch of other stuff is thrown into the scene so incompetently it had to be done intentionally</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Saber toothed tigers are chasing a stegosaurus</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some kind of ancient pyramid is sitting on top of a tar pit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Tribal fetishes and primitive fertility icons are hung on the “sky” that’s supposed to be a nature backdrop for the scene</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even a life-sized replica of the Rosetta Stone is tossed in there, because why not</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, according to one of the movers’ excuses it was done because “it looked like cave drawings”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”How the hell does this even happen!?” the director says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Having an answer to that isn’t exactly in your pay grade</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Unfortunately, you need to investigate anyway</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The whole staff is sent around the museum to catalog all the misplaced or missing displays, and you’re in charge of 27C</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can kind of see the thought process of how all the inaccuracies were made</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The movers clearly grew up with The Flintstones and based their arrangement off of the show</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re examining the exhibit with clipboard in hand noting everything wrong about it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you duck behind the pyramid your heart stops</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Holy shit, is that a bomb!?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s a small, box-like device humming and vibrating on the floor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You then notice the gyros on top, realizing it must be from the Technology wing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But that’s all the way on the other side of the museum</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Those were some pretty dumb movers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The director deliberately said not to touch anything “unless you absolutely have to”, but it’s just going to drain electricity or overheat if you don’t unplug it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When you approach it, the gyros start spinning wildly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The whole device lifts off the ground</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A white flash of light like an old camera goes off, and you pass out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You awaken to the sound of insects buzzing, lying under the shade of enormous leaves</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s a pool of murky water nearby with a pair of strange, goofy looking creatures eating the flora around it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wait, are those...dinosaurs?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t know exactly what kind you’re looking at, but with your mind on dinos just moments ago they can’t be anything else</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Outside of the overgrowth are rolling hills and scattered vegetation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ancient wildlife everywhere</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Did you just go back in time?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The dinos squeal in pain, and you see large spears sticking out of them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You spin around, trying to see where the attack came from</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;From out of the shrubbery creeps a burly feline with massive fangs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A saber toothed tiger</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Walking on two legs?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And obviously female</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Spear in hand, wearing a leather loincloth and a band around her furry breasts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Jewelry adorns her body, and her head it topped with a feathered headdress</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her muscular physique shows even through her dusty pelt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s a predatory, yet inquisitive look in her eyes as she stands guard with her spear aimed at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t think you could outrun her (or her weapon), so you stare her down hoping to buy a few extra seconds</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That’s exactly what she wants</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;By the time you sense the others behind you, you’re already on the ground tangled in a net</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Four more of the felines, all female, dare you to make a move</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”What is this thing, Nassial?” one of the says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now they’re talking in your language?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They make room for the one you confronted first, Nassial</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looms over you, blocking out the sun</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Should we kill it?” one of the others says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Wait,” both you and Nassial say in unison</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They all jump back in surprise</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Now it’s talking? In OUR tongue?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They look to Nassial for command, or some sort of answer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”What ARE you?” the leader says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The way her question rumbles is even more threatening than the dinosaurs and the other sabers with their spears combined</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Human, you try explaining</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Are there any others like you nearby?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Yes?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Maybe?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don’t even know where you are right now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Hmph. We’ll bring it back with us,” Nassial says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re carried off in the net like a hammock by the four who trapped you, with Nassial following in the rear to keep an eye on you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Any time you look at her you see an unblinking stare</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Any time you look at any of the others for too long, she growls at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re better off just closing your eyes for the trip</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take a peek when you hear the commotion of civilization</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh look, it’s a whole lush village filled with buildings shaped like pyramids</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The pieces are coming together now, no matter how mismatched they still are</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It doesn’t take long before you notice something about the sabers milling about</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Young or old, there’s nothing but females here</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They stare at you in awe as you are carried through their village and up the main stairs of the biggest structure</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Inside looks like a gathering hall, with a pile of leathers stacked high on stone steps in the far end</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sitting on top is an aged saber with a sagging hide, one chipped fang and the other gone completely</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Unlike the others, she doesn’t react much to the sight of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”What have you brought today, Nassial?” she says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”It calls itself a ‘human’,” the leader says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The sage blinks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Interesting...”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You are unrolled by your captors, though they keep the net held up as though it were a fence keeping you from running away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The sage hobbles over and feels your clothes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”So soft,” she says. “I would hate to destroy such craftsmanship. Would you mind removing them for us?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What, now? In front of all these women?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They’re not human women, but still...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Take them off, or I’ll TEAR them off with any flesh I grab as well,” Nassial says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hesitantly strip down to nothing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Thankfully, they’re more interested in you than judgmental</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You cover yourself reflexively, but the sage just brushes you hands away like moving a leaf from her path</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Male,” she says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s murmuring from the others</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Do you know what he is?” Nassial asks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”He’s a human,” the sage says as though she came to the conclusion herself. “Male human, yes. Perhaps a gift from the Fang Mother.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nassial scoffs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”He’s not even one of us, though. What use do we have for such a ‘gift’?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The sage shrugs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Take him along on your hunts. Maybe his role among us will be clear then.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You see the gears working in Nassial’s eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Fine,” she responds. “Tomorrow he comes with us. Tonight he sleeps outside, with the night guard.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re given a matted blanket to sleep on, along with some cooked (dino?) meat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sleeping with so many eyes on you is troublesome at first, but is also a little comforting</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As long as you’re not being used as bait, no harm will come to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Right?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Does anyone back home even know you’re gone?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re roused from sleep by the leader, Nassial</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The saber tooth you learn is the leader of the ENTIRE tribe, and not the worldly sage</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The night was cool, but you can already tell the day will be a hot one</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You strip down to your underwear and take a rather dilapidated spear with you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You stay in the front,” Nassial orders, “so we can keep you from running off, and to see your hunting prowess.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Which isn’t that great</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whether it’s the shape of the spear or the thick plates of the dinos, you can’t seem to make any successful strike against them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sometimes they flee before you can even lift your weapon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Any mistakes you make are met with snarling and the sabers charging in to fix things</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nassial isn’t too happy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You may be better off making clothes, or sweeping the streets,” she growls</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you’re given one final chance to redeem yourself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s a few more of the goofy looking things milling about, though these at least have some fairly nasty looking spikes on them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you can make the first move, however, Nassial grabs your shoulder</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Hold it. Watch.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, you can feel and hear it before anything else</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A goddamn Tyrannosaurus rex</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just as intimidating as you’d imagine</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It attacks the docile dinosaurs, trying to pick them off one at a time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Some of its prey fights back, getting a few good blows in before being killed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Let them wear it down, and then we move in.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod and stay attentive</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When Nassial takes her hand off your shoulder, you hear a faint sniffing from her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Great, now you’re self-conscious about your sweaty odor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The T-rex begins ripping apart its prey, but it doesn’t get too far before the sabers launch in for the ambush</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Between the beast’s fatigue and the deadly precision of the women, it’s slain in a flurry of spears</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”What a catch!” Nassial says triumphantly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Two of the others run back to the village to get help transporting their game back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With more sabers on hand, the T-rex and its prey are then stripped, cut up, and hauled back in chunks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The whole village seems to be in better humor when the hunting party returns with its trophies</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn’t really do much to contribute, but Nassial doesn’t harass you about it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Hold it, let me check for wounds,” she says, steering you into a private chamber</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You didn’t get hurt much (or at all, really) except for a bit of your pride</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Once inside, she’s at your back spreading her paw pads all over as though combing through fur you don’t have</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She grabs your head to keep you looking forward, and you can feel the breathing of her snout up against your skin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The rumble of Nassial’s lungs is audible as she heaves in and out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You offer no resistance, and your arm is soon hoisted over your head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She isn’t even trying to be discreet any longer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her nose buries into your underarm and she inhales deeply</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For the longest time you’re standing still with the saber tooth hyperventilating behind you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Stay there!” she barks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You don&#039;t need to be told twice</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She leaves you alone, but returns in less than a minute</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You hear the sloshing of water moments before being drenched by a clay jar</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”They can’t...know your scent...too strong...for safety,” she mutters incoherently</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re “fur dried” with her paws, and then her whole body, before you’re allowed back outside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The village accepts you into their evening feast, indulging in the spoils of the hunt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s music, dancing, and bonfires</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No amount of activity is enough to distract Nassial</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her eyes stay on you for the entire night, and even when you lie down to sleep</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The next day follows a similar hunting pattern, albeit with a darker, ominous sky</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your technique hasn’t improved much, but Nassial is more encouraging</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To you, anyway</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;To the others, she’s much more impatient and critical</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”What has gotten you so agitated?” one of the others says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She almost takes a spear shaft to the face from her comment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But Nassial is distracted without a doubt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her wide battle stance from the last two days is replaced with knees touching and thighs rubbing together </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;By midday, sweat is dripping from you thanks to the humidity</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A booming is heard not too far in the distance</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Thank the Fang Mother,” Nassial mutters under her breath</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The hunt is called early, and you return to the village just before the downpour</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Without saying a word, Nassial pulls you up the stairs to an abode almost as high up as the gathering hall</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s a glazed look in her eyes, and NOW you see the same predatory stance as when you first squared off against her in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Y-you did this to me,” she huffs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Our men have all gone...slain, sick...months ago. Now YOU show up, and I can’t stop this crippling heat. I can’t see clearly. I can’t...think.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She grabs you and pins you down atop a stack of leathers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Take it off,” she says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can’t exactly move your arms much the way they are, but you make an earnest effort to reach your waist</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”No, MINE!” she hisses</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can’t reach her loincloth either, so you tentatively grab her breast wrap</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have just enough wingspan to untie her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The strip of fabric flops to your chest as her breasts dangle free, her nipples poking through her coat</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She lets go of you but places her paws opposite your head, nodding slowly with her eyes shut</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You cup her breasts and rub your thumbs over the aroused teats</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her mouth unhinges and her drool splatters around you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You never realized just how far a saber tooth’s mouth can even open</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”N-now...you.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You roll your underwear down as far as you can while on your back, just enough to give her what she needs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her hips lift up and position themselves for the inevitable</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’ve been too busy focusing on the sabers’ teeth and weapons to fully absorb how little those loincloths actually cover</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s completely exposed, and the heat from her engorged lips pours over you as she eases her weight down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She takes your length little by little, whether out of unfamiliar strain or savoring each bit at a time</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her muscles are visibly flexed as she works her way around you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The huntress, the leader, the sword-fanged beast...</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mewling and shuddering by the time your hips touch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s frozen on you, feeling your pulse as she relishes the moment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”T-thank the Fang Mother,” she gasps.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like a piston, her gyrating is slow to start before rapidly building up speed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s not long already before your pelvis aches from her fervent humping</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;For such a sexually starved creature, her stamina is impressive</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s either aware of your discomfort, or begging for you to take control</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But in any case, it’s time for her to switch positions</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Without disconnecting, you are flipped to your feet while she rolls onto her back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Too fast for you to grasp what even happened</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her rump is in the air and her legs hook around your waist</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s got core strength, no doubt</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you resume thrusting, you find yourself leaning forward a little too much</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grab a hold of the only support you can find</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her fangs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”C-careful!” she snaps. “They’re not made of stone!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try your best not to put too much pressure on her teeth, but you’re also concerned about trying not to finish too soon and risk her fury</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That, however, seems the opposite of her wishes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Rrrragghhh, give IN already! You are MY quarry, and I will drain you dry!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now holding back is no longer a matter of life or death</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s probably just death if you do</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your escalating climax is reached and unloaded with one last pump</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As you splash her insides, the saber tooth lets out a silent roar</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her throat muscles contract, but she is too enervated to do anything but pant</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You slowly pull yourself out of her, suddenly feeling the chill of the rainy air without her heat around you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But her legs clench tighter as you try to move away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Not yet...you’re not finished...until I say so.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a jerk Nassial pulls you on top of her, one arm grappling you to her bosom while her other paw cups your groin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”We must take advantage of the rains. They won’t hear us like this, and I will not let you go until the seed has taken hold.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That doesn’t sound good</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nassial becomes highly possessive of you over the following weeks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re not allowed out of her sight, and you’re not allowed to go into the danger of the hunts with her either</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She mates with you frequently, sometimes with the rains masking your noises and sometimes out in the vegetation when privacy is scarcer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her forcefulness drops off a bit from the first night</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In fact, some nights are spent in her arms with her claws making red marks on your chest, as if she’s squeezing a loved toy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It doesn’t take long before the other women grow suspicious</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They sniff the air around the two of you, but it’s less about your post-sex aroma and more about the subtle changes from Nassial’s fertility</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then the changes become impossible to ignore</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nassial’s appetite intensifies, and the definition of her abdominal muscles is concealed by the growing swell of her belly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There is a village meeting before the sage, and the other women finally confront their leader</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Nassial carries a litter within her!” they shout</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nassial is clearly searching for a way to challenge the accusation, but her paw instinctively touches her stomach</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Is this true?” the sage says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”It’s as you said,” Nassial growls, “the human is a blessing from the Fang Mother.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”A blessing for the whole tribe!” one of the others cries</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”He is MY prize, and the tribe’s lineage will pass on because of it!”	</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Then perhaps it’s time for a change in leadership!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The women advance forward, but Nassial grabs a spear and repels them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You would betray your ruler? You would kill her unborn cubs? You would waste YOUR lives just for the CHANCE to overthrow me?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”THAT’S ENOUGH,” the sage roars</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her age and weathered look have not quelled her spirit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I do believe the Fang Mother has given Anon as a gift for us all, but also as a test of our tribe’s unity. If you strike out against one another, the Fang Mother will curse you all.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There is a hush over the whole village</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The sage’s words are less of a warning and more of a guarantee</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Nassial...” the sage says, back to her soft-spoken nature,” I urge you to reconsider. Until we find more males out there we need Anon to ensure the safety of our tribe.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The anger is gone from the other sabers, and the women just look to their leader plaintively.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nassial sighs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks back to the sage hoping to see her support, but the elder saber is unyielding</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Fine, he will mate with the rest of the tribe for its survival.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The tension dissipates</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A few walk forward only to be stopped once more by Nassial’s spear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”But as your leader, I will control who mates with him. You will copulate with MY approval, and only as long as I deem necessary. At night, he will bed with ME and me alone.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One step is all she needs to push the whole crowd back in fear</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Should I catch anyone attempting to usurp Anon or my authority, I shall break her legs and leave her for the raptors. AM I UNDERSTOOD?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Silent nodding, even from the sage</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Guess you’re not getting a say in this</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The fate of being a breeding slave comes with being venerated as a savior of sorts</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Both you and Nassial are catered to each day, especially as an attempt to win her favor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nassial oversees all potential mates for you, going so far as to sometimes watch the deed being done</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The women don’t have the same kind of performance anxiety it seems, likely unabashed in their raging lust</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But Nassial actually considers your condition most times</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like if you are too raw or tired, she prohibits mating until you’re ready</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even then, she “urges” you to conserve some energy for her own lovemaking needs at night</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Young, hopeful, and rejected sabers are sent out to hunt for greater quantities of food to feed the increasing appetite of those selected for reproduction</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This in turn improves the overall strength and hunting skill of the tribe, as the warriors hope to someday become the coveted chosen ones</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After months, you see your labor pay off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Over a third of the women around the village cradle their gravid bellies containing your progeny</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They look to you with delight, stroking the gift you’ve given and reminding you of each night you were allowed to share with them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Most of the women continue to hunt until they become too large, then they help out with other chores</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even Nassial hangs her spear for the time being when her expansion proves too cumbersome</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;However, she hasn’t lost her warrior’s might as she prepares new homes for the tribe</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Despite her warnings, some unapproved or heat-possessed women try to entice you while their leader is preoccupied</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not wanting to share in the wrath, you hold them off long enough for Nassial to catch the disobedience</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At the same time, the leader’s threats are never truly carried out apart from verbal reprimands and a few swipes from her paws</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It seems her maternal temperament is making her more forgiving</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It also helps that the tribe becomes more self-governing, and any women who “cut in line” are punished by the others</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Regardless, the approved mates still try to impress you and outshine each other</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But something about Nassial, whether it’s her dominance or her confidence, makes her your only true queen</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’ve since accepted this as your new home</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s little chance you’ll see your own world again, but this new one ensures you’ll be taken good care of</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nassial’s pregnancy turns her from an aggressive ruler to a motherly caretaker</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At least to a certain extent</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It helps that she feels honor (and a little smugness) for being your first, the farthest one along in her growth, and will very likely hold the record for being the biggest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her hunger alone is a testament to this</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A pile of fruit cores and discarded dino ribs are stacked up in the aftermath of her feasting</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But no amount of girth keeps her from her commanding duties, or douses her heat and desire</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s raining heavily one night when you’re in bed with her, after being thoroughly drained yet again </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Almost your whole body is curled around her enormous belly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She guides your hands as you feel for life within her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Mine will be the strongest,” she reminds you.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You could have guessed that from the dozens of spears and knives she already has stockpiled for her cubs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Our tribe will grow with unmatched warriors, but OUR kin will reign over these lands.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Kissing proves to be a little awkward with her sword-like canines</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She instead shows her affection by nuzzling your head and massaging you with her soft, leathery paw pads</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your hands are forced back by the roiling of life in her womb</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”See? Strong already!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The wind howls through the village, whistling as it passes by</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nassial pulls you closer for security, and even her cubs calm down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”And when they’re born, we will prepare for the next litter. With any luck, the Fang Mother will bless us with these rains again when the time comes.”</div></li></ol>        </div>

        <textarea class="textarea">Reigns over Barren Land [Saber Tooth Tiger; Tribal, Harem, Pregnancy]: Anon is the only male in a tribe of female saber tooth tigers, and his presence alone is enough to put them into heat. Unfortunately, one in particular is not fond of sharing him.

&gt;Man, is he furious
&gt;You are working at the Museum of History and Technology as a temp job
&gt;It’s usually a pretty easy job: pick up trash, hand out maps, yell at kids to get off the displays
&gt;But today the museum director is running all over absolutely steaming
&gt;Most of the museum was shut down for renovations, and the exhibits were taken away for cleaning or repairing
&gt;When the various artifacts and dioramas were returned everything had been put back all wrong
&gt;Some artifacts were thrown onto the floor
&gt;Some statues were blocking doorways
&gt;And then there’s exhibit 27C
&gt;In what was supposed to be a section devoted mostly to dinosaurs, a bunch of other stuff is thrown into the scene so incompetently it had to be done intentionally
&gt;Saber toothed tigers are chasing a stegosaurus
&gt;Some kind of ancient pyramid is sitting on top of a tar pit
&gt;Tribal fetishes and primitive fertility icons are hung on the “sky” that’s supposed to be a nature backdrop for the scene
&gt;Even a life-sized replica of the Rosetta Stone is tossed in there, because why not
&gt;Well, according to one of the movers’ excuses it was done because “it looked like cave drawings”
&gt;”How the hell does this even happen!?” the director says
&gt;Having an answer to that isn’t exactly in your pay grade
&gt;Unfortunately, you need to investigate anyway
&gt;The whole staff is sent around the museum to catalog all the misplaced or missing displays, and you’re in charge of 27C
&gt;You can kind of see the thought process of how all the inaccuracies were made
&gt;The movers clearly grew up with The Flintstones and based their arrangement off of the show
&gt;You’re examining the exhibit with clipboard in hand noting everything wrong about it
&gt;When you duck behind the pyramid your heart stops
&gt;Holy shit, is that a bomb!?
&gt;There’s a small, box-like device humming and vibrating on the floor
&gt;You then notice the gyros on top, realizing it must be from the Technology wing
&gt;But that’s all the way on the other side of the museum
&gt;Those were some pretty dumb movers
&gt;The director deliberately said not to touch anything “unless you absolutely have to”, but it’s just going to drain electricity or overheat if you don’t unplug it
&gt;When you approach it, the gyros start spinning wildly
&gt;The whole device lifts off the ground
&gt;A white flash of light like an old camera goes off, and you pass out

&gt;You awaken to the sound of insects buzzing, lying under the shade of enormous leaves
&gt;There’s a pool of murky water nearby with a pair of strange, goofy looking creatures eating the flora around it
&gt;Wait, are those...dinosaurs?
&gt;You don’t know exactly what kind you’re looking at, but with your mind on dinos just moments ago they can’t be anything else
&gt;Outside of the overgrowth are rolling hills and scattered vegetation
&gt;Ancient wildlife everywhere
&gt;Did you just go back in time?
&gt;The dinos squeal in pain, and you see large spears sticking out of them
&gt;You spin around, trying to see where the attack came from
&gt;From out of the shrubbery creeps a burly feline with massive fangs
&gt;A saber toothed tiger
&gt;Walking on two legs?
&gt;And obviously female
&gt;Spear in hand, wearing a leather loincloth and a band around her furry breasts
&gt;Jewelry adorns her body, and her head it topped with a feathered headdress
&gt;Her muscular physique shows even through her dusty pelt
&gt;There’s a predatory, yet inquisitive look in her eyes as she stands guard with her spear aimed at you
&gt;You don’t think you could outrun her (or her weapon), so you stare her down hoping to buy a few extra seconds
&gt;That’s exactly what she wants
&gt;By the time you sense the others behind you, you’re already on the ground tangled in a net
&gt;Four more of the felines, all female, dare you to make a move
&gt;”What is this thing, Nassial?” one of the says
&gt;Now they’re talking in your language?
&gt;They make room for the one you confronted first, Nassial
&gt;She looms over you, blocking out the sun
&gt;”Should we kill it?” one of the others says
&gt;”Wait,” both you and Nassial say in unison
&gt;They all jump back in surprise
&gt;”Now it’s talking? In OUR tongue?”
&gt;They look to Nassial for command, or some sort of answer
&gt;”What ARE you?” the leader says
&gt;The way her question rumbles is even more threatening than the dinosaurs and the other sabers with their spears combined
&gt;Human, you try explaining
&gt;”Are there any others like you nearby?”
&gt;Yes?
&gt;Maybe?
&gt;You don’t even know where you are right now
&gt;”Hmph. We’ll bring it back with us,” Nassial says
&gt;You’re carried off in the net like a hammock by the four who trapped you, with Nassial following in the rear to keep an eye on you
&gt;Any time you look at her you see an unblinking stare
&gt;Any time you look at any of the others for too long, she growls at you
&gt;You’re better off just closing your eyes for the trip

&gt;You take a peek when you hear the commotion of civilization
&gt;Oh look, it’s a whole lush village filled with buildings shaped like pyramids
&gt;The pieces are coming together now, no matter how mismatched they still are
&gt;It doesn’t take long before you notice something about the sabers milling about
&gt;Young or old, there’s nothing but females here
&gt;They stare at you in awe as you are carried through their village and up the main stairs of the biggest structure
&gt;Inside looks like a gathering hall, with a pile of leathers stacked high on stone steps in the far end
&gt;Sitting on top is an aged saber with a sagging hide, one chipped fang and the other gone completely
&gt;Unlike the others, she doesn’t react much to the sight of you
&gt;”What have you brought today, Nassial?” she says
&gt;”It calls itself a ‘human’,” the leader says
&gt;The sage blinks
&gt;”Interesting...”
&gt;You are unrolled by your captors, though they keep the net held up as though it were a fence keeping you from running away
&gt;The sage hobbles over and feels your clothes
&gt;”So soft,” she says. “I would hate to destroy such craftsmanship. Would you mind removing them for us?”
&gt;What, now? In front of all these women?
&gt;They’re not human women, but still...
&gt;”Take them off, or I’ll TEAR them off with any flesh I grab as well,” Nassial says
&gt;You hesitantly strip down to nothing
&gt;Thankfully, they’re more interested in you than judgmental
&gt;You cover yourself reflexively, but the sage just brushes you hands away like moving a leaf from her path
&gt;”Male,” she says
&gt;There’s murmuring from the others
&gt;”Do you know what he is?” Nassial asks
&gt;”He’s a human,” the sage says as though she came to the conclusion herself. “Male human, yes. Perhaps a gift from the Fang Mother.”
&gt;Nassial scoffs
&gt;”He’s not even one of us, though. What use do we have for such a ‘gift’?”
&gt;The sage shrugs
&gt;”Take him along on your hunts. Maybe his role among us will be clear then.”
&gt;You see the gears working in Nassial’s eyes
&gt;”Fine,” she responds. “Tomorrow he comes with us. Tonight he sleeps outside, with the night guard.”
&gt;You’re given a matted blanket to sleep on, along with some cooked (dino?) meat
&gt;Sleeping with so many eyes on you is troublesome at first, but is also a little comforting
&gt;As long as you’re not being used as bait, no harm will come to you
&gt;Right?
&gt;Right?
&gt;Does anyone back home even know you’re gone?

&gt;You’re roused from sleep by the leader, Nassial
&gt;The saber tooth you learn is the leader of the ENTIRE tribe, and not the worldly sage
&gt;The night was cool, but you can already tell the day will be a hot one
&gt;You strip down to your underwear and take a rather dilapidated spear with you
&gt;”You stay in the front,” Nassial orders, “so we can keep you from running off, and to see your hunting prowess.”
&gt;Which isn’t that great
&gt;Whether it’s the shape of the spear or the thick plates of the dinos, you can’t seem to make any successful strike against them
&gt;Sometimes they flee before you can even lift your weapon
&gt;Any mistakes you make are met with snarling and the sabers charging in to fix things
&gt;Nassial isn’t too happy
&gt;”You may be better off making clothes, or sweeping the streets,” she growls
&gt;But you’re given one final chance to redeem yourself
&gt;There’s a few more of the goofy looking things milling about, though these at least have some fairly nasty looking spikes on them
&gt;Before you can make the first move, however, Nassial grabs your shoulder
&gt;”Hold it. Watch.”
&gt;Well, you can feel and hear it before anything else
&gt;A goddamn Tyrannosaurus rex
&gt;Just as intimidating as you’d imagine
&gt;It attacks the docile dinosaurs, trying to pick them off one at a time
&gt;Some of its prey fights back, getting a few good blows in before being killed
&gt;”Let them wear it down, and then we move in.”
&gt;You nod and stay attentive
&gt;When Nassial takes her hand off your shoulder, you hear a faint sniffing from her
&gt;Great, now you’re self-conscious about your sweaty odor
&gt;The T-rex begins ripping apart its prey, but it doesn’t get too far before the sabers launch in for the ambush
&gt;Between the beast’s fatigue and the deadly precision of the women, it’s slain in a flurry of spears
&gt;”What a catch!” Nassial says triumphantly
&gt;Two of the others run back to the village to get help transporting their game back
&gt;With more sabers on hand, the T-rex and its prey are then stripped, cut up, and hauled back in chunks

&gt;The whole village seems to be in better humor when the hunting party returns with its trophies
&gt;You didn’t really do much to contribute, but Nassial doesn’t harass you about it
&gt;”Hold it, let me check for wounds,” she says, steering you into a private chamber
&gt;You didn’t get hurt much (or at all, really) except for a bit of your pride
&gt;Once inside, she’s at your back spreading her paw pads all over as though combing through fur you don’t have
&gt;She grabs your head to keep you looking forward, and you can feel the breathing of her snout up against your skin
&gt;The rumble of Nassial’s lungs is audible as she heaves in and out
&gt;You offer no resistance, and your arm is soon hoisted over your head
&gt;She isn’t even trying to be discreet any longer
&gt;Her nose buries into your underarm and she inhales deeply
&gt;For the longest time you’re standing still with the saber tooth hyperventilating behind you
&gt;”Stay there!” she barks
&gt;You don&#039;t need to be told twice
&gt;She leaves you alone, but returns in less than a minute
&gt;You hear the sloshing of water moments before being drenched by a clay jar
&gt;”They can’t...know your scent...too strong...for safety,” she mutters incoherently
&gt;You’re “fur dried” with her paws, and then her whole body, before you’re allowed back outside
&gt;The village accepts you into their evening feast, indulging in the spoils of the hunt
&gt;There’s music, dancing, and bonfires
&gt;No amount of activity is enough to distract Nassial
&gt;Her eyes stay on you for the entire night, and even when you lie down to sleep

&gt;The next day follows a similar hunting pattern, albeit with a darker, ominous sky
&gt;Your technique hasn’t improved much, but Nassial is more encouraging
&gt;To you, anyway
&gt;To the others, she’s much more impatient and critical
&gt;”What has gotten you so agitated?” one of the others says
&gt;She almost takes a spear shaft to the face from her comment
&gt;But Nassial is distracted without a doubt
&gt;Her wide battle stance from the last two days is replaced with knees touching and thighs rubbing together 
&gt;By midday, sweat is dripping from you thanks to the humidity
&gt;A booming is heard not too far in the distance
&gt;”Thank the Fang Mother,” Nassial mutters under her breath
&gt;The hunt is called early, and you return to the village just before the downpour
&gt;Without saying a word, Nassial pulls you up the stairs to an abode almost as high up as the gathering hall
&gt;Hers
&gt;There’s a glazed look in her eyes, and NOW you see the same predatory stance as when you first squared off against her in
&gt;”Y-you did this to me,” she huffs
&gt;”Our men have all gone...slain, sick...months ago. Now YOU show up, and I can’t stop this crippling heat. I can’t see clearly. I can’t...think.”
&gt;She grabs you and pins you down atop a stack of leathers
&gt;”Take it off,” she says
&gt;You can’t exactly move your arms much the way they are, but you make an earnest effort to reach your waist
&gt;”No, MINE!” she hisses
&gt;You can’t reach her loincloth either, so you tentatively grab her breast wrap
&gt;You have just enough wingspan to untie her
&gt;The strip of fabric flops to your chest as her breasts dangle free, her nipples poking through her coat
&gt;She lets go of you but places her paws opposite your head, nodding slowly with her eyes shut
&gt;You cup her breasts and rub your thumbs over the aroused teats
&gt;Her mouth unhinges and her drool splatters around you
&gt;You never realized just how far a saber tooth’s mouth can even open
&gt;”N-now...you.”
&gt;You roll your underwear down as far as you can while on your back, just enough to give her what she needs
&gt;Her hips lift up and position themselves for the inevitable
&gt;You’ve been too busy focusing on the sabers’ teeth and weapons to fully absorb how little those loincloths actually cover
&gt;She’s completely exposed, and the heat from her engorged lips pours over you as she eases her weight down
&gt;She takes your length little by little, whether out of unfamiliar strain or savoring each bit at a time
&gt;Her muscles are visibly flexed as she works her way around you
&gt;The huntress, the leader, the sword-fanged beast...
&gt;Mewling and shuddering by the time your hips touch
&gt;She’s frozen on you, feeling your pulse as she relishes the moment
&gt;”T-thank the Fang Mother,” she gasps.
&gt;Like a piston, her gyrating is slow to start before rapidly building up speed
&gt;It’s not long already before your pelvis aches from her fervent humping
&gt;For such a sexually starved creature, her stamina is impressive
&gt;She’s either aware of your discomfort, or begging for you to take control
&gt;But in any case, it’s time for her to switch positions
&gt;Without disconnecting, you are flipped to your feet while she rolls onto her back
&gt;Too fast for you to grasp what even happened
&gt;Her rump is in the air and her legs hook around your waist
&gt;She’s got core strength, no doubt
&gt;As you resume thrusting, you find yourself leaning forward a little too much
&gt;You grab a hold of the only support you can find
&gt;Her fangs
&gt;”C-careful!” she snaps. “They’re not made of stone!”
&gt;You try your best not to put too much pressure on her teeth, but you’re also concerned about trying not to finish too soon and risk her fury
&gt;That, however, seems the opposite of her wishes
&gt;”Rrrragghhh, give IN already! You are MY quarry, and I will drain you dry!”
&gt;Now holding back is no longer a matter of life or death
&gt;It’s probably just death if you do
&gt;Your escalating climax is reached and unloaded with one last pump
&gt;As you splash her insides, the saber tooth lets out a silent roar
&gt;Her throat muscles contract, but she is too enervated to do anything but pant
&gt;You slowly pull yourself out of her, suddenly feeling the chill of the rainy air without her heat around you
&gt;But her legs clench tighter as you try to move away
&gt;”Not yet...you’re not finished...until I say so.”
&gt;With a jerk Nassial pulls you on top of her, one arm grappling you to her bosom while her other paw cups your groin
&gt;”We must take advantage of the rains. They won’t hear us like this, and I will not let you go until the seed has taken hold.”
&gt;That doesn’t sound good

&gt;Nassial becomes highly possessive of you over the following weeks
&gt;You’re not allowed out of her sight, and you’re not allowed to go into the danger of the hunts with her either
&gt;She mates with you frequently, sometimes with the rains masking your noises and sometimes out in the vegetation when privacy is scarcer
&gt;Her forcefulness drops off a bit from the first night
&gt;In fact, some nights are spent in her arms with her claws making red marks on your chest, as if she’s squeezing a loved toy
&gt;It doesn’t take long before the other women grow suspicious
&gt;They sniff the air around the two of you, but it’s less about your post-sex aroma and more about the subtle changes from Nassial’s fertility
&gt;Then the changes become impossible to ignore
&gt;Nassial’s appetite intensifies, and the definition of her abdominal muscles is concealed by the growing swell of her belly
&gt;There is a village meeting before the sage, and the other women finally confront their leader
&gt;”Nassial carries a litter within her!” they shout
&gt;Nassial is clearly searching for a way to challenge the accusation, but her paw instinctively touches her stomach
&gt;”Is this true?” the sage says
&gt;”It’s as you said,” Nassial growls, “the human is a blessing from the Fang Mother.”
&gt;”A blessing for the whole tribe!” one of the others cries
&gt;”He is MY prize, and the tribe’s lineage will pass on because of it!”	
&gt;”Then perhaps it’s time for a change in leadership!”
&gt;The women advance forward, but Nassial grabs a spear and repels them
&gt;”You would betray your ruler? You would kill her unborn cubs? You would waste YOUR lives just for the CHANCE to overthrow me?”
&gt;”THAT’S ENOUGH,” the sage roars
&gt;Her age and weathered look have not quelled her spirit
&gt;”I do believe the Fang Mother has given Anon as a gift for us all, but also as a test of our tribe’s unity. If you strike out against one another, the Fang Mother will curse you all.”
&gt;There is a hush over the whole village
&gt;The sage’s words are less of a warning and more of a guarantee
&gt;”Nassial...” the sage says, back to her soft-spoken nature,” I urge you to reconsider. Until we find more males out there we need Anon to ensure the safety of our tribe.”
&gt;The anger is gone from the other sabers, and the women just look to their leader plaintively.
&gt;Nassial sighs
&gt;She looks back to the sage hoping to see her support, but the elder saber is unyielding
&gt;”Fine, he will mate with the rest of the tribe for its survival.”
&gt;The tension dissipates
&gt;A few walk forward only to be stopped once more by Nassial’s spear
&gt;”But as your leader, I will control who mates with him. You will copulate with MY approval, and only as long as I deem necessary. At night, he will bed with ME and me alone.”
&gt;One step is all she needs to push the whole crowd back in fear
&gt;”Should I catch anyone attempting to usurp Anon or my authority, I shall break her legs and leave her for the raptors. AM I UNDERSTOOD?”
&gt;Silent nodding, even from the sage
&gt;Guess you’re not getting a say in this

&gt;The fate of being a breeding slave comes with being venerated as a savior of sorts
&gt;Both you and Nassial are catered to each day, especially as an attempt to win her favor
&gt;Nassial oversees all potential mates for you, going so far as to sometimes watch the deed being done
&gt;The women don’t have the same kind of performance anxiety it seems, likely unabashed in their raging lust
&gt;But Nassial actually considers your condition most times
&gt;Like if you are too raw or tired, she prohibits mating until you’re ready
&gt;Even then, she “urges” you to conserve some energy for her own lovemaking needs at night
&gt;Young, hopeful, and rejected sabers are sent out to hunt for greater quantities of food to feed the increasing appetite of those selected for reproduction
&gt;This in turn improves the overall strength and hunting skill of the tribe, as the warriors hope to someday become the coveted chosen ones
&gt;After months, you see your labor pay off
&gt;Over a third of the women around the village cradle their gravid bellies containing your progeny
&gt;They look to you with delight, stroking the gift you’ve given and reminding you of each night you were allowed to share with them
&gt;Most of the women continue to hunt until they become too large, then they help out with other chores
&gt;Even Nassial hangs her spear for the time being when her expansion proves too cumbersome
&gt;However, she hasn’t lost her warrior’s might as she prepares new homes for the tribe
&gt;Despite her warnings, some unapproved or heat-possessed women try to entice you while their leader is preoccupied
&gt;Not wanting to share in the wrath, you hold them off long enough for Nassial to catch the disobedience
&gt;At the same time, the leader’s threats are never truly carried out apart from verbal reprimands and a few swipes from her paws
&gt;It seems her maternal temperament is making her more forgiving
&gt;It also helps that the tribe becomes more self-governing, and any women who “cut in line” are punished by the others
&gt;Regardless, the approved mates still try to impress you and outshine each other
&gt;But something about Nassial, whether it’s her dominance or her confidence, makes her your only true queen

&gt;You’ve since accepted this as your new home
&gt;There’s little chance you’ll see your own world again, but this new one ensures you’ll be taken good care of
&gt;Nassial’s pregnancy turns her from an aggressive ruler to a motherly caretaker
&gt;At least to a certain extent
&gt;It helps that she feels honor (and a little smugness) for being your first, the farthest one along in her growth, and will very likely hold the record for being the biggest
&gt;Her hunger alone is a testament to this
&gt;A pile of fruit cores and discarded dino ribs are stacked up in the aftermath of her feasting
&gt;But no amount of girth keeps her from her commanding duties, or douses her heat and desire
&gt;It’s raining heavily one night when you’re in bed with her, after being thoroughly drained yet again 
&gt;Almost your whole body is curled around her enormous belly
&gt;She guides your hands as you feel for life within her
&gt;”Mine will be the strongest,” she reminds you.
&gt;You could have guessed that from the dozens of spears and knives she already has stockpiled for her cubs
&gt;”Our tribe will grow with unmatched warriors, but OUR kin will reign over these lands.”
&gt;Kissing proves to be a little awkward with her sword-like canines
&gt;She instead shows her affection by nuzzling your head and massaging you with her soft, leathery paw pads
&gt;Your hands are forced back by the roiling of life in her womb
&gt;”See? Strong already!”
&gt;The wind howls through the village, whistling as it passes by
&gt;Nassial pulls you closer for security, and even her cubs calm down
&gt;”And when they’re born, we will prepare for the next litter. With any luck, the Fang Mother will bless us with these rains again when the time comes.”</textarea>
