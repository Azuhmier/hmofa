unintelligibly while looking around as if trying to find an escape route</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but she finds no way out of this situation and hangs her head low and lets out the most pathetic whine you&#039;ve ever heard</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;sighing, you kneel down and lift up her chin and begin to scratch it</div></li><li class="li1"><div

class="de1">&gt;she seems to brighten up slightly at that but she doesn&#039;t ease up on protecting the cupboard</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;in that small moment of silence is when you hear it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you swear you hear whatevers in there crying for help</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;now you&#039;re really curious</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Coco, what&#039;s in there?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she suddenly turns around and grabs a hold of the handle on the door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Do you still want to see?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your about to tell her to just tell you but she immediately opens the door a crack and this is enough for whatever it is to escape</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;all you see is a brown blur across the kitchen floor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;both your pets have far quicker reaction times than you do</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;nearly running over each other both give chase to your &quot;present&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;it&#039;s a short chase though</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;bailey uses coco as a springboard to launch herself jaws first at the animal and catches it between them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;unfortunately she gives herself too much momentum as slams face first into the wall</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but she still holds onto her prize by the tail and you can finally get a good look at the poor creature</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;OUCH OUCH OUCH TEETH HURTING I&#039;M GOING TO DIE AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;in baileys jaws she holds what is very obviously a very panicked anthro rat girl</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she&#039;s surprising small for an anthro only between 2-3 feet tall and she doesn&#039;t really seem to be much different than how&#039;d you expect an anthro rodent to be</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but in her mad thrashing she&#039;s not doing much to protect her modesty</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she has pretty well proportioned breasts for her size and she&#039;s got 6 pairs of them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;if you had to give her a cup size you&#039;d say her top pair were the equivalent of a B cup for a normal sized women</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she also had a really puffy and prominent mound that would have been obvious even if she were trying to hide it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but her most striking feature was her disproportionally wide hips and thighs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;they seemed far too large to fit on such a tiny girl and you imagined she had an ass to match</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but there was no way you ever going to sexualize a wild mouse girl even if your dick disagreed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Coco where do you find her?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you struggled to imagine where she could of gotten it considering she wasn&#039;t allowed to go outside without your permission</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;The garage&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;ah yes if it was anywhere in the house it would be there</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the one place you never had any reason to go into considering you couldn&#039;t actually open the door to get your car in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;now the only thing left to do was to figure out what to do with her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you suppose the only right thing to do was to let her go considering you couldn&#039;t afford another pet</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you reach over to grab the poor girl by the scruff of her neck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her struggles don&#039;t cease but all she can really do is weakly slap at your fingers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Whoa now girl calm down, I&#039;m not going to hurt you like these 2 meanies did&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;your sweet words don&#039;t seem to calm her down but does put her into a more talkative mood</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;What are you going to do to me? Break all my bone? Gut me? Boil me alive? Bite my head off? Do whatever you like I won&#039;t give you the satisfaction of hearing me scream!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you were going to point out that you already heard her scream plenty but decided it wasn&#039;t a good idea</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;No i&#039;m really serious about not hurting you, look&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you brought her by the back door, opened it and put her down on her feet on the porch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Oh freedom! thanks mis-OOOF&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you still held onto her by the scruff of her neck tho</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Now listen here, I&#039;m the one who owns that garage you&#039;ve been squatting in&quot; </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the rat girl gives a nervous smile </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Oh is that right hahahahah&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;her nervous laughter goes on for way too long</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I want to make this clear, I don&#039;t ever want to see your face around here again, and if one of my girls catches you in my garage ever again, then what happens, happens, got it?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;the rat girl is really pulling on your hand in an attempt to escape</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yeah got it hahahaha message received hahahaha you can let go now hahahaha&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you do </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you didn&#039;t think such a tiny thing could move so fast</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;she jets off into the forest on the right side of your house</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;then comes back across your backyard and jumps into the brush on the left side of your house</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you shrug your shoulders and close the door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;turning around to face your pets you give them both a stern look</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;bailey has her tail curled around herself and coco has hers tucked between her legs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;you can&#039;t just let such a hectic morning go unpunished</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;but how exactly do you go about punishing pets?</div></li></ol>        </div>

&gt;it doesn&#039;t take much in the way of investigation to figure out who it belongs to
&quot;Down girl, down, I&#039;m awake&quot;
&gt;coco leans back to straddle your waist while panting and wagging her tail
&gt;kinda reminds you of that dream you just had
&quot;Morning master, now come on hurry up and get ready, you gotta come see your present&quot;
&gt;coco get off you heads to the doorway as sit there confused for a few seconds
&quot;Wait present? Whats the occasion?&quot;
&gt;coco stops in the doorway and looks back at you
&quot;Well I&#039;m not going to be outdone by a cat&quot;
&gt;with that she goes through the door
&gt;but her clarification only confuses you further
&gt;bailey got you a gift?
&gt;well you suppose she&#039;d give it to you when you got up as well
&gt;either way it&#039;s about time to get dressed
&gt;you go over to your dresser and pick out you clothes for the day
&gt;when you turn around to lay them on your bed you&#039;re horrified by what you see
&gt;on the pillow opposite of the side you slept on lays a mangled dead bird
&gt;you nearly retch at the sight and the knowledge that you slept right next to it for who knows how long
&gt;but before you feel the need to rush for the disinfectant another more horrible realization comes over you
&gt;if this is baileys present what could coco&#039;s present be?
&gt;now your in a rush to put on your clothes
&gt;you&#039;ll dispose of the carcass and clean your sheets later
&gt;you need to make sure coco&#039;s present doesn&#039;t do any permanent damage to anything
&gt;you nearly slip as you round the corner and shout
&quot;BAILEY! COCO!&quot;
&gt;which as it turns out was totally unnecessary cause they&#039;re right there in front of you

&quot;W-wait, but i-i...&quot;
&quot;No buts, I don&#039;t want to see any other dead animals here, I don&#039;t like&#039;em and I don&#039;t want&#039;em, got it?&quot;
&gt;bailey looks like she&#039;s going to say more but instead just nods her head and looks up at you with the saddest eyes she can muster
&gt;but right now you&#039;re not having any of it
&gt;you turn your attention to coco
&gt;she has begun to cover the cupboard door as if to protect whats inside from you
&gt;you give her a stern look before walking over and standing right in front of her
&quot;Coco, whats in the cupboard?&quot;
&gt;she stammers out unintelligibly while looking around as if trying to find an escape route
&gt;but she finds no way out of this situation and hangs her head low and lets out the most pathetic whine you&#039;ve ever heard
&gt;sighing, you kneel down and lift up her chin and begin to scratch it
&quot;Don&#039;t worry coco, I&#039;m not going to kick you out or anything, But you can&#039;t be bring living things into the house either&quot;
&gt;she seems to brighten up slightly at that but she doesn&#039;t ease up on protecting the cupboard
&gt;in that small moment of silence is when you hear it
&gt;you swear you hear whatevers in there crying for help
&gt;now you&#039;re really curious
&quot;Coco, what&#039;s in there?&quot;
&gt;she suddenly turns around and grabs a hold of the handle on the door
&quot;Do you still want to see?&quot;
&gt;your about to tell her to just tell you but she immediately opens the door a crack and this is enough for whatever it is to escape
&gt;all you see is a brown blur across the kitchen floor
&gt;both your pets have far quicker reaction times than you do
&gt;nearly running over each other both give chase to your &quot;present&quot;
&gt;it&#039;s a short chase though
&gt;bailey uses coco as a springboard to launch herself jaws first at the animal and catches it between them
&gt;unfortunately she gives herself too much momentum as slams face first into the wall
&gt;but she still holds onto her prize by the tail and you can finally get a good look at the poor creature
&quot;OUCH OUCH OUCH TEETH HURTING I&#039;M GOING TO DIE AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot;
&gt;in baileys jaws she holds what is very obviously a very panicked anthro rat girl
&gt;she&#039;s surprising small for an anthro only between 2-3 feet tall and she doesn&#039;t really seem to be much different than how&#039;d you expect an anthro rodent to be
&gt;but in her mad thrashing she&#039;s not doing much to protect her modesty
&gt;she has pretty well proportioned breasts for her size and she&#039;s got 6 pairs of them
&gt;if you had to give her a cup size you&#039;d say her top pair were the equivalent of a B cup for a normal sized women
&gt;she also had a really puffy and prominent mound that would have been obvious even if she were trying to hide it
&gt;but her most striking feature was her disproportionally wide hips and thighs
&gt;they seemed far too large to fit on such a tiny girl and you imagined she had an ass to match
&gt;but there was no way you ever going to sexualize a wild mouse girl even if your dick disagreed
&quot;Coco where do you find her?&quot;
&gt;you struggled to imagine where she could of gotten it considering she wasn&#039;t allowed to go outside without your permission
&quot;The garage&quot;
&gt;ah yes if it was anywhere in the house it would be there
&gt;the one place you never had any reason to go into considering you couldn&#039;t actually open the door to get your car in
&gt;now the only thing left to do was to figure out what to do with her
&gt;you suppose the only right thing to do was to let her go considering you couldn&#039;t afford another pet
&gt;you reach over to grab the poor girl by the scruff of her neck
&gt;her struggles don&#039;t cease but all she can really do is weakly slap at your fingers
&quot;Whoa now girl calm down, I&#039;m not going to hurt you like these 2 meanies did&quot; 
&gt;your sweet words don&#039;t seem to calm her down but does put her into a more talkative mood
&quot;What are you going to do to me? Break all my bone? Gut me? Boil me alive? Bite my head off? Do whatever you like I won&#039;t give you the satisfaction of hearing me scream!&quot;
&gt;you were going to point out that you already heard her scream plenty but decided it wasn&#039;t a good idea
&quot;No i&#039;m really serious about not hurting you, look&quot;
&gt;you brought her by the back door, opened it and put her down on her feet on the porch
&quot;Oh freedom! thanks mis-OOOF&quot;
&gt;you still held onto her by the scruff of her neck tho
&quot;Now listen here, I&#039;m the one who owns that garage you&#039;ve been squatting in&quot; 
&gt;the rat girl gives a nervous smile 
&quot;Oh is that right hahahahah&quot;
&gt;her nervous laughter goes on for way too long
&quot;I want to make this clear, I don&#039;t ever want to see your face around here again, and if one of my girls catches you in my garage ever again, then what happens, happens, got it?&quot;
&gt;the rat girl is really pulling on your hand in an attempt to escape
&quot;Yeah got it hahahaha message received hahahaha you can let go now hahahaha&quot;
&gt;you do 
&gt;you didn&#039;t think such a tiny thing could move so fast
&gt;she jets off into the forest on the right side of your house
&gt;then comes back across your backyard and jumps into the brush on the left side of your house
&gt;you shrug your shoulders and close the door
&gt;turning around to face your pets you give them both a stern look
&gt;bailey has her tail curled around herself and coco has hers tucked between her legs
&gt;you can&#039;t just let such a hectic morning go unpunished
&gt;but how exactly do you go about punishing pets?</textarea>
