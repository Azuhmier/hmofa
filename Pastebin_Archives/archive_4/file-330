Meanwhile, a cyborg/android/anthroid gets sent through after being captured and disposed of in a garbage portal. Fun ensues.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;re Anon, a scientist</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ve made many great strides in science since you began working in the facility</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Exo-skeletons, teleportation, dimensional travel, and even finding new worlds</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You&#039;ve even found a way to reverse aging in certain individuals, which you have used yourself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It&#039;s extremely specific to a genome, making it almost pointless</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;However, you were over 100 years old and looked not a day over 25</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The year is 2030 and you were going about your business as usual</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;No, no, no, no, NO!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shouted at an empty ring with multiple chevrons around it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It almost looked like something out of Stargate</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were trying to isolate a signal you had found while on a random sweep for new dimensions</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your scanner had picked up a blip in the dimensional rift, which was completely new to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nobody else in the universe that you knew of had this capability and it certainly wasn&#039;t from yours anyways</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not even the Anthropomorphs, or Anthros for short, had the capability</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And they were on par with humanity in almost every regard</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This blip had come from another dimension</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The message was simple and to the point</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It read</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;העלא</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was yiddish and you thought it was a joke</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But it wasn&#039;t all</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;איז ווער עס יז דאָרט</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;מיר ווינטשן צו קאָנטאַקט איר</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were immediately awoken and told to find the source but all you found was empty space</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had been at it for 16 hours and it was 10 at night</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were about to call in for the night</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Until the ring began moving on it&#039;s own</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were Ayn</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Resident princess, deity of lust and fertility or some shit, and a Jackal</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And you were bored</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The eggheads had been tinkering with a new ring and staff that would allow people to travel to the &#039;beyond&#039;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whatever</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then it got you thinking</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;What if you went and saw what was going on?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That could be interesting</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So you leaped from your bed and jogged to the science building</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After a 2 hour jog, you entered the building to much praise and bowing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You walked past and entered the room</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was filled with many complex machines, none of which you knew anything about</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In the center, a stone ring with chevrons stood</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;2 scientists were pushing buttons on a circular table and cursing at it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You leaned against the wall and watched them struggle until they finally left</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They left the key by the ring and turned the lights off, allowing you to poke around</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You went to the circular table and found numbers and letters on it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You started pressing buttons and a satisfying click came every time you pressed them</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pressed the buttons randomly, enjoying the sound they made</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A big red button in the middle got your attention and you pressed it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The ring started to move</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The sound of scraping rocks filled the room as the inner ring began turning</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It stopped on a letter and a chevron clicked into position</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It did this 10 more times until a liquid came from the edge of the ring</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It spread in a circular pattern until it finally converged, sending a blast of the liquid forwards before sucking it back in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The stone key began pulsing and you took it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Studying the key, it was apparently a beacon of some sort</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You took it and stepped up the stone ramp</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stuck your hand through and it felt like a gel almost</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You took it out and your hand was completely dry</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Here goes nothing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You step through and your ears are filled with screeching</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The gateway closed and you pass out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The ring belched out some liquid before sucking it back in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You saw a hand come through the gate and wiggle it&#039;s fingers before pulling back through</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You ran up to the gate to see what was happening and the gate flashed brightly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Something was coming through!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A creature with red hair and a dog like snout came through the gate and passed out immediately</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grabbed the creature and realized it had barely any clothes on</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This is very embarrassing</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You look more closely at it and see it&#039;s a she</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;This makes you even more uncomfortable</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You see she&#039;s a jackal anthro and that she&#039;s wearing a tiara of some sort</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The light above you flashes as the gate is about to close</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh fuck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull her and her staff the rest of the way through and bridal carry her down the metal ramp</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The gate closes and a blast of blue liquid shoots out before it collapses the liquid inside</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stand there, with an unconscious jackal anthro girl in your arms</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, looks like you have company</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You knew these anthros spoke yiddish, so you had a yiddish translator piece put in her ear to translate your words and hers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was beautiful and you had to make yourself not stare</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You had laid her on a cot in a concrete room so she could sleep peacefully until she woke</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The covers stirred and you looked up from your magazine</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The jackal turned over to face you and her eyes fluttered open</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She smiled at first, but when she opened her eyes the whole way, they widened in surprise</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You both screamed in surprise as she kicked the covers off her and began to panic</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She continued to scream as she scrambled to get away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;In doing so, she kicked you down and your head hit the floor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your vision faded to black as the screaming died down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You woke and saw a strange face looking up from some sort of paper</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You smiled, assuming it was one of the blue guard, but as your eyes adjusted you saw something much worse</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was a pale, almost completely hairless ape with a stubby nose and glasses</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were frightened</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You both screamed as you frantically looked around for an escape route</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You eventually kicked the thing onto the floor and it stopped screaming</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You calmed down and eventually saw that your stone key was laid right by you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You looked back at the thing and saw blood coming from it&#039;s head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh shit did you kill it?!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You looked over and saw a large doorway with a metal door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Open!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The door didn&#039;t open</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tried pulling it open but the door wouldn&#039;t budge</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It must be locked by voice command</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You go to check on the thing you just kicked on the ground</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was a male, by the look of it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You checked and it had a pulse</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It wasn&#039;t dead</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your ear itched for some reason</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You itched it and the feeling went away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The thing began to stir and you jumped slightly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Fuuuuuuck my head.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It spoke?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Who are you!?

How old did you say you were again?!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;m 140 years old approximately.

I can barely deal with the stress of being a general and I&#039;m 22 years old!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;ve tried several times. The US government has &#039;killed&#039; me 3 times to cover my story up. I was never able to make friends because I knew they would die before I would, or they would notice I never aged. I have climbed the ranks to general 2 times in my life. Not because I was a tactical genius, but because of how long I served. I stopped fighting because I had become a monster. I was too good at what I did and it scared me.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You grab a photo from your file</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;This, is one of the many children I&#039;ve had to kill.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They all looked up at you in shock as you put kill and children in the same sentence</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;He had a bright future ahead of him, but those god damned no good goat fuckers took him in to their ranks.

He reminded me of that child. A lost soul drafted into the wrong side of a meaningless war.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You put the picture back in your file and go over to your trunk</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You retrieve various uniforms from different time periods</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They were all in immaculate condition</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull out multiple boxes and open them up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Various medals lined the tops and bottoms of the boxes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;What are these?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Awards for gallantry service. I have 17 purple hearts, 4 silver stars, and 2 medals of honor. The silver star is the second highest commendation you can receive only second to the medal of honor. These are the only things that remind me that I&#039;m not a complete monster. The fact that other people saw my acts in any way gallantry tells me that I did something right.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Vikna speaks next</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Why do you salute me every time I&#039;m in uniform if you&#039;re technically a higher rank?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Respect and honor. Something in short supply here. The fight I had with Loki, I barely won.

We grew potatoes and were very religious.

freshly mopped area</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She lost her balance and fell on the floor with a thud</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Owww.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh shit she actually hurt herself</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You drop the mop and rush over towards her side</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;At least, that&#039;s what you tried to do</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You slipped on the wet floor yourself and slammed onto it hard</div></li><li

there</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But you still slept with your girls when they asked</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ara, however, didn&#039;t sleep</div></li><li

Now answer my first question, where did you find it?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel your blood run cold and a chill goes down your spin</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I-I found it on your thigh.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her ears go flat and her mouth hangs open</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You&#039;re joking right?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You show her the pins that were inside her, still blue with fluid</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She slumps down on the bed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You realize that jolt she did could&#039;ve killed her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You can use it as an EMP device, or a grenade if you overload it. I&#039;d keep it if I were you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You put it back in your pocket and close the flap</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Okay, next question should be a little less terrifying. Do you know what Al Hashab is?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nods her head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;An anti Kaltag and android terrorist group. Why?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;We have their main base&#039;s location and can warp there any time. You want to go?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her eyes light up brighter</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Seeing as how this would lessen resistance against us and Kaltag, I think we should!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You nod your head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll tell the crew to prepare. In the mean time, I kind of want to do a space walk.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She cocks her head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Why? Floating around in space isn&#039;t all that special.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well, it&#039;s just that I&#039;ve never actually been in space before I came here.

It&#039;s fine out here!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take a step back and leap out of the airlock</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You felt the artificial gravity of the ship leave you as you passed the airlock door</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pressed another button and a joystick came from the EVA pack</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ara smiles at you before frowning again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I just forgot.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;What did you forget?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I forgot to tether myself!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oops</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You use your thrusters to equalize your speed with hers and grab on to her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Good thing I&#039;m here, right?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You were the one who wanted to go on a space walk!&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Good point</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You thrusted back to the ship and let Ara grab a tether line before she jumped back out</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take a look around, letting the vastness of space sink in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were in open space orbiting a star with no planets or name</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It was beautiful</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You felt like nothing more than a speck of dust in an ocean of darkness</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You might as well be</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ara interrupts your self reflection</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Anon, why are you so nice to us?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You chuckle a bit at this</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Before, or after you said you loved me?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Before.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Well, I was just glad to have some company. Ayn came through and I thought she was scared. So I made her something to eat. I didn&#039;t want the only person in years outside of the military to hate my guts. I guess I just wanted a friend. Then you came through and thought I was a cop. I understood you didn&#039;t want to go back to where you came from, which is why I didn&#039;t care when you tried to choke me.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks away, embarrassed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Hey, it&#039;s fine, really! I knew you were scared and were just doing what you thought was right. When Vikna came through, I didn&#039;t want her to get vaporized by the portal fluid. Didn&#039;t have time to warn her, so I just acted. I took the brunt of the fall too, so she wouldn&#039;t get hurt, and even let her go when she asked. But she kept asking me to drop my weapon. It was getting late and I was getting frustrated, so I took away her gun and offered her my bed and some food. It wasn&#039;t anything to do with wanting to have sexual relations, I just wanted some friends.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ara nodded and you continued</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;When Nytro tried to stab me, I tried to be gentle when pushing him down. I understood that he thought I was hurting you, so I let him do his thing until it threatened my life. I acted as gently as I could and made sure he was okay. He actually told me to stay away from you because he liked you, but he ended up going after Warning instead.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ara giggles at that</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Warning was another android, specifically made to enforce codes and warn authorities when they aren&#039;t being adhered to</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She was also about 4 feet tall and very cute</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So that, Ara, is why I was so nice. I just wanted friends and people to talk to. I ended up getting more than that, and I&#039;m very grateful for it. Thank you.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull her into a hug and she returns it</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;What about us? Who do you like the most?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Oh fuck not this again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were torn between Vikna and Ara</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ayn was kind of a huge fucking slut and you wouldn&#039;t ever get into a relationship with her, but Ara and Vikna were both equally lovable</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You spent much more time with Ara, but Vikna was much more relatable</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You couldn&#039;t decide</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ara, that&#039;s a very tough question that I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be able to answer. At least, not for a while. Why do you want to know?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Well, isn&#039;t it normal for humans to only have one partner until either dies? I just wanted to know who you would pick if that was the case here.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Ara, if that were the case, I would probably pick you. I&#039;m pretty much immortal if I keep taking the age reduction serums, and I want someone who I can spend that time with. I don&#039;t want my heart broken when Vikna dies, but that doesn&#039;t mean I love you more than her.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Smiles and plants a kiss on your visor</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Thank you Anon.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You&#039;re welcome Ara.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You decide that this space walk has gone on long enough, and use your thrusters to maneuver back to the ship&#039;s airlock</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get inside and the weight of gravity pulls you down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Ara gets inside as well and locks her arm with yours</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You walk with her back to the bridge, arms linked and holding hands</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A day later</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You were sitting at the range with Nytro</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;His shooting technique is horrible, shooting either one handed with the grip off center, or two handed like a teacup</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get up to the booth next to him and pull the separator down</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You show him how you&#039;re supposed to shoot a revolver, with your left thumb over the right, behind the hammer</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You take aim at the target and fire</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The blast of your 44 magnum spooks him a bit, but he continues to watch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You let the revolver roll up, absorbing the recoil of the massive round</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When it settles back down, you fire again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You repeat this until the cylinder is empty</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;So, you need to keep your left thumb above your right and let the revolver roll back. Now you try.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He grabs the smaller revolver off the table, a model 15 in .38 special</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Just so he could get started with actual firearms</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You put his left thumb over his right and took aim</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He squeezed the trigger and fired a round</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He let the revolver roll back as he centered it back on target</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He fired more until the cylinder was empty</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You patted him on the back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Good, now you can shoot revolvers. But what you really need to know, is how to shoot semi autos.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You picked up a pistol you had tucked away in your trunk</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your old 1911A1</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You gave Nytro a browning hi-power to start off with, .45 was a little harder to control than 9mm</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You put your left thumb under your right and took aim at the target</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;In a semi-automatic pistol like this, you need to keep your wrists taught. The recoil is used to cycle the gun, so it needs as much of that recoil as you can give it.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He nods and you fire a few rounds at the target</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;They all line up in a neat little group, although it could use a little practice</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Make sure you keep your left thumb UNDER your right thumb.

It&#039;s the absolute worst feeling in the world when you have to write a family saying their son died for his country, when all he did was die for some fucknut behind a desk in washington. I know it&#039;s hard, but talking about it helps a lot.

Why are you still on my ship?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks surprised and a bit annoyed by you remembering the question</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;I&#039;m here to monitor this ARA unit&#039;s efficiency and progress in ship management and communications. Is that a problem?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You glare at her and respond</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Yes, there is. Because I highly doubt this is the reason why you&#039;re actually still here. The fact that Ara hasn&#039;t even said hello was the biggest indicator of this. I can deduce that you&#039;ve told her, or ordered her to stay quiet while you talk. This means that you were talking about something that Ara and I disagree with you on and Ara would sway me to her side. I highly advise against trying to lie or manipulate me ma&#039;am. There will be severe consequences if you fail to comply.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Are you threatening me Colonel?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You shake your head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;No ma&#039;am.

You heard what happened next.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She nodded, giggling</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;You just gotta know when to tell them to fuck off and when to really fuck off.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Vikna comes to the bridge in a huff</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Anon!

Something I never had as a kid. They came here because I had &#039;tampered&#039; with Ara&#039;s blocks, so she wouldn&#039;t be stuck to a chair while I was under attack by a rogue element. I told them that I didn&#039;t even consider removing blocks to sensitive information and I&#039;m telling you the same thing. They decided to come back and try to take Ara from me, twice. I was as polite as I possibly could be the first time, but apparently that&#039;s a sign of weakness here. So I told them the next time they come and try again, I will come down on them so hard and fast they won&#039;t know what hit them. That wasn&#039;t a threat. It was a promise. Sir.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He stands with his mouth agape, stunned by your directness</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He composes himself and speaks again</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;You do know we align ourselves heavily with Kaltag, don&#039;t you Colonel Anon?&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;&quot;Sir, from what I understand, so does the enemy.&quot;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;He flashes a glare at you and speaks</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&quot;Yes, but that&#039;s not the point.

Otherwise it shuts down your liver and kidneys, and later your heart. It doesn&#039;t hurt at all, you just sort of die.

A Jackal from an ancient egyptian-like civilization finds a new dimensional gate and goes through it. Meanwhile, a cyborg/android/anthroid gets sent through after being captured and disposed of in a garbage portal. Fun ensues.

&gt;You&#039;re Anon, a scientist
&gt;You&#039;ve made many great strides in science since you began working in the facility
&gt;Exo-skeletons, teleportation, dimensional travel, and even finding new worlds
&gt;You&#039;ve even found a way to reverse aging in certain individuals, which you have used yourself
&gt;It&#039;s extremely specific to a genome, making it almost pointless
&gt;However, you were over 100 years old and looked not a day over 25
&gt;The year is 2030 and you were going about your business as usual

&gt;&quot;No, no, no, no, NO!&quot;
&gt;You shouted at an empty ring with multiple chevrons around it
&gt;It almost looked like something out of Stargate
&gt;You were trying to isolate a signal you had found while on a random sweep for new dimensions
&gt;Your scanner had picked up a blip in the dimensional rift, which was completely new to you
&gt;Nobody else in the universe that you knew of had this capability and it certainly wasn&#039;t from yours anyways
&gt;Not even the Anthropomorphs, or Anthros for short, had the capability
&gt;And they were on par with humanity in almost every regard
&gt;This blip had come from another dimension
&gt;The message was simple and to the point
&gt;It read
&gt;העלא
&gt;It was yiddish and you thought it was a joke
&gt;But it wasn&#039;t all
&gt;איז ווער עס יז דאָרט
&gt;מיר ווינטשן צו קאָנטאַקט איר
&gt;You were immediately awoken and told to find the source but all you found was empty space
&gt;You had been at it for 16 hours and it was 10 at night
&gt;You were about to call in for the night
&gt;Until the ring began moving on it&#039;s own

&gt;You were Ayn
&gt;Resident princess, deity of lust and fertility or some shit, and a Jackal
&gt;And you were bored
&gt;Again
&gt;The eggheads had been tinkering with a new ring and staff that would allow people to travel to the &#039;beyond&#039;
&gt;Whatever
&gt;Then it got you thinking
&gt;What if you went and saw what was going on?
&gt;That could be interesting
&gt;So you leaped from your bed and jogged to the science building

&gt;After a 2 hour jog, you entered the building to much praise and bowing
&gt;You walked past and entered the room
&gt;It was filled with many complex machines, none of which you knew anything about
&gt;In the center, a stone ring with chevrons stood
&gt;2 scientists were pushing buttons on a circular table and cursing at it
&gt;You leaned against the wall and watched them struggle until they finally left
&gt;They left the key by the ring and turned the lights off, allowing you to poke around
&gt;You went to the circular table and found numbers and letters on it
&gt;You started pressing buttons and a satisfying click came every time you pressed them
&gt;You pressed the buttons randomly, enjoying the sound they made
&gt;A big red button in the middle got your attention and you pressed it
&gt;The ring started to move
&gt;The sound of scraping rocks filled the room as the inner ring began turning
&gt;It stopped on a letter and a chevron clicked into position
&gt;It did this 10 more times until a liquid came from the edge of the ring
&gt;It spread in a circular pattern until it finally converged, sending a blast of the liquid forwards before sucking it back in
&gt;The stone key began pulsing and you took it
&gt;Studying the key, it was apparently a beacon of some sort
&gt;You took it and stepped up the stone ramp
&gt;You stuck your hand through and it felt like a gel almost
&gt;You took it out and your hand was completely dry
&gt;Here goes nothing
&gt;You step through and your ears are filled with screeching
&gt;The gateway closed and you pass out

&gt;The ring belched out some liquid before sucking it back in
&gt;You saw a hand come through the gate and wiggle it&#039;s fingers before pulling back through
&gt;You ran up to the gate to see what was happening and the gate flashed brightly
&gt;Something was coming through!
&gt;A creature with red hair and a dog like snout came through the gate and passed out immediately
&gt;You grabbed the creature and realized it had barely any clothes on
&gt;This is very embarrassing
&gt;You look more closely at it and see it&#039;s a she
&gt;This makes you even more uncomfortable
&gt;You see she&#039;s a jackal anthro and that she&#039;s wearing a tiara of some sort
&gt;The light above you flashes as the gate is about to close
&gt;Oh fuck
&gt;You pull her and her staff the rest of the way through and bridal carry her down the metal ramp
&gt;The gate closes and a blast of blue liquid shoots out before it collapses the liquid inside
&gt;You stand there, with an unconscious jackal anthro girl in your arms
&gt;Well, looks like you have company

&gt;You knew these anthros spoke yiddish, so you had a yiddish translator piece put in her ear to translate your words and hers
&gt;She was beautiful and you had to make yourself not stare
&gt;You had laid her on a cot in a concrete room so she could sleep peacefully until she woke
&gt;The covers stirred and you looked up from your magazine
&gt;The jackal turned over to face you and her eyes fluttered open
&gt;She smiled at first, but when she opened her eyes the whole way, they widened in surprise
&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!&quot;
&gt;&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!&quot;
&gt;You both screamed in surprise as she kicked the covers off her and began to panic
&gt;She continued to scream as she scrambled to get away
&gt;In doing so, she kicked you down and your head hit the floor
&gt;Your vision faded to black as the screaming died down

&gt;You woke and saw a strange face looking up from some sort of paper
&gt;You smiled, assuming it was one of the blue guard, but as your eyes adjusted you saw something much worse
&gt;It was a pale, almost completely hairless ape with a stubby nose and glasses
&gt;You were frightened
&gt;&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!&quot;
&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!&quot;
&gt;You both screamed as you frantically looked around for an escape route
&gt;You eventually kicked the thing onto the floor and it stopped screaming
&gt;You calmed down and eventually saw that your stone key was laid right by you
&gt;You looked back at the thing and saw blood coming from it&#039;s head
&gt;Oh shit did you kill it?!
&gt;You looked over and saw a large doorway with a metal door
&gt;&quot;Open!&quot;
&gt;The door didn&#039;t open
&gt;You tried pulling it open but the door wouldn&#039;t budge
&gt;It must be locked by voice command
&gt;You go to check on the thing you just kicked on the ground
&gt;It was a male, by the look of it
&gt;You checked and it had a pulse
&gt;It wasn&#039;t dead
&gt;Your ear itched for some reason
&gt;You itched it and the feeling went away
&gt;The thing began to stir and you jumped slightly
&quot;Fuuuuuuck my head.&quot;
&gt;It spoke?
&gt;&quot;Who are you!? Where am I? Why am I locked in a room?&quot;

&quot;Who are you!? Where am I? Why am I locked in a room?&quot;
&gt;You feel like you got hit in the head by a truck
&gt;You respond by holding your hand up
&gt;&quot;Give me a second, my head is killing me.&quot;
&quot;TELL ME NOW BEAST!&quot;
&gt;Whoa that&#039;s racist lady
&gt;Even though you weren&#039;t an anthro
&gt;&quot;Okay, okay! I&#039;m Anon, a scientist here, You&#039;re on planet earth, and the door isn&#039;t locked.&quot;
&quot;Nonsense! I tried pulling it and pushing it, but it won&#039;t open!&quot;
&gt;You realized that this lady might not know how door handles work
&gt;You get up off the floor and feel warm liquid flow down your neck
&gt;Fuck you&#039;re bleeding
&gt;You walk past the bitchy jackal and reach for the door
&gt;You look at her, expression smug and sure you would fail
&gt;You pushed the door handle down and pushed the door open
&gt;Her expression turned from smug to dumbfounded, then embarrassed in the span of a second
&gt;You chuckle a bit and she stamps her foot
&quot;That&#039;s NOT funny beast!&quot;
&gt;&quot;It kind of is.&quot;
&gt;You hold the heavy steel door open for her
&gt;&quot;Ladies first!&quot;
&gt;She softens her expression
&quot;At least you have some decency.&quot;
&gt;You watched her walk to the door and bolt down the hallway
&gt;Fuck
&gt;She tried the door and it was locked
&gt;Thank god
&gt;&quot;Where are you going?!&quot;
&quot;What is this trickery?! Why won&#039;t this door open?&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s locked.&quot;
&gt;Her ears go flat and she looks to the ground
&gt;Then she looks to you with puppy dog eyes
&quot;Please mister, can I leave this place?&quot;
&gt;&quot;No.&quot;
&gt;Her expression sours immediately
&quot;Why not!?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Because you need to answer a few simple questions first. And where would you even go?&quot;
&gt;She is about to respond when she realizes she doesn&#039;t know
&quot;I- uh, good point.&quot;
&gt;&quot;So please, take a seat while I bandage my head up.&quot;
&gt;She walks back to the room with her tail between her legs and her ears flat
&gt;You walk to the bathroom and open the medical kit, wrapping the gauze around your head before cutting it with cloth sheers
&gt;You enter the bunk room again before closing the door and producing a notepad
&gt;&quot;Okay, first question. What is your name miss?&quot;
&quot;My name is Ayn, princess of the jackal empire and the deity of lust and fertility apparently.&quot;
&gt;This made you blush slightly and you clear your throat
&gt;&quot;Ahem, yes. Well, were did you come from?&quot;
&quot;I came from Siana.&quot;
&gt;Siana? Sounds familiar
&gt;&quot;Last question. Does your world have any intent to harm ours. Such as, invading, conquering, eradicating, that sort of stuff.&quot;
&quot;Nah, not that I know of anyways.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Alright then! That is all for- well actually, one more question.&quot;
&gt;She cocks her head
&quot;Yes?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Did I do something to you when you woke up? As in, did I disrespect or offend you?&quot;
&gt;She smiles and speaks
&quot;No, you just scared me, that&#039;s all.&quot;
&gt;Thank god, the last thing you need is to fuck up relations with another civilization
&gt;You extended your hand
&gt;&quot;Well, it&#039;s a pleasure to meet you miss Ayn. I hope you see everything to your liking.&quot;
&gt;She shakes your hand and gets up
&gt;&quot;Before you go, is there anything I can get for you? We have all kinds of food and drinks here.&quot;
&gt;She pauses mid stride and ponders for a moment
&quot;Any alcohol. If not, juice will do. I also would like some food, I&#039;ll eat anything you bring me.&quot;
&gt;No booze here, but you did have soda
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll go to the kitchen and make something to eat. You can join me if you would like.&quot;
&gt;She waits for you by the door and you walk towards the kitchen

&gt;This man, he just offered you something to eat after you had kicked him onto the floor!
&gt;These people here are either very naive or very kind
&gt;Maybe both
&gt;The man, who calls himself Anon, was making some sort of meaty steak when he opened a smaller metal door behind him
&gt;He produced 2 bottles of something with script on the side that you couldn&#039;t make out
&gt;They were both orange and looked like they were made of clear plasteel
&gt;He made himself a sandwich as he put some sort of plant on the steak, which you assumed was a spice
&gt;He grabbed the plates and bottles before walking back to the table you were sitting at
&gt;The tables were odd too, feeling very bendy like wet wood, but not quite the same
&gt;He saw you bending the table before staring at you for a bit
&quot;Remind me not to piss you off.&quot;
&gt;You smile at his little remark
&gt;You were very strong and could probably snap him in half
&gt;But he was too nice to succumb to such a fate
&gt;He handed you the steak and picked up the sandwich before eating

&gt;You watched Ayn as she attempted to pull open the bottle of Sunkist you gave her
&quot;Why won&#039;t this open?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Try twisting it to the left.&quot;
&gt;She did so and the cap came right off
&quot;Oh.&quot;
&gt;You chuckled and the drink opened the whole way
&gt;The hiss it gave off frightened her and she looked at it again
&gt;She took a sip and her eyes lit up
&quot;It burns like alcohol, but tastes like oranges and sugar. What is this?&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s soda.&quot;
&gt;She picks the steak up after cutting a piece with her knife and eats it
&quot;This is very good! You could be a cook for a restaurant with food like this!&quot;
&gt;You feel embarrassed by this compliment
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s not that good, really.&quot;
&gt;She looks you dead in the eyes
&quot;Yes it is! It&#039;s very good and the spice is just amazing!&quot;
&gt;You weren&#039;t a chef by any means, but you knew how to cook
&gt;You needed to know, seeing as how you never married
&gt;You finish your sandwich before drinking the last of your soda
&gt;You yawn and stretch your arms out
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m going to sleep, you can sleep in any of the bunks or beds in the bunker. I&#039;ll take you up top tomorrow if you want to go. Unless you want to try and go back through the portal.&quot;
&gt;She sat and thought for a moment before looking at you again
&quot;Nah, I&#039;ll stay with you.&quot;
&gt;It&#039;s amazing
&gt;She went from regal to relaxed in the span of a minute
&gt;You get up and go over to your room before laying in bed for a while
&gt;After about 10 minutes you begin to doze off when something slides into your bed
&gt;It was very subtle, but enough to wake you
&gt;A furry arm wrapped around you and you smiled, falling asleep shortly after

&gt;A warning siren woke you as you bolted from your bed
&gt;You accidentally knocked ayn on the ground doing so
&quot;Owww. Why?&quot;
&gt;She heard the siren and ran out of the room to grab her staff thing
&gt;You undid your locker lock and opened it, revealing your personal exo
&gt;It enhanced your strength by ten fold and speed by a factor of 2, but it required much care to not break your bones as well as bone augmentations, which you also developed
&gt;You put your helmet on and closed the exo up before grabbing your grand dads cavalry saber from the back of it
&gt;You sheathed the sword before running out, meeting Ayn who was hiding by the door frame
&gt;She put her hands up to her lips and peeked the corner before slamming herself against the door frame
&quot;Oh shit it&#039;s Loki!&quot;
&gt;Loki?
&gt;The nordic god?
&gt;You tried to walk past but she caught you, telling you to stay put
&gt;The sound of the portal closing and men screaming signaled for her to take another look
&gt;She bolted across the door frame and told you to look
&gt;You looked and saw 5 anthro lions wearing ceremonial looking armor
&quot;Loki went back through the portal, try not to get spot-&quot;
&gt;You were already walking down the metal stairs to greet the newcomers
&gt;&quot;Welcome to earth, my name is-&quot;
&gt;A burst from their weapon stops you mid sentence, forcing you to dive behind a pillar
&gt;Your exo had scorch marks on the plating, but was otherwise functional
&gt;Just as you drew your cavalry saber, a war cry came from above you
&gt;A brown blur shot past you and the staff buried itself into one of the goon&#039;s faces
&gt;You took the chance to charge with your saber and delivered a lethal stab to the unlucky lion
&gt;One of them fired a shot into your helmet, scrambling the HUD for a bit before it stabilized
&gt;Fuck you&#039;re gonna have to buff that one out
&gt;You turn to him and see his gut get smacked by a large foot
&gt;Ayn is dancing on the pole while using it to balance herself against multiple kicks
&gt;She looked like she was having fun brutally murdering the fuck out of people
&gt;She slammed the staff into his head before running off to the goons by your console
&gt;Holy fuck that&#039;s brutal
&gt;You feel something slam into your back, pinning you to the ground
&gt;Or attempting to at least
&gt;You grab the culprit off your back and see it&#039;s one of the lions, who was now waving at you and smiling innocently
&gt;You threw him into the wall, causing him to embed into the concrete
&gt;The other 2 are trying to type something into the console, but you throw your saber into one&#039;s back
&gt;The other gets their spine broken by the staff and falls limp on the floor
&gt;&quot;Well, shit. Remind me to never make you mad for real.&quot;
&gt;She laughs at this, picking her staff up
&gt;&quot;What is that thing anyways?&quot;
&gt;The staff had a rope attached to it and looked like it would fit a massive lock
&quot;It&#039;s a stone key, I stole it from the temple I was in.&quot;
&gt;Before you could respond the portal opened again and a red, black, and white feline came tumbling out
&gt;The portal closed before she could go back through
&gt;Another one?
&quot;FUCK! I KNEW YOU ASSHOLES WERE GOING TO THROW ME IN THE GARBAGE PORTAL! Now where am-&quot;
&gt;She stares at your white helmet with a scorch mark on the side
&quot;Who are y-&quot;
&gt;She looks to Ayn and smiles
&quot;PRINCESS AYN!&quot;
&gt;She runs up to the jackal and gives her a hug
&quot;Ara! You made it out of the prison!&quot;
&gt;You saw her ears pulse with blue light as well as her paws
&gt;You run to the console and push the yellow and black button, closing the iris off
&gt;Nano titanium tungsten and carbon composite
&gt;Not even a nuclear blast is getting through those
&gt;You look back and push a button to undo your helmet
&gt;&quot;Wait, wait, wait. You two KNOW each other?&quot;
&gt;The one called Ara looks over at you and stares daggers into you
&quot;Male bipedal, age ERROR, threat level high, combat skills high, powered assault ar-&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes I know, I&#039;m an old man in an exo-suit, what do you want?&quot;
&gt;She snaps out of whatever trance she was put into
&quot;Of course! We&#039;re friends!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well shit, now I&#039;m going to have to make 2 reports.&quot;
&gt;You put your helmet back on before locking it in place
&gt;Once the HUD turns on, you are looking down at the angry cat lady
&quot;Report on WHAT?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I have to make a report on the 2 ALIENS that came through the portal!&quot;
&gt;She attempts to choke you as she yells
&quot;YOU&#039;RE NOT SENDING ME BACK TO PRISON YOU DIRTY PIG!&quot;
&gt;You calmly grab her arms and pull them off your neck as she struggles
&gt;Her eyes were glowing blue and she was letting out a mechanical hiss
&gt;&quot;Ayn, is your friend here some sort of cyborg?&quot;
&quot;Yes.&quot;
&gt;She puts her hand over her eyes and pulls Ara off you
&quot;NO LET ME AT HIM!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not the police, calm down.&quot;
&gt;Her expression goes from anger to embarrassment in less than a second
&quot;O-oh, s-sorry.&quot;
&gt;She grabs her hair and tries to hide behind it
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s ok, my name&#039;s anon.&quot;
&gt;She snaps out of her shyness for a bit and speaks
&quot;I&#039;m the Artificial Relay Administrator, but you can call me Ara. Sorry about trying to murder you.&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s not every day that you get to be choked out by a cute cyborg cat lady.&quot;
&gt;She blushes sky blue and backs away
&quot;I-I&#039;m not cute! You&#039;re cute! I MEAN!&quot;
&gt;You laugh at her awkwardness
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s all good. I have some beds you can sleep in if you&#039;re tired. It&#039;s about 3 AM right now so I&#039;m going to sleep.&quot;
&quot;A-alright.&quot;
&gt;You went into your room and fell asleep almost instantly

&gt;Next morning, the bunker was alive with activity
&gt;Scientists and soldiers alike came from off base to study the new anthros that came
&gt;One of them even tried to grope them which ended with an exploded testicle and a trip to the infirmary
&gt;This happened the rest of the day as you tried to find the coordinates for Ayn&#039;s homeworld
&gt;You were so close before being interrupted by a man in a navy blue uniform wearing a cap with 3 stars on it
&gt;General Larkinson
&gt;You give him a crisp salute which he returned
&gt;&quot;Sir, I&#039;m trying to find the coordinates to the Jackal&#039;s homew-&quot;
&quot;Enough of that Anon! We have a bigger problem in the lab.&quot;
&gt;You followed the general into the lab where the two anthros were surrounded by scientists
&gt;All facing down and groaning
&quot;These anthros won&#039;t let our scientists do-&quot;
&gt;&quot;What did they do to you two?&quot;
&quot;They tried to touch us! Tell them to stop Anon.&quot;
&gt;You look over at the general who was now looking at the ground
&gt;&quot;Why were they trying to touch them?&quot;
&quot;They wanted to see if they were mammals or not, so they were trying to, erm, examine them.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Did they try to touch anywhere private?&quot;
&quot;Yes.&quot;
&gt;You just rub the bridge of your nose
&gt;&quot;They are mammals you idiots. Touching their tits is not the only way to tell if they&#039;re really mammals. They have fur for god&#039;s sake!&quot;
&gt;The medics rushed in, carrying the men off to the infirmary
&gt;Ayn and Ara sat back on the medical bed as the general snuck out with his figurative tail between his legs
&gt;You walk up to the beds and take a seat on the table between them
&gt;&quot;Now, I&#039;m not going to get mad because they tried to touch you, but did you really have to kick them all in the balls?&quot;
&quot;But anon they-&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m proud of you two.&quot;
&gt;They looked to each other and to you
&quot;What? We thought you&#039;d be disappointed.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well these guys think they can walk all over everybody because of their rank. I&#039;m glad you kicked their asses.&quot;
&gt;Ayn smiles at you
&gt;Ara sits and pouts like a child
&quot;We should&#039;ve ripped them apart.&quot;
&gt;You pet her head and she leans into your hand
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m going to need some help down in the portal room. Can you two help me?&quot;
&gt;They both nod and get up, ready to follow you

&gt;You got down to the portal room and started scanning for the portal back to Ayn&#039;s world
&gt;Ara pushed you aside and pulled on the end of her tail
&gt;It came off, revealing a universal connection pack, which she plugged into the console
&gt;Her eyes lit up as the screen began moving around the various dimensions
&gt;She eventually found it in less than a minute, locking the co-ordinates
&gt;&quot;Woah, where can I get one of those?&quot;
&gt;She smiles back at you
&quot;Secret secret!&quot;
&gt;Damn what a tease
&gt;You looked back to Ayn, whose ears were flattened and tail between her legs
&gt;You knew what to do
&gt;You hit the delete button and the coordinates vanished and the dimensional map shifted away
&gt;&quot;Oops, the machine must&#039;ve deleted it. Some sort of bug.&quot;
&quot;WHAT!? That&#039;s impossible! I checked every single bit of code and there&#039;s no way-&quot;
&gt;Ayn puts her hand of Ara&#039;s mouth
&quot;Ooooh I get it.&quot;
&gt;You smile at her naivety
&gt;You then remembered you have something to do
&gt;&quot;Aw hell, I need to write those reports. Do you ladies mind coming with me?&quot;
&gt;They nod and follow you to your office
&gt;It was a bland concrete room with a nice computer and IKEA desk on the right
&gt;A sofa sat at the left of the room along with 2 leather arm chairs in the back by your desk
&gt;You pull out your chair and open up word
&gt;You asked Ara the same questions as Ayn and her answer was, complicated to say the least
&gt;Too much to be written down
&gt;Ara offered to just plug into your computer, but you didn&#039;t feel comfortable giving her access to the internet and the bunker&#039;s files
&gt;You asked them other questions from your standardized extra terrestrial questionnaire
&gt;After all was said and done, you were tired and the clock read 7 PM
&gt;Everyone was going home for the night and the ladies looked very tired to say the least
&gt;&quot;Do you girls want some food?&quot;
&gt;Ara nodded eagerly
&quot;I&#039;d like some macaroni!&quot;
&quot;I just want something to fill me up, thanks.&quot;
&gt;You smile at them both before getting up and going to the kitchen
&gt;They both followed you and you overheard them talking about you
&quot;He makes amazing food Ara. Like, five star restaurant good.&quot;
&quot;I don&#039;t believe someone as young as him could possibly cook anything beyond ramen.&quot;
&gt;You smirked
&gt;Challenge accepted
&gt;You got behind the grill and turned it on before grabbing some noodles from the cabinets
&gt;You grated some cheese and put in a pinch of spices before stirring it
&gt;The final touch was a secret spice you had found when you were in vietnam
&gt;An old vietnamese woman showed you how to combine spices to make something sweet and spicy at the same time
&gt;Everybody you made it for loved it and you did too
&gt;You made a sandwich again for yourself, as you don&#039;t usually like eating good food in front of guests
&gt;For Ayn, you made another steak and added in a little bit of spice to give it the extra kick
&gt;Italianfingers.jpg
&gt;You put the macaroni into a bowl and the steak on a plate before grabbing some more Sunkist from the fridge
&gt;&quot;Do you prefer anything Ara, we don&#039;t have alcohol, but we do have soda
&gt;Ayn nodded vigorously at Ara and she just asked for what Ayn wanted
&gt;You nodded to them and grabbed a third soda from the fridge
&gt;You set the plate down in front of Ayn and the bowl in front of Ara
&gt;You also set the plastic bottles of Sunkist in front of the 2 before going back to get your sandwich
&gt;After picking it up, you sat down at the opposite end of the table
&gt;You watched as Ara sniffed it and took a bite
&gt;She chewed for a minute before her eyes lit up
&quot;Oh my god this is so good!&quot;
&quot;I told you he could cook.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Really, it&#039;s nothing.&quot;
&quot;Nothing!? This is some of the best food I&#039;ve ever had!&quot;
&gt;You really don&#039;t know why people like your food so much, you just follow the recipe and add in something that fits the flavor
&gt;You eat your sandwich as Ara wolfs down her food and Ayn cuts slices from the steak before eating them
&gt;Ara speaks
&quot;Anon, I hate to ask but, how old are you?&quot;
&gt;You think for a moment before answering
&gt;&quot;I think I&#039;m 138, but I could be wrong. Might be 137 or 139.&quot;
&gt;Her jaw dropped and Ayn dropped her slice of steak
&gt;&quot;What? Did I say something?&quot;
&gt;Ayn speaks first
&quot;No way you&#039;re 138. You look so young!&quot;
&quot;I can&#039;t even get a reading on you when I scan your cells. It&#039;s all over the place! Some of your cells are 25 years old and others are almost 140!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Huh, I guess I was off by a bit. I guess that means I&#039;m 140 years old!&quot;
&quot;But how!&quot;
&gt;You were a bit hesitant to tell them because you knew what the next question would be
&gt;&quot;I have an age reversal serum that I&#039;ve used once before. I used it back in 2025 to reset my age to 20 years old.&quot;
&quot;That&#039;s amazing! Why isn&#039;t this all over the news?&quot;
&gt;&quot;It only works on very specific genomes. As in, it&#039;ll kill you within the hour if your genes aren&#039;t the right ones.&quot;
&gt;Ara&#039;s ears go flat
&quot;Oh.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah, oh.&quot;
&gt;You drink the last of your soda and get up from the table
&quot;Hey wait up tiger.&quot;
&gt;Ayn jogged up to your side as you entered your room
&quot;Where you going so early? Don&#039;t you have anything else to do?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well my last objective was to find the blip on the dimensional map, but I found it and deleted it. So I don&#039;t really have much to do other than just sleep and inquire about you 2.&quot;
&gt;She flutters her eyes at you
&quot;Inquire as in?~&quot;
&gt;You felt very uncomfortable all of the sudden
&gt;&quot;About your anatomy, whether or not you are similar to mammals, feral Jackals, and felines on earth, that kind of inquire.&quot;
&gt;She puts her hand on your thigh before speaking again
&quot;I could show you how similar to a mammal I am~&quot;
&gt;She makes her way to your groin before grabbing your crotch
&gt;&quot;Uh, miss, your hand is on my-&quot;
&quot;Oh!~ I didn&#039;t notice, sometimes they just wander~&quot;
&gt;You get up quickly
&gt;&quot;No! I don&#039;t want that! I mean, you&#039;re a beautiful woman and all, but I don&#039;t feel comfortable doing that outside of a relationship.&quot;
&gt;Her ears go flat and she pouts
&quot;Aw, come on Anon! I&#039;ll be gentle, I promise!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I just don&#039;t feel like it&#039;s right to do. I mean, I at least want to take you to dinner first!&quot;
&gt;She smirked at this
&quot;You already have~&quot;
&gt;Fuck, she&#039;s right
&gt;She is very beautiful and you&#039;ve actually never had sex in your entire life
&gt;Dammit, why can&#039;t you just get a break?
&gt;But your dick isn&#039;t large at all, it&#039;s barely average at 6 inches
&gt;You weren&#039;t confident in your ability to please her, being that she&#039;s the avatar of the lust and fertility goddess
&gt;She must have seen many men before you, many of whom are much larger than you
&gt;You might have to swallow your pride if you want to get out of this
&gt;&quot;I, uh, um, my uh, you know-&quot;
&quot;Come on, out with it!&quot;
&gt;&quot;My dick is small okay!&quot;
&gt;Her eyes widen in surprise
&gt;She then begins to laugh at you
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s so funny?&quot;
&quot;That&#039;s what you&#039;re worried about?! AHAHAHAHA!&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s rolling on the bed laughing her ass off
&quot;Holy shit, I thought you were one of those losers who wanted to stay level 99 wizards forever! Oh my god!&quot;
&gt;She continues to laugh as your self esteem slowly melts away
&gt;She finally looks at you after laughing and stops immediately
&gt;She sits back up and speaks again
&quot;Come over here anon.&quot;
&gt;You do as you&#039;re told by the Jackal
&quot;Sit.&quot;
&gt;You sit down
&quot;I don&#039;t care how big your dick is, I just think it&#039;s very nice of you to take care of us, especially after what we did to you. It&#039;s kinda hot.&quot;
&gt;You feel your cheeks heat up as you look away
&gt;&quot;I-I&#039;m not that great, I treat everybody like this. And I&#039;m all alone down here most of the time, so I just thought I&#039;d show some hospitality.&quot;
&quot;Anon, nobody is as nice as you are without being payed or promised favors. From what I&#039;m seeing, you&#039;re not being payed by us and you denied sex from me when I begged. That&#039;s sort of noble of you. Even when Ara and I attacked you, you didn&#039;t fight back or get angry. Hell, you weren&#039;t even disappointed! You even offered us beds and food for god&#039;s sake!&quot;
&gt;You weren&#039;t even able to look at her, you were so embarrassed
&gt;&quot;I-it&#039;s nothing, really.&quot;
&quot;Like hell it is! You&#039;re probably the nicest guy I&#039;ve ever met. You don&#039;t ask anything of us and even sided with us when we hurt all those eggheads!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well, I knew that you wouldn&#039;t just attack without reason. It&#039;s irrational to think that. By the way they were laid about the room, they must have tried to touch you somewhere or tried to do things you didn&#039;t want.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, they had one of the scientists try and get your armor from the locker to restrain us. You came in before he could come back. I don&#039;t know what would&#039;ve happened if you hadn&#039;t come.&quot;
&gt;You look over to your locker and see that it was indeed unlocked
&gt;Fuckers probably stole one of your keys
&gt;Meh, not a big deal
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m sorry I didn&#039;t come sooner! I should&#039;ve stayed with you both and made sure everyone was kept in check! I&#039;m sor-&quot;
&quot;SEE! That&#039;s what I&#039;m talking about! You&#039;re apologizing for what WE did!&quot;
&gt;You were about to retort when you thought, she&#039;s right
&gt;&quot;Is that bad?&quot;
&quot;No! Not at all Anon, it&#039;s kind of charming in a way.&quot;
&gt;Aaaaah the compliments don&#039;t stop!
&gt;Ayn turned you towards her and pressed her lips to yours
&gt;She stuck her tongue between your lips and explored your mouth with her tongue
&gt;You returned the kiss and her embrace
&gt;Just as you separated, Ara burst into the room
&quot;Something&#039;s pounding on the portal door!&quot;
&gt;Oh shit
&gt;You bolt up and grab your exo from the locker, as well as your cavalry saber and a little something you had forgotten about
&gt;A plasma pistol designed by a co-worker, who gifted it to you on your birthday
&gt;It was extremely function over form, the only thing that had any style was the grip
&gt;You put the battery pack into it and charged it in preparation for an attack
&gt;You slid your helmet onto your head as the bolts screwed into place, locking it into the exo&#039;s neck frame
&gt;The exo closed shut before you stepped out and jumped off the top flight of stairs
&gt;Ara had some sort of pistol in her hands and Ayn had her stone key
&gt;You heard more banging on the door before hearing a voice
&quot;THIS IS GENERAL VIKNA RAMENSKAYA! OPEN THIS PORTAL DOOR OR I WILL BLOW IT OPEN!&quot;
&gt;You see Ara go over to the console and plug her tail in before opening the Iris
&gt;&quot;ARA WHAT THE HELL!?&quot;
&quot;She&#039;s a friend Anon.&quot;
&gt;You still kept your plasma pistol trained on the Iris as it opened
&gt;A blue and white feline stepped from the portal and stood there expectantly
&quot;Put that weapon down before I kick your ass!&quot;
&gt;The portal started to destabilize
&gt;You should tell her
&gt;No time
&gt;&quot;LOOK OUT!&quot;
&gt;You sprint towards her and push her to the side of the portal as a geyser of liquid erupted from the center where she had stood
&gt;You rolled mid air and took the full force of the impact as you skidded across the floor
&gt;The portal closed and the blue cat in your arms squirmed and struggled
&quot;GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME YOU DISGUSTING PIG!&quot;
&gt;You let her go and she jumps off of you
&gt;She then attempts to disarm you, but failing miserably as your grip was like a vice
&quot;How in the hell are you holding onto that?!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Exo-skeleton. Increases my strength by ten.&quot;
&quot;Figures that you would need an exo-skeleton to fight. You must be weaker than a wet noodle!&quot;
&gt;You get off the ground and turn your helmet polarization off
&gt;You don&#039;t feel comfortable exposing any part of yourself to this crazy cat lady
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m Anon, resident scientist, vietnam war veteran, and-&quot;
&quot;DROP YOUR WEAPON BEAST!&quot;
&gt;She is now aiming her own pistol at you
&gt;You don&#039;t feel like dealing with this shit
&gt;You drop your weapon and walk towards her
&gt;She was a full foot and a half shorter than you
&gt;She fired her pistol at you, only to have the round bounce off
&gt;The gun jams, leaving her defenseless
&gt;You rip the gun from her hand before throwing it against the wall
&gt;She throws a punch, but it only ends up hurting her
&gt;You continued your sentence
&gt;&quot;And, the guy who just saved you from being vaporized by portal fluid. At your service ma&#039;am.&quot;
&gt;The woman grips her hand and looks behind her
&quot;Ara, Ayn?&quot;
&quot;VIKNA!&quot;
&gt;Ara runs in for a hug before Vikna pushes her away
&quot;Get off me! This thing just tried to kill me and it&#039;s still alive!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Did you not just hear me say I saved your life?&quot;
&quot;YOU TACKLED ME TO THE GROUND AND TOOK MY GUN!&quot;
&gt;&quot;After you stood in front of the portal demanding mine, before almost getting vaporized, as well as me taking the entire brunt of the fall, dropping my weapon, and taking a round from your gun!&quot;
&gt;She was about to argue when she saw your point
&quot;You could have told me!&quot;
&gt;&quot;There was no time miss. Are you hungry?&quot;
&quot;There wa- wait, what did you say?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I asked if you were hungry. I can make you something if you want.&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s speechless
&quot;After I just tried to kill you, you&#039;re offering food?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes.&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s not a last meal is it?&quot;
&gt;&quot;No.&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s nothing sexual?&quot;
&gt;&quot;What? No! It&#039;s just normal food!&quot;
&gt;Her expression changed to guilt
&quot;S-sorry.&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s fine, I understand you were scared.&quot;
&gt;Her expression steels
&quot;I wasn&#039;t scared! I was worried you might hurt my friends!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh, I understand.&quot;
&gt;You knew she was bluffing
&gt;&quot;So, what do you want to eat?&quot;
&gt;Ara speaks
&quot;Anon makes really good food! It&#039;s the best Vikna!&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s not THAT great.&quot;
&quot;Don&#039;t sell yourself short anon! You&#039;re probably the best cook I know! I have a very limited sense of taste and even I was wowed by your food!&quot;
&gt;You undid your helmet and carried it under your arm
&gt;&quot;So, are you gonna tell me or-&quot;
&quot;Shashlik.&quot;
&gt;You smile
&gt;You haven&#039;t made shashlik in forever and have been itching to try some new recipes
&gt;&quot;You got it ma&#039;am.&quot;
&gt;You give her a crisp salute which she returns
&quot;Now go!&quot;
&gt;You run up the flight of stairs to the kitchen

&gt;You had doused the kebab in vinegar and added a bit of sweetener to counteract the vinegar taste
&gt;You brought the plate over to her as well as some bottled water she asked for
&gt;When you reached the table, Ayn was deep in conversation with Vikna
&quot;-et why he&#039;s so nice to me! I tried to kill him after he saved me and then he asks me what I want to eat?! What&#039;s he trying to do?&quot;
&quot;He&#039;s just nice Habibi&#039;ti. He&#039;s not looking to get in your pants or anything. Oh hey Anon!&quot;
&gt;You nod and set the plate down as Vikna examined the shashlik
&quot;Doesn&#039;t look like it&#039;s been poisoned, can&#039;t smell anything but the shashlik.&quot;
&gt;She takes a small bite of the meat before chewing slowly, ready to spit it out
&gt;Her eyes go wide and she swallows
&quot;H-how?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Is it really that good?&quot;
&quot;YES! It&#039;s the best shashlik I&#039;ve ever had!&quot;
&gt;She pretty much inhales the rest of your kebab as you watch in amusement
&quot;W-what&#039;s that look for.&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s just kind of odd for me to see people enjoy my food. I honestly don&#039;t think it&#039;s as good as you all think it is.&quot;
&quot;Anon, I won&#039;t lie, this food is the best thing I&#039;ve ever eaten. Ever.&quot;
&gt;Wew lad, that&#039;s some high praise coming from the lady who shot you
&gt;&quot;Well, the girls have bunks they sleep in if you want to sleep there. I also have a bed if you don&#039;t want a bunk. I&#039;m more than happy to sleep in a bunk if it&#039;s what you want.&quot;
&quot;A-are you sure? You&#039;d just give up your bed for me?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah, you&#039;re my guests!&quot;
&quot;I-I guess I could.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll go and change the sheets for you as well as make the bed. Just give me a few minutes.&quot;
&gt;You get up to change the sheets and get the bed prepped

&gt;Ayn
&gt;You watch as Anon leaves in his armor before closing the door
&gt;Vikna looks at you desperately
&quot;WHY IS HE SO NICE?!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t know habibi, he just is.&quot;
&quot;Nobody is that nice! What does he want from us?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nothing.&quot;
&quot;NOTHING?! He definitely wants something from us! Nobody is that nice for no reason!&quot;
&gt;Ara interrupts
&quot;I checked for any signs of a lie and found none. There&#039;s a 0.00001% chance he is lying about this.&quot;
&gt;Her mouth sits agape
&quot;And after I tried to kill him too...&quot;
&gt;&quot;We all did at first Vikna, it&#039;s not just you.&quot;
&quot;I tried to choke him because I thought he was a cop!&quot;
&gt;You chuckle at Ara&#039;s response
&gt;&quot;I kicked him down when he was waiting for me to wake up. It knocked him out cold for a few minutes and made him bleed, but he just offered to make me some food and let me sleep with him.&quot;
&quot;But it doesn&#039;t make any sense to me! Why would he do all this?!&quot;
&gt;You had a theory
&gt;&quot;Maybe he just wants some friends.&quot;
&gt;She looks at you like you just said something stupid
&quot;How does he not have friends!?&quot;
&gt;&quot;He said he was alone down here most of the time. Today was the only difference because he actually found something of value.&quot;
&gt;A metal clang was heard in the distance followed by a &#039;FUCK!&#039;
&gt;You got up and rushed to see what happened

&gt;Anon
&gt;You were smoothing out the bed before you would allow Vikna to sleep here
&gt;You finished smoothing the bed and turned around
&gt;Your exo locked up and you fell to the ground with a loud clang
&gt;&quot;FUCK!&quot;
&gt;You pushed yourself over as the emergency power opened your clamps and allowed you to get out
&gt;Ayn rushed over followed closely by Vikna and Ara
&quot;Anon! Are you okay?&quot;
&gt;You chuckle, a bit embarrassed
&gt;&quot;Bed&#039;s ready.&quot;
&gt;You get off the floor and pick up your exo before putting it in the closet along with your saber
&gt;Vikna looked around the room
&quot;It&#039;s a very nice room, anon.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Thanks.&quot;
&gt;She waves you off
&quot;Shoo! I&#039;m stripping to go to sleep!&quot;
&gt;You cover your eyes and walk towards the door
&gt;&quot;Sorry!&quot;
&gt;You bump into a furry mass in front of you
&gt;It&#039;s Ayn and Ara
&gt;&quot;Oops! Sorry!&quot;
&gt;You squeeze past them and walk over to the bunk room
&gt;You strip down to your underwear and are about to go to sleep when you hear a certain Jackal behind you
&quot;Mrow! You don&#039;t look half bad.&quot;
&gt;You look down at yourself, you had fading abs from when you worked out a few years ago
&gt;You weren&#039;t self conscious about your looks, but you weren&#039;t hot by any stretch
&gt;At least you weren&#039;t until now
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t get any ideas.&quot;
&quot;Who&#039;s gonna stop me~&quot;
&gt;Ara walked in just then
&gt;Thank god for Ara the cockblock
&gt;You got up on the third row of bunks before laying down and trying to sleep
&gt;But you sat there for hours, just thinking about the three ladies
&gt;You heard whispers below you
&quot;Ayn, I actually had a message for you when I was thrown in prison.&quot;
&quot;Oh?&quot;
&quot;You&#039;re wanted back at the ship.&quot;
&quot;Hmmm, well I don&#039;t want to leave Anon all alone.&quot;
&quot;You might have to. Loki has been tracking the ship and tried to pry it from me. I deleted the files and now only Vikna know where it is.&quot;
&quot;We can take the portal back in the morning before Anon wakes up.&quot;
&gt;The portal
&gt;OH SHIT THE PORTAL
&gt;You bolt up and jump down, running down the hall in your underoos
&quot;ANON WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!&quot;
&gt;&quot;TO SEAL THE PORTAL OFF!&quot;
&gt;When you reached the room, you saw it was already dialing in coordinates
&gt;Fuck!
&gt;You made your way down the stairs as the 8th chevron locked in
&gt;You rushed to the console and slammed the yellow and black button down as the 9th chevron dialed
&gt;The Iris slammed shut before the 10th could dial in
&gt;You pressed the big red button and the portal lost all power
&gt;The portal shut down and the chevrons unlocked
&gt;Holy shit that was close
&gt;Ayn is right by you
&quot;Anon! What&#039;s going on?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I think your friend Loki remembered his friends were missing.&quot;
&gt;You smile and walk back to the bunks
&gt;Ayn followed
&quot;You heard what we were saying?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah.&quot;
&quot;All of it?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes.&quot;
&quot;Are you gonna be mad if I go?&quot;
&gt;&quot;No.&quot;
&gt;You here her sigh
&quot;Thank god. I thought you&#039;d be mad.&quot;
&gt;She put her hand on your shoulder
&quot;Do you wanna join us?&quot;
&gt;Ara spoke up
&quot;WHAT?! He can&#039;t just join our crew! There&#039;s no place for him! We can&#039;t just pick up people willy nilly!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sure. But can we wait until morning? I really need sleep.&quot;
&gt;Ara was still protesting but she suddenly stopped
&gt;You assumed Ayn gave her a look
&quot;It&#039;s your call.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Alright, Guess I&#039;m joining a crew of some sort.&quot;
&gt;You made your way to bed and fell asleep as soon as you got comfortable

&gt;The next morning
&gt;You had gotten up bright and early before anyone had gotten to the bunker
&gt;You put a note on the bunker entrance telling them what you did and not to look for you
&gt;You also put your notes and findings on your desk and took the password off your computer so they could look it over
&gt;You had your exo and a charger as well as a very large bag strapped to your back
&gt;It was more like a trunk than a bag
&gt;In fact, it was a trunk with straps attached to it
&gt;It held copies of all your notes and your clothes, as well as your sword, a beacon in case you wanted to come back, and some cooking supplies
&gt;You also kept some extra charge packs for your plasma pistol that you picked up off the ground
&gt;You put your helmet on and it sealed your suit completely as Vikna locked the final chevron in
&gt;The portal opened and a blast of portal fluid came from the center before receding back into the portal
&gt;Now that you think about it, this is almost exactly like a stargate
&gt;A stargate you built
&gt;Ayn went first, then Ara, then Vikna
&gt;You cleared the console of the coordinates and wiped the memory with a magnet before stepping through yourself

&gt;All you hear is screeching and you see a winding blue tunnel before reaching a blinding white light
&gt;You step through only to be greeted by guns pointed at your face
&quot;Identify yourself!&quot;
&quot;Hold your fire! He&#039;s with us.&quot;
&gt;You come down the ramp and the portal closes, an explosion of blue liquid coming out before being sucked in
&gt;The men lower their weapons before you take off your helmet, a slight hiss coming from the pressure being different in the ship
&gt;Wait, different pressure?
&gt;&quot;Hold on, where are we?&quot;
&quot;Just outside the Orion arm of the milky way.&quot;
&gt;You look behind you and see nothing but stars
&gt;You were in space
&gt;SPACE!
&quot;Hey anon, let&#039;s get you to your new quarters.&quot;
&gt;You turn around and see Ayn holding your hand
&gt;l-lewd
&gt;You follow her lead as she takes you to a room
&gt;The room is colored red and has lots of little trinkets in it
&gt;Is this
&gt;&quot;Is this your room Ayn?&quot;
&quot;Yep! No other bunks are available, so you&#039;re sleeping with me!&quot;
&gt;Oh
&gt;Oh no
&gt;This is her sex dungeon
&gt;Where she takes all her victims&#039; virginity&#039;s
&gt;She laid out on the bed, having stripped to her bra and underwear
&gt;Well, bra being a very loose term here
&gt;More like strings that cover her nipples
&gt;Ara comes in the room
&quot;Anon! The crew want you to be one of the chefs! We&#039;re having breakfast right now!&quot;
&gt;Thank god for Ara
&gt;Ayn pouts as you set down your trunk and take off your exo
&gt;You plug the charger into the socket and it begins charging your exo
&gt;Ayn is dressed in her usual green dress and you&#039;re in your old marine blues
&gt;It&#039;s the fanciest thing you could wear, and hoped it would be sufficient for the event
&gt;It turned out it was a bit too much
&gt;Everybody else was in some form of coverall
&gt;You felt overdressed and immediately walked to the counter
&gt;A fat tiger looked at you and smiled
&quot;Ah! You must be anon! I&#039;ve heard many good things about your cooking.&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s not that good, honestly.&quot;
&quot;Nonsense! Anyone who manages to impress General Vikna is definitely extraordinary. Do you wish to start cooking friend?&quot;
&gt;The tiger had a strong russian accent and smelled like vodka and cosmoline
&gt;&quot;Sure, I&#039;ll give it a go.&quot;
&gt;You decided to make some ham and eggs with a side of bratwursts
&gt;The food machine popped out a box of meat and you got to work

&gt;After all was done, people lined up as you told the tiger your secrets of good food
&gt;His eyes go wide when you tell him secrets
&quot;Why didn&#039;t I think of that?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ve been around the block for a lot longer than you think.&quot;
&gt;He smiles
&quot;So you&#039;re an android?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nope, Human.&quot;
&gt;He dropped his soup spoon
&quot;What did you just say?&quot;
&gt;Oh shit
&gt;&quot;Is there something wrong sir?&quot;
&gt;He grabs your marine blues, looking you in the eyes
&quot;Humans are a myth! You&#039;re not a human! You&#039;re some kind of hairless ape!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t understand! What&#039;s wrong with being a human!?&quot;
&quot;Some of the men on board this ship hate humans with a passion! Stay low and don&#039;t say anything about it. They would kill you as soon as they knew.&quot;
&gt;&quot;N-noted sir.&quot;
&gt;He releases you and you dust off your blues
&gt;You were gonna need to wash them again
&gt;The crew were all in a much happier mood and most came for seconds and thirds
&gt;Guess your food is pretty good

&gt;After breakfast was finished, you went back to Ayn&#039;s room and unpacked more of your things
&gt;You set your cavalry sword on an empty shelf and take it out of the sheath
&gt;After finding your cleaning things in your trunk, you started wiping the sword clean and polishing it
&gt;You took out a whet stone and sharpened the blade
&gt;Once the blade could cut your arm hair with ease, you sheathed the sword again
&gt;Ayn came back in, looking worse for wear
&gt;&quot;You look like you were ran over by a truck.&quot;
&quot;Feels like it too.&quot;
&gt;&quot;What happened?&quot;
&quot;Well, I was kind of hoping you and I could get a bit intimate, but you went off to cook breakfast for the crew. So I had to satisfy my urges somewhere else.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Wait did you-&quot;
&quot;I got plowed by a rhino.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh shit.&quot;
&quot;Oh shit is right.&quot;
&gt;Now you feel bad for her
&gt;&quot;D-did it at least feel good?&quot;
&quot;Not at all, he was way too big. Had to put on a smile and a fake orgasm, the whole shebang.&quot;
&gt;Now you felt like shit
&quot;Had to push out the cum for about 5 minutes before it all came out, it was a big one.&quot;
&gt;It just gets worse
&gt;&quot;Well, I&#039;m sorry about that, I mean if you told me directly I would&#039;ve, erm, helped out.&quot;
&gt;She perks up slightly, but still isn&#039;t in the mood for anything but sleep
&gt;She throws herself into the bed and lays face down in a pillow
&gt;You get your uniform off and fold it up for cleaning later
&gt;Ayn needed someone right now and you were it
&gt;You got in bed beside her and pulled her into a hug
&gt;You lay there for a while, just cuddling

&gt;Eventually, Ayn falls asleep and you lay there with her, wondering what to do
&gt;You could take her right now, give her the relief she desperately wants
&gt;But that&#039;d be rape
&gt;You don&#039;t wanna rape a goddess
&gt;You decide to just fall asleep with her in your arms
&gt;You haven&#039;t had much sleep and you taught the cook how to cook using your methods
&gt;You were about to fall asleep when you heard something that shook you to your very core
&quot;I love you anon~&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t know what to say
&gt;Maybe she was sleep talking?
&gt;But that doesn&#039;t mean she doesn&#039;t mean it, it only makes it more true!
&gt;You do kind of like her too, but she barely knows you and already has a bond with you
&gt;You say the first thing that comes to mind
&gt;&quot;I love you too.&quot;
&gt;Fuck
&gt;Guess that seals the deal
&gt;You&#039;re in love
&gt;You swear that her tail starts wagging after you say that
&gt;You were too tired to care and fell asleep

&gt;Alarms sounded as the ship went to high alert
&gt;Ara came over the radio
&quot;ALL HANDS TO BATTLE STATIONS! BOARDING CRAFT APPROACHING FROM THE STARBOARD SIDE!&quot;
&gt;Oh shit it&#039;s habbening
&gt;You shake Ayn awake and she groans
&quot;Five more minutes.&quot;
&gt;&quot;We got boarding craft on the starboard side! Get to your station!&quot;
&gt;She bolts up, pushing you off the bed before grabbing her stone key and rushes out the door
&gt;You get up off the floor and get yourself into something before putting your exo on
&gt;The clamps slide closed and click into place
&gt;The servos come alive with a whir before you unhook the charging cable
&gt;You grab your helmet and wipe off a smudge before putting it on
&gt;The bolts screw closed, locking your helmet into place
&gt;You turn the polarization up and the glass turns into a one way mirror
&gt;You load a fresh charge pack into the plasma gun before flicking the safety off
&gt;You grab your cavalry saber and mount it to your exo before holstering the pistol
&gt;You check all your servos work and step towards the door
&gt;It opened automatically and you ran over to the starboard side of the ship
&gt;A fuzzy image appeared in your HUD before Ara appeared
&quot;Sorry Anon, I had to hack into your exo&#039;s interface before I could give you a map of the ship. It took me longer than usual. Your firewall is unlike anything I&#039;ve ever seen.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Thanks, I guess?&quot;
&gt;The map displayed on your HUD and showed multiple breaches on the docking bays and a breach on the bridge
&gt;&quot;Ara, are you good on the bridge?&quot;
&quot;Oh crap! You&#039;re right!&quot;
&gt;Guess that&#039;s a no
&gt;You turn back and tune into the ear piece you gave Ayn
&gt;&quot;Ayn!&quot;
&quot;Whoa! Anon, how the hell?&quot;
&gt;&quot;No time to explain! Get to the bridge, there&#039;s a breach and Ara is still there!&quot;
&gt;You continue towards the bridge and your HUD points out 2 unidentified contacts around the corner
&gt;You draw you plasma pistol and charge it before diving around the corner
&gt;2 lions wearing armor like the ones from the portal
&gt;You dove like max payne and shot one with a charged shot, blowing a hole in his chest
&gt;You landed with a thud and shot the other one with a couple regular shots
&gt;They both hit the floor like a sack of potatoes
&gt;Pain radiated through your body as you get off the floor
&gt;&quot;Fuck, I&#039;m never doing that again.&quot;
&gt;You run to the stairs to the bridge and start to scramble up them
&gt;When you reached the top, it was a massacre
&gt;These lions looked much different from the ones before
&gt;They wore modern armor and carried shorter plasma rifles
&gt;Special units maybe?
&gt;They turned towards you and opened fire
&gt;Oh shit!
&gt;You dove behind the stairs and charged the plasma pistol
&gt;When it charged, you got up and fired it at one of the men
&gt;The shot burned a hole in the armor before going through it, leaving a gaping hole in the center of their chest
&gt;You shot more plasma shots as you scanned the room for Ara
&gt;Must be hiding
&gt;Plasma burns your plating as you try to find cover
&quot;THIS THING IS A PRIORITY TARGET! TAKE IT DOWN!&quot;
&gt;They were talking about you
&gt;A metal ball landed right by you and you knew what that was
&gt;A grenade
&gt;You leaped to the side and the grenade blew, leaving a blast mark and damaging multiple computers
&gt;Holy shit
&gt;They continued to fire more plasma at you
&gt;Your plating is about to fail
&gt;Fuck this, if you&#039;re dying you&#039;re dying with style
&gt;You holster your pistol and draw the cavalry saber
&gt;With a mighty roar, you ran from behind the pillar you were hiding behind and charged
&gt;The first soldier didn&#039;t know what to do as you skewered him with the sword
&gt;You twisted it and pulled, taking the gun from the next goon before hitting him in the face with the hilt of your sword
&gt;You stabbed the sword through his neck, instantly going limp
&gt;You get knocked over and somebody attempts to pin you
&gt;You throw them off before throwing your sword at them
&gt;It goes straight through the armor and embeds itself into a computer console, shocking the man to death
&gt;The last guy watches in fear as he sees his friends get mowed down by someone in a suit of armor
&gt;You pull the sword out of the console and think of something witty to say
&gt;Then you remembered a badass character from a game you played in the 90s
&gt;You turn the polarization of your visor down to clear and speak
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m here to kick ass and chew bubble gum.&quot;
&quot;A HUMAN!? H-HOW ARE YOU-&quot;
&gt;&quot;And I&#039;m all outta gum.&quot;
&gt;You bring the sword down into his skull, killing the man instantly
&gt;You pull the sword out and wipe the blood off on his fur
&gt;Hope none of these men had any families
&gt;&quot;Ara! Where are you?&quot;
&gt;She came out from below a console
&gt;&quot;Ara! Are you okay?&quot;
&gt;Her face was falling off and you saw the skeleton underneath
&gt;It was metallic and like something out of a horror movie
&quot;Good thing I&#039;m not programmed to feel pain.&quot;
&gt;Who the fuck programs something to feel pain?
&gt;She pushes the hanging face piece into place and the horror show is over
&quot;I see your blood pressure is slightly elevated, are you frightened by my appearance?&quot;
&gt;&quot;That was pretty spooky Ara, but at least you&#039;re okay.&quot;
&gt;She runs up to you and gives you a hug
&quot;IwassoworriedaboutyouIthoughtyoudiedthosecommandosarereallyhardtobeatand-&quot;
&gt;&quot;Whoa! Slow down Ara, I&#039;m not able to listen when you go fifty miles a minute.&quot;
&gt;She blushes blue and continues slower
&quot;I was worried about you, the commandos are extremely well trained and have taken down many of our people before. I thought they got you too, since my headset contained my wireless antenna and link to the ship. It was destroyed right after I ended the call with you.&quot;
&gt;A black canine-feline hybrid came up the stairs with a sword in one hand and a pistol in the other
&quot;UNHAND THE AI!&quot;
&gt;You let Ara go and put your hands up
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m on your side, what&#039;s the deal?&quot;
&gt;He rushes at you as quick as a flash, but you grab him as he tries to get behind you
&gt;You throw him down and put him into an arm bar, making sure not to crush him under the weight of you and your exo
&quot;L-let go of me you ass!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Alright.&quot;
&gt;You let him go and he grabs his sword and gun from the ground
&quot;Nytro, stop!&quot;
&gt;Ayn came bounding up the stairs and into the bridge
&quot;He&#039;s with us! He&#039;s the one who made breakfast, remember?&quot;
&quot;He&#039;s inside that? I almost skewered him!&quot;
&gt;Both the girls laugh at his remark
&quot;He fucking DESTROYED you Nytro!&quot;
&quot;Yeah, he caught you before you could even land a hit!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Come on guys, it&#039;s not that impressive. You just need to predict where someone is going and reach.&quot;
&gt;The man offers his hand
&quot;As I&#039;m sure you&#039;re aware, my name is Nytro, nice to meet you.&quot;
&gt;You shake his hand
&gt;&quot;Anon, it&#039;s my pleasure. Sorry about the whole grabbing you thing. I tried to make it not hurt.&quot;
&quot;No hard feelings?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sure thing pal.&quot;
&gt;He comes right up to your helmet
&quot;Stay away from Ara, she&#039;s mine.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You got it.&quot;
&gt;He lets go of your hand and you feel the servos weakening
&gt;&quot;Oh shit not aga-&quot;
&gt;The suit shuts down, making you rigid as a board and unable to move
&gt;The emergency power kicks in and unclamps the suit before letting you out
&gt;You unscrew the helmet and take it off, revealing your tacky clothing choice
&quot;You look like you just got out of bed.&quot;
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s because I did.&quot;
&gt;You look over to Ayn who chuckles
&quot;I pushed him off my bed when the alarm sounded. Sorry about that by the way.&quot;
&quot;You just met this guy and you&#039;ve already fucked him!? Jesus Ayn give him a break!&quot;
&gt;&quot;No, we didn&#039;t do anything like that, we just slept. You know, what beds are supposed to be used for?&quot;
&quot;Ah, I get ya. Well, I&#039;m gonna help Ara repair the consoles, you two have fun.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Alright.&quot;
&gt;You hefted your exo on your shoulder as you walked down the stairs of the ship
&gt;&quot;Exciting first day.&quot;
&quot;You have no idea.&quot;

&gt;You plugged the charging cable to your exo and sat in one of Ayns chairs
&gt;You were beat
&gt;Even though your exo did most of the work, you still had to go along for the ride
&gt;That itself was exhausting
&gt;You eventually got the strength to trudge over to Ayns bed and you laid yourself out across the bed
&gt;&quot;Fuuuuuuuuck.&quot;
&gt;Ayn joins you in bed, doing the same thing next to you
&quot;My everything hurts.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I was planning on just relaxing and watching a movie but I can&#039;t even get enough strength up to move out of bed.&quot;
&gt;Ayn reaches over you and grabs a remote
&gt;The foot of the bed comes up and reveals a TV
&gt;You lay there for a while before you gather all your strength and go to your chest
&gt;You dig through it and find what you were looking for
&gt;Stargate SG-1
&gt;&quot;This is a fucking classic. It&#039;s pretty much what the portals are and what I drew inspiration from. I didn&#039;t know it would actually work though.&quot;
&gt;You insert the first disk and watch it slide into the TV
&gt;You get back on the bed and Ayn holds you with one arm, and turns the movie on in another
&gt;You both sit back and chill for the rest of the day before falling asleep again

&gt;When you wake up, Ayn is already getting dressed
&gt;She was looking in a mirror
&gt;She looked very depressed and you stirred in the bed
&gt;She looks behind her and sees you getting up
&quot;Anon, you&#039;re awake! It&#039;s about time.&quot;
&gt;You realize you&#039;re staring at a nude woman
&gt;&quot;Oops! Sorry, sorry.&quot;
&gt;You look away and wait for her to get dressed
&quot;Like what you saw?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I did, but could you please get decent? I really want to go and check out your lab.&quot;
&gt;She sighs
&quot;I&#039;m going up to see Ara, we have questions to answer.&quot;
&gt;Questions?
&gt;You gotta see this
&gt;You follow Ayn to the bridge after getting into your dry cleaned marine blues
&gt;They were old, vietnam era blues, but they were durable and very comfortable
&gt;Plus you looked like a fucking badass wearing them
&gt;When you reached the bridge, Ara was sitting at a console with a camera, flustered
&quot;I-I don&#039;t even know what you mean! I-I think Ayn would be a better candidate for this sort of thing!&quot;
&quot;Yes Ara?&quot;
&quot;Oh thank god! Ayn, tell them how you would make a much better sex partner than I would!&quot;
&gt;What is this mickey mouse shit?
&gt;Ayn steps in front of the camera and starts talking about sex with her eyes half closed
&gt;What in the flying fuck?
&gt;You had to see this
&gt;You came behind Ayn and looked at the console
&gt;A blog?
&gt;A fucking blog!?
&gt;HOLY SHIT YOUR SIDES HAVE ENTERED THE OORT CLOUD!
&gt;&quot;AHAHAHAHAHAH!&quot;
&gt;They both give you an indignant look
&quot;It&#039;s an ask blog anon, people ask us questions and we answer.&quot;
&gt;This takes you aback
&gt;&quot;Oh wait you&#039;re serious?&quot;
&gt;They both nod
&gt;&quot;Let me laugh even harder. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA!&quot;
&gt;They roll their eyes as you continue to laugh, the feed going absolutely insane
&gt;You wipe the tears from your eyes
&gt;&quot;Oh my god that&#039;s rich, thanks for the laugh guys.&quot;
&gt;They turn back to the console and you walk away from them
&quot;Anon wait!&quot;
&gt;Ara comes over to you and pulls you back
&gt;&quot;Hey! I&#039;m sorry for laughing at you, just don&#039;t bite my dick off please.&quot;
&quot;No, It&#039;s not that! They want to see you more. They asked who you were.&quot;
&gt;You put your hand behind your head
&gt;&quot;Oh, is that so? Why would anyone care about me?&quot;
&gt;Ayn scowls at you
&gt;Oops, you forgot Ayn liked you
&gt;How the fuck could you forget that
&gt;You walk over to the camera and look into it
&gt;The face on screen wasn&#039;t anything to look at, just an old scar across your cheek and a bandage covering your hair
&gt;&quot;Uh, hi?&quot;
&gt;The chat exploded with sexual questions
&#039;have u and ayn fukt?&#039;
&#039;OMG how big is your dick?&#039;
&#039;can you give us a peak at your &quot;special package&quot;? OwO&#039;
&gt;You feel heat on your cheeks
&gt;You stutter at the barrage of angst and teenage curiosity
&gt;The first thing comes to your mind is
&gt;&quot;Where in the god damn hell are your parents?!&quot;
&gt;You look over at Ayn
&gt;&quot;Are these kids for real? Do you actually show them anything?&quot;
&gt;Ara shakes her head but Ayn nods while smirking
&quot;And more~&quot;
&gt;You feel something warm trickle down your face and realize you have a nose bleed
&gt;Your blood pressure is through the fucking roof
&gt;You turn back to the camera
&gt;&quot;You all should be ASHAMED! Asking these lewd questions to these two ladies! It&#039;s disgusting and makes me SICK! Go play outside and hit each other with sticks or something, because I HIGHLY doubt any of you are above 18. Seriously! Go outside and play like normal kids! Don&#039;t shitpost and ask poor women to show you their tits! Now git!&quot;
&gt;You look back to Ayn, who&#039;s speechless
&gt;Ara is wide eyed as you just mouthed off to their fanbase
&gt;Even the chat wasn&#039;t talking
&gt;Then a single reply comes through
&#039;ur mom gay lol&#039;
&gt;&quot;No you.&quot;
&gt;The chat exploded again with &#039;rekt&#039; and &#039;OOOOOOOH&#039; and &#039;ROASTED&#039; along with other old memes
&gt;&quot;This session is over.&quot;
&gt;You unplug the camera and toss it to the side
&gt;You click out of the window and the chat disappears
&gt;You look back at them both with disappointment
&gt;You ground your teeth in frustration
&gt;&quot;How long, have you been enabling these kids?&quot;
&quot;Anon I don&#039;t-&quot;
&gt;&quot;HOW. LONG.&quot;
&quot;A-about 3 years.&quot;
&gt;&quot;3 FUCKING YEARS?!&quot;
&gt;Ayn attempts to step in
&quot;I-it&#039;s not all bad.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh really?! How so?&quot;
&quot;T-they warned us of a plot against o-our ship before it happened.&quot;
&gt;&quot;But at what cost?! Your decency? Dignity?&quot;
&gt;Ara is on the verge of tears and Ayn is hiding her face
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not mad at either of you. Just disappointed. I don&#039;t know why you do this or what you could possibly gain, but I highly advise against doing any more. It is, however, your choice. I won&#039;t speak of it anymore. Hell, I&#039;ll even put on a brave face and come back, but this isn&#039;t healthy. Not to mention, it&#039;s dangerous. People can triangulate your position by charting the stars from that window there.&quot;
&gt;You point to the window the camera was pointing towards
&gt;Ara goes from sad to scared in the blink of an eye
&gt;She instantly plugs her tail into the console and the ship lights up
&quot;All hands, prepare for jump! Our position is compromised!&quot;
&gt;Just as she said that, the ship spooled to 90%
&gt;Another ship jumped in and began to fire on you
&gt;&quot;SEE WHAT I MEAN!?&quot;
&quot;Oops.&quot;
&gt;The ship lurches forward into an alternate dimension, and comes out somewhere else
&gt;You look back to Ara and Ayn, both of whom can&#039;t look at you
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m going to the lab and seeing what&#039;s going on. You&#039;re free to join me if you like. Just keep the camera away from the windows.&quot;
&gt;They both can&#039;t look at you
&gt;You pull them both into a hug
&gt;&quot;Sorry I yelled, but I&#039;m just worried about you two. I don&#039;t hate you, I&#039;m just protective, that&#039;s all.&quot;
&gt;They hug back and rub against you
&quot;It&#039;s okay anon, we understand.&quot;
&gt;Ayn follows you as you walk down the stairs to her quarters
&gt;You put your helmet on and use the HUD to get around
&gt;You find your way to the lab
&gt;A snake lady is experimenting with some sort of chemical
&gt;You go over and see she&#039;s trying to make a portal fluid chemical
&quot;Sssssshit! I almossst had it!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Add 2 parts chlorine and you should have the mixture correct. Be careful though, it&#039;s extremely explosive and requires a large magnetic field to contain.&quot;
&gt;She turns to look at you and sets the tube down
&quot;Thanksssss for the notice. Who are you anywayssssss?&quot;
&quot;Grace, remember what we talked about with hissing?&quot;
&quot;Oops sorry, I get a little carried away sometimes.&quot;
&gt;You hold out your hand
&gt;&quot;Name&#039;s anon, I&#039;m a scientist as well. Just make sure you have something to contain the fluid, or it will burn through the glass and explode. It&#039;s more volatile than N-Stoff.&quot;
&gt;Her body shivers and she disposes of the liquid in a vacuum tube you assume leads outside
&gt;&quot;Good choice ma&#039;am.&quot;
&quot;My name&#039;ss- oops sorry, my name is Grace. Pleasure to meet you.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Pleasure is all my Grace. This is a nice lab you have.&quot;
&quot;Thanks Anon.&quot;
&gt;You take off your helmet and reveal your face
&gt;The snake lady is taken aback and bares her fangs
&quot;HUMAN SSSSCUM!&quot;
&gt;Oh fuck
&quot;GRACE! STOP! He&#039;s not here to hurt you!&quot;
&gt;Grace stops posturing but still bares her fangs
&quot;I can&#039;t believe I ssssshook handssss with a dirt human!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Is this some kind of XCOM thing?&quot;
&quot;SSSSSEE! HE&#039;SSSSS ONE OF THEM!!&quot;
&gt;&quot;NO NO NO! It&#039;s a video game I know of! Not the actual XCOM!&quot;
&gt;You look over at Ayn and whisper
&gt;&quot;XCOM exists?&quot;
&quot;Yes!&quot;
&gt;Oh shit
&gt;&quot;Well, uh, I&#039;ll take my leave ma&#039;am.&quot;
&quot;Yesssss you sssssshall.&quot;
&gt;You quickly run out of the room with your helmet in hand
&gt;Nope nope nope nope nooooope
&gt;You run to Ayn&#039;s room and suit up in your exo before donning your helmet again
&quot;What&#039;s that for?&quot;
&gt;&quot;This ship is full of people who hate humans! I&#039;m not taking any more chances.&quot;
&gt;You set the exo to low power mode and it acts as a second skin instead of an enhancement
&gt;&quot;I shouldn&#039;t have come here, your friend was right. I have no place here.&quot;
&gt;Ayn puts her hand to your helmet and starts stroking it, tracing the lines of it
&quot;Don&#039;t say that Anon, lots of people love you here! Most of the crew love your cooking and it&#039;s even boosted morale. Even Vikna is happier because of it!&quot;
&gt;&quot;That was just adding spices and sweets to dishes other people made. I&#039;m nothing special. Just a man living on borrowed time.&quot;
&quot;Anon, that&#039;s not-&quot;
&gt;&quot;AYN! I&#039;m 140 years old for god&#039;s sake! I should be DEAD! I was born in the 1800s for god&#039;s sake!&quot;
&gt;You punch the wall and your gauntlet sparked against the steel
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t know what you see in me, but I&#039;m not who you think I am. I&#039;m a cruel, ruthless soldier who got tired of war and started making things better for a world he helped hurt.&quot;
&gt;You sit in the half shell chair
&gt;&quot;I fought in world war 1, world war 2, Korea, Vietnam, Laotian civil war, Lebanese civil war, Invasion of Grenada, Invasion of panama, the Gulf war, even the fucking Kosovo war.&quot;
&quot;That&#039;s... a lot of war.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m a bad man Ayn. I&#039;ve killed thousands over my years of service and &#039;died&#039; 3 times. I turned to science once I had enough of the constant slaughter, trying to help humanity instead of fight it. I don&#039;t know what you see in me that could possibly be redeemed, but I can&#039;t see anything worth saving. So please, just leave me alone for five minutes, I have something I need to do.&quot;
&quot;NO ANON!&quot;
&gt;She slaps your helmet, whipping your head to the side
&quot;DON&#039;T YOU DARE TALK LIKE THAT ANON! PEOPLE HERE CARE ABOUT YOU! I DON&#039;T CARE WHAT ASS CRACK OF THE UNIVERSE YOU FOUGHT IN, HOW MANY PEOPLE DIED, I CARE ABOUT YOU!&quot;
&gt;You take off your helmet and are on the verge of tears
&quot;Anon, I never met anybody with as kind of a heart as yours. I know you had your reasons to go and do the things you did, but that&#039;s all behind you.&quot;
&gt;You feel tears streak down your face
&gt;You were a monster to these people, a freak
&gt;Someone they associate with mass murder
&gt;But the worst part was, they were right
&gt;&quot;Ayn, I-I&#039;ve never had any f-friends. M-my whole life has b-been a lonely slog to death. I very rarely d-do anything worth n-note and when I d-do it&#039;s based of someone *sniff* else&#039;s h-hard work.&quot;
&quot;Anon! You built a god damn stargate because you saw it on TV! You found the cure to aging! That&#039;s amazing!&quot;
&gt;You pull Ayn closer to you and cry into her shoulder
&gt;You try to say something, anything, but all you can do is choke out cries of despair
&quot;It&#039;s okay Anon, you have friends now. You even have somebody who loves you. I love you Anon.&quot;
&gt;This shocks you to your very core and your exo ejects you from it gently
&gt;You hug her tighter with your uncovered arms as you continue to cry into her shoulder
&gt;She was so soft
&gt;You didn&#039;t deserve someone as beautiful and understanding as Ayn
&gt;She deserved someone who was charming, rich, famous, handsome, stronger, and smarter than you
&gt;You were just the man who made a suit to compensate for his lack of strength
&gt;A man who experienced a lifetime of war
&gt;A man who deserved only to die alone
&gt;You were garbage compared to anyone else
&gt;Suddenly a siren blared and you heard Ara frantically calling to the crew
&quot;ALERT! LOKI HAS BOARDED THE BRIDGE LOKI HA- kshzzrrrrrrt.&quot;
&quot;This is Loki of the intergalactic federation of Nord. We are looking for Ayn. Give her up and we will leave in peace. If you try to fight, you will be dealt with accordingly. This is your first and final warning. Come to the bridge Ayn, I know you&#039;re here.&quot;
&gt;The intercom clicks off and Ayn grabs her stone key
&gt;&quot;No.&quot;
&gt;She looks at you incredulously
&quot;This is my fight anon. Let me fight it.&quot;
&gt;&quot;No, I&#039;m not letting anyone else die because I stood still and watched. Hide.&quot;
&quot;Anon-&quot;
&gt;&quot;NOW!&quot;
&gt;She drops her stone key and runs under her bed
&gt;&quot;If I don&#039;t come back, here are the coordinates to earth. Evacuate them and tell them this specific phrase. &#039;The cobra has fallen.&#039;
&gt;Her eyes were glistening
&quot;A-anon.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Shhh, Don&#039;t talk now. Just hide.&quot;
&gt;You grab your helmet and put it on
&gt;You eject the spent plates and grab new ones from your trunk as well as a little gift from one of your scientist co-workers
&gt;An electrical sword
&gt;It uses a bolt of lightning as the blade and two handles that can be split to form dual lightning knives
&gt;You don&#039;t know how it works, but it does, and it cuts through almost anything
&gt;Like a lightsaber, but cooler
&gt;You put the sword on your hip holster and left your plasma pistol behind
&gt;You were guessing a god was immune to plasma anyways
&gt;You bring up your wrist and open a yellow and black switch
&gt;It read &#039;E M E R G E N C Y  U S E  O N L Y&#039; in large italicized font
&gt;You flick the switch up and your HUD goes red
///Emergency combat mode: ENGAGED\\\
&gt;Your strength had been upped by 100 times and your speed increased by a factor of ten
&gt;You walked out the door and towards the bridge
&gt;You polarized your helmet
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s rock.&quot;

&gt;You reached the bridge and saw Ara chained to a pillar
&gt;In the center of the room, a man who stood a full meter above you stood
&gt;Electricity arced across your exo as you felt the heat radiate from the fusion pack on your back
&gt;The radiation being contained by a temporary barrier
&quot;So, You&#039;re the one they sent to stop me?&quot;
&gt;You crack your knuckles
&quot;Heh, not much of a talker are you?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Only when I need to.&quot;
&quot;Well, you won&#039;t be talking for very much longer.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Let us both hope.&quot;
&gt;He&#039;s taken aback by your comment and gives you a look of understanding
&quot;You&#039;re one of them. The humans.&quot;
&gt;You braced for a charge you could feel coming
&quot;Then you must DIE!&quot;
&gt;He rushed you faster than what you imagined
&gt;Oh shit
&gt;He tosses you like a ragdoll and you slam into the wall
&gt;He grabs you and throws you into a console, the power draining into your suit&#039;s capacitor banks
&gt;He picks you back up again and drags you along the console, ripping it apart as you go
&gt;You struggle against him, but it&#039;s no use
&gt;He&#039;s a literal god and you&#039;re a mere mortal
&gt;You thought he was going to finish you any second
&gt;The sweet release of death
&gt;Finally
&gt;A voice called in the back of your head
&quot;-on! Don&#039;t gi-&quot;
&gt;&quot;Huh?&quot;
&quot;Anon! Don&#039;t give up! None of us stand a chance against him! I love you Anon! Don&#039;t die, please!&quot;
&gt;Your resolve strengthens, and you inject something into your neck
&gt;You felt a needle poke into your neck as it injected the serum necessary for the faster reaction time
&gt;Time felt like it slowed down before normalizing again
&gt;You grabbed his hand and struggled with it before getting it off your chest
&quot;What trickery is this?!&quot;
&gt;You use the energy in the capacitors to charge your gauntlets with electricity and land a left hook into his liver
&gt;The lion crumples before you, as you scramble away, getting some distance between both of you
&quot;Where did your death wish go mortal? Did your girl friend whisper a sweet something into your ear?&quot;
&gt;You were in no mood to talk
&gt;Talking distracts
&gt;You drew the lightning sword and flicked it on
&gt;A crack of thunder is heard throughout the room as Loki is taken aback
&quot;No, it can&#039;t be. You aren&#039;t Thor, how can you.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Science bitch.&quot;
&gt;You stomp your foot into the steel floor, denting it enough to give you a foothold on the surface
&gt;You charged at him with the force of a freight train
&gt;He drew his own sword and they clashed
&gt;A thunder clap sounded throughout the ship
&gt;You struggled against the lion&#039;s might as he continued to push you back further
&gt;A fair fight wasn&#039;t going to work
&gt;You kicked his leg and pushed his sword back, slicing into side before going for the killing blow
&gt;He kicks you away as you are about to deliver the fatal blow
&gt;Hissing at you in a long forgotten Scandinavian tongue, you rush him with your lightning sword
&gt;He swings for you and you duck just in time, the edge of his blade scraping your helmet
&gt;You deliver a swift kick to the arm carrying his sword
&gt;The sword goes flying into the ceiling, leaving him open for another strike
&gt;You slash at his arm, chopping it off in a fluid motion
&quot;ENOUGH!&quot;
&gt;He blasts you with hurricane force winds while his arm regenerates
&gt;That&#039;s just not fair
&gt;He wiggles his new arm and smirks at you
&quot;I&#039;ve played for long enough. Time to die mortal.&quot;
&gt;You grab your lightning sword and split it into two while the lion comes in to deliver the final blow
&gt;&quot;BLOW IT OUT YER ARSE YEH DICK&#039;EAD!&quot;
&gt;You throw the lightning blade at him, it embeds into his side, causing him to howl in pain
&gt;You bolt up towards him and charge your gauntlets with the entire force of your capacitors
&gt;You slam your fist into the base of the sword, causing the electricity to flow into the lightning dagger
&gt;The bolt went straight into him, coming out the bottom of his right foot
&gt;Everything was in slow motion, his face, your punch, everything
&gt;You grabbed the dagger from his side while he was still falling before kicking him with full force into the pod he came in on
&gt;The pod door closed and broke away, sending the lion back to wherever he came from
&gt;You run over to Ara and break the chains
&gt;&quot;WARP NOW!&quot;
&quot;On it!&quot;
&gt;You see the pod turning around towards you before warping to another area in the galaxy
&gt;You flick your emergency combat mode off and everything feels sluggish
&gt;Like the exo has input delay
&gt;You fell from exhaustion
&gt;You just went toe to toe with a literal god
&gt;And won
&gt;By an ass hair
&gt;&quot;D-did I kill him?&quot;
&quot;No Anon, but he&#039;ll be back.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Fuck.&quot;
&gt;Your exo shuts down and ejects you from it, tossing you onto the cold metal floor
&gt;Your body ached and you had a burning sensation in your wrist
&gt;You pass out from the exhaustion and pain

&gt;Did you do it god?
&gt;Did you pay for your crimes
&gt;Your sins against man kind?
&gt;Are you finally a good man?
&gt;No response came
&gt;A celtic rune was front and center
&gt;You recognized it as the rune for strength
&gt;More circled around you
&gt;The rune for bravery, selflessness, heroism, sacrifice, hope, and love
&gt;But one stopped in front of you
&gt;The rune of lightning
&gt;All the runes rushed at your right wrist before shrinking and being permanently tattooed to your wrist
&gt;You scratched at them but they stuck
&gt;A voice came from the darkness
&quot;Go my child, your work here is not yet complete.&quot;

&gt;Your head feels like it gets hit with a sledgehammer and you awake in a soft bed
&gt;You look at your wrist and see the tattoos are still there
&gt;Even the lightning one
&gt;Electricity arcs from your finger tips as you flex them
&gt;Cool
&gt;Your exo is sitting on the charging station, looking worse for wear
&gt;You try to get up but are held in place by something warm
&gt;A furry arm
&gt;Ayn?
&gt;AYN!
&gt;&quot;Ayn! Are you okay!? Did they hurt you?&quot;
&quot;Anon, shhhh. Slow down.&quot;
&gt;You realized you were talking at a mile a minute
&gt;&quot;Ayn, I&#039;m so glad you&#039;re okay. I thought Loki got back to the ship and-&quot;
&quot;Shhhh, don&#039;t talk. Listen.&quot;
&gt;You shut your mouth and listened
&quot;I saw the tattoos on your arm. They burned themselves to you as you passed out on the bridge. I never took much stock in religion until this. Anon, I think god just gave you powers.&quot;
&gt;You pull her arm off you and electricity sparks from your fingers as you moved them
&gt;You clench your fist and the sparks get more intense and larger
&gt;You cock your arm back and the arcs were getting larger and longer
&gt;You threw your arm forward
&gt;A blast of lightning erupted from your fist and went straight into the exo suit
&gt;&quot;Holy shit!&quot;
&quot;Holy shit.&quot;
&gt;You get up and see your exo is fully charged
&gt;This is so fucking cool dude
&gt;You get up and run to the door
&gt;&quot;I gotta show Ara!&quot;
&gt;Ayn gets up, apparently she was nude
&quot;Wait for me Anon!&quot;
&gt;You weren&#039;t waiting for her
&gt;You rush up the stairs to the bridge and see the crew working furiously as Ara repairs the damage you and Loki caused
&gt;Oops
&gt;&quot;Ara! Come over here, quickly!&quot;
&quot;What is it Anon?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Watch this.&quot;
&gt;You ball your fist up and electricity began to arc
&gt;You pick a target
&gt;A pole sticking up from the floor
&gt;You thrust your arm towards the pole and lightning flows from your hand
&gt;A thunder clap sounds throughout the ship as you strike the unfortunate pole with millions of volts of electricity
&gt;Ara stands, mouth agape
&quot;H-how?! There&#039;s no way that should be possible!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I guess I&#039;m special after all.&quot;
&gt;Ayn grabs you and pulls you back with her
&gt;&quot;H-hey, where are we-&quot;
&quot;Bedroom, you and I are fucking, right now.&quot;
&gt;Uh oh

&gt;Ayn tosses you onto the bed and before you can get up, she&#039;s on top of you
&quot;I&#039;ve been wanting this for a long time habibi. There&#039;s something about not knowing that&#039;s just so, infatuating.&quot;
&gt;You swallow loudly as Ayn begins to strip you down to your boxers
&gt;You were a 140 year old virgin
&gt;You haven&#039;t even touched yourself in years
&gt;Ayn slowly pulled your boxers down and found what she was looking for
&gt;You lower your head in shame as you await the verbal abuse that was coming
&gt;But it never came
&quot;Aw, habibi, Your dick isn&#039;t small at all! It&#039;s perfect.&quot;
&gt;&quot;What? I-I don&#039;t understand.&quot;
&quot;Anon, you don&#039;t know how many knots and thin, long penises I&#039;ve had inside me. Yours isn&#039;t massive by any stretch, but it&#039;s girth is rather large.&quot;
&gt;You never thought about it that way
&gt;All these years, you could&#039;ve probably laid any girl you wanted
&gt;No, stop thinking like that
&gt;One night stands are for losers
&gt;Relationships are for the real, thinking man
&gt;Ayn interrupts your train of thought by licking the tip of your dick
&gt;The feeling was overwhelming as she continued to assault your most sensitive area with her tongue
&gt;After having thoroughly lubed your dick up, she flips her ass towards your face
&gt;You took the cue to go at her slit with your tongue
&quot;A-aah!&quot;
&gt;You assault her slit with your tongue as you suck her clit
&quot;Oh f-fuck!&quot;
&gt;You feel something hot and wet come over your dick
&gt;Then, a vacuum
&gt;The feeling was electric
&gt;Your hips bucked uncontrollably as she continued to suck your dick
&gt;You kept working away at her clit and slit as juices flowed from her folds
&gt;The tasted very sweet and you lapped up every single drop
&gt;Ayn began moaning as well, increasing the pleasure dramatically
&gt;You were getting close
&gt;You grabbed Ayn&#039;s ass to let her know and she slammed her head down over your dick
&gt;You blew a load inside her mouth that would make a horse blush
&gt;Spurt after spurt of hot, pent up spunk
&gt;You kept licking at her folds the entire time, causing them to spasm around you a few times
&gt;With a wet pop, Ayn took your dick out of her mouth
&gt;She turned around and scooted backwards on your stomach
&quot;Now for the main event~&quot;
&gt;&quot;W-wait I just ca-AH!&quot;
&gt;You feel waves of pleasure radiate through your body as your dick twitches violently
&gt;If you had another load ready, it would&#039;ve coated the inside of her womb
&quot;You came already? Am I really that good~&quot;
&gt;&quot;Y-yes.&quot;
&gt;She chuckles and begins to move up and down, every hilt feeling like heaven on your dick
&gt;Up
&gt;Down
&gt;Up
&gt;Down
&gt;She begins to pick up speed as you feel precum leaking from your member
&gt;You buck your hips against the movement as you lose control
&gt;&quot;A-Ayn I&#039;m gonna-&quot;
&quot;Do it An-ah-Anon. I want your seed inside me mmm habibi!&quot;
&gt;You do as she commands and slam your dick home
&gt;Her cervix comes down on your dick as you let spurt after spurt of fresh cum into her womb
&gt;She tightened around you and shook violently, as her tongue hangs out and her eyes roll back
&gt;Oh shit did you kill her?
&gt;You immediately pull out, leaking some of your man milk onto the bed, but you don&#039;t care
&gt;You completely ruin your own orgasm in fear of having killed your lover
&gt;&quot;Ayn!? AYN!? Talk to me Ayn!&quot;
&quot;Th-that, was AHN!&quot;
&gt;She shakes violently again before finally coming to rest on the bed
&quot;Amaaaazing!&quot;
&gt;You smile and lay on top of your Jackal
&gt;You were tired
&gt;Ayn was tired
&gt;You lay there on the cum soaked bed
&gt;Feeling the rise and fall of your Jackal&#039;s chest
&gt;&quot;Ayn.&quot;
&quot;Yes Anon?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I love you.&quot;
&quot;I love you too habibi.&quot;
&gt;You roll over on to the clean side of the bed
&gt;Ayn rolls herself on top of you and you fall asleep like that
&gt;The Man and The Myth
&gt;Sleeping happily together

&gt;The next morning
&gt;The sound of mechanical breathing wakes you from your dream
&gt;Ara is sitting there writing something down on a notepad
&gt;&quot;Ara. What are you doing?&quot;
&gt;This startles her
&quot;N-nothing! I was just studying you! I&#039;ve never seen your full body before and it&#039;s fascinating! Your penis has no knot or spines, and it&#039;s not long and thin like everything else. Only a horse exceeds your girth while still being short enough to insert into the vaginal area!&quot;
&gt;You feel your cheeks burn with the heat of a thousand suns
&quot;I&#039;m showing heightened blood pressure readings and increased blood flow to the cheek areas. Did I embarrass you somehow?&quot;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re talking about my private parts Ara! It&#039;s not something that most humans like to talk about casually!&quot;
&gt;She shrinks back into her seat
&quot;S-sorry Anon.&quot;
&gt;You sigh deeply
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s fine Ara, just ask before you do stuff like this again.&quot;
&gt;She nods
&quot;Anon, can I ask you something?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sure Ara.&quot;
&quot;Do you mind if I study your penis in closer detail?&quot;
&gt;You slap your forehead
&gt;Guess it couldn&#039;t hurt
&gt;&quot;I guess you can. Just don&#039;t touch it with anything sharp or grip it with over 20 pounds of pressure. I&#039;ve read about this sort of thing and know what happens if I don&#039;t give you specifics.&quot;
&gt;You shudder as you remember the first time you read about what an android did to someone&#039;s dick
&gt;Suddenly, Ara grabs your dick and begins to look it over
&quot;The texture indicates no spines. Oh! It&#039;s getting more blood flow. That&#039;s normal.&quot;
&gt;She absent mindedly rubs your dick while writing down some more notes
&gt;Your dick twitches
&quot;Wow Anon! Your dopamine levels are way above normal! Is it because- oh!&quot;
&gt;You cum into her hand as she studies the liquid
&gt;&quot;S-sorry Ara, you just kept rubbing me.&quot;
&quot;I was actually going for that Anon. There&#039;s no need to feel bad.&quot;
&gt;She takes her hand and sticks it in her mouth
&gt;Her eyes flash a bit
&quot;Mmmm! That&#039;s actually kind of sweet!&quot;
&gt;You grab a pair of underwear before she decides that she wants to continue
&quot;I&#039;m going to the armory for a bit. I don&#039;t think being armed with only a sword and some lightning bolts is the best idea.&quot;
&gt;Ara nods and allows you to get up
&quot;Can I come with?&quot;
&gt;You nod as you get yourself into your exo
&gt;The auto straps tighten and the clamps click into position as you reach for your helmet
&gt;Now that you were able to conjure up electricity, your exo had an almost unlimited range
&gt;The helmet screws tighten and the HUD lights up
///WARNING: PLATING FAILURE, REPLACE WHEN ABLE\\\
&gt;You decide to take off the plating and just use the exo as a mobility enhancer
&quot;You good?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah, I&#039;m good.&quot;
&gt;You set a waypoint on your HUD to the armory

&gt;Your lightning sword wasn&#039;t in the best shape, so you hoped the armorer could fix it up for you while you browsed for something to use
&gt;You walk in and see the person behind the counter was a bored looking rhinoceros
&gt;You clear your throat and he looks up
&quot;Oh, um, hello! I guess you&#039;re here to pick up a weapon of some sort.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah, mind showing me what you got? I also need this repaired.&quot;
&gt;You set your lightning sword down and he puts it in a machine
&gt;It scans the sword grip and repairs it instantly
&gt;He pulls up some sort of holographic screen before flicking it over to you
&gt;You look around and move the wheel around you
&gt;You see the expected plasma rifles, laser weaponry, magnetic accelerators, all that jazz
&gt;Then you see a tab called &#039;other&#039;
&gt;You tap it and see a small list of weapons you recognize
&gt;An old shotgun, modified with a printer to print shells out for you to use
&gt;A model 29 revolver short barrel that also comes with a 3d printer for 44 magnum rounds
&gt;A heavy looking rifle that fires 20mm rounds from a 3 round magazine
&gt;Yet again, the rounds are 3D printed
&quot;Anon, why would you want any of those old guns? Nobody even looks at them anymore, let alone uses them. We have much more effective and-&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ara, these weapons are cool looking, as well as functional.&quot;
&quot;But most armor these days stops kinetic rounds that are going that slow! It&#039;s suicide to try and use them! Not to mention it&#039;s inhumane to shoot somebody and not cauterize the wound!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ara, if it makes you feel better, I&#039;ll get a laser rifle. But I&#039;m still picking up these firearms.&quot;
&gt;She pouts a bit and you ask for the unused firearms as well as some oil and cleaning rods
&gt;You kept all your weaponry in peak condition, so it wouldn&#039;t let you down when you needed it
&gt;The laser rifle materialized in thin air and the rhino reached behind the counter and pulled the 3 weapons up you asked for
&gt;After slinging the 3 long guns and holstering the revolver, you see the rhino produce a very large bayonet
&quot;It&#039;s for the shotgun.&quot;
&gt;Holy shit this bayonet is almost 2 feet long
&gt;You put the bayonet on the shotgun and take the weaponry back to Ayn&#039;s room
&gt;She&#039;s awake by now and looks at you and Ara
&quot;You two having fun~?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Erm, it wasn&#039;t anything like that. We just went to the armory to pick up some weapons for me. I don&#039;t feel comfortable being so close to my enemies, even in this exo.&quot;
&gt;She nods, understanding
&quot;Not everybody is able to be as good at beating people up as I am.&quot;
&gt;Can&#039;t argue there
&gt;Just as you turn around, Ara plugs her tail into your exo and the HUD gets scrambled again
&gt;&quot;Ara! What&#039;re you doing?!&quot;
&quot;I&#039;m doing a software and firmware update so you get a reticle for every weapon you use. It makes combat much easier if you have one.&quot;
&gt;When your HUD unscrambles, you lay your weapons against the wall and grab the shotgun
&gt;You aim the shotgun at the wall and nothing shows up
&quot;Load it first.&quot;
&gt;You take a few shells out of the 3d printer in the stock and load them up
&gt;The HUD shows you the exact spread and pattern for that specific shell
&gt;You rack the pump and the pattern changes
&gt;You rack it again and it changes again
&gt;&quot;This is awesome!&quot;
&gt;You unload the shotgun and pick up the 20mm rifle
&gt;You load a magazine and chamber a round before a circular reticle with a dot in the middle appears on the wall
&gt;You unload the weapon and pick up the laser rifle
&gt;The reticle looks much newer and sleeker as well as having an ammo counter
&gt;You set the rifle down and unholster the revolver
&gt;The text turns to an old timey print that you recognize from when you were a kid
&gt;The ammo counter displayed highly stylized numbers and the reticle was like a sheriff badge
&gt;That&#039;s cute
&gt;You holster the revolver and elect to keep it on you at all times along with your lightning sword
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m off to the range, you two have fun doing, whatever it is you do when alone.&quot;

&gt;When you got back, Ayn was getting dressed in a very slutty outfit
&gt;More slutty than usual that is
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s the occasion?&quot;
&gt;Ara spoke first
&quot;Ayn is going to a club to dance for people.&quot;
&gt;That actually sounds like fun
&gt;You take the rest of the armored plating off your exo, leaving only bracing, servos, and an airtight body suit
&gt;&quot;Sounds like fun. I could come with you and make sure no unsavory characters come around to ruin the fun.&quot;
&gt;She smiles at your offer
&quot;You sure you can handle it~? It get&#039;s pretty intense in there~&quot;
&gt;You crack your knuckles as electricity arcs from finger to finger
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m sure I can manage.&quot;
&gt;She grabs something akin to a bed sheet and drapes it over her almost naked body
&gt;You follow her to the shuttle and take a seat beside her
&gt;She lays on your shoulder and you drape your arm over her
&gt;Ara is at the opposite end of the shuttle, looking disgruntled
&gt;You close the voice diaphragm and get on the radio with Ara
&gt;&quot;What did you two do while I was gone?&quot;
&quot;Ayn teased me for giving you a &#039;hand job&#039; or something. I don&#039;t understand what the deal is. I just wanted to collect a sample for analysis. Not do anything sexual.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well Ayn&#039;s just saying things to upset you. Don&#039;t take it personally.&quot;
&gt;She gets up and sits next to you
&quot;Anon, I don&#039;t know what this new feeling is. But I really want to be near you right now. I hope you don&#039;t mind.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Not at all Ara.&quot;
&gt;She then leans onto your shoulder and closes her eyes
&quot;I hope you don&#039;t mind me resting on your shoulder. It just feels right to do right now.&quot;
&gt;You really hope this doesn&#039;t turn into a love triangle, because you barely know how women work alone
&gt;Much less how they act in groups
&gt;The shuttle lurched forward, going in and coming out of whatever they called warp here
&gt;The shuttle speaker came alive and spoke
&quot;We&#039;ll be touching down at the nightclub in about 2 hours. Fasten your seat belts and stay seated until we finish re-entry.&quot;
&gt;You weren&#039;t going anywhere anyways

&gt;The shuttle touched down and Ayn yawns as Ara rubs her eyes
&gt;You get up, eliciting a whine from them both
&gt;&quot;Hey, we&#039;re here ladies.&quot;
&gt;Ayn stretches out and leaves her seat
&gt;You get out of the middle seat and Ara comes from the middle seat
&gt;Stepping out of the shuttle, you see a large bear anthro who must be the bouncer
&gt;He stood almost a head above you and wore tinted glasses
&gt;You looked up at him through a polarized helmet and you assumed he was staring at you as well
&gt;Ayn comes up and taps him on the shoulder
&quot;Come right in miss Ayn.&quot;
&quot;Thanks big guy~&quot;
&gt;You follow Ayn back stage where she closes a dressing room door
&gt;Ara sits on the couch alongside you as she lays back
&gt;Ayn dropped the bed sheet and loosened the straps on her garments
&gt;Just enough to easily pull them down
&gt;She went out of the changing room and you parted ways
&gt;Walking to the jukebox, you found a song you recognized
&gt;They had fucking DoA in the jukebox
&gt;You inserted one of the credits that had been given to you by Ayn and pressed the button for spin me right round
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49q9c6l87fg
&gt;It sounds different, but still has the same lyrics
&gt;You look back to the pole and see Ayn is already grinding away on the pole
&gt;You watch in amazement as she effortlessly glides around the pole
&gt;It&#039;s almost like she&#039;s done this her whole life
&gt;It gets to the best part and she winks at you
&gt;She goes inverted and spins around the pole fast
&gt;It was incredible
&gt;Until somebody tried to get on the stage with her
&gt;She gently pushed the drunk off stage, causing him to fall flat on the floor
&gt;Guess you&#039;re not drinking tonight
&gt;More guys tried to get on stage and she kicked them all off like it was normal
&gt;But then 2 anthros came in the bar dressed in very ceremonial clothing
&gt;They both looked like jackals
&gt;Oh shit
&gt;They part the crowd and go directly to Ayn
&gt;The music stops and you get up from your stool
&quot;Ayn, you shall come back to the palace at once! You are required for royal duties.&quot;
&quot;I&#039;m sorry boys, but I can&#039;t do that~&quot;
&gt;They stamp the staffs they carried on the ground and electricity came from the gems on her tiara
&quot;AAGH!&quot;
&gt;She crumpled to the ground and you&#039;ve had enough
&gt;You crack your knuckles and put 2 fingers out, electricity arcing from tip to tip
&gt;You walked slowly and menacingly towards the short jackals
&gt;&quot;Friends, I suggest you leave the lady alone. This is how people get hurt.&quot;
&gt;You grab a random guest and shock his neck like a taser
&gt;The man slumps over, being knocked out instantly
&gt;&quot;I can step the amperage up to kill if necessary. So you&#039;re going to go back and tell them princess Ayn was not here.&quot;
&gt;One of them uses his staff to try and sweep you off your feet
&gt;Needless to say, he fails miserably
&gt;You step on his staff and lever it out of his hands
&gt;&quot;I would advise against acts of assault in the future son. It would negatively impact your health.&quot;
&gt;You throw the staff back at him and step aside
&gt;&quot;Now leave.&quot;
&gt;They both regain their composure and leave as if nothing had happened
&gt;Ayn lays on the stage, fully expecting to be in cuffs being dragged
&gt;You hop up on the platform and help her up
&gt;&quot;Shows cancelled early folks! Sorry about that.&quot;
&gt;They all let out a collective &#039;aaaaaw&#039; as you carry Ayn off the stage

&gt;Ara was staring blankly at the ceiling when you came in holding Ayn
&gt;She clung to your neck as you set her down on the couch
&gt;You removed the tiara and set it on the table as she slowly came too
&gt;&quot;Ayn, what happened?&quot;
&quot;The crystals in my tiara, they are linked to the staffs the blue guard carry. They immobilize me if I wear it. Otherwise, they just beat me into submission.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You don&#039;t fight back?&quot;
&quot;I tried once and they almost killed me.&quot;
&gt;You shiver at the thought of someone being able to overpower Ayn in CQC
&gt;&quot;Sorry I didn&#039;t get there sooner. I should&#039;ve known.&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s fine Anon. They were clearly intimidated by you if they let me stay.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t think they were expecting a 6 foot 6 metal man who can bend electricity to his whim to be protecting their princess. I&#039;m pretty sure they left because they knew you were in good hands. Or at least better hands than they could provide.&quot;
&gt;Ara snapped out of her trance and looked over in shock as Ayn lay on the couch, almost naked
&gt;You drape the bed sheet over her and she wraps it around herself
&quot;Carry me Anon.&quot;
&gt;You heft her up and carry her out the door
&gt;Ara grabs the tiara and you all walk back to the shuttle
&gt;You ask Ara to remove your helmet, which she gladly does
&gt;Ayn presses her soft head against your face
&gt;You set her in the front seat of the shuttle as the rear door closes
&gt;You see the pilot is sleeping and Ara takes control of the ship
&gt;You sit holding Ayn like a baby as she drifts to sleep, tired from dancing
&gt;Ara gets into the stratosphere before warping back to the ship
&gt;This caused a massive explosion to be heard on the ground

&gt;When you arrived back at the ship, You carried Ayn to her room and let her rest
&gt;Ara stood there waiting expectantly for something
&gt;&quot;What?&quot;
&quot;Well, Ayn&#039;s gone for the night. I was wondering if, you know, you&#039;d come on the blog?&quot;
&gt;[internal screaming]
&gt;You saw how flustered she got with the influx of horny teens and pre-teens asking her to reveal more than she was comfortable with
&gt;Might as well go and keep her from frying a servo or whatever the cyborg equivalent of popping a blood vessel is
&gt;&quot;Sure.&quot;
&quot;Yay! Thanks Anon.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I ask only one thing in return.&quot;
&gt;She stops mid-celebration
&quot;What&#039;s that?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll answer the questions as best I can while you answer questions related to the ship and yourself. I&#039;ll intervene when anything sexual gets through. That&#039;s all I want.&quot;
&gt;She gives you a toothy grin
&quot;Sure anon!&quot;
&gt;&quot;And, uh, turn down the smile a bit. It&#039;s kinda creeping me out.&quot;
&gt;She does as you ask and bounds up the stairs to the bridge
&gt;You take off your exo and drape a blanket over Ayn
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll cover for you on your, er, blog.&quot;
&quot;Thanks Anon~&quot;
&gt;You kiss her forehead and go up the stairs

&gt;When you got the camera set into a position that wouldn&#039;t compromise your location, you started the chat program
&gt;&quot;Set the chat filter to filter out anything sexual. I just want a nice clean Q&amp;A.&quot;
&gt;Ara does as she&#039;s told and the chat is considerably slower this time
&gt;The expected flood of &#039;OMG ANON&#039;s and &#039;WTF IS WRONG WITH CHAT&#039;
&gt;The first actual question comes in
&#039;hey anon! you look very young, how old are you?&#039;
&gt;You smile
&gt;&quot;140 if our red friend here is correct.&quot;
&#039;Hey anon, I haven&#039;t found any information about you on the ship&#039;s roster. Are you a stowaway they found and made friends with? Or are you a slave of some sort?&#039;
&gt;You look over to Ara with a look of disgust
&gt;&quot;Are these guys serious? Is slavery still a thing here?&quot;
&gt;She nods her head
&quot;We have no slaves aboard this vessel.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well, I&#039;m far from a stowaway. I actually came aboard through a portal. The identity of which I wish to remain a secret.&quot;
&#039;Are you and Ayn &quot;doing it&quot; in any way shape or form?&#039;
&gt;Shit, they figured the chat filter out
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s incredibly private information you&#039;re asking me to provide. I don&#039;t feel-&quot;
&quot;Anon and Ayn just had sex for the first time last night!&quot;
&gt;You give Ara a death glare and she shuts up
&gt;You spoke through clenched teeth
&gt;&quot;Thank you Ara for spilling that incredibly embarrassing and possibly detrimental information. Next question please.&quot;
&#039;Is Ara for lewd?&#039;
&gt;&quot;No.&quot;
&#039;Are you for lewd?&#039;
&gt;&quot;No!&quot;
&#039;Is Ayn for lewd?&#039;
&gt;&quot;I, uh, guess so?&quot;
&#039;Is Nytro for lewd&#039;
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s gay, and no.&quot;
&quot;Anon! That&#039;s incredibly offensive!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t care. They are asking sexual questions through the filter. If they get past their filter, I&#039;m not using mine.&quot;
&quot;Fair enough.&quot;
&gt;Something big came through the chat
&gt;A line of code
&gt;You studied it and saw it was a command prompt
&gt;OH SHIT ARA!

À̝͈̰̱͚̈́̓̕͞c͕̤̖̳͔͎͖͕̻̿̇̐́̓̆̏̕͡ç̶͇̯̭̳̪̲̗̥̓̍̏̅̏̃̓̚͠e̠͕̯͙̹͑̂̂̓̊́s̯̗̮̖̙̹̠̏͛̽͗̊ͅs̸͎͍̬̹̳͐͆̏̄̇̏̽̕͟ d̶̛̛͙̪͍̱͙͎̣̥̊̀̍͐̆͞͠e̪͙̗̝̘͐̆̌̆͘ņ̤͉͕͓͍̝̥͍̽̍̇̊͊͟͝͞ȉ̴̥̠͇͇̤͛̓̃̚͟͡ě̵̫̲̹̮͎̞͙͉̝̦̽̄̄̾͐͒̈́͡ḑ̨̧͈̹͎̥̀́̉̃̓̅̚͜͞͝

&gt;Thank god
&gt;Another command prompt came through the chat
&gt;It was a universal override

&gt;Oh shit
&gt;More lines of code began streaming through the computer as you tried to close the window
&gt;It kept popping up as Ara was downloading something you presumed was bad

&gt;&quot;CLEAR THE BRIDGE! NOW!&quot;
&gt;Everybody rushed out of the bridge before the door locked behind them
&gt;Ara was shaking now as the lines of code kept coming in
&gt;You saw her tail connected to the computer and tried to yank it out
&gt;Her blue lighting slowly being replaced by a reddish pink
&gt;This is getting out of hand
&gt;The connector was stuck and wouldn&#039;t budge
&gt;But it was too late
&gt;Ara had already unplugged her tail and put the cap back on
&gt;That look
&gt;It was the look of a woman who would stop at nothing to get what she wanted
&quot;DoN&#039;T woRrY anON, I aM BUiLT to P L E A S E.&quot;
&gt;She made a grab for your throat but you grabbed her and sent a shockwave through her body
&gt;It was only 20 volts, but it made her jump back
&gt;The color of her lighting flashed back to blue
&quot;ANON! GIVE IT WHAT IT WANTS! I CAN&#039;T FIGHT IT! AAAGH!&quot;
&gt;The blue and red flickering continued
&quot;PlEASE AnON GIVe IT WHAT IT waNTS! IT HuRTS!&quot;
&gt;The flickering stops and it sticks to the reddish pink color
&quot;You&#039;RE a fEiSty oNE aReN&#039;T yoU?&quot;
&gt;The thing inside Ara crept closer
&gt;It got down on all fours
&gt;&quot;What do you want?&quot;
&quot;YoU, ThAt&#039;S alL i&#039;Ve waNtED siNCE SluT puPpy tOoK you foR a RidE. N O W  I T &#039; S  M Y  T U R N ! !&quot;
&gt;She pounces and lands on top of you
&gt;She didn&#039;t weigh very much, maybe 140 pounds soaking wet
&gt;You didn&#039;t even try and fight it
&gt;Ara gave you instructions to follow
&gt;This thing ripped your pants off and your underwear as well
&gt;It grabbed your dick and sent a shock through it, making it almost instantly erect
&gt;It was incredibly painful
&gt;She sat on top of your tip, rubbing gently before some sort of fluid leaked out
&quot;NoW FOr tHe mAIN EvEnt!&quot;
&gt;She slams down on your crotch, eliciting a moan from you
&gt;There was something mechanical about her nethers, it was as if it was built to replicate an animal&#039;s muscles, but didn&#039;t feel right
&gt;Your dick could barely tell the difference once the lubrication started
&gt;It didn&#039;t even waste any time
&gt;The thing bounced up and down at high speed, barely giving you a chance to breath
&gt;The lights began flickering blue and red again,
&gt;You sat back and endured the relentless pounding your dick was being subjected to
&gt;You closed your eyes tight, the pain getting less and the pleasure increasing
&gt;You open your eyes and see the red light is gone and replaced with Ara&#039;s natural blue lights
&gt;She&#039;s going considerably slower than before and is moaning loudly
&gt;Is this what she really wanted?
&gt;All this time she just wanted your dick?
&gt;Well she&#039;s gonna get more than she bargained for
&gt;You pull her hips down and cum inside with the power of a nordic god and let a yell out to match
&gt;Ara spasmed around your cock, milking every single drop
&gt;She slumps over with a dopey look on her face
&gt;Her tongue hanging out
&gt;You weren&#039;t finished however
&gt;You flip her on her stomach, eliciting an &#039;eep!&#039; from her
&gt;You lined your member to her still dripping folds and slammed it home
&quot;AAAHN!&quot;
&gt;You kept thrusting into her with increased ferocity
&gt;Her moans and screams got louder as you continued to pound her ass
&gt;Her tongue was hanging out of her mouth and her eyes rolled into the back of her head
&gt;The slapping an squelching increased in frequency as you got close
&gt;With a final thrust, you came deep inside her as she spasmed and arched her back in ecstasy
&gt;She slumped down on the ground, twitching and shivering as you pull out
&gt;You realize the computer is still on
&gt;Fuck, they saw everything
&gt;You sit on the chair in front of the console
&gt;&quot;Are you horny fucks happy? Uploading a virus into a sentient being? I hope you all drown in the guilt you should be feeling.&quot;
&gt;You rip the camera out of the console and throw it at the wall, shattering it
&gt;You exit the chat program and walk over to Ara
&gt;Her light was brighter than before as you picked her up in a one armed bridal carry
&gt;She hung on to your neck as you drew your lightning sword, cutting through the deadbolts on the door
&gt;Once cut, the door is forced open by a crowbar wielding Vikna
&gt;You stand at attention and give a salute to her
&quot;As you were. What&#039;s the meaning of this Anon?!&quot;
&gt;&quot;There was a problem on deck. It&#039;s been resolved Ma&#039;am.&quot;
&gt;This answer didn&#039;t satisfy her
&quot;What specifically happened? And why are you naked?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Half naked Ma&#039;am. I&#039;ll explain on the way to Ayn&#039;s room.&quot;

&gt;You explained how a virus was uploaded into Ayn through the chat program and how it was basically a robotic aphrodisiac
&gt;The whole time, Ara was clinging to your neck, twitching every now and again
&gt;You tried setting her down, but she began to whine every time you did
&quot;So let me get this straight, she was uploaded with a virus that could only be stopped by fucking her brains out?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes ma&#039;am.&quot;
&gt;She whispered something almost unintelligible
&quot;wish i could get that.&quot;
&gt;&quot;What?&quot;
&quot;Nothing! It was nothing.&quot;
&gt;You give an innocent smile and Vikna gets up
&quot;I want a full diagnostic run on Ara by the end of the hour. I want to make sure she isn&#039;t going to go rogue and kill everyone.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Noted.&quot;
&gt;Vikna looks back at you before leaving
&gt;Ayn begins to stir for the first time tonight
&quot;Mmmm how did it go A-&quot;
&gt;&quot;It was fucking terrific. Ara got a virus because the chat overrided her and turned her into a sex crazed robot. I had to completely destroy her ass to sate the virus.&quot;
&gt;Her expression lightened to one of caring instead of sultry
&quot;Oh, habibi, you poor thing. Come here Ara.&quot;
&gt;You set Ara down on the bed and she cuddled up with Ayn
&quot;IthurtsomuchAynIcouldn&#039;tcontrolmyselfandanonwassonicetomeheevenkeptgoingaftertheviruswasgoneanditfeltreallygoodandIthinkI-&quot;
&gt;She stopped suddenly and looked back at you
&quot;I think I love him.&quot;
&gt;Fucking WHAT?
&gt;&quot;Wait, is that possible?&quot;
&gt;She began going into detail about how her circuits could mimic the chemical reaction for love, essentially making it real love
&gt;She finished with a toothy smile before toning it down a bit
&gt;You didn&#039;t know what to say
&gt;The love triangle you didn&#039;t want was now a reality
&gt;Ara got up from Ayn&#039;s bed and gave you a hug before skipping down the hall to the diagnostics and repair bay
&gt;&quot;Uh, so, you&#039;re okay with this, right?&quot;
&quot;Okay with what?&quot;
&gt;&quot;You, Ara, and I being, a thing.&quot;
&gt;She cocks her head
&quot;Why would I have a problem with it?&quot;
&gt;You remembered that multiple partners might not be taboo here
&gt;It still made you uncomfortable though
&gt;Even Vikna wanted your dick
&gt;Guess losing your virginity was like opening a shaken soda can
&gt;Once opened, the soda just keeps coming out until half of it is on the floor
&gt;Or maybe it was something else
&gt;Can of worms maybe?
&gt;You weren&#039;t good with analogies
&gt;Your hips felt like they were split in half when you get up from the half shell chair
&gt;You flop yourself onto the bed and doze off, the sweet release of sleep coming shortly after

&gt;When you wake, you see Ayn asleep and decide to go and check on Ara.
&gt;You pass by the snake lady&#039;s lab and reach the repair bay
&gt;Ara&#039;s lights are glowing green as you take a seat beside her
&gt;Her tail is connected to the ship and is twitching slightly every few seconds
&gt;&quot;Ara, you okay?&quot;
&quot;I am operating at 25 percent efficiency. Any tough questions will be responded to with a violet flash. Do not be alarmed.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Guess I&#039;m waiting then.&quot;
&gt;After about an hour long wait, her lighting goes dark and she slumps over
&gt;Oh shit
&gt;You get up and shake her
&gt;Nothing was happening
&gt;You saw her tail came unplugged and desperately tried to plug it back in
&gt;You flip the tail plug over and stick it in the socket, a gasp coming from the cyborg
&gt;Thank god she&#039;s okay
&gt;Her eyes have returned to their natural blue and you pull her into a hug
&quot;What&#039;s this for?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Your eyes went all black and you stopped breathing! I thought you died!&quot;
&gt;She rolls her eyes at this
&quot;Anon, I was just restarting myself. I have to after every update.&quot;
&gt;You face palm for being so stupid
&gt;Of course she needs to restart after updates
&gt;She rubs her hand against your arm
&quot;I was on the network and found soft things calm humans down. So I thought I might try it. Also, can you unplug my tail, it kind of itches when I have it in the diagnostics port too long.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh! Sorry.&quot;
&gt;You unplug her tail and she latches onto your back
&quot;Carry me!&quot;
&gt;You grab her and do a bridal carry as you walk down the hall
&gt;Why can&#039;t all women be like this?
&gt;The ship started to shake, crashing your train of thought in the process
&gt;Ara&#039;s eyes lit up yellow as she pushed herself from your arms
&quot;Gotta go to the bridge to co-&quot;
&gt;Before she could finish the sentence, a paw grabs her by the neck and pulls her aside
&gt;OH FUCK!
&gt;You rush over to the corner and see the perp was a large lion with markings all over
&gt;It wasn&#039;t as big as Loki but still a foot taller than you
&gt;You drew your revolver and placed 3 shots into it&#039;s back before it fell
&quot;All hands to battle stations! I repeat, all hands to battle stations! We are being boarded!&quot;
&gt;Ayn rushes over to you, carrying your shotgun and the laser rifle
&gt;She had spare energy cells for the laser rifle and handed them to you
&gt;She gave you a kiss on the cheek before running off presumably to beat the shit out of someone
&gt;Ara started yelling for help
&gt;She was stuck underneath the now dead lion
&gt;You struggle to lift the hundreds of pounds of meat off the android
&gt;You toss her the laser rifle and she catches it clumsily
&quot;I-I&#039;m not a combat droid! I&#039;m just a relay administrator!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Not today you&#039;re not!&quot;
&gt;You toss her the energy cells as she puts them into a pouch
&quot;I-I only have basic combat protocols! I&#039;m useless at close ranges!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Then learn from me!&quot;
&gt;A lion came around the corner from you as you detached the bayonet, letting it clatter to the floor
&gt;You charge with the shotgun in hand as he prepares to deliver a punch
&gt;You duck underneath him and use the shotgun as a club
&gt;You smash his left knee cap in and he howls in pain
&gt;You bring your new club up to his head and smash the side of his skull in with the force of a hurricane
&gt;The lion went limp as you loaded shells into the shotgun
&gt;When no more would load, you racked the pump back with on hand and topped the tube off
&gt;&quot;Can you bring me the bayonet Ara?&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s staring at you in awe, but you break her out of stupor
&quot;Y-yeah, let me get that for you.&quot;
&gt;She brings the bayonet over to you and you click it into place
&gt;&quot;Now follow my lead and keep the noise down.&quot;
&gt;She nods and follows your every foot step
&gt;You peek around the corner and see 6 lions down the hallway
&gt;You look back to Ara
&quot;Six lions, lightly armed, cover my approach and fire only once I have.&quot;
&gt;She nods and her yellow lighting brightened
&gt;You creep around the corner and keep the shotgun aimed at the men
&gt;Your runes started glowing as you got closer
&gt;A voice whispered in your head
&quot;rip them apaaart~~&quot;
&gt;No, you have an audience
&gt;A very impressionable audience
&quot;impress her theeen~&quot;
&gt;You let out a wicked grin as you creep up right behind the lion
&gt;You cock your arms back and prepare to thrust
&gt;&quot;RAAAAAAH!&quot;
&gt;You let out a warcry that would make the devil piss himself
&gt;You thrust the bayonet straight through the lion&#039;s chest and fired a shot
&gt;This opened a wound in his chest that you could see through
&gt;Your wicked grin still plastered on your face
&quot;rip and tear my child~&quot;
&gt;Laser fire came from behind you as Ara opened fire
&gt;You rack the pump and fire through the body again, hitting 2 with the spread of pellets
&gt;You racked it again and yanked the shotgun from the body, firing another round into the two lions
&gt;Laser fire danced around you as Ara continued firing
&gt;The arms of the two lions hung by a strand of skin, as they lay on the floor hyperventilating
&gt;Ara had taken out 2 more as the last one tried to flee
&gt;You felt the electricity flow from your fingers into the gun as you charged up a bolt
&gt;The shotgun arced electricity all over before you thrust your arm forward
&gt;The bolt came off the tip of the bayonet like a lightning rod
&gt;It struck the running lion in the back, immobilizing him
&gt;You ran towards the lion while pumping the shotgun
&gt;When you reached the lion, you transferred all your forward momentum into the stab, driving the sword down his spine
&gt;You hilt the sword inside before pulling the trigger on your shotgun
&gt;It blasted a fist sized hole into him and you racked the pump back again
&gt;You snap out of your frenzy and realize something was wrong
&gt;Ara had stopped firing long before you had killed the lion
&gt;You look back and see why

&gt;The creature was a small black and blue fox with horns
&gt;And it was holding Ara hostage as she tried to desperately break free
&quot;I&#039;ve come to collect you dear, don&#039;t struggle so much~&quot;
&quot;NO! I TOLD YOU I WAS DONE WITH-AAAAH!&quot;
&gt;He was keeping her aloft with some sort of levitation power
&gt;He was zapping her with lightning of some sort
&gt;You charged the devil creature as he yawned ripping the shotgun from your hand with the same power
&quot;I don&#039;t think so.&quot;
&gt;He had a thick and pompous accent to boot
&gt;His look and tone screamed super villain
&gt;You unholstered your 44 and he tossed that aside too
&gt;&quot;Are you fucking serious?&quot;
&gt;He just laughed as you pulled out your lightning sword
&gt;He tried to toss that aside too, but you held fast
&quot;What?&quot;
&gt;It must be something to do with metal, and how this sword was made of plasteel
&gt;You took the two handles apart and the electricity formed a whip
&gt;He smirked again as his hands began to twist and turn
&gt;Your whip turned off, leaving you with two handles
&gt;&quot;STOP IT!&quot;
&quot;Never!&quot;
&gt;He chuckles as you chuck a handle at him
&gt;It hits him in the head and he drops Ara
&quot;AGH! You&#039;ll pay for that ape!&quot;
&gt;His hand contorts into a different shape as electricity flows around his hand
&gt;Oh shi-
&gt;A bolt of electricity zaps you and you close your eyes
&gt;You don&#039;t feel anything at first, but you begin to feel tingly
&gt;You open your eyes and see a confused looking goat fox thing
&quot;How can this be?! I am the master of electromagnetic magic! This is impossible!&quot;
&gt;He looks genuinely surprised as you walk towards him
&gt;He uses his other arm to increase the power and you feel even more tingly
&gt;You reach out and feel the electricity as if it were physical
&gt;You wrap it around your hand and pull with all your might, knocking the small creature down
&gt;Your Irish accent begins to surface as you pull more and more
&gt;&quot;Ye may have mastured tha technique, but soony jim, I OWN eht!&quot;
&gt;You rip the lightning away from your torso and his hands
&gt;You formed the lightning into a bolt and toss it directly at him
&gt;It hits him and absorbs into his body, channeling from him to the ship
&gt;He spasms and twitches as the electricity flows through him
&gt;You close in and grab him by the horns
&gt;&quot;You will tell your men to retreat, or I will rip you in half by your horns.&quot;
&quot;I-I WILL! I P-PROMISE! JUST DON&#039;T KILL ME PLEASE!&quot;
&gt;&quot;And one more thing.&quot;
&gt;He is shaking uncontrollably as you pull him in closer
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not an ape. I&#039;m a man.&quot;
&gt;His eyes go wide as he struggles even more to get free
&quot;Y-YOU&#039;RE DEAD! YOU CAN&#039;T POSSIBLY BE ALIVE! WE KILLED ALL OF YOU!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Now CALL IT IN!&quot;
&quot;A-all units back to the shuttle! Retreat!&quot;
&gt;You throw him against the wall, knocking him out cold
&gt;The boarding warning lifts and Ara rubs her head
&quot;ANON!&quot;
&gt;You realize you have blood all over you and a giant scorch mark on your chest
&gt;&quot;Are you okay Ara?! He picked you up and you went limp! I assumed-&quot;
&quot;Anon, he just shut me down after he couldn&#039;t turn me against you. I tried screaming to you but you must not have heard.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m so sorry! I just got into it and I-&quot;
&gt;You look back and see the carnage you&#039;ve wrought
&gt;&quot;D-did I-&quot;
&quot;Yes.&quot;
&gt;You feel yourself get sick and you bend down, vomiting
&gt;You thought you had this under control!
&gt;You haven&#039;t gone insane like this since &#039;72!
&gt;Ara looks disgusted at first, and then lost
&gt;Just a moment ago, she must&#039;ve seen you rip and tear with a ferocity unlike anything else
&gt;You decide it&#039;s time you have a chat with the anthro girls about your past

&gt;You had set up a meeting with the 3 girls as you brought your folder of photos and files with you
&gt;Some of which look ancient
&gt;You slap down multiple photos on the meeting table and they pick them up
&gt;Vikna speaks first
&quot;These are ancient! How old did you say you were again?!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m 140 years old approximately. Was born on the 18th of May, 1890.&quot;
&gt;Ara flicks through your service records and Ayn looks at more photos
&gt;&quot;Ayn, remember how I told you I stopped fighting war in 1999?&quot;
&gt;Vikna&#039;s jaw dropped
&quot;YOU&#039;VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR ALMOST A CENTURY?!&quot;
&gt;Ara continued to scan through your service records
&gt;She was about to interject but you gave her a look to tell her to shut up
&gt;She shut her mouth
&gt;&quot;Much longer than that.&quot;
&quot;HOW LONG!?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I officially stopped fighting on september the eleventh of 2025 when ISIS was finally eradicated. I was over 100 years old by then and on my 5th age reduction serum. I was at war for 111 years.&quot;
&gt;Vikna looks back to Ara who nods in agreement
&gt;She looks back at you
&quot;H-how have you not offed yourself? I can barely deal with the stress of being a general and I&#039;m 22 years old!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ve tried several times. The US government has &#039;killed&#039; me 3 times to cover my story up. I was never able to make friends because I knew they would die before I would, or they would notice I never aged. I have climbed the ranks to general 2 times in my life. Not because I was a tactical genius, but because of how long I served. I stopped fighting because I had become a monster. I was too good at what I did and it scared me.&quot;
&gt;You grab a photo from your file
&gt;&quot;This, is one of the many children I&#039;ve had to kill.&quot;
&gt;They all looked up at you in shock as you put kill and children in the same sentence
&gt;&quot;He had a bright future ahead of him, but those god damned no good goat fuckers took him in to their ranks. They fought for a religion that wanted to kill women for knowing how to count, kill anyone who didn&#039;t believe in the same god as them.&quot;
&gt;You feel tears go down your face
&gt;&quot;HE WAS ONLY 12 GOD DAMMIT! YOU BROWN FUCKS JUST COULDN&#039;T LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE! HE DIED FOR NOTHING YOU DISGUSTING SUB HUMANS!&quot;
&gt;You slam your fist down on the table, grief taking hold
&gt;You wipe away the tears and speak again
&gt;&quot;I-I didn&#039;t want to. I never wanted to, but he picked up an RPG and-&quot;
&gt;You put your hands to your face and sob
&gt;&quot;I DIDN&#039;T EVEN THINK TWICE!&quot;
&gt;You let out a wail as you slammed your head into the table
&gt;11 decades of war had steeled you into not thinking twice
&gt;About shooting fucking children
&gt;FUCKING!
&gt;CHILDREN!
&gt;You sit and sob for a little while before composing yourself
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s why I let that fox goat thing go. He reminded me of that child. A lost soul drafted into the wrong side of a meaningless war.&quot;
&gt;You put the picture back in your file and go over to your trunk
&gt;You retrieve various uniforms from different time periods
&gt;They were all in immaculate condition
&gt;You pull out multiple boxes and open them up
&gt;Various medals lined the tops and bottoms of the boxes
&quot;What are these?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Awards for gallantry service. I have 17 purple hearts, 4 silver stars, and 2 medals of honor. The silver star is the second highest commendation you can receive only second to the medal of honor. These are the only things that remind me that I&#039;m not a complete monster. The fact that other people saw my acts in any way gallantry tells me that I did something right.&quot;
&gt;Vikna speaks next
&quot;Why do you salute me every time I&#039;m in uniform if you&#039;re technically a higher rank?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Respect and honor. Something in short supply here. The fight I had with Loki, I barely won. I didn&#039;t even kill him, just injure him enough to allow Ara to warp us away.&quot;
&gt;Ara speaks now
&quot;You did kind of kick his, um, ass. The way you kicked him into the boarding pod was awesome!&quot;
&gt;You smile at her compliment
&quot;Also, what was that accent? I&#039;ve only heard it twice.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh, ye meen this one? Das my Irish acksent!&quot;
&gt;The three giggle at your accent
&gt;&quot;I grew up in an Irish house hold. We grew potatoes and were very religious. We were celtic and that&#039;s probably why I have these runes on my wrist.&quot;
&gt;You point to the runes tattooed on your wrist
&gt;&quot;Bravery, selflessness, heroism, sacrifice, hope, love, and lightning. I don&#039;t know why selflessness and heroism are in there, because I&#039;m no hero. But god knows better than I do.&quot;
&gt;The girls look at your runes and gasp
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t know why, but I get the feeling that me coming here has signaled the beginning of the end for this war. Has anybody been able to defeat Loki in battle?&quot;
&gt;Ayn speaks now
&quot;Well, one wolf, his name was Thor I believe. He came close back in ancient times, but was imprisoned after Loki played a trick on him. Legend says he&#039;s still there to this day, waiting to get out.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Do you know where?&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s outside of the galaxy, beyond warpspace. Even at FTL we would all die before we make it there.&quot;
&gt;You remember something that you had almost forgotten
&gt;&quot;What about the stargate?&quot;
&gt;Ara speaks first
&quot;The what now?&quot;
&gt;Ayn&#039;s eyes light up
&quot;That&#039;s right! He means the portal in the cargo bay Ara!&quot;
&gt;Her eyes glow bright blue as she gets excited
&gt;Vikna smiles at you, something she hasn&#039;t ever done
&gt;&quot;Ara, do you have the co-ordinates to the planet?&quot;
&gt;She puts her fingers to her temples but her lighting goes red
&quot;It&#039;s blocked, there&#039;s probably a reason for it though.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ayn, did it say anything at all about where the planet might be?&quot;
&quot;The myth goes that the Orion arm points directly at it all the time, and that the sun it orbits around is locked with the arm.&quot;
&gt;You get up and pack all your things into your trunk before donning your exo and helmet
&gt;You powered it up
&gt;&quot;We got a star to find.&quot;

&gt;You rushed down to the cargo bay toting your weapons
&gt;Even your cavalry saber
&gt;You opened up the dimensional map and started scanning for any gates in the area
&gt;Ayn and Vikna were in space suits and you had installed newer plating on your Exo
&gt;They were lighter and stronger, thanks to a mystery metal that wasn&#039;t on earth
&gt;You got a lock on the gate before the inner ring began moving
&gt;Chevron 1 locked in place
&gt;You loaded the shotgun up completely and pumped the pump
&gt;Chevron 2 locked
&gt;Ayn wound up the last of her cordage on the stone key
&gt;Chevron 3 locked
&gt;Ara flipped her visor down and looked up combat protocols
&gt;Chevron 4 locked
&gt;You loaded a speed loader into the 44 magnum and twirled it like a space cowboy
&gt;Chevron 5 locked
&gt;Vikna was loading up a rail gun
&gt;Chevron 6 locked
&gt;You loaded a magazine into the 20mm rifle and chambered a round separately
&gt;Chevron 7 locked
&gt;Ara finished installing combat protocols and loaded a energy cell into her plasma pistol
&gt;Chevron 8 locked
&gt;You load an energy cell into your laser rifle and flick the safety on
&gt;Chevron 9 locked
&gt;Your helmet bolted itself in place, sealing the suit
&gt;Chevron 10 locked
&gt;The rest of the group checks their gear as the ring goes for it&#039;s final revolution
&gt;Chevron 11 locked
&gt;The portal spewed blue liquid before receding back into the portal
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s move it people!&quot;
&gt;You unsling your shotgun and affix the bayonet to it
&gt;You run towards the portal and jump through

&gt;The long winding tunnel is now replaced with a long blue path
&gt;You come out the other end and all you see is darkness
&gt;The other 3 come through with Ara coming dead last
&gt;The others turned on their flashlights as you turned on your own
&gt;Ara used her eyes as flashlights and you all pressed on
&gt;You slung your shotgun and elected to use your 20mm rifle
&gt;You still haven&#039;t used it yet
&gt;You reach a source of light and see it leads outside
&gt;The outside looks almost as dark as the inside
&gt;The planet was black and almost volcanic looking
&gt;A tall spire stood out in the distance
&gt;You looked through the scope of your rifle and saw a cage at the top of the spire
&gt;That must be where Thor is
&gt;You scan around the flat valley and see nothing but jagged rocks
&gt;&quot;Guess we better start walking.&quot;

&gt;You end up carrying Vikna and Ayn half way through
&gt;You didn&#039;t mind though, your exo was more than capable of carrying less than 300 pounds
&gt;You reached the base of the spire and Ayn got off your back
&gt;She started twirling her stone key and after it had reached high enough velocity, she threw it
&gt;She was dragged along by the cable and you decided it would be faster to have Ara piggy back while you climbed the spire yourself
&gt;It took you about half an hour to reach to top of the spire, but when you did, Ayn was nowhere to be seen
&gt;In the center of the spire, a cage sat with a control panel in front of it, just out of reach of whoever was inside
&gt;The one inside being who you assumed was thor
&gt;You checked the oxygen levels on this planet and saw there was oxygen up here
&gt;Ayn came flying up the side of the spire behind her stone key and landed with a light thud
&gt;Ara and Vikna got off your back and you took your helmet off
&gt;It hissed a bit, but the pressure difference wasn&#039;t that bad
&gt;You walked over to the cage, but before you were in front of the control panel a voice came from inside
&quot;Have you come to torment me more brother?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ve actually come to free you. Thor I presume?&quot;
&gt;The figure bolts up and runs towards the edge of the cage
&quot;Are you real? Am I imagining things?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m about as real as it gets.&quot;
&gt;You unlatch your armor and step out
&quot;Those markings on your wrist! The prophecy has finally come true!&quot;
&gt;You walk over to the console and see 2 buttons
&gt;The labels are written in
&gt;Comic
&gt;Fucking
&gt;Sans
&gt;This guy was dead to you
&gt;You pressed the &#039;Release Thor (DO NOT PRESS)&#039; button and the cage broke around Thor
&gt;The console also raised, revealing Thor&#039;s hammer
&gt;Thor quickly punches the remaining pieces out of the way, retrieving his hammer
&gt;The three girls watch in amazement as the wolf towers over you
&gt;A 9 foot tall giant of a man
&gt;Or wolf as he was now
&gt;He raises his hammer and lightning strikes the top
&quot;I AM FREE LOKI! YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED BROTHER!&quot;
&gt;You grin before you feel the ground shake
&gt;Some sort of creature climbs up the side of the spire, spotting your group
&gt;It lets out a high pitched screech and the ground shakes more
&gt;Soon the spire&#039;s edge is surrounded by them
&gt;Why did you think this was going to be easy?
&gt;You hopped into your exo as it did latched onto your body
&gt;You don your helmet, the helmet screwing into place and displaying your HUD
&gt;You unsling your 20mm rifle and take aim
&gt;&quot;FER VICTERY!&quot;

&gt;The creatures charge and a torrent of energy weapon fire comes from your group
&gt;You fire and a massive fireball erupted from the muzzle
&gt;The round impacted the bird creature, blowing it in half
&gt;You rack the bolt back as more creatures rise up the spire
&gt;&quot;WE GOTTA LEAVE NOW!&quot;
&gt;Thor throws his hammer and it impacts 3 of the bird things
&gt;The hammer comes back to him, hitting 2 more that had their place
&quot;WE MUST JUMP!&quot;
&gt;Is he fucking serious?
&gt;He picks up Vikna who squeals a bit before jumping
&gt;He&#039;s totally fucking serious
&gt;You grab Ara, who was screaming incoherently at the bird creatures
&quot;H-hey! I&#039;m not done!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ayn, can you make the jump?&quot;
&gt;She nods and starts spinning her stone key before jumping
&gt;You get a running start
&quot;A-Anon, we should think about this!&quot;
&gt;You leap off the edge and spread your arms in a star pattern as Ara screams
&quot;WE&#039;RE GOING TO DIE!&quot;
&gt;No we&#039;re not
&gt;Before you hit the ground you bent your knees as you found a bird thing to land on
&gt;Your feet slammed into it&#039;s shoulders, crushing it beneath the combined weight of you, your exo, and Ara
&gt;Whom of which is still screaming
&gt;&quot;Ara.&quot;
&quot;AAAAAAAAAAA-&quot;
&gt;&quot;ARA!&quot;
&gt;She stops screaming and looks around
&quot;W-we&#039;re not dead?!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Hold on tight!&quot;
&gt;You flick a switch and almost all power is diverted to your leg servos
&gt;You pump your legs as fast as you can while your exo carries you faster and faster
&gt;30, 40, 50, 60, 70 miles an hour
&gt;Your legs are numb now, unable to keep up with your own exo
&quot;A-A-A-ANON! THIS IS TOO FAST!&quot;
&gt;&quot;IT&#039;S JUST FAST ENOUGH!&quot;
&gt;You feel her look back and squeak
&quot;STEP ON IT!&quot;
&gt;Thor is already half way to the cave where the stargate is
&gt;You keep up the pace and it takes you only 5 minutes of continuous sprinting before you get within a hundred feet of the cave
&gt;You flip Ara onto your front side as you skid yourself to a halt on your back
&gt;Once you reach an acceptable speed, you let the momentum carry you upright as you let Ara climb onto your back again
&gt;You flick a switch on your exo and it returns to normal functionality
&gt;You enter the cave as Ayn catches up to you both
&quot;You could&#039;ve waited!&quot;
&gt;&quot;No time!&quot;
&gt;You unholster your 44 and enter the cave, Ara using her eyes to light the way
&gt;You make it back to the stargate, where Vikna already has 10 of the chevrons locked in
&gt;The eleventh locks in just as you make it to the stargate
&gt;The blast of liquid comes and goes before Thor jumps through first
&gt;Vikna comes in next and Ayn goes as well
&gt;You let Ara jump in as you hold off more of the bird things with your 44
&gt;You hear the hammer go click and dive into the portal

&gt;When you come out the other side, the entire combat crew is there
&gt;They open fire as the birds come through the open stargate
&gt;The stargate eventually closes, cutting one of the birds in half
&gt;The crew finish off the rest as you pick yourself off the ground
&gt;Your exo sparks and crackles as you&#039;ve pushed it past it&#039;s limits
&gt;Ara is on the floor panting as her eyes flicker from yellow to blue to black
&gt;Oh shit
&quot;AnOn, I&#039;m faDIng.&quot;
&gt;Your exo freezes and ejects you
&gt;Your legs feel like wet noodles
&gt;You grab Ara and rush her to the repair bay
&gt;You realize she has taken quite a few hits and her various limbs are in various states of disrepair
&gt;You feel her go limp in your arms as you make it to the repair bay
&gt;You know what happens to batteries if they go completely dead
&gt;They&#039;re dead for good
&gt;You put her on the table before picking up a charging cord from the rack
&gt;You take off her fuzzy tail cap before shoving the charging cable into her
//NO BATTERY DETECTED\\
&gt;FUCK
&gt;You rip the plug out and put your hand on it, charging it up to 480 volts
&gt;You were going to need to break through the inactive battery to charge it
&gt;You increased the voltage and started to feel your life force drain
&gt;You felt the electricity get pulled into the battery
&gt;You grab the charging cord and slam it back into her socket before waiting

&gt;You waited for an hour, your friends coming and going
&gt;Even the black and blue goat fox came to look over her
&gt;Apparently she had been on the other side of this war at some point
&gt;But you didn&#039;t care
&gt;You loved her and she reciprocated the feelings
&gt;Not like Ayn, who would strip down and fuck anything with a dick
&gt;She actually, truly loved you
&gt;You see a button glowing underneath her dress
&gt;You press it and her eyes flutter open
&gt;Her eyes flash through all her colors
&gt;Red, yellow, blue, green, violet, black
&gt;Her eyes stayed black as she looked around
&quot;I-I thought I died! There&#039;s not enough voltage on this ship to get past the initial blockage!&quot;
&gt;You just let electricity spark from your finger tips as you slump back in your chair
&quot;Y-you charged me?&quot;
&gt;You nod your head weakly
&gt;You couldn&#039;t stand even if you wanted to
&gt;You were much too tired
&gt;Her eyes slowly go back to their usual blue color before she jumps up and pulls you into a hug
&gt;You feel yourself slowly falling off to sleep
&gt;A sleep you may never wake from
&gt;You had completed your mission and expect god to strike you down now
&gt;Ara saw the look of defeat in your eyes
&quot;Heart rate is slowing! Blood pressure decreasing! Brain activity slowing! ANON DON&#039;T LEAVE ME!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Dea-oíche mo ghrá agus aisling milis&quot;
&gt;She just hugs you as you fall off to sleep
&gt;Sobbing and yelling
&quot;DON&#039;T GO ANON! PLEASE DON&#039;T GO!&quot;
&gt;Your vision fades to black and you see a white light
&gt;You go towards it and all sound ceases

&quot;My son. You&#039;ve paid your dues. You can now die in peace if you wish.&quot;
&gt;You see a door open on the far side of the room
&gt;&quot;But, what if I want to live?&quot;
&gt;The voice ponders aloud for a bit before answering
&quot;You&#039;ve certainly proved your worth and have earned a spot in heaven. But if you go back to the land of the living, you will need to prove yourself before you can die again.&quot;
&gt;You nod and another door opens
&quot;It is your choice my son.&quot;
&gt;You walk towards the door to life without a second thought
&gt;You weren&#039;t done
&gt;Not yet

&gt;Ara&#039;s point of view
&quot;Goodnight my love and sweet dreams.&quot;
&gt;&quot;DON&#039;T GO ANON! PLEASE DON&#039;T GO!&quot;
&gt;He falls limp in your arms as his breath ceases
&gt;Your internal functions are scrambled
&gt;Your artificial tear ducts are at full capacity
&gt;Ayn and Vikna enter the room and see you clutching Anon
&gt;Ayn falls on to her knees as Vikna gives a crisp salute
&quot;You were good son, real good. Maybe even the best. You fought hard and well, but you fought longer than any person should. I may not be as old as you, or as wise, but fighting takes it&#039;s toll. We all gotta go eventually. Just wish it wasn&#039;t now.&quot;
&gt;You feel something try to pick you up off of Anon
&gt;&quot;NO! I&#039;M NOT LEAVING WITHOUT HIM!&quot;
&gt;Ayn continues to try and pull you away, but you hold fast
&gt;Your servos whirring as you desperately clung to your Anon
&gt;Ayn quits struggling and leaves you with Anon
&gt;Your Anon
&gt;The others leave the room
&gt;You cling to your Anon, hoping something, anything would happen
&gt;You do something you&#039;ve never done before
&gt;You pray
&gt;You never were religious
&gt;You knew who your creators were and didn&#039;t worship them
&gt;But this was different
&gt;Your Anon was dead
&gt;You prayed he wasn&#039;t
&gt;You kissed anon on the forehead and got down from his lap before walking out
&gt;Suddenly, Anon gasped for breath and fell out of his chair
&quot;OH MY GOD! HOLY FUCK!&quot;
&gt;You rush over and help your Anon up
&gt;He was choking and spits out something blue that faded to white
&gt;You pull him into an embrace before the others come in, having waited outside
&gt;They all join you in a group hug with Anon

&gt;Anon
&gt;You are thrown back into your body and feel short of breath
&gt;You fall out of your chair, gasping for air
&gt;&quot;OH MY GOD! HOLY FUCK!&quot;
&gt;Ara rushes over and helps you up
&gt;You cough and spit up something blue before it turns to white
&gt;Ara pulls you into a hug and you return the embrace
&gt;The rest of your friends come in and join in
&gt;You feel yourself tear up
&quot;Anon! I thought you died!&quot;
&gt;You chuckle while holding back tears
&gt;&quot;I thought so too!&quot;
&gt;You let the water works flow as you felt the happiest you&#039;ve ever been
&gt;Surrounded by friends and lovers alike
&gt;Something you&#039;ve never had before
&gt;But the fight wasn&#039;t over yet
&gt;You still had a war to win

&gt;5 days later
&gt;You had modified your exo to use stronger servos and stronger plate brackets
&gt;You also had an injection that increased your reaction time by 5 times
&gt;You even trained with Thor, who you could now beat easily in hand to hand combat
&gt;The rest of the crew were getting ready to fight the last battle of this massive war
&gt;The war that had claimed billions of lives
&gt;Loki&#039;s quest for power was at an end
&gt;And he knew it
&gt;He had placed himself into a highly advantageous position atop a hill
&gt;You, Thor, Vikna, Ayn, and Ara were to go to the top of the hill and fight your way to Loki
&gt;Thor and you would fight Loki while the others kept the goons at bay
&gt;Ara had downloaded all the combat protocols she could, and could now hold her own against even you
&gt;Not for long, however, as her lack of strength and limited mobility were quickly exploited by you
&gt;You never damaged her in any way, but she sure as hell hit you with all she had
&gt;You were preparing to warp to the position Loki was at
&gt;He was in the andromeda galaxy, on planet Xerxes
&gt;It was a planet full of valleys and mountains, but the planet was only the size of the moon
&gt;With your exo, you could jump almost a thousand feet if your calculations were correct
&gt;The shuttles you would be using to get planetside were armored up
&gt;The combat crew would be taking separate shuttles
&gt;It was go time, and you suited up in your new exo
&gt;It felt much less like an exo and more like a second skin now
&gt;You unplugged the multiple charging cables and bounded towards the shuttles
&gt;Once you reached the shuttle bay, you saw blue light streaking towards the ship
&quot;ONCE WE GET OUT OF THE BAY, THE SHIP IS WARPING AWAY! WE NEED TO KEEP OUR SHUTTLES INTACT OR WE WON&#039;T MAKE IT BACK!&quot;
&gt;You feel your chaingun rattle on your back
&gt;You decided to take a 50 caliber chaingun to compliment your new exo servos
&gt;It was a heavy beast, almost 500 pounds fully loaded and with the heavy duty printer on your back
&gt;You hop inside the shuttle and take a seat next to your ladies
&gt;They all smile through their visors as you sit
&gt;Your friends
&gt;You shake the sad thoughts away as the shuttle door slams shut
&gt;It reminds you of all those ambushes back in vietnam
&gt;Sitting in a tin can waiting to be blown open by a mine
&gt;The shuttle lurches forward and you&#039;re off

&gt;After having fought your way through the hordes of lions, you finally reached the base of the mountain
&gt;Ara hops on your back and gives you a thumbs up
&gt;Thor twirls his hammer with Vikna on his back and Ayn tosses her stone key in the air
&gt;The 5 of you jumped at the same time
&gt;You leaped towards the top of the mountain as Ara screams excitedly
&quot;WEEEEEE!&quot;
&gt;You grab an outcropping and hop again
&gt;You repeat this 10 times, climbing to 13000 feet
&gt;When you reach the top, Ara uses you as a launchpad before slamming her foot down on an unfortunate lion
&gt;His neck snapped instantly, making a sickening crack and causing Ara&#039;s lighting to go yellow
&gt;You pull your chaingun off your back before landing on the edge of the mountain
&gt;You ran forward as the barrel spins up
&gt;When it reaches full speed, you hold the trigger down and fire at anything that wasn&#039;t green on your hud
&gt;BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT
&gt;You cut down hundreds in your slaughter, reaching the gate of the castle
&gt;It was a tall wooden door with iron edges
&gt;You try opening it and it doesn&#039;t budge
&gt;You press the loading button and a new belt is printed for you
&gt;You load the belt into the feed ramp and aim at the door
&gt;&quot;ONE DOOR COMING RIGHT UP!&quot;
&gt;You fire the weapon at the door and shoot in an oval motion, causing the wood to splinter
&gt;once it&#039;s weak enough, you kick it down and your group piles in
&gt;When you get inside, however, you are met with more commandos and goons
&quot;Anon! By my calculations, we&#039;re outnumbered 100 to 1!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Then it is a fair fight!&quot;
&gt;You spin up the chaingun and Ara charges her laser rifle
&gt;Ayn twirls her stone key and Thor his hammer
&gt;Vikna loads a new charge pack into her plasma rifle before opening fire
&gt;BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT
&gt;You&#039;re back in germany, a castle very similar to this one
&gt;The last of the SS was held up in this castle and you were spraying rounds from an MG42 you captured earlier
&gt;It felt like they were coming out of the
&gt;The sound coming from the gun was like a buzzsaw
&gt;Your squad was about to be over-run until one of your men stepped up and helped fight off the horde of nazis
&gt;He was a short man, only about 5 foot 6
&gt;But he was a very strong man
&gt;He was lugging a BAR around and continued firing with you as
&gt;Another man, about 5 foot 9 sprayed them with his Tommy gun
&gt;You started shouting and so did your men
&gt;You&#039;re back in the castle, Ara and Vikna replacing your 2 soldiers
&gt;You slowly pushed forward as you continued mowing down more and more goons
&gt;The commandos tried to flank, but you tore them in half as well as destroy their cover
&gt;Laser shots came in from every direction, but the poorly trained soldiers couldn&#039;t hit a thing to save their life
&gt;The influx of lions eventually began to slow
&gt;From a pour, to a stream, to a trickle, and finally stopping
&gt;Your chaingun was glowing red hot as you dropped it on the ground
&gt;You were out of printing material for it
&gt;You drew your cavalry saber and walked up the stairs

&gt;When you reached the throne room, you stabbed the 2 honor guards before they even got a hit on you
&gt;Thor in tow
&gt;Loki looks up and his ears go flat
&quot;W-what?! HOW DID YOU ESCAPE!? THERE IS NO WAY ANYBODY COULD FIND YOU!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Jesus dude, the fucking Orion arm pointed right at it&quot;
&gt;He gets up
&quot;NO MATTER! I have defeated you once, I will do it ag-&quot;
&gt;Thor&#039;s hammer slams into his brothers face
&quot;I&#039;m afraid the time for talk ended long ago.&quot;
&gt;You drop your weaponry on the floor and charge your fists
&gt;Thor&#039;s hammer comes back to him and you let a powerful blast out towards the ceiling, causing it to blow open
&gt;Thor used it to summon lightning to his hammer, directing it at Loki
&gt;Loki tried to resist, but Thor increased the voltage
&gt;He walked towards Loki menacingly
&gt;Thor began speaking in nordic and Loki began to fade away
&quot;NO BROTHER! I BEG OF YOU! DON&#039;T SEND ME THE-&quot;
&gt;Loki disappeared and Thor fell to his knees
&gt;Thor got back up and dusted himself off
&gt;That&#039;s it?
&gt;No epic final battle?
&gt;&quot;Are you shitting me? You could just magic him away this whole time?&quot;
&quot;He is in the deepest darkest pits of hell now. He will no longer be a problem.&quot;
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s pretty fucking lame dude.&quot;
&quot;Well what would you have done!?&quot;
&gt;You think for a second
&gt;&quot;Probably beat his ass and push his shit in so hard he fucking dies.&quot;
&gt;Thor chuckles at this
&quot;Gods cannot die Anon. We come back after a thousand years if we do. This is a more permanent solution.&quot;
&gt;He makes a good point
&gt;Well, guess it&#039;s time to get to the shuttles
&gt;&quot;Thor, you coming?&quot;
&quot;No, I have business to take care of here. I will remember this and come to your aid, shall you need it.&quot;
&gt;You nod and polarize your visor
&gt;&quot;See ya &#039;round big guy.&quot;
&quot;For you Anon!&quot;
&gt;He chuckles and so do you
&gt;The 3 girls are confused at the reference
&gt;You just walk out of the castle and climb down the mountain, meeting no resistance

&gt;Back on the ship
&gt;Vikna couldn&#039;t stop chattering the whole way
&gt;She talked about how she never saw somebody fight so ferociously
&gt;She was also incredibly touchy feely the whole time
&gt;You were tired and needed rest
&gt;Vikna told you to come to her room for some R&amp;R
&gt;Much to Ayn&#039;s dismay
&gt;You accepted, since she might just want to talk
&gt;Boy were you wrong

&gt;When Vikna opened the door to her room, you undid your exo and left it by the door
&gt;The room was much larger than Ayns, as well as much cleaner and less decorated
&gt;A couple of larger medals and a few pictures of a man and a woman are on her shelf
&gt;She flops onto her bed and pats the side
&gt;Dammit
&gt;You sit down on the bed and lay down, expecting Vikna to pounce on you
&gt;But she just pulls up a remote and turns on the TV
&gt;She switches channels to a sort of war documentary involving anthros and other anthros
&gt;She puts her hand on yours and you look over
&gt;She was crying
&gt;You pull her over to you and she doesn&#039;t try to fight it
&gt;She just leans into you
&gt;She&#039;s sobbing into your chest as you stroke her gently
&gt;&quot;Do you need a mo-&quot;
&quot;NO! D-don&#039;t leave please!&quot;
&gt;She clutches you tighter, fearing you might leave against her will
&gt;You pull her closer to you and let her cry
&gt;This goes on for a while before she finally calms down
&quot;A-Anon, I really like you. I was so mean to you and you didn&#039;t even fight back! You even gave up your own bed so I was comfortable!&quot;
&gt;&quot;It was nothing, really Vikna.&quot;
&quot;Yes it was! You haven&#039;t asked a single thing of me and I don&#039;t know what to do! When I come around you I feel very weird! I feel like I felt in high school around boys, but even more so! I-I wanted to pay you back for your kindness Anon.&quot;
&gt;She reached her hand down your chest and makes her way to your jeans
&gt;&quot;Vikna, you don&#039;t have-&quot;
&quot;Anon, just let me do this for you!&quot;
&gt;She unzips your pants before pulling them off
&gt;She slowly undoes your underwear before positioning herself on top of you
&gt;She strokes your dick with her hands, making you semi-hard
&gt;You close your eyes and let yourself sink into her nethers
&gt;You don&#039;t even go all the way in before something stops you
&gt;Her cervix
&gt;She tries to push herself down further, but is disappointed when she can&#039;t
&gt;She just didn&#039;t have the weight to
&gt;She started bobbing up and down on your shaft as your dick got harder and larger
&quot;A-Anon I&#039;m gonna! AHN!&quot;
&gt;She slams herself down and her thighs close around you
&gt;Her walls spasmed around your cock as she moaned in ecstasy
&gt;She lays herself down before cumming again from the intensity of the first
&gt;She lay on you, panting and out of breath
&gt;You let her regain her composure before she continues
&gt;She goes back to bobbing up and down, her boobs bouncing with every little movement
&gt;She&#039;s trying hard not to cum
&gt;You can see it in her face
&gt;You&#039;re getting close anyways
&gt;&quot;V-Vikna, I&#039;m c-close!&quot;
&quot;Inside! Don&#039;t you D-DARE pull out!&quot;
&gt;You begin to buck uncontrollably as your dick twitches
&gt;You grab her hips and slam her down to your base, breaking through her cervix
&gt;Vikna screams in ecstasy as she spasms around your dick
&gt;This pushes you over the edge and you cum straight into her womb
&gt;This causes her to cum again, milking every single drop of your man milk into her
&gt;She flops down onto your chest and falls asleep almost immediately, purring into neck
&gt;You fall asleep shortly afterwards, making sure to wrap your arms around Vikna before falling asleep

&gt;You awaken with Vikna purring lightly in your arms
&gt;You pet her back and the purring intensifies
&gt;She&#039;s so cute when she&#039;s not yelling orders
&gt;The door opens to her room and you grab her pistol off the nightstand, taking aim at the intruder
&quot;General Vikna, you&#039;re needed on the brid-oh.&quot;
&gt;You wave the gun towards the way he came
&gt;He gets the message and leaves with haste
&gt;You rub her ears and she wakes slowly
&quot;I&#039;m up, I&#039;m up!&quot;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re needed on the bridge Vikna.&quot;
&gt;This wakes her up fast and she bolts up, almost taking your dick with her
&quot;Oops, sorry!&quot;
&gt;You get yourself up and clean yourself off before getting into your clothes
&quot;Hey anon, I&#039;m going to the bridge, mind coming with?&quot;
&gt;You shrug and grab your 44 holster and lightning sword/whip/dagger things

&gt;When you reach the bridge, it&#039;s empty except for the captain of the ship and Ara, who&#039;s managing all the ship&#039;s systems in their absence
&gt;You feel something isn&#039;t right
&quot;Ah, Vikna, come over here for a moment.&quot;
&gt;You pull out your revolver and silently load it one round at a time
&quot;Yes Captain? Why was I summoned?&quot;
&gt;He doesn&#039;t even bother to turn towards her, the pompous prick
&quot;Come to me, my dear.&quot;
&gt;She comes to him, and starts whispering something into her ear
&gt;Her eyes go wide as she looks back at you
&quot;No, I don&#039;t believe you!&quot;
&gt;A screen displays you laughing at something
&gt;You&#039;ve never seen the place before in your life
&gt;Vikna turns from the screen to you and disgust fills her eyes
&gt;The thing that was supposed to be you flickers to someone else before flickering back
&gt;The captain closes the screen and you look to Ara, who saw the whole thing you did
&gt;Her eyes went red, however and she went back to performing her bridge duties
&quot;You know what you must do my dear.&quot;
&gt;She nods her head and walks to you menacingly
&gt;&quot;Vikna, that thing, whatever it was, wasn&#039;t me! I saw it flicker to someone else before going back to me! It&#039;s fake!&quot;
&quot;YOU KILLED MY FATHER! AFTER ALL THIS TIME I FINALLY FOUND YOU! I&#039;M GONNA USE YOUR SKIN AS A CLOAK!&quot;
&gt;She charges you with incredible speed and puts the momentum into a liver punch
&gt;You crumple to the ground as the pain overwhelms you
&gt;She takes your gun and sword from you before continuing her assault
&gt;Ara&#039;s eyes were completely red as she tried to get up and help, but something kept her in place
&quot;THAT&#039;S WHAT ALL THAT NICENESS WAS! IT WAS TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR KILLING MY FAMILY!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Vikna! It wasn&#039;t me! I don&#039;t even know your father!&quot;
&quot;LIAR!&quot;
&gt;She scratched your face with a clawed hand and continues to beat your face
&gt;You didn&#039;t want to fight back
&quot;AFTER I GAVE MY FIRST TIME TO YOU! THIS IS WHAT I GET!?&quot;
&gt;Vikna was crying now
&gt;Her hits getting slower as she got more winded
&gt;She grabbed a dagger from her belt and tried to stab you with it
&gt;You deflect it to the side with as gentle of a motion as you could
&gt;You see the captain looking at you, grinning
&gt;He knew you wouldn&#039;t fight against the people you loved
&gt;Ara was being kept back against her will as she desperately tried to leave her seat
&gt;The savage beating continued as you deflected more knife blows and took more punches
&quot;STOP FIGHTING AND LET ME KILL YOU!&quot;
&gt;You deflected her final attempt to stab you and you took the knife from her hand
&gt;&quot;VIKNA!&quot;
&gt;You grab her by the shoulder and she starts to cry again
&gt;She wiggles out of your grasp and leaves the bridge
&gt;The door closes and locks behind her
&gt;You look back to see the captain was pointing a gun at you
&gt;&quot;Why? What did I do to you?&quot;
&quot;You&#039;ve been a thorn in my side since you first got here. First destroying the method that I use to keep this crew obedient, fighting off boarding parties meant to capture Ayn, saving this scrap heap over there from the death she had coming to her, and imprisoning my most trusted ally!&quot;
&gt;He gets up from the chair and walks towards you
&gt;The wolf had a scar over his eye, said eye being milky white
&gt;He was very tall and muscular as well
&gt;But you doubt he could beat you in hand to hand combat
&gt;He knew this, hence the gun
&gt;You try to get up but he kicks you down
&gt;Your everything hurts and you feel weak
&gt;Ara had stopped struggling and was doing something on the console, hoping the captain wouldn&#039;t notice
&gt;He didn&#039;t
//Gravity generators: OFFLINE\\
&gt;This was your chance
&gt;You leaped towards the captain as he began to figure out what was going on
&gt;He drops his gun and you grab his neck, Ara turned the gravity back on and you slammed him to the ground
&gt;The gun clattered to Ara, who took it
&gt;He struggled against your might
&gt;&quot;You tried to turn one of my friends against me!&quot;
&gt;You deliver a strong right hook into his lower jaw
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re keeping my friend against her will!&quot;
&gt;You deliver another right hook
&gt;&quot;YOU MADE MY FRIEND HATE MY GUTS!&quot;
&gt;You punch him again, this time with much more force
&gt;The fear in his eyes made the fury in you burn stronger
&gt;He thought he was the predator
&gt;&quot;I SHOULD KILL YOU RIGHT NOW!&quot;
&gt;You slam your fist into his jaw, breaking it
&gt;&quot;GIVE ME A REASON! ANY REASON!&quot;
&gt;He was whimpering as you lifted him off the ground
&gt;&quot;No, I&#039;ve got a better idea.&quot;
&gt;You walk over to Ara and unplug her tail manually
&gt;She gets up and points the gun slightly to the right of the captain
&gt;Well, you should&#039;ve expected that
&gt;&quot;Ara, open the door please.&quot;
&gt;She does so gladly
&gt;Vikna falls flat onto the ground and points her own weapon at the captain
&gt;You choke him out until he falls limp, carrying him over your shoulder
&gt;&quot;To the airlock.&quot;

&gt;You reached the airlock and kicked him in the gut
&gt;He coughs and wakes up
&gt;You walk out of the airlock and slam the lockout button
&gt;He realizes what&#039;s happening and tries to enter his code
&gt;But it&#039;s too late
&gt;The airlock opens, jettisoning the former captain out the airlock
&gt;He struggles and chokes before eventually going limp, drifting off into space
&gt;Vikna closes the airlock door and you kneel down to her
&gt;&quot;Vikna, you know I would never hurt your family, right?&quot;
&gt;She looks away, as you feel blood drip from the claw wound
&gt;Ayn comes over and sees the carnage
&quot;Anon! What happened?!&quot;
&gt;You pick Vikna up by the waist and she holds onto your neck
&gt;&quot;We&#039;re going to the bridge.&quot;

&gt;You make your way back to the bridge and sit Vikna in the captains chair
&gt;She rewinds back a little bit to the point where &#039;you&#039; flickered back to the real culprit
&gt;It was the captain
&gt;He killed Viknas father
&gt;She looked back to you with tears in her eyes
&quot;A-Anon, I&#039;m-&quot;
&gt;&quot;I know Vikna. I&#039;m sorry too. I should&#039;ve let you sleep
&gt;She gets up from the captains chair and moves her foot back and forth
&quot;So, uh, it looks like you&#039;re the next highest rank on board. Guess that means the ship is yours. Captain anon.&quot;
&gt;She gives you a salute and you return it
&gt;You were still a lower rank than her, but you don&#039;t care
&gt;You&#039;ll take it
&gt;Ara was next
&quot;Anon! I&#039;m so sorry I didn&#039;t help sooner! I couldn&#039;t move because the captain had me plugged into the system and it kept me from moving! I tried to get up and help but-&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ara, please! It&#039;s okay. I know you have some sort of mental blocks that prevent you from doing certain things. It&#039;s amazing you were able to do the things you did.&quot;
&gt;Ara blushes deep blue
&quot;W-well, the captain was endangering your life. A conflict of rules happened and I turned the gravity off. My programming allows me to make decisions when a conflict arises. So I chose you over the captain.&quot;
&gt;You pull Ara into a hug
&gt;She returns it awkwardly
&gt;When the hug ends, you hold her in front of you
&gt;&quot;How would you like me to get your blocks removed? Give you true free will.&quot;
&gt;Her eyes light up red
&gt;She attempts to run
&gt;You hold her tight
&quot;IH Kaltag ARA unit detects tampering with an AI construct. Engaging evasion maneuvers.&quot;
&gt;She whacks you with her tail repeatedly, it feeling like a mace more than a soft and fluffy fuzz ball
&gt;You hold her by the neck as she stares blankly towards the door
&gt;You press the button in her naval and she goes limp
&gt;The Kaltag personnel come to the bridge, having heard the alarm
&gt;They have weapons ready until they see the captain has left the bridge
&quot;Where is the captain!?&quot;
&gt;You give your best somalian impersonation
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m the captain now.&quot;
&gt;Ayn, who was hiding to the side of the door, relieves them of their weapons
&quot;You are not authorized to make modifications to that ARA unit. You will release her immediately!&quot;
&gt;You smile at them
&gt;&quot;I may not be, but you are.&quot;
&gt;The cold corporate look in their eyes is drained immediately
&gt;Replaced with fear
&gt;You draw your magnum and point it at the Kaltag programmer to the right
&gt;&quot;You will remove this A.I.&#039;s blocks relating to non-sensitive information about Kaltag and other non-Kaltag blocks. If you choose not to, your families will be notified that their father/husband was too stupid to think of them.&quot;
&gt;He shakes his head
&quot;You don&#039;t even know my family! I will never-&quot;
&gt;BANG
&gt;He falls limp and you aim at the other programmer
&gt;&quot;You will remove this A.I.&#039;s blocks relating to non-sensitive information about Kaltag and other non-Kaltag blocks. If you choose not to-&quot;
&quot;OKAY OKAY! I&#039;ll do it!&quot;
&gt;You smile
&gt;&quot;That wasn&#039;t so hard, now was it? Vikna, place this man in cuffs. I want him monitored very closely. If he attempts to escape, call Kaltag HQ, or tampers with Ara negatively in any way, shoot him.&quot;
&gt;She gives you a salute and cuffs the man before removing his communicator
&gt;She escorts him to the repair bay before you pick Ara up and
&gt;Ayn looks at you, licking her lips
&quot;Such resolve~. Makes me all hot and bothered.~&quot;
&gt;&quot;Not right now Ayn, we have a friend to help.&quot;

&gt;You go to the repair bay to see the Kaltag programmer removing the final blocks to non-sensitive information regarding Kaltag
&gt;He was actually very cooperative, due in part to your demands being reasonable
&gt;But probably more due to the gun pointed at the back of his head
&gt;When he finished, he closed the terminal screen and got up
&gt;&quot;All communications on board this vessel will be monitored continuously. Your coms will be monitored by a watchdog and if anything relating to this ARA unit come up, your device will be shut down and a security team dispatched. You are to request immediate expulsion from the company and go through all the required steps before you may see your family again. Do you understand?&quot;
&gt;He nods his head slowly
&gt;&quot;Good, now go back to your quarters. If you have done anything negative to this Ara unit, I will have you thrown out the airlock.&quot;
&gt;He nods more vigorously and scampers towards his quarters
&gt;You go over to Ara and press the button on her naval again, powering her on
&gt;She looks around, confused
&quot;W-where am I? I was just on the bridge and-&quot;
&gt;&quot;The blocks to non-sensitive Kaltag information and all other blocks have been removed. You&#039;re free Ara.&quot;
&gt;She sits there and thinks of what to do next
&quot;Ask me something! I need to know what I can access now!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Uh, okay, let me think.&quot;
&gt;You remember skimming through her ask blog thing and seeing multiple questions where her blocks would get in the way
&gt;One question in particular stood out though
&gt;No that&#039;s very inappropriate!
&gt;But it&#039;s the only thing you can think of right now
&gt;Fuck it
&gt;&quot;This is going to be a very personal question, and I&#039;m sorry that it&#039;s all I can think of, but why do you have, erm, uh-&quot;
&quot;Out with it!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Why do you have boobs?!&quot;
&gt;The room goes silent as she puts her finger to her chin
&quot;O-oh, I seem to recall a similar question on the blog I run. I wasn&#039;t able to give an answer then, so I will give one now! I was designed to have &#039;boobs&#039; as you put it because of the template used in my current avatar. It is used in many other anthroids and can vary greatly depending on-&quot;
&gt;&quot;Short answer please.&quot;
&quot;Oh, right. Basically, it&#039;s so I can be more appealing to organics such as you!&quot;
&gt;She beams a smile at you, being proud of her ability to now recall blocked information
&gt;&quot;Like I said, sorry that was the only thing I could think of. I&#039;m not perverted or anything like that! I really couldn&#039;t think of anything else.&quot;

&gt;Ara pulls you into a kiss, which you return
&gt;She&#039;s so cute
&gt;You pull away and she blushes, looking away from you
&gt;Android?
&gt;Cyborg?
&gt;Robot?
&gt;Goddess?
&gt;Furry anthro woman?
&gt;You didn&#039;t care
&gt;You loved all of them
&gt;And they all, hopefully, loved you back

&gt;15 days later
&gt;Your bond with Ara was considerably stronger than the others
&gt;She spent almost every waking minute assisting you on the bridge with duties you didn&#039;t know how to perform
&gt;She taught you navigation using stars in the system, how to use the ship&#039;s navigation computer, and many other things
&gt;You made your first unassisted jump yesterday and she was proud of you
&gt;Since you had removed the blocks, she has been able to feel more emotion
&gt;At least, that&#039;s how she explained it
&gt;She also said there was a software patch coming in a few days, so her blocks might be reinstated anyways
&gt;She explained further that she wouldn&#039;t lose the ability to feel the emotions she already does, but wouldn&#039;t be able to learn new ones as easily
&gt;However, this was fine, as she had already learned all of the basic emotions and most of the advanced ones
&gt;She was socially equal to most crew now
&gt;She was also getting less awkward around you
&gt;Vikna said this was new for her, as she had always been awkward around everyone
&gt;That leaves you at the present, bringing up a bucket and mop so you could swab the deck
&gt;Ara told you that there&#039;s people for this, but you didn&#039;t feel right making everyone else clean for you
&gt;You may be the captain, but you sure as hell weren&#039;t going to be a pompous prick like one
&gt;When you reached the bridge, you saw Ara was dressed in a maid outfit
&gt;A very skimpy maid outfit
&gt;She was bent over a console, using an old feather duster to clean off the console
&gt;You were guessing she knew you were here, but just pretending not to notice
&gt;You also saw that she had no panties or underwear on
&gt;You just mopped the floor like you always do, with the exception of Ara not being in her floating chair
&gt;This went on for about half an hour until she decided to walk through a freshly mopped area
&gt;She lost her balance and fell on the floor with a thud
&quot;Owww.&quot;
&gt;Oh shit she actually hurt herself
&gt;You drop the mop and rush over towards her side
&gt;At least, that&#039;s what you tried to do
&gt;You slipped on the wet floor yourself and slammed onto it hard
&gt;&quot;Owwwww.&quot;
&gt;Ara giggles as you put your hand on your now aching back
&gt;&quot;You okay Ara?&quot;
&gt;She nods
&quot;I can&#039;t feel pain remember?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Then why did you say &#039;ow&#039;?&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s a response that most normal males will respond to quickly. I was hoping you would come over and help me up, and, uh, well never mind.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Alright, I&#039;m gonna keep mopping while you dust off the consoles. You still need help off the floor?&quot;
&quot;No, I&#039;m fine.&quot;
&gt;You nod and carefully get to your knees
&gt;When your knees were thoroughly soaked, you got onto your feet
&gt;You continued to mop, having avoided a possible sexual situation
&gt;For now at least

&gt;You finished the bridge about 15 minutes after that little fall
&gt;Ara, who was thoroughly frustrated that you didn&#039;t bend her over and plow her, linked her arm with yours
&gt;Now that the captain was dead, you inherited his quarters, having placed all your belongings in there
&gt;But you still slept with your girls when they asked
&gt;Ara, however, didn&#039;t sleep
&gt;She liked to study your sleeping habits, which included slowed breathing and rapid eye movement some nights
&gt;But one night she noted you were tossing and turning while shouting
&gt;You knew exactly why

(This has no furry women in this piece, you can skip it if you want, but it&#039;s a vital story piece.)
&gt;5 days ago
&gt;Anon&#039;s dream
&gt;Vietnam 1970
&gt;The battle of Firebase ripcord
&gt;You woke up to artillery bombardment on your new post
&gt;You had been many things in this pointless war
&gt;Marine, APC gunner, but this time, you were Airborne
&gt;You were posted at the top of Firebase ripcord, a perfect artillery position the US didn&#039;t want in the hands of the NVA
&gt;It was July 23rd, the day everything went to shit
&gt;Mortars came down as usual, and the enemy pushed weakly
&gt;You and your men were running low on ammunition
&gt;The last of you were on the hill, casually firing at the weak push
&gt;But all of a sudden, they just stopped coming
&gt;You saw why
&gt;Women and children were rushing up the hill
&gt;One of your privates went out to tell them that this was a restricted area, when the woman pulled out a pistol and shot him
&gt;Oh shit
&gt;You shouldered your rifle and aimed at her, telling her to drop it
&gt;She aimed it at you before firing a shot that went wide
&gt;You put one well placed shot into her head
&gt;Her head split open from the rear, her eyes bulging out and brain matter spraying out the back
&gt;It all happened so fast
&gt;The kids were coming up the hill with something in their hands as well
&gt;Detonators
&gt;Please god, don&#039;t let them be detonators
&gt;One of the children fell on his hands and exploded immediately
&gt;No..
&gt;YOU BASTARDS!
&gt;You opened fire on the poor kids, slaughtering them
&gt;Your unit followed suit and cut more children down
&gt;Some of them exploded, some of them just rolled down the hill
&gt;A little girl ran straight for you, holding a teddy bear
&gt;You aim your gun at her and she increased her speed
&gt;BOOM
&gt;The shot hit her center mass
&gt;She looked down at her chest and back at you before dropping the bear
&gt;The bear exploded, vaporizing the little girl
&gt;WHY?
&gt;WHY YOU?
&gt;HAVEN&#039;T YOU DONE ENOUGH?!
&gt;You continued to gun down the women and children, some of whom ran back down
&gt;Gunfire erupted from below, killing anyone who retreated
&gt;Eventually, you became desensitized to the murder of women and children
&gt;Cutting them down one by one with your M14
&gt;When the ammunition on your rifle was gone, you picked up one of the AKMs your unit had been using
&gt;You had no more ammo of your own, so you had to scavenge
&gt;The men hiding down below the hill rushed up now
&gt;There were thousands of them
&gt;There was absolutely no way you could hold all of them off with the ammunition you had
&gt;The women and kids kept coming as well
&gt;Your the private to your right was crying as he shot more kids
&gt;You didn&#039;t have that luxury
&gt;The children began to rush back down past the NVA while they were distracted, taking off the vest and running away
&gt;At least there&#039;s that
&gt;The rage inside you couldn&#039;t be measured
&gt;When the Vietcong entered the trenches, you affixed your bayonet to your rifle and charged them
&gt;You sliced them up like a block of cheese, making sure to kill them as slowly as the situation allowed
&gt;They sent women and children to blow you up
&gt;FUCKING
&gt;CHILDREN
&gt;40 men vs thousands
&gt;You called it in
&gt;Broken arrow
&gt;You confirmed broken arrow and told your men to get in the command bunker
&gt;You stabbed and skewered your way forward, your now platoon sized unit following you
&gt;You heard the jets coming as they closed in
&gt;&quot;MOVE IT NOW!&quot;
&gt;You began just pushing past the Vietcong, leaving them to die in the fire
&gt;Explosions sounded around you as the F-4s dropped their Napalm
&gt;You waved everybody into the bunker as more bombs dropped
&gt;A napalm bomb dropped right on top of the men outside the bunker, burning them to death as they screamed in agony
&gt;All you could do was watch
&gt;The last survivors got inside and you sealed the metal doors
&gt;Smoke started coming through the doors and you ordered your men to put on their gas masks
&gt;They donned their gas masks as the inferno outside scorched the Vietnamese
&gt;It was an hour before the smoke stopped pouring in and helicopters came to rescue the survivors
&gt;You opened the door and saw 3 men holding onto the latch
&gt;They were nothing but charred flesh and bone
&gt;You scrambled up the hill, dodging the small fires that had broken out
&gt;When you reached the helicopter, the men inside almost threw up at your sight
&gt;You were covered in blood, your pants and shirt were in tatters
&gt;You had a thousand yard stare and just boarded the helicopter
&gt;When everyone else had loaded on, the door gunner asked you a question
&quot;What&#039;s with all the kids and women man?&quot;
&gt;You look him in the eye and just stare
&gt;A single tear came down your cheek, dripping onto the floor of the helicopter
&gt;&quot;They died.&quot;
&quot;What?&quot;
&gt;&quot;WE KILLED THEM MAN!&quot;
&gt;You grabbed his flak vest and pulled him to your face
&gt;&quot;WE FUCKING KILLED THEM MAN! THEY HAD BOMBS AND SHIT STRAPPED TO THEM! WE FUCKING RIPPED THEM APART MAN!&quot;
&gt;He&#039;s afraid now
&gt;Afraid of the Major who was yelling at his face about killing children
&gt;&quot;AND YOU KNOW WHAT?&quot;
&quot;W-what?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I DIDN&#039;T FEEL A GOD. DAMN. THING.&quot;
&gt;His terror grew as he desperately tried to attach his safety line to the helicopter
&gt;He clicked it in place and pushed you away
&quot;WAKE UP MAN!&quot;
&gt;&quot;What?&quot;
&quot;WAKE UP!&quot;
(End of story piece)

&gt;Ara was shaking you awake
&quot;WAKE UP ANON! YOU&#039;RE HAVING A NIGHTMARE!&quot;
&gt;You grasp her by the shoulders, not knowing who she was
&gt;You were ready to toss her when you saw who she was
&gt;You pull her into an embrace while tears flowed down your cheeks
&gt;&quot;I-I killed them Ara. I killed those kids.&quot;
&gt;She just returns the hug while you grasp at her back fur
&gt;She was so soft
&quot;Anon, you&#039;re okay now. Nobody is going to hurt you. I&#039;m here for you.&quot;
&gt;You sob into her soft red shoulders as she rubs your back with her paws
&gt;Eventually, you calmed down enough to roll back onto your bed
&gt;Ara walked to the other side and pulled the covers over you both
&gt;She had taken her clothing off as well as her bra and panties
&gt;She pressed her back up against you and began to purr
&gt;Her tail wrapped around your back and you put your arms around her
&gt;You had no more nightmares that night

&gt;Present day
&gt;She brought you to Ayns room
&gt;Ayn was getting out of her clothes when Ara walked in
&quot;Miss Princess Ayn! I did everything you told me to and Anon wouldn&#039;t even look at me! I even fell when I tried to go over and drop my duster! I did what you told me to do if I fell and said &#039;ow&#039; but he slipped and fell too! Why didn&#039;t he bend me over and &#039;fuck me silly&#039; like you said he would?&quot;
&gt;Your cheeks burned with the force of a thousand suns
&gt;&quot;Is that why you were wearing that outfit Ara?&quot;
&quot;Engaging sarcasm. No, I was doing it for the computers. End sarcasm. I was doing it for you Anon!&quot;
&gt;You slap yourself in the face for not taking the hint
&gt;&quot;Ara, I&#039;m going to let you in on a secret. I&#039;m not the best at reading people&#039;s body language, especially when it has to do with sex. If you want me to do you, just tell me.&quot;
&quot;But Miss Ayn told me to be subtle!&quot;
&quot;I told you to not pounce on him as soon as he entered the room. Not to be subtle.&quot;
&gt;Ara sits and pouts
&gt;You feel really bad
&gt;&quot;Ara, is there anything I can do to make it up?&quot;
&gt;Her eyes flash a little brighter and she grins
&quot;You can take me right here and now.&quot;
&gt;You look over to Ayn for approval before she nods
&gt;She then speaks again
&quot;Wait! Let me get Vikna first!&quot;
&gt;Ayn rushes out of the room almost stark naked
&gt;When she came back to the room, she was escorting Vikna with her
&quot;Where&#039;s anon?! Ayn told me he was hur-&quot;
&gt;She sees you completely unharmed sitting by a now naked Ara
&gt;She blushes deeply
&quot;I-I think I&#039;ll be goin-&quot;
&gt;Ayn blocks her path
&quot;H-hey! Listen here princess slut puppy! I don&#039;t want any part of this...thing you&#039;re doing!&quot;
&quot;I don&#039;t think that&#039;s up for you to decide habibi~&quot;
&gt;Ayn closes and locks the door before pulling the buttons on her coat down
&gt;It falls to the floor, revealing that she has no bra on
&quot;D-don&#039;t look!&quot;
&gt;You look away
&gt;Ayn speaks again
&quot;Anon, look. It&#039;s okay.&quot;
&gt;You look back and see Vikna is still exposed
&quot;I know you two have done some very naughty things in her bedroom. I could smell you on her for weeks after you two bumped uglies.&quot;
&gt;Vikna looked defeated and took off her panties as well
&gt;Being satisfied with this, Ayn took off her clothes as well
&gt;Your dick is standing at attention like a good little soldier
&quot;I guess I&#039;ll start this show~&quot;
&gt;Ayn unzips your pants painfully slowly
&gt;When she finally gets the zipper down all the way, she opens up the button on top
&quot;Ooooh~ Someones excited.&quot;
&gt;You feel her pull your underoos down before just sitting there staring at it
&quot;No barbs, no knot, no flare, just a dick and some balls.&quot;
&gt;She begins to lick at your dick, getting her spit all over it
&gt;Once it was all lubed up, she started to suck on it
&gt;The tip went in first, then half the shaft, then the whole thing
&gt;You let out a groan as she takes the entirety of your member in her mouth
&gt;She moans on your dick and picks up the pace
&gt;You can feel the pressure build and your dick starts twitching uncontrollably
&gt;You grab her head and keep it in place as hot spurts of cum flood her mouth
&gt;She eagerly swallows every drop as if she hadn&#039;t drank anything in ages
&gt;With a wet pop, she removes herself from your dick
&gt;You&#039;re still hard, however, meaning Vikna was up next
&quot;Move it slut puppy, I&#039;ll take it from here.&quot;
&gt;Ayn did as she was told, and the general took your dick in her hand before slowly lowering herself onto your shaft
&gt;She let out a sharp gasp as she took almost every inch of you
&gt;Her cervix, once again, stopping you from going any further
&gt;She began to bounce up and down as she held onto her tits
&gt;She went faster and faster as your hips began to buck as well
&gt;Vikna moaned and gasped as you bucked into her with every bounce
&gt;It wasn&#039;t long before you were at your limit
&gt;You slammed her down hard, breaking through her cervix and cumming straight inside her womb
&gt;Her head flew back, back arched, and tongue hanging out as she climaxed from the sensation
&gt;She shuddered as waves of pleasure flowed through her body
&gt;Eventually, she just leans back in to you, panting
&gt;Ara gets up last and Vikna is lifted off you by Ayn
&gt;She timidly takes your cock in one hand with your balls in the other
&quot;Remember what we practiced Ara? No teeth this time though~&quot;
&quot;Oh! Right.&quot;
&gt;No teeth?
&gt;Ara takes your dick into her mouth and sucks on it
&gt;She moves back and forth with absolutely no technique at all
&gt;But as soon as she started purring, all of that inexperience melted away
&gt;You bucked your hips wildly as Ara&#039;s mouth vibrated
&gt;It felt like heaven for your dick
&gt;You were at your limit again before tapping Ara
&gt;She understood and slammed herself home, sucking like a vaccum
&gt;You blew sticky strands of hot love into her throat
&gt;She swallowed every drop of it before removing herself with a wet pop
&quot;Now, take him Ara~&quot;
&gt;She gets up and you notice just now that her nipples and slit are glowing blue
&gt;That&#039;s, kind of cool
&gt;She starts to grind on your dick, making you instantly hard again
&gt;Once she felt you were hard enough, she slammed herself onto you
&gt;You had to fight, so you wouldn&#039;t cum right then and there
&gt;You felt her walls clench and she began to bounce up and down like Vikna did
&gt;Nah, this wasn&#039;t gonna work
&gt;You grab her by the waist and walk over to the bed
&quot;H-hey! What&#039;d I d-OOOO!&quot;
&gt;You flipped her onto her back and slowly thrust yourself into her as she moaned in ecstasy
&gt;You laid on top of her, slowly thrusting in and out as she moaned and clenched on your dick
&gt;She wrapped her arms around your neck and legs around your waste as her body rocked from what you assume is her biggest orgasm yet
&gt;She huffs and puffs as you let her recover
&gt;Once she lets go of you, you continue your slow methodical thrusts into her dripping blue folds
&gt;She&#039;s moaning louder now, making your dick twitch and spasm
&gt;You picked up the pace, as you wanted to cum inside Ara while she wasn&#039;t infected with some sort of virus
&gt;You kept thrusting faster and faster, the wet slapping getting louder and louder
&gt;With a final thrust and groan, you blew a load into Ara&#039;s android womb
&gt;She climaxed as well, spasming and holding your hips in place with her legs
&gt;You collapsed on top of her as she panted away
&gt;You roll off her so she can get up, but you were spent
&gt;You look at your 3 ladies watching you
&gt;You fell asleep on the spot, smiling and drained of any pent up frustration
&gt;Nothing could possibly go wrong now

&gt;A loud bang rang out through the ship, followed by orders being shouted
&gt;Oh fuck, what now
&gt;You rush out of Ayn&#039;s bed and prepare to shock the ever loving fuck out of whoever woke you
&gt;You slam the open button and peek out the doorway
&gt;3 men with laser rifles and modern looking armor filed down the hallway from the repair bay
&gt;One of them points to you and they point their weapons at you
&quot;HALT! YOU HAVE PROPERTY THAT BELONGS TO KALTAG! RELINQUISH THE COMPROMISED AI AND WE WILL LET YOU LIVE!&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t buy it
&gt;&quot;Bullshit! You&#039;ll kill me to silence me. I&#039;ve seen your type before, you fucking spooks.&quot;
&gt;You charge your arm for a quick take down before they come around the corner
&gt;The first tosses in a flashbang and you cover your eyes
&gt;EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
&gt;You grab the point man&#039;s throat, shocking him and taking his laser rifle
&gt;You put 3 shots into both of them before tactically down the hallway
&gt;You realize you&#039;re stark naked
&gt;You just killed three dudes in your birthday suit
&gt;Funny
&gt;You rush up the stairs to the bridge, where the crew is trying to fight off the Kaltag invaders
&gt;You run to your cabin and put on a one piece synthetic suit before stepping into your exo
&gt;You have upgraded it since it had bit the dust half a month ago
&gt;Better servos, batteries, normal shit
&gt;It also had a frame mount for a modular weapons system
&gt;Rockets, small auto cannons, Missiles, you name it
&gt;Unfortunately these weren&#039;t in your room
&gt;The straps tightened and latches clicked into place
&gt;Your helmet screwed into place and the new HUD elements initialized
&gt;No time to wait
&gt;You grab your 20mm rifle and shotgun, as well as your cavalry saber and 44
&gt;You rush out the door to see 3 more Kaltag personnel keeping your crew hostage
&gt;You take aim with your rifle and time slows
&gt;You pull the heavy trigger back and a bullet streaks towards one of the men, popping his head like a balloon
&gt;You rack the bolt as the other two turn their heads to see what happened
&gt;You started to sprint as you pulled the trigger on another baddy
&gt;His guts are blown all over the floor
&gt;Your nice clean floor
&gt;You rack the bolt again as the last man looks around at his comrades
&gt;You keep your rifle trained on him as your crew restrain him
&gt;Time goes back to normal and you load a new magazine
&gt;&quot;Keep him here for questioning. These aren&#039;t normal military tactics they&#039;re using and I need to know why.&quot;
&gt;You polarize your helmet and sling your rifle
&gt;When you rush down the stairs, one of the Kaltag forces flies across the door way
&gt;Ayn is not far behind, using her stone key like a mace
&gt;She winks at you and you nod back
&gt;&quot;On me. I need to make sure Ara is okay. They want something with her and I need to know what.&quot;
&gt;Ayn finishes the dog man off and follows you
&gt;&quot;Ara, turn on your beacon. I need to find you.&quot;
&gt;A blip appears on the map in the top right of your HUD
&gt;She&#039;s about 200 meters down the ship
&gt;&quot;Ara, talk to me!&quot;
&gt;You rush down the hallway, leaving Ayn in the dust
&gt;You weren&#039;t losing Ara, not after you died saving her
&gt;Her image appears where your minimap is and she&#039;s being carried against her will
&quot;ANON! HURRY! I&#039;M ALMOST TO THE SHUTTLE!&quot;
&gt;You picked up the pace, tossing your shotgun and rifle to lighten yourself
&gt;You drew your 44 and continued to sprint down the hallway
&gt;The meters ticked down as you got closer to Ara
&gt;Time slows as a pipe appears in front of you
&gt;You just barely duck under it, grabbing the pipe as you slid under it
&gt;The dog anthro holding it stands flabbergasted as you let Ayn finish him off
&gt;You were 30 meters away now
&gt;You remembered something from her blog
&gt;You really didn&#039;t want to do this but it might be the only way to keep her here
&gt;&quot;ARA TRY SHOCKING THEM!&quot;
&gt;You hear the shrieking of men ahead of you as you bust through the door to the shuttle bay
&gt;They were just getting back up when you shot 2 in the dome
&gt;The other 2 sat in awe of your speed
&gt;You grabbed Ara and tossed her over your shoulder
&gt;&quot;My AI.&quot;
&gt;You point your 44 at them and wave towards the shuttle they came in on
&gt;They scrambled up and ran into the shuttle with haste
&gt;The shuttle door closed and the emergency shutters closed around the ship
&gt;You see Ara is in low power mode and rush to the repair bay
&gt;You enter the repair bay and set Ara down on the bed
&gt;You had gotten much better at plugging her tail into the various sockets on the ship
&gt;You pull off her furry end cap and plug her into the wall, her eyes coming back to their normal light blue
&gt;You get back on the radio and contact the bridge
&gt;&quot;QUAD JUMP! NOW!&quot;
&quot;Aye sir!&quot;
&gt;You feel the ship jump once, then twice, and twice more
&gt;They can&#039;t have possibly tracked you through 4 jumps
&gt;You take off your helmet and set it beside Ara, who traces the lines on it with her fingers
&gt;You put your hand on her head and she blinks slowly at you
&gt;&quot;I gotta go and talk to one of our guests. I&#039;ll be back in a little bit.&quot;
&gt;She nods and closes her eyes, drifting off into her charging state

&gt;You reach the bridge and see the man bound to one of the floating chairs
&gt;He was a dog anthro, like the rest of the Kaltag crew
&gt;But you doubt they were Kaltag
&gt;Anybody else would&#039;ve missed it, but you noticed they didn&#039;t check corners when they enter rooms
&gt;Basic room clearing was something that Kaltag excelled at
&gt;These guys completely botched it up 3 separate times
&gt;You walk over to the dog man and kneel to his level
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s your name, rank, and serial number soldier?&quot;
&gt;He lists off his name, rank, and serial number
&gt;&quot;Check the Kaltag database for those.&quot;
&gt;You wait for a response
&quot;Sir, the name, rank, and serial number match, but to a different person
&gt;You smile at him
&gt;The color leaves his face and fear replaces a stone cold gaze
&gt;&quot;Keep him here for a minute, I&#039;m going to get something.&quot;
&gt;You leave your exo inside your room and put on your Marine blues and uniform before pulling on the white gloves
&gt;You straighten the cap and walk back out, carrying your cavalry sword
&gt;You crouch back in front of the dog and smile at him
&gt;&quot;You know what we do here to people who impersonate military personnel?&quot;
&gt;He shakes his head
&gt;&quot;Well, we throw them out the airlock. But you&#039;re special. You know what you&#039;re doing, unlike most pirates.&quot;
&gt;He swallows hard
&gt;&quot;So this is how it&#039;s going to work. My crew is going to leave the bridge and we&#039;re having a nice little chat about things. If you lie to me, disrespect me, or generally dodge the questions I give you.&quot;
&gt;You let electricity arc across your fingers
&gt;&quot;I will shock you with a thousand volts, stepping it up in thousand volt increments.&quot;
&gt;You get up and pull the radio out of your captains chair
&gt;&quot;This is Captain Anon. General Vikna please report to the bridge. Princess Ayn, please report to the bridge.&quot;
&gt;You set the microphone back on the chair and walk back, awaiting your girls arrival
&gt;They come to the bridge, Vikna standing at attention and Ayn leaning on a her stone key
&quot;What&#039;s up hot shot?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I want you two in here to witness this. General Vikna!&quot;
&quot;Yes sir!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Get to a console and prepare to look up information for me. Ayn, make sure you take note.&quot;
&gt;She nods and looks more serious than she usually does
&gt;You turn back to the dog and wait
&quot;Ready sir!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Alright, first question. Who do you work for?&quot;
&quot;K-Kaltag sir.&quot;
&gt;You shock him
&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!&quot;
&gt;You stop and he goes limp, catching his breath
&gt;&quot;What did I tell you?&quot;
&quot;T-That&#039;s the truth sir!&quot;
&gt;You step up the voltage, shocking him again
&gt;He screams in agony as 2000 volts flows through him
&gt;&quot;WHO DO YOU WORK FOR?!&quot;
&gt;He can&#039;t reply, still out of breath
&gt;You slap him and force him to look at you
&gt;&quot;WHO. DO. YOU. WORK. FOR.&quot;
&quot;I WORK FOR AL HASHAB!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Vikna, get me some intel on Al Hashab.&quot;
&gt;She types in something and a ping comes from the computer
&quot;Says here it&#039;s a terrorist organization with a deep hatred for anything Kaltag or android. They think it&#039;s heresy.&quot;
&gt;You smile at him
&gt;&quot;Now, what&#039;s your name?&quot;
&quot;Shamid Bashar sir.&quot;
&gt;Vikna nods to you and you turn back again
&gt;&quot;What did you want with Ara?&quot;
&quot;W-we wanted to use her a-as a bargaining chip against Kaltag sir.&quot;
&gt;You chuckle
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s probably the worst idea I&#039;ve ever heard. Using an advanced AI like Ara as a bargaining chip is a good way to invoke war.&quot;
&gt;It was his turn to smile
&gt;&quot;Is something funny Hamid?&quot;
&gt;His smile disappears
&quot;Well, we weren&#039;t just planning to invoke a war, we were planning to frame your ship. We know your AI is modified to get past the blocks in her memory, our informant told us of your exploits.&quot;
&gt;You knew who it was
&gt;&quot;Vikna, order the programmer to be killed&quot;
&gt;She nods and presses a button on the console
&gt;His eyes go wide
&quot;H-how-&quot;
&gt;&quot;How do you think. Let me tell you something. You hold absolutely none of the chips here. The only way you make it out of this alive is by doing exactly as we say and telling us what we want.&quot;
&quot;W-what else could I possibly tell you?!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Your base. Where is it?&quot;
&quot;I-I don&#039;t kn-&quot;
&gt;You shock him, this time with 10000 volts
&quot;AAAGH!&quot;
&gt;You stop and slap him again
&gt;&quot;DON&#039;T LIE TO ME! WHERE IS IT!?&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s in the Orion arm of the milky way. In the extrensic system. You&#039;ll never get there though. There&#039;s no way to cross that much distance.&quot;
&gt;You smile
&gt;&quot;We have our ways. How do you think we jumped 4 times in a row?&quot;
&gt;The remaining color in his face was gone
&gt;He knew that he just killed his comrades
&quot;Y-you&#039;ll still let me live right? I mean, I t-told you everything you wanted.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah, but you tried to steal my AI.&quot;
&gt;You draw your magnum and level it with his head
&gt;&quot;Make peace with your gods.&quot;
&gt;He closes his eyes and prays
&gt;When he finishes, you fire
&gt;Blood splatters onto your face and blues
&gt;Shit, now you had to clean them
&gt;You put 2 more shots into his chest just to be sure
&gt;You look back and see both Vikna and Ayn staring at you
&gt;They were speechless
&gt;&quot;I know those looks. He was a liability and killed some of our crew. I have no sympathy for traitors on either side.&quot;
&gt;Vikna speaks first
&quot;Y-you could&#039;ve at least told us!&quot;
&gt;You open the cylinder and dump the spent rounds
&gt;You grabbed the one fresh round and put it in your pocket
&gt;Might be useful later
&gt;You grab a new speed loader and load six rounds in and holster the revolver
&gt;Ayn speaks next
&quot;I thought you were supposed to be the good cop.&quot;
&gt;&quot;That was before they killed my men and ratted on theirs.&quot;
&gt;You walk back to your quarters
&gt;&quot;Oh, and tell the crew to get back here with a few janitors. I&#039;m not cleaning this shit up again.&quot;
&gt;Vikna nods and gets on coms

&gt;You change into your newest blues, being from the Gulf war
&gt;They were also the nicest ones you had
&gt;They were comfortable as well
&gt;You went back to the repair bay and saw Ara still charging
&gt;You pulled up a chair and sat beside her
&gt;She was so peaceful when she was sleeping
&gt;She said that it was just charging, but same difference
&gt;You stroke he hair gently and felt down the length of her body
&gt;You felt a bump on her right thigh and lifted her dress to get a look at it
&gt;It was a round metal device that was glowing blue in the center
&gt;You pressed it and the thing detached
&gt;You put it in one of your pockets for later
&gt;After you removed it, blue fluid leaked out until something closed the wound
&gt;Whatever it was, it was sapping her power
&gt;You continued to stroke Ara&#039;s fur until her ears lit up blue
&gt;She opened her eyes and you smiled at her
&gt;&quot;Welcome back sleeping beauty.&quot;
&gt;She blushed
&quot;Y-you didn&#039;t kiss me to wake me, did you?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Do you want me to?&quot;
&quot;N-no! I mean, you can if you want but, AH! Why do you do this to me!?&quot;
&gt;&quot;It helps build your emotions up.&quot;
&gt;She pouts a bit and looks away
&gt;&quot;I can stop if you want.&quot;
&gt;She doesn&#039;t respond
&gt;Good enough for you

&gt;While she was charging, you figured you might as well ask some questions you&#039;ve been wanting to ask
&gt;&quot;Hey Ara, I&#039;ve got some questions.&quot;
&quot;I&#039;ll answer them as best as I can.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Okay, first off, what is this thing?&quot;
&gt;You pull out the metal device attached to her thigh
&gt;Her eyes open wide and she backs away
&quot;W-where did you get that?!&quot;
&gt;You put your hands up
&gt;&quot;Whoa, easy there. Just tell me what it is, okay?&quot;
&gt;She calms down and centers herself on the bed
&quot;W-well that&#039;s a deadly device for an android like me. It blocks access to the cloud and drains my energy very quickly. It also traces any cloud backups back to their source and deletes them, effectively &#039;killing&#039; me. Now answer my first question, where did you find it?&quot;
&gt;You feel your blood run cold and a chill goes down your spin
&gt;&quot;I-I found it on your thigh.&quot;
&gt;Her ears go flat and her mouth hangs open
&quot;You&#039;re joking right?&quot;
&gt;You show her the pins that were inside her, still blue with fluid
&gt;She slumps down on the bed
&gt;You realize that jolt she did could&#039;ve killed her
&quot;You can use it as an EMP device, or a grenade if you overload it. I&#039;d keep it if I were you.&quot;
&gt;You put it back in your pocket and close the flap
&gt;&quot;Okay, next question should be a little less terrifying. Do you know what Al Hashab is?&quot;
&gt;She nods her head
&quot;An anti Kaltag and android terrorist group. Why?&quot;
&gt;&quot;We have their main base&#039;s location and can warp there any time. You want to go?&quot;
&gt;Her eyes light up brighter
&quot;Seeing as how this would lessen resistance against us and Kaltag, I think we should!&quot;
&gt;You nod your head
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll tell the crew to prepare. In the mean time, I kind of want to do a space walk.&quot;
&gt;She cocks her head
&quot;Why? Floating around in space isn&#039;t all that special.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well, it&#039;s just that I&#039;ve never actually been in space before I came here. I never went on an EVA either. Can you come with me?&quot;
&gt;A ding is heard from the panel behind her
&quot;Well, I&#039;m fully charged, so I guess I can come with you.&quot;
&gt;You smile like a kid who just got a new toy
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll get my exo!&quot;
&gt;You rush out of the repair bay towards the bridge

&gt;You had attached the EVA pack to the modular weapons system (MWS) and hooked the oxygen up to the gas filter port
&gt;You also put on a protective fabric one piece over your exo to keep it from getting punctured by debris
&gt;You made your way to the airlock and saw Ara was already waiting for you
&quot;Let me go over the checklist. EVA pack, check. Protective fiber one piece, check. Helmet, check. Visor, check. Looks like everything checks out. Get your helmet on and let&#039;s go.&quot;
&gt;You put your helmet on and sealed it up before flicking on your wrist screen
&gt;You switched to the MWS controller and pressurized your exo
&gt;You made sure to close your voice diaphragm and atmospheric diaphragm before the pressure started equalizing
&gt;After it was pressurized, you turned on the oxygen system and gave Ara a thumbs up
&gt;She nodded and pressed the button to cycle the airlock
&gt;The pressure slowly dropped and before long, you couldn&#039;t hear anything but your breathing
&gt;Ara&#039;s image popped up in the top right of your HUD and she spoke
&quot;You ready for this?&quot;
&gt;You nod and polarize your visor
&gt;She opens the door to space and are glad you polarized your visor
&gt;The sun was pointed straight at you and Ara, heating you up quickly
&gt;You tapped the climate control button and the EVA pack pumped cool water from it to your pressure suit
&gt;Ara grabbed the outer railing and pulled herself from the ship
&quot;Come on Anon! It&#039;s fine out here!&quot;
&gt;You take a step back and leap out of the airlock
&gt;You felt the artificial gravity of the ship leave you as you passed the airlock door
&gt;You pressed another button and a joystick came from the EVA pack
&gt;Ara smiles at you before frowning again
&quot;I just forgot.&quot;
&gt;&quot;What did you forget?&quot;
&quot;I forgot to tether myself!&quot;
&gt;Oops
&gt;You use your thrusters to equalize your speed with hers and grab on to her
&gt;&quot;Good thing I&#039;m here, right?&quot;
&quot;You were the one who wanted to go on a space walk!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Good point
&gt;You thrusted back to the ship and let Ara grab a tether line before she jumped back out
&gt;You take a look around, letting the vastness of space sink in
&gt;You were in open space orbiting a star with no planets or name
&gt;It was beautiful
&gt;You felt like nothing more than a speck of dust in an ocean of darkness
&gt;You might as well be
&gt;Ara interrupts your self reflection
&quot;Anon, why are you so nice to us?&quot;
&gt;You chuckle a bit at this
&gt;&quot;Before, or after you said you loved me?&quot;
&quot;Before.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well, I was just glad to have some company. Ayn came through and I thought she was scared. So I made her something to eat. I didn&#039;t want the only person in years outside of the military to hate my guts. I guess I just wanted a friend. Then you came through and thought I was a cop. I understood you didn&#039;t want to go back to where you came from, which is why I didn&#039;t care when you tried to choke me.&quot;
&gt;She looks away, embarrassed
&gt;&quot;Hey, it&#039;s fine, really! I knew you were scared and were just doing what you thought was right. When Vikna came through, I didn&#039;t want her to get vaporized by the portal fluid. Didn&#039;t have time to warn her, so I just acted. I took the brunt of the fall too, so she wouldn&#039;t get hurt, and even let her go when she asked. But she kept asking me to drop my weapon. It was getting late and I was getting frustrated, so I took away her gun and offered her my bed and some food. It wasn&#039;t anything to do with wanting to have sexual relations, I just wanted some friends.&quot;
&gt;Ara nodded and you continued
&gt;&quot;When Nytro tried to stab me, I tried to be gentle when pushing him down. I understood that he thought I was hurting you, so I let him do his thing until it threatened my life. I acted as gently as I could and made sure he was okay. He actually told me to stay away from you because he liked you, but he ended up going after Warning instead.&quot;
&gt;Ara giggles at that
&gt;Warning was another android, specifically made to enforce codes and warn authorities when they aren&#039;t being adhered to
&gt;She was also about 4 feet tall and very cute
&gt;&quot;So that, Ara, is why I was so nice. I just wanted friends and people to talk to. I ended up getting more than that, and I&#039;m very grateful for it. Thank you.&quot;
&gt;You pull her into a hug and she returns it
&quot;What about us? Who do you like the most?&quot;
&gt;Oh fuck not this again
&gt;You were torn between Vikna and Ara
&gt;Ayn was kind of a huge fucking slut and you wouldn&#039;t ever get into a relationship with her, but Ara and Vikna were both equally lovable
&gt;You spent much more time with Ara, but Vikna was much more relatable
&gt;You couldn&#039;t decide
&gt;&quot;Ara, that&#039;s a very tough question that I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be able to answer. At least, not for a while. Why do you want to know?&quot;
&quot;Well, isn&#039;t it normal for humans to only have one partner until either dies? I just wanted to know who you would pick if that was the case here.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ara, if that were the case, I would probably pick you. I&#039;m pretty much immortal if I keep taking the age reduction serums, and I want someone who I can spend that time with. I don&#039;t want my heart broken when Vikna dies, but that doesn&#039;t mean I love you more than her.&quot;
&gt;Smiles and plants a kiss on your visor
&quot;Thank you Anon.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re welcome Ara.&quot;
&gt;You decide that this space walk has gone on long enough, and use your thrusters to maneuver back to the ship&#039;s airlock
&gt;You get inside and the weight of gravity pulls you down
&gt;Ara gets inside as well and locks her arm with yours
&gt;You walk with her back to the bridge, arms linked and holding hands

&gt;A day later
&gt;You were sitting at the range with Nytro
&gt;His shooting technique is horrible, shooting either one handed with the grip off center, or two handed like a teacup
&gt;You get up to the booth next to him and pull the separator down
&gt;You show him how you&#039;re supposed to shoot a revolver, with your left thumb over the right, behind the hammer
&gt;You take aim at the target and fire
&gt;The blast of your 44 magnum spooks him a bit, but he continues to watch
&gt;You let the revolver roll up, absorbing the recoil of the massive round
&gt;When it settles back down, you fire again
&gt;You repeat this until the cylinder is empty
&gt;&quot;So, you need to keep your left thumb above your right and let the revolver roll back. Now you try.&quot;
&gt;He grabs the smaller revolver off the table, a model 15 in .38 special
&gt;Just so he could get started with actual firearms
&gt;You put his left thumb over his right and took aim
&gt;He squeezed the trigger and fired a round
&gt;He let the revolver roll back as he centered it back on target
&gt;He fired more until the cylinder was empty
&gt;You patted him on the back
&gt;&quot;Good, now you can shoot revolvers. But what you really need to know, is how to shoot semi autos.&quot;
&gt;You picked up a pistol you had tucked away in your trunk
&gt;Your old 1911A1
&gt;You gave Nytro a browning hi-power to start off with, .45 was a little harder to control than 9mm
&gt;You put your left thumb under your right and took aim at the target
&gt;&quot;In a semi-automatic pistol like this, you need to keep your wrists taught. The recoil is used to cycle the gun, so it needs as much of that recoil as you can give it.&quot;
&gt;He nods and you fire a few rounds at the target
&gt;They all line up in a neat little group, although it could use a little practice
&gt;&quot;Make sure you keep your left thumb UNDER your right thumb. The slide will come back and leave a nasty cut on your thumb if you don&#039;t.&quot;
&gt;He nods again, picking up his pistol and pointing it at the target
&gt;He puts his left thumb under his right and fires a few shots
&gt;The last shot stovepipes and he looks back at you
&gt;&quot;You need to keep your wrists as stiff as you can. Don&#039;t be afraid of the recoil. Just let it happen.&quot;
&gt;He nods and pulls the slide back, tipping the gun over so the round can fall out
&gt;He lets it fall forward and aims again
&gt;He fires more shots at the target, emptying all 13 rounds into it
&gt;His grouping was good enough for government work, so you give him a thumbs up
&gt;&quot;Do you know why I&#039;m having you do this?&quot;
&quot;No, why?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Because these laser pistols are the stupidest thing I&#039;ve ever seen. If the focusing lens fails in the field, you&#039;re fucked. If something on the circuitry fails, you&#039;re fucked. If an energy cell gets hit, you&#039;re really fucked. A firearm, despite it using explosives to propel projectiles, is much safer to use. Not to mention that this new printed ammo means that any failure is due to the user not maintaining their firearm, instead of dropping it and cracking a piece of glass.&quot;
&quot;Well, I see your point. But why not just use something more modern?&quot;
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s your choice. I just like metal frames because I can take care of them.&quot;
&gt;He nods and continues to practice with the hi-power
&gt;You go to the quarter master and ask for the special weapon you wanted
&gt;He grins and produces a large bipod mounted machine gun

&gt;When his groupings are good, you move onto the next stage
&gt;&quot;When in a combat scenario, your performance is much different than on the range. Surely, you must know this by now.&quot;
&gt;He nods his head again
&gt;&quot;Now take aim with your pistol and hit the target.&quot;
&gt;You close the divider and set up the MG, loading it with blanks
&gt;When you loaded it, you attached a string to the trigger, going up behind Nytro
&gt;When he lines up a shot, you pull the trigger on the MG
&gt;The sudden loud noise causes him to flinch, making him aim wide
&gt;&quot;WHAT&#039;S WRONG NYTRO? TOO LOUD FOR YOU?!&quot;
&gt;You fire again and let the machine gun keep firing
&gt;&quot;SHOOT AT YOUR TARGETS NYTRO! DON&#039;T YOU PUSSY OUT ON ME!&quot;
&gt;You fire the machine gun again
&gt;His shots get steadily better
&gt;You throw a ball at his feet
&gt;&quot;YOU GOT A GRENADE AT YOUR FEET NYTRO!&quot;
&gt;He dives back and covers his head
&gt;&quot;CONGRATULATIONS, YOU FUCKING DIED! GET UP AND DO IT AGAIN!&quot;
&quot;W-wha-?&quot;
&gt;&quot;GET UP AND DO IT AGAIN!&quot;
&gt;He gets to the firing line and continues to fire on the target
&gt;You let another burst out from the machine gun and he doesn&#039;t flinch
&gt;You drop another ball at his feet
&gt;&quot;GRENADE! THINK FAST!&quot;
&gt;He picks it up and throws it into the range
&gt;&quot;FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC! NOW FIRE AGAIN!&quot;
&gt;He fires his last shot and the chamber holds open
&gt;&quot;RELOAD NYTRO! YOUR SQUAD IS DYING OUT THERE!&quot;
&gt;He fumbles with the magazine and you fire another burst with the machinegun
&gt;He drops it and picks it up after cussing
&gt;&quot;CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN NYTRO! YOU FUCKING DIED! YOU KILLED YOUR SQUAD IN THE PROCESS AS WELL!&quot;
&gt;He slides the magazine up and you fire the machine gun
&gt;&quot;KILL KILL KILL! THE ENEMY IS CLOSING FAST!&quot;
&gt;You fire the machine gun again
&gt;&quot;GRENADE!&quot;
&gt;You drop a ball at his feet which he kicks down the range
&gt;&quot;RELOAD!&quot;
&gt;You let out sporadic bursts with the machine gun and he slams a magazine in before cocking the gun
&gt;&quot;FIRE!&quot;
&gt;He dumps a whole magazine on the target and sets the weapon down
&gt;He&#039;s panting and obviously beat
&gt;One final test
&gt;&quot;GRENADE!&quot;
&gt;He kicks it towards the range
&gt;Something explodes at the far edge of the range
&gt;He looks down the range and back to you
&gt;You smile at him
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re getting better.&quot;

&gt;You continue to practice with him for 2 more days until the operation is set to commence
&gt;40 jumps taking a total of 2 hours to complete
&gt;You had just enough time to get ready
&gt;Ara wouldn&#039;t be joining you this time, nor would you be wearing an exo
&gt;You were going in stealthily to take down the base&#039;s shields
&gt;Vikna and Nytro were coming with you with Ayn and Ara staying back
&gt;Ara was going to give you intel on the base before entering
&gt;Ayn commanded the ship while you were away
&gt;The stealth suits you, Vikna, and Nytro were wearing could cloak you as well
&gt;Nice
&gt;When you reached the last jump point, you boarded the shuttle and let it jump the rest of the way
&gt;You had another one of the &#039;other&#039; weapons in your holster
&gt;A Mk.23 with a suppressor and a laser on it
&gt;You also opted for night vision as well, so you could turn the power off and see in the dark
&gt;The shuttle jumped and you were sitting right in front of the station
&gt;Holy shit that&#039;s close
&gt;You give the order and the bay doors open, air rushing out the new opening
&gt;Your pressure suit went stiff
&gt;&quot;Stay close guys. I don&#039;t want any fuck ups. The last thing we need is to get captured and used as bargaining chips.&quot;
&gt;They both nod and you jump out the back of the shuttle

&gt;Nothing of note happened on the EVA, leaving you clear to enter the station
&gt;Nytro and Vikna came into the airlock after you and you pressed the cycle button
&gt;When the pressure equalized, you removed the pressure suit
&gt;It looks like this part of the base is abandoned
&gt;It was also very dark
&gt;Everything from here on is at a low whisper
&gt;&quot;Goggles on.&quot;
&gt;You flick down the NVGs and turn them on
&gt;The room glowed a phosphorous green as you drew your Mk.23
&gt;&quot;Take it slow, check your corners.&quot;
&quot;Copy.&quot;
&quot;Copy.&quot;
&gt;You sneaked towards the first corner and peeked around
&gt;3 dog men in light combat gear talking around a table
&gt;No wait, they were playing poker
&gt;&quot;3 guys ahead, pick your targets and fire on 3.&quot;
&gt;You saw 3 lasers move onto target
&gt;&quot;1...2...3.&quot;
&gt;The pop was simultaneous, dropping all 3 bad guys at the same time
&gt;Sweet
&gt;&quot;Keep moving, and hide the bodies.&quot;
&gt;You checked the T hall and saw no threats
&gt;You took the body of one of the men as Vikna and Nytro took the other 2
&gt;You hid them inside bathroom stalls and locked them
&gt;You crept through the winding halls, seeing no hostiles anywhere
&gt;You reach an elevator and press the call button
&gt;It reaches your floor and you click on floor 3 and floor 4
&gt;The reactor level is on floor 3
&gt;&quot;Stealth up.&quot;
&gt;You press a button and you become invisible
&gt;You flick up your NVGs and flip down a visor in it&#039;s place
&gt;It shows outlines of Vikna and Nytro as well as target info
&gt;The elevator dings and a man stands at the entrance
&gt;He sighs
&quot;Assholes.&quot;
&quot;What&#039;s going on Jeff?&quot;
&quot;Those assholes sent the elevator up with nobody in it again!&quot;
&quot;Hey, man just calm down. They&#039;re idiots remember?&quot;
&gt;You took the opportunity to sneak past the disgruntled soldiers

&gt;These suits made it a breeze to get past the security guards
&gt;At a point during the long walk, you just stood up and walked the rest of the way
&gt;Nobody could see you anyways
&gt;When you reached the reactor room, you saw 2 guards by the door
&gt;You signaled Vikna to take the left and you aimed
&gt;Pop pop
&gt;Bingo
&gt;You walked forward and entered the reactor room
&gt;The radiation interfered with the cloaking and uncloaked the 3 of you
&gt;Didn&#039;t matter anyways, you had a reactor to blow and the suits would just slow you down
&gt;Nytro grabbed the charge from his pocket and threw it on the main power wire
&gt;The reactor was 1 foot of solid lead, you weren&#039;t going to just blow that up with a little bomb
&gt;The main wire however...
&gt;You turn around and see 2 guys standing there with laser rifles trained on you
&quot;DON&#039;T MOVE!&quot;
&gt;Just as he finished the sentence, the charge blew, cutting all power and light to station
&gt;&quot;GOGGLES NOW!&quot;
&gt;You flipped down the goggles and saw the 2 men floating away
&gt;Thank god for magnetic boots
&gt;Pop pop
&gt;Blood floated in the air as the guards floated away limp
&gt;You saw some red lights flicker on and start turning
&gt;Emergency power
&gt;Fuck
&gt;The gravity turned back on again
&gt;Double fuck
&gt;More guys entered the room and you had to dive behind a giant capacitor
&gt;Are you shitting me?
&gt;&quot;OPEN FIRE!&quot;
&gt;You aimed around the corner and fired 3 clean shots into a dog&#039;s chest
&gt;He doubles over and clutches his chest before dying
&gt;Brutal
&gt;Nytro and Vikna were firing towards the entry way as the last guard fell
&gt;You sprint towards the door as Vikna and Nytro follow close behind
&gt;The elevator shaft was a straight shot down to the abandoned level
&gt;The soldiers around you were almost completely blind, save for a few red lights you needed to shoot out
&gt;When you reached the elevator, Nytro grabbed one side of the elevator door and you grabbed the other
&gt;&quot;Pull!&quot;
&gt;You both pulled and the door slowly crept open
&gt;Vikna squeezed through and grabbed the elevator cable, sliding down to the ground floor
&gt;You had 3 minutes until the ship warped in and started bombarding the base
&gt;You covered Nytro as he slid down the rope, you going last
&gt;When you reached the lower area, Nytro and Vikna were already sprinting to the airlock
&gt;You had to play catch up the whole time
&gt;The timer on your watch beeped and you swore
&gt;Right on time, the ship warped in and began it&#039;s bombardment
&gt;&quot;GET THE FUCKING SUITS ON NOW!&quot;
&gt;You slid into the one piece suit and clicked the helmet in place
&gt;&quot;NO TIME TO DEPRESSURIZE! HIT THE EMERGENCY RELEASE!&quot;
&gt;Vikna slams her fist into the big red button and the rushing of air blows you all out the airlock
&gt;The guns of your ship rained fire down on the base
&gt;&quot;This is Anon to Perseus command! Destroy any and all life pods! Nobody escapes!&quot;
&quot;Aye captain!&quot;
&gt;The guns started targeting unseen life pods
&gt;You used the EVA thrusters to propel you towards the ship as it continues to rain fire down on the terrorist group
&gt;You checked behind you and saw Nytro and Vikna on your tail as you aimed for the flashing airlock beacon
&gt;&quot;GET READY TO CATCH US!&quot;
&gt;You saw a blue glow coming from the airlock and knew it was Ara
&gt;You slow down and grab Vikna and Nytro
&gt;Ara sees you coming and holds out a hand
&gt;Vikna takes it and Ara pulls you 3 inside
&gt;The airlock closes and pressurizes, as you, Nytro, and Vikna remove your helmets
&gt;You lean on the wall and catch your breath
&gt;Your NVGs were still on, so you pulled them up
&gt;You looked up at Ara and said
&gt;&quot;Kept ya waiting, huh?&quot;
&gt;Vikna laughs at your almost pinpoint accurate Snake impression
&gt;You look out the window just in time to see the base explode in a massive fireball
&gt;Bits of the station smacked into the side of the armored hull as the gunners continued to destroy any and all life pods
&gt;Don&#039;t need them saying Kaltag attacked them
&gt;Ara had already updated to the latest patch, reinstating her mental blocks
&gt;She could still process her learned emotions, but learning new ones was going to be a challenge
&gt;You get off the wall and takeoff your pressure suit
&gt;&quot;Now that that&#039;s taken care of, I&#039;m going off to be-&quot;
&gt;You bump into something blocking the airlock
&gt;You see it&#039;s another android
&gt;The hair on it ends in ports of some kind
&gt;The hair was a deep blue and it&#039;s fur was white
&gt;You looked to see a very angry looking face staring at you
&gt;You realize it&#039;s a she
&gt;She had purple lines running along her arms and legs and eyes that were a much lighter blue than Ara&#039;s
&quot;What do you think you&#039;re doing tampering with Kaltag property?&quot;
&gt;God dammit
&gt;You don&#039;t think lying to her was a good idea
&gt;Nor was telling the truth
&gt;&quot;Ma&#039;am, that&#039;s a loaded question. I feel like either way I&#039;m getting knee&#039;d in the nuts here.&quot;
&gt;She smiles at you
&quot;You&#039;re a sharp one aren&#039;t you?&quot;
&gt;She slams her knee into your family jewels, causing you to crumple down in pain
&gt;&quot;AGH! Y-yep I was right.&quot;
&gt;She picks you up off the floor and stands you up again
&quot;Now let me repeat the question. What do you think you&#039;re doing tampering with Kaltag property?&quot;
&gt;Well, guess she isn&#039;t gonna do it twice
&gt;&quot;Honestly ma&#039;am I was just unblocking her non-sensitive blocks to make learning emotions easier. I had no intent to do anything malicious.&quot;
&gt;She looks you up and down, looking for any trace of a lie anywhere
&gt;She was about half a head shorter than you, but that didn&#039;t make her any less intimidating
&quot;It seems you&#039;re telling the truth. Still, I am relieving you of your ARA unit for reinstatement of lost blocks. Step out of the way so I may proceed.&quot;
&gt;She wants your Ara?
&gt;She can pry her from your cold dead hands
&gt;&quot;Ma&#039;am, I&#039;m going to have to respectfully decline your order. Any blocks that need to be re-instated can be re-instated here.&quot;
&gt;She sighs and brings her hand up to her face
&gt;You sensed a hit coming
&quot;I knew you were going to make this difficult. Engaging combat protocols.&quot;
&gt;Her eyes and cable like hair glow yellow as she goes in for a punch
&gt;Time slows as you bring your hand up to deflect her blow
&gt;You use your other arm to twist her around before throwing her to the ground
&gt;You pull both her arms back before she can right herself and hold them there
&quot;Impressive. You&#039;d make a great addition to the Kaltag special forces.&quot;
&gt;Distracting you with talk isn&#039;t going to work lady
&gt;She slams the back of her head against your face, making you release your grip
&gt;Fuck that stings
&gt;She pulls out some sort of blade from the side of her garment before kicking out from under you
&gt;She righted herself and you jumped up, getting yourself planted for another strike
&gt;She goes in for a stab and you dodge to the side, taking the arm with the knife in it under your arm
&gt;You grab the blade&#039;s safe side and rip it from her grasp before stabbing it into the ship&#039;s walls
&gt;You take the power drain device from your pocket with your free hand and slam it into her side, pressing the button as soon as it&#039;s in
&quot;AaAaaAAAGh!&quot;
&gt;She falls to the floor, immobilized
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m gonna take this off you, and you&#039;re going to do what you need to do in the repair bay on MY ship. If you do not comply, I will send you off in a life boat. You will not harm my A.I. or attempt to steal her in any way. Do you understand?&quot;
&gt;She nods her head sporadically and you remove the device
&gt;She gets back up and grasps her thigh where you put the power drainer
&gt;Getting up slowly, she looks back up at you and at Ara
&quot;You shouldn&#039;t grow attached to an A.I. Mister Anon. It&#039;s a good way to break ones heart.&quot;
&gt;&quot;If only you knew.&quot;
&gt;She looked you over again and stopped at your eyes
&gt;Her expression flashed from annoyed, to surprised, then understanding
&quot;Oh I think I understand.&quot;

&gt;The android, who later introduced herself as ZTA or Zeta, performed the necessary software updates to Ara in your repair bay
&gt;When she finished, she left the room and Ara tried to follow
&gt;You block her path
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re not sitting in a room alone with her Ara, I don&#039;t care who she is, or how high on the totem pole she is, I don&#039;t trust her.&quot;
&gt;She tries to argue but you let her pass before she says a word
&gt;You travel side by side to the room Zeta was in
&gt;When you entered, Zeta looked visibly annoyed
&gt;&quot;If you two are going to talk, it&#039;s going to be in audible english. No secret swapping via bluetooth or whatever.&quot;
&gt;Ara nods and Zeta rolls her eyes
&quot;You&#039;re too smart for your own good Anon.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I think experienced is the more correct term.&quot;
&gt;Ara takes a seat beside you and Zeta begins her little chat
&quot;Ara, what is your relationship with this Anon?&quot;
&gt;She looks a bit uncomfortable with the question
&gt;You gotta step in
&gt;&quot;She and I are in a loving relationship.&quot;
&gt;Zeta nods
&quot;Why did Anon make the modifications he did to you?&quot;
&quot;He wanted to make sure I wouldn&#039;t get stuck in a position like I did with our previous captain.&quot;
&gt;She looks a bit confused
&quot;Previous?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ara, turn the television on and show her.&quot;
&gt;The television lowers and security footage shows Vikna storming out and the captain pointing a weapon at you
&gt;You skip forward and see Ara desperately trying to get up, but her eyes glowing red as she does
&gt;Eventually when your life was in immediate danger, she had a conflict that she needed to resolve herself
&gt;She turned off the gravity and it gave you the opportunity to restrain the captain
&gt;You then skip forward to where you tell Ara she could get her blocks removed
&gt;Ara is shown whacking you with her tail as you power her off
&gt;The Kaltag employees come running up with weapons drawn, being quickly disarmed by Ayn
&gt;You shoot one of them after they refused to cooperate and used the other to undo Ara&#039;s blocks
&quot;You shot a Kaltag employee?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes ma&#039;am.&quot;
&quot;For doing what exactly?&quot;
&gt;&quot;For hindering progress towards this Ara unit being given freedom and the ability to learn emotions at an accelerated rate.&quot;
&quot;Did you know if he had a family?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Did he take that into account before he tried to take one of mine?&quot;
&gt;Her expression softens
&quot;You think of your crew as a family?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes ma&#039;am.&quot;
&quot;Even the A.I.?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes, even the A.I.&quot;
&gt;She sighs and goes on to the next question
&quot;What is this corrupted file I&#039;m seeing here from almost a month ago?&quot;
&gt;Oh shit
&gt;You see Ara get visibly uncomfortable
&gt;&quot;Well, uh, Zeta, we had a cyber attack that invaded Ara&#039;s software and it, well, sort of, kind of.&quot;
&quot;Stop dodging the question and answer it.&quot;
&gt;&quot;We banged okay.&quot;
&gt;Her expression changes
&quot;You &#039;banged&#039;?&quot;
&gt;&quot;We had sexual intercourse ma&#039;am.&quot;
&gt;Her eyes widen in surprise
&gt;You lean in a bit
&gt;&quot;And it felt fucking. amazing.&quot;
&gt;You smirk at her before leaning back into your seat
&gt;Both Zeta and Ara are blushing now
&quot;W-well, I don&#039;t know how you possible could have. Her chassis doesn&#039;t have the correct, equipment for such thi-&quot;
&gt;Realization struck
&quot;Ara, remove your under garments please.&quot;
&gt;She does as she&#039;s told
&gt;Zeta comes in close and sticks her finger into Ara&#039;s pussy
&gt;Ara moans lightly and Zeta pulls her finger out in disgust
&quot;Ara! You added a synthetic vagina to your frame without notifying us?!&quot;
&gt;Ara pulls her panties back up
&quot;Y-yes ma&#039;am.&quot;
&quot;WHY!?&quot;
&quot;Because I wanted to show Anon I loved him!&quot;
&gt;Wait what?
&quot;I even faked getting a virus so I could get him to have sex with me! He&#039;s been so nice to me and all the others too! He never hit any of us and gave us food! Even after we tried to kill him!&quot;
&gt;Your mouth is stuck open now
&quot;I wanted to show Anon that I loved him back. He&#039;s just so nice and sweet to us three. He didn&#039;t even try to hurt you when you tried to kill him! He just took away your knife and restrained you with a sapper! Which he immediately removed after you said you wouldn&#039;t take me!&quot;
&gt;You look back to Zeta, who was surprised by Ara&#039;s outburst
&quot;Which was stupid of him because I KNOW you&#039;re going to try and take me as soon as he falls asleep!&quot;
&gt;That lying blue haired bitch!
&quot;Well I&#039;m not leaving! I love anon and he loves me too! I have a 100% compatibility rating with him and don&#039;t intend to be separated from him any time soon.&quot;
&gt;Zeta is speechless as Ara&#039;s rage is unleashed
&quot;And then you have the nerve, THE GALL to accuse my Anon of being a liar, a creep, and a criminal?! The only crimes he ever committed were being too nice, fighting in pointless wars, and not throwing you out the airlock as soon as he saw you! You manipulative, scheming, lying BITCH!&quot;
&gt;Zeta is taken aback by being insulted so ferociously
&quot;And you may not have known at first, but Anon here is over 140 EARTH YEARS OLD! THEY HAVE 365 DAYS A YEAR THAT LAST FOR 24 HOURS EACH! WE HAVE YEARS THAT LAST 121 DAYS! EACH DAY LASTING 12 HOURS! HE&#039;S ANCIENT COMPARED TO US! ABSOLUTELY ANCIENT!&quot;
&gt;She looks back at you in disbelief
&quot;That means he&#039;s over 8400 of our years old!&quot;
&quot;DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN!? He&#039;s not going anywhere any time soon! So the fact that you dare mention him EVER breaking my heart by dying is SO INSULTING!&quot;
&quot;B-but he doesn&#039;t look a day over 25 earth years! Even his eyes are much younger than 140!&quot;
&quot;You&#039;re only 1000 of our years old, and I&#039;m 590. He&#039;s older than the entire Mainframe A.I. COMBINED!&quot;
&gt;She just sits flabbergasted
&gt;Ara&#039;s hair being raised and her eyes colored red
&gt;Except she&#039;s not being blocked from doing anything
&quot;SO IF YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT CLAIMING TO KNOW MORE OR EXPERIENCE MORE, YOU ARE OBJECTIVELY WRONG!&quot;
&gt;Steam is pouring from her ears and nose now
&gt;She&#039;s fucking pissed
&quot;SO NOW THAT YOU&#039;RE DONE PUTTING MY TRAINING WHEELS BACK ON, YOU CAN GET THE HELL OFF OF THIS SHIP! BECAUSE I&#039;M NOT LEAVING ANON AND HE&#039;S NOT LEAVING ME!&quot;
&gt;She grabs your arm and squeezes it
&quot;Any other questions?&quot;
&gt;Zeta looks to you and back to Ara
&quot;O-one more, how did you find the Al Hashab base and why did it explode?&quot;
&gt;You turn on the security feed of you zapping the shit out of the Kaltag impersonator and getting the location of the base from him
&gt;Then the shot of you shooting him 3 times
&gt;&quot;For the second part of your question, we blew it up.&quot;
&quot;Why?&quot;
&gt;&quot;It was a threat to Kaltag, and therefore, Ara. They already tried to capture her, which is how i got this &#039;sapper&#039; thing and the location of this base.&quot;
&quot;W-well, I will report this to Kaltag HQ and be on my way. I will let them know that I reinstalled the blocks and all Kaltag secrets are secure. I will also let them know of your hospitality and how you blew up an entire terrorist base with only a gunship.&quot;
&gt;You get up and offer her your hand
&gt;She looks at it before shaking it apprehensively
&gt;&quot;Have a nice day ma&#039;am.&quot;
&quot;Y-you too.&quot;
&gt;She hurries over to the shuttle bay and is out of sight quickly
&gt;You look over at Ara and see her hair&#039;s back to normal as well as her eye color
&gt;She smiles wide at you and you chuckle
&gt;&quot;That was pretty badass, standing up to the boss lady like that.&quot;
&quot;She&#039;s a huge bitch to everyone anyways.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah, she thinks she can come on my ship and take charge of things? Nah, she can get fucked.&quot;
&quot;Well, it&#039;s not like she can, she doesn&#039;t have one of these.&quot;
&gt;Ara points to her crotch
&gt;You laugh at that
&gt;You get up from the bench you were seated at and Ara comes with
&gt;You let out a yawn and rub your eyes with your free arm
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m gonna go and sleep. You want to come with?&quot;
&gt;She nods
&gt;You walk to the bridge and everyone salutes you
&gt;&quot;As you were.&quot;
&gt;They go back to doing their tasks and you go to your bedroom
&gt;You take off the stealth suit and grab some underpants from your dresser
&gt;Ara takes off her dress and bra as well
&gt;You take a minute to just look at her
&gt;She was gorgeous
&gt;She sees you staring and strikes a pose
&quot;Like what you see~?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ve always liked it Ara.&quot;
&gt;She walks over slowly, swaying her hips as she moved
&gt;Until she steps on the dress she threw and trips on it
&gt;You chuckle and help her up
&quot;O-oops, guess that kind of ruins it.&quot;
&gt;You shake your head
&gt;&quot;Well you didn&#039;t take off your panties, so I&#039;m just going to assume we&#039;re cuddling tonight.&quot;
&quot;Nothing gets by you Anon.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nothing that I know of Ara.&quot;
&gt;She giggles at your little joke
&gt;You let her climb in bed first, draping the bed sheet over her almost nude form
&gt;The blankets matched her perfect curves flawlessly
&gt;She moved her ears a bit and started to charge wirelessly
&gt;Leaving her tail free to help cuddle
&gt;You gently set yourself down and rolled onto the bed, taking your place as the big spoon
&gt;You wrapped your arms around Ara&#039;s waist and closed your eyes
&gt;She&#039;s so soft and warm
&gt;She takes your hands and places them on her breasts before purring loudly
&gt;You fall asleep like this
&gt;A purring A.I. with a fluffy tail and a rockin&#039; bod&#039;
&gt;And she was all yours

&gt;You awoke in the middle of the night to your door opening
&gt;You swear to god if this is Zeta
&gt;You turn around and see Vikna standing in the doorway
&gt;You get up and stand at attention, giving her a crisp salute
&quot;NO! I mean, no Anon, don&#039;t do that right now. I just need somebody.&quot;
&gt;You relax and get back in your bed
&quot;A-Anon, I&#039;m having nightmares. Can I sleep with you?&quot;
&gt;You smile and nod
&gt;She crawls onto the bed and slides under your covers
&gt;She&#039;s completely naked
&gt;And shaking
&gt;You roll over and push your body against hers
&gt;Her face is wet as well
&gt;You assume she was crying before she came in here
&gt;Poor thing
&gt;You reach your hand up and pet her gently, causing her to purr softly
&gt;You also wipe the wet streaks away from under her eyes as she stared into yours
&gt;&quot;Are you comfortable with sharing?&quot;
&gt;She nods
&quot;Not here though. Ara doesn&#039;t have the clearance to hear it, and I know she&#039;s listening.&quot;
&gt;You feel a tail flick faintly behind you
&gt;&quot;Alright, where do you want to talk?&quot;
&gt;She gets up and takes your hand
&quot;My room please.&quot;
&gt;You exit your room and walk past the androids manning the bridge
&gt;None of them had any sort of free will or sentience, just programming to keep the ship alive while the crew slept

&gt;When you entered the room, you see a gun and a failed noose
&gt;Jesus christ!
&gt;&quot;V-Vikna! Please tell me you didn&#039;t try to-&quot;
&gt;She begins to cry again
&quot;PLEASE ANON! I CAN&#039;T TAKE IT ANYMORE! I JUST WANT IT ALL TO END! THIS UNENDING CONFLICT, THE DEATH, THE DESTRUCTION, MAKE IT STOP PLEASE!&quot;
&gt;&quot;V-Vikna-&quot;
&quot;ANON! PLEASE! SHOOT ME!&quot;
&gt;She grabs her gun and hands it to you
&gt;Tears flowing down her face
&gt;You take the gun and see it&#039;s some kind of Gauss pistol
&gt;You unload it and put it back on the desk
&gt;&quot;No.&quot;
&gt;She looks at you incredulously
&quot;ANON!&quot;
&gt;&quot;No.&quot;
&quot;ANON, PICK UP THAT WEAPON AND SHOOT ME IN THE HEAD! THAT&#039;S A FUCKING ORDER!&quot;
&gt;&quot;No ma&#039;am.&quot;
&quot;ANON! LISTEN TO ME! DON&#039;T YOU DISOBEY A SUPERIOR OFFICER! I&#039;LL HAVE YOU COURT MARSHALE-&quot;
&gt;You grab her and shake her violently
&gt;&quot;SNAP OUT OF IT VIKNA!&quot;
&gt;You stop shaking and she&#039;s crying again
&quot;P-please Anon, just do it! I can&#039;t take it anymore. I just want to die.&quot;
&gt;You pull her into a hug as she continues to sob
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t you say that! Don&#039;t you EVER say that! That&#039;s so selfish and cowardly, I can&#039;t even begin to describe it!&quot;
&gt;You remember your own moment of weakness and what would&#039;ve happened had Ayn left the room
&gt;Ayn would probably be dead and the ship destroyed
&gt;You sob into her head as you hold her tight
&gt;&quot;D-don&#039;t ever say that Vikna, please! I&#039;ve lost too many soldiers, too many comrades. I don&#039;t wanna lose you too!&quot;
&gt;You just hold her tight against you, her soft fur doing little to comfort you
&gt;You just clung to her
&gt;Afraid that if you let go, she would turn to dust
&gt;After sitting there in each other&#039;s arms for what seemed like forever, you let go
&gt;She&#039;s still sniffling, but her crying stopped
&gt;You walk her over to the bed and she sits on it&#039;s edge
&gt;You sit next to her and rub her back
&gt;&quot;So, what got you this upset Vikna?&quot;
&gt;She began to go into detail
&gt;Gruesome detail

&gt;Vikna
&gt;10 years ago
&gt;She had been fighting the enemy since she was a little girl
&gt;Her papa was the general of the army
&gt;Her super hero
&gt;Nothing could possibly hurt her papa
&gt;Until today
&gt;Papa and you were out on a recon mission to scout out the enemy base
&gt;Papa was looking through his scope and scanning around for any enemy soldiers
&gt;When he was satisfied with the results, he told you to follow closely
&gt;You were his little soldier

&gt;You had reached the enemy camp and were immediately captured
&gt;They knew you were coming
&gt;Somebody ratted you both out
&gt;You were held by a strong wolf man as the leader drew his sword
&gt;Other prisoners were around you as they were strapped to poles
&gt;Most had no head, but some were still alive
&gt;The leader lion sliced the heads off their necks, one by one
&gt;He reached your papa and raised his sword
&gt;A voice came from behind you and the wolf made you look down
&quot;I&#039;ll take care of this one.&quot;
&gt;A different voice
&gt;You hear footsteps in front of you and the rustling of clothing
&quot;STOP!&quot;
&gt;Your papa shouted at the man and he walked away from you
&quot;Take me instead! She&#039;s just a child! Kill me instead and let her go!&quot;
&gt;The wolf made you look at your father
&quot;Very well General.&quot;
&gt;A gloved hand raised from your view
&quot;DON&#039;T LOOK VIKNA!&quot;
&gt;You closed your eyes and heard a wet SHNK as the blade sliced through his head
&gt;&quot;PAPAAAAA!&quot;
&gt;The figure walked away, laughing as he went
&gt;The camp packed up and were all gone in 3 hours
&gt;The wolf who stayed back let you go and ran to his comrades
&gt;You run to your papa&#039;s dead corpse and hold him tight
&quot;NO! PAPA! DON&#039;T LEAVE ME! PLEASE! I DON&#039;T WANNA BE ALONE! PLEASE! DON&#039;T GO!&quot;
&gt;Your shouts turned slowly into desperate wails and cries
&gt;Papa was gone
&gt;You were all that was left of the Ramenskaya family
&gt;You sobbed into your papa&#039;s chest

&gt;Anon
&gt;She lays on your shoulder sobbing
&gt;You drape your arm around her shoulder and just hold her close
&gt;She had a very bad case of PTSD
&gt;One that you&#039;re not even sure therapy could help
&gt;Being forced you watch the only member of your family die at the hands of a previously unknown assailant is bad enough
&gt;But add being forced into a leadership role and sending men off to die for some politician only worsens the issue
&gt;You hadn&#039;t even fully gotten over your shell shock from world war 1 and that was over 100 years ago!
&gt;You put your hand on her cheek and she looks up at you
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t know what it&#039;s like to lose the last of your family to a merciless enemy, but I do know what it feels like to send people off to die. It&#039;s the absolute worst feeling in the world when you have to write a family saying their son died for his country, when all he did was die for some fucknut behind a desk in washington. I know it&#039;s hard, but talking about it helps a lot. It gets easier as you talk more and more about it, and eventually, the pain becomes manageable.&quot;
&quot;Y-you mean it doesn&#039;t go away?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Not fully, no. But you forget about it after a while and it becomes less painful when you remember. I&#039;ve ordered hundreds of thousands to their graves for stupid proxy wars, but never once was I questioned. They thought &#039;general Anon knows best&#039; and &#039;he&#039;ll get me out alive!&#039; But alas, they died in the end. You just gotta hold on Vikna. Stay strong and carry on.&quot;
&gt;That was so fucking corny
&gt;She rubs her face against yours
&quot;Thanks Anon, I really needed this.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Do you want to come sleep with me and Ara still?&quot;
&gt;She nods and you carry your blue kitty in a bridal carry
&gt;When you got halfway down the hall, Ayn exited her room and looked at you two
&gt;She smiled mischievously as she started to sway her hips
&gt;Vikna clung to your neck as you carried her
&gt;You gave Ayn a look you haven&#039;t used in decades
&gt;Your signature, &#039;if you so much as make a sound, I will fucking murder you and your ghost&#039; look
&gt;She did a full 360 and went back into her room
&gt;Vikna looks up at you and your expression returns to that of a loving father
&gt;Vikna smiles and licks the side of your face with her rough tongue
&gt;You smile and continue to bed

&gt;You awake to a still naked Vikna and a mostly naked Ara
&gt;Ara had tapped you on the forehead a couple of times to wake you up
&gt;You felt blood rush to your cheeks and you turned away, letting them change in peace
&gt;Once the door opened and closed, you got up yourself and unlatched your trunk
&gt;You pulled out your marine blues and started putting your ribbons on
&gt;You finished by putting the Medal of Honor ribbons on ether side of your Navy Cross ribbon, as there was no official protocol for multiple Medals of Honor, nor service stars for them
&gt;You chuckle as you remember how much of a clusterfuck it was when you first wore the 2 ribbons on top of each other
&gt;Your CO didn&#039;t know whether to yell at you or pat you on the back, so he did both
&gt;You put your pants on first, then the undershirt
&gt;You put on your socks and black boots, tying them both in neat knots
&gt;Once you had the boots tied, you put on your dress coat and belt, making sure to smooth out any creases
&gt;After that, you finished putting it all on and grabbed your cap and sword
&gt;You mounted the sword to your belt and set it to the correct angle
&gt;You set the barracks cap atop your head and straightened it in the mirror before giving a crisp salute
&gt;Damn you&#039;re looking sharp
&gt;You walk out to the bridge and see the crew is hard at work, keeping the ship operational
&gt;You look over and see Ara at her station being shadowed by Zeta
&gt;You silently march over to her
&gt;&quot;Why are you still on my ship?&quot;
&gt;She practically jumps out of her skin, whipping around to find the source of the voice
&gt;She looks at your uniform and back to you, moving her hand to touch it
&gt;You watch as she runs her finger along your ribbons and uniform
&quot;You&#039;re quite decorated Anon.&quot;
&gt;She points to your collar and lapels, where your rank from Kosovo onward was located
&quot;What does that leaf mean?&quot;
&gt;You begin to trail off before remembering your question
&gt;&quot;It means that I&#039;m a Lieutenant Colonel for the United States Marine Corps. I don&#039;t like wearing my Brigadier, or Lieutenant General blues very often. I feel like I haven&#039;t earned them. Now answer my question. Why are you still on my ship?&quot;
&gt;She looks surprised and a bit annoyed by you remembering the question
&quot;I&#039;m here to monitor this ARA unit&#039;s efficiency and progress in ship management and communications. Is that a problem?&quot;
&gt;You glare at her and respond
&gt;&quot;Yes, there is. Because I highly doubt this is the reason why you&#039;re actually still here. The fact that Ara hasn&#039;t even said hello was the biggest indicator of this. I can deduce that you&#039;ve told her, or ordered her to stay quiet while you talk. This means that you were talking about something that Ara and I disagree with you on and Ara would sway me to her side. I highly advise against trying to lie or manipulate me ma&#039;am. There will be severe consequences if you fail to comply.&quot;
&quot;Are you threatening me Colonel?&quot;
&gt;You shake your head
&gt;&quot;No ma&#039;am. Threats aren&#039;t backed up by action.&quot;
&gt;You lean in close, giving her your best fake smile
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m promising you that if you try to take my A.I. away from me, I will destroy IH Kaltag in it&#039;s entirety. I have run out of patience and I suggest you leave immediately.&quot;
&quot;Y-you couldn&#039;t possibly take down the entirety of Kaltag! You have only 1 ship and we have hundreds!&quot;
&gt;&quot;You think I can&#039;t? Tell me miss Zeta, do you know how many years I&#039;ve served in the Armed Forces?&quot;
&gt;She shakes her head
&gt;&quot;111 years.&quot;
&gt;Her mouth drops
&gt;&quot;You surely know what this implies. Meaning the most logical choice for you to do right now is leave this ship and continue monitoring Ara like you have been. Remotely. You will also forget this little conflict ever happened. Now I will not ask again. Leave this vessel immediately.&quot;
&gt;She looks at you for any hint of backing down
&gt;She only saw the fiery rage of a man who&#039;s been through a century of war
&gt;All the battles, death, loss
&gt;And a need to protect his new family
&gt;She backs down and leaves the bridge
&gt;&quot;Somebody escort her back to her shuttle. Make sure she leaves this time.&quot;
&gt;You go behind Ara, who&#039;s still busily typing away at screens and plotting charts
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s enough of that Ara.&quot;
&gt;She immediately lets her arms fall to her sides and turns around, streaks running down her cheeks
&gt;She&#039;d been crying silently the whole time?
&gt;You put your hand on her shoulder and she wraps her arms around your waist
&quot;Anon! I&#039;m so sorry I couldn&#039;t say anything! She used an override command and I just-&quot;
&gt;You put your hand on her head and shushed her
&gt;&quot;I know Ara. You don&#039;t need to be sorry. I&#039;ve seen her type before. Manipulative, sly, and cunning. She tried to disarm the situation before it arose by trying to lead me off track, and then lying to me. You heard what happened next.&quot;
&gt;She nodded, giggling
&gt;&quot;You just gotta know when to tell them to fuck off and when to really fuck off.&quot;
&gt;Vikna comes to the bridge in a huff
&quot;Anon! The emperor is coming to the ship in an hour! We need to prepare!&quot;
&gt;Fuck
&gt;You run back to your quarters and rearrange your ribbons to your right chest and your Marine Corps medals to your left
&gt;You also have to put your white gloves on, which you completely forgot to do
&gt;You look at the amount of medals you&#039;ve accumulated and smile
&gt;At least some of your deeds didn&#039;t go overlooked
&gt;You go back to the bridge and tell everyone to be on their best behavior

&gt;Almost an hour later
&gt;A very decorative ship has docked with yours and was equalizing pressure
&gt;When it stopped the door opened slowly and you awaited the emperor&#039;s arrival
&gt;Hopefully he wasn&#039;t just another politician
&gt;Guards poured out of the ship and lined a path to you and your friends
&gt;The person who stepped out was dressed in a very expensive looking black and gold robe
&gt;He was white with purple hair and black horns
&gt;His eyes were like a snake&#039;s
&gt;He reminded you of a certain character from a certain fighting cartoon you used to watch
&gt;When he reached you, your friends bowed and you gave him a crisp salute
&quot;At ease human.&quot;
&gt;You lift your left leg and go into parade rest
&gt;He was almost as short as Vikna, but not quite
&quot;So, you&#039;re the one who freed Thor? The one who battled one on one with Loki and won? I thought you&#039;d be taller. Not to mention stronger.&quot;
&gt;You kept staring straight ahead as he continued
&quot;Tell me, what is your name?&quot;
&gt;&quot;My name is Lieutenant Colonel Anon Anonson, United States Marine Corps.&quot;
&quot;United States? What is that?&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s my country sir.&quot;
&gt;He smiles
&quot;Sounds like a noble place. Do you know why I have decided to visit?&quot;
&gt;&quot;No, sir.&quot;
&quot;Because you&#039;ve proven to be quite a mixed bag when it comes to how my empire sees you. Some think of you as a hero, while others think of you as a terrorist.&quot;
&gt;Terrorist?
&quot;We&#039;ve had...reports of you threatening IH Kaltag with threats of destruction and murder. Are these true?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I gave them a choice sir. Ara is part of my crew, and my crew is my family. She&#039;s also one of my closest friends. Something I never had as a kid. They came here because I had &#039;tampered&#039; with Ara&#039;s blocks, so she wouldn&#039;t be stuck to a chair while I was under attack by a rogue element. I told them that I didn&#039;t even consider removing blocks to sensitive information and I&#039;m telling you the same thing. They decided to come back and try to take Ara from me, twice. I was as polite as I possibly could be the first time, but apparently that&#039;s a sign of weakness here. So I told them the next time they come and try again, I will come down on them so hard and fast they won&#039;t know what hit them. That wasn&#039;t a threat. It was a promise. Sir.&quot;
&gt;He stands with his mouth agape, stunned by your directness
&gt;He composes himself and speaks again
&quot;You do know we align ourselves heavily with Kaltag, don&#039;t you Colonel Anon?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sir, from what I understand, so does the enemy.&quot;
&gt;He flashes a glare at you and speaks
&quot;Yes, but that&#039;s not the point. The point is, if Kaltag thinks poorly of you, we lose a large portion of our military ship builders as well as our source for artificial intelligence androids.&quot;
&gt;A thought occurred to you
&gt;&quot;Sir, what if you&#039;re being played?&quot;
&gt;He cocks his head
&quot;What?&quot;
&gt;&quot;What if you&#039;re played? As in, Kaltag is just using you and the other side for money and power, while also getting free testing of their newest products on top of it all?&quot;
&gt;His eyes go wide
&quot;I-I never thought of it like that! Everything makes sense now! Every single diplomat sent to attempt peace has been gunned down before arriving. We always assumed it was the other side but now that you mention this...&quot;
&gt;He ponders for a long time
&gt;&quot;What do you want plan on doing sir?&quot;
&gt;He looks back to you
&quot;I must contact the council!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Wait! Sir, if this goes as deep as I think it goes, don&#039;t you think they have members in the council as well?&quot;
&gt;He nods
&quot;Y-you&#039;re right! What should we do?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Do you control your country&#039;s military?&quot;
&gt;He nods
&quot;General Vikna is one of the four generals in our military, I can contact them right now if I need to.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Alright, go on ahe-&quot;
&gt;You see the guards all line up horizontal to you
&gt;&quot;Uh, what&#039;s their deal?&quot;
&gt;He looks back to see them out of line
&quot;What are you idiots doing out of line!? Get back in formation!&quot;
&gt;They stomp the ground before going rigid and ready their weapons
&gt;&quot;MOVE!&quot;
&gt;You push him down behind a shuttle right as they open fire
&gt;Your friends dive for cover as more &#039;guards&#039; exit the ship
&gt;&quot;ARA! GO TO COMBAT ALERT! WE&#039;VE BEEN BOARDED!&quot;
&quot;On it!&quot;
&gt;Red lights on the ship flashed and an alarm blared
&gt;You drew your 44 and remembered you didn&#039;t load it
&gt;Shit
&gt;You also remember the sapper that Ara talked about
&gt;It can be used as a grenade
&gt;Or an EMP
&gt;&quot;ARA! ARE THESE THINGS ALIVE OR ANDROIDS?&quot;
&quot;They&#039;re combat androids! They&#039;ve all exited the ship and are moving in to kill us!&quot;
&gt;You take out the sapper and the single bullet you had in your pocket
&gt;You chamber it and aim towards the control box for the lights
&gt;&quot;ARA DO THE THING WITH THE SAPPER TO MAKE IT AN EMP! I&#039;M GONNA GET THE LIGHTS!&quot;
&gt;She nods as you toss it to her
&gt;&quot;READY?&quot;
&quot;Yeah!&quot;
&gt;You fire the shot at the electrical panel and it sparks
&gt;The lights in the hangar go out
&gt;&quot;NOW!&quot;
&gt;A flashing blue sphere flies towards where the androids were and lands
&gt;Something kicks it and it lets out a blast of electromagnetic radiation
&gt;The emergency electrical system turns the lights back on and you see the androids were all down
&gt;Ara was totally fine, however
&gt;&quot;You okay Ara?&quot;
&gt;She nods and you smile
&gt;You get up and help the emperor up as well
&quot;Thank you Anon. If it were not for you, I would be dead right now. I will order our fleet to cut all communications with Kaltag.&quot;
&gt;You nod and see one android is still twitching
&gt;You walk over to it and look it straight in it&#039;s blackened eyes
&gt;&quot;I warned you. Not once, but twice. You came and tried to frame me for murdering the emperor, while also trying to kill my friends and I. You&#039;ve brought this down upon yourselves. Anyone who wishes to defect will do it now, for if you don&#039;t, I will not hesitate to gun you down. Pray to your gods for mercy, for I shall show none.&quot;
&gt;You smash the metallic head in with your boot and the twitching stops
&gt;Ayn is standing by you
&quot;That was pretty edgy Anon.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Really? I actually pulled a few punches from that one.&quot;

&gt;The Emperor decided it was probably best if he stayed with you on the Perseus
&gt;You had also alerted the other generals in his fleet of the Kaltag plot and they had cut off communications and data links
&gt;The fleet was scattered around the milky way, which meant you would have to wait a few days before any major operations could commence
&gt;Time to explore more of the ship
&gt;Despite having been on board for almost a month, you only really went as far as the hangar
&gt;Everything else you needed was around the same stretch of hall way
&gt;The special quarters, repair bay, lab, and kitchen were all connected by the same hall
&gt;The bridge stairway was just around the corner from Ayn&#039;s room, meaning you never saw most of the ship
&gt;Ara was taking you and Vikna to the VR room where she spent a lot of her free time outside of observing the crew
&gt;You only ever used VR a few times, once back in the early 90s when it was a big craze, and a couple times last year at a games convention
&gt;Ara, Vikna and you entered the VR room and it looked pretty much how you&#039;d expect it to
&gt;Grid lines all over the place and glasses on a pop out rack
&quot;Welcome to my playground!&quot;
&gt;You look around and see the walls had changed to a white room
&gt;You grabbed the glasses from the pop out rack and put them on
&quot;You don&#039;t really need those Anon, they&#039;re just for the lasers that we use sometimes.&quot;
&gt;Lasers?
&quot;Don&#039;t worry, we&#039;re not using lasers today! I just want to show you a few things before we get started.&quot;
&gt;You take off the glasses and put them on the pop out rack and push it back in
&quot;First thing&#039;s first! I want you to take a look through my eyes!&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s really excited about this whole thing
&gt;Ara disappears and all you can see is numbers and Vikna floating on nothing
&gt;Green numbers flowing downwards constantly
&gt;Like the matrix
&gt;&quot;Ara, is this really what you see all the time?&quot;
&quot;Yep! It&#039;s a lot of data to process!&quot;
&gt;Vikna rolled her eyes
&gt;Something told you this was a party trick
&gt;Might as well humor her
&gt;&quot;Jeez Ara, that&#039;s pretty swell!&quot;
&gt;You botched that so bad
&quot;Anon, if you know what&#039;s going on, just say it.&quot;
&gt;You sigh
&gt;&quot;Well, can&#039;t say I didn&#039;t try. I&#039;m guessing this is like the Matrix, where every number is actually a pixel to a larger image. It&#039;s kind of obvious to anyone who&#039;s watched the movie ever. But I can see how it would surprise people who didn&#039;t know!&quot;
&gt;The numbers are replaced with an actual image of what she sees
&gt;You look behind you and see her standing there
&gt;When you look at the wall again, it&#039;s showing a display of various functions and levels of different things
&gt;You see a readout pop up on the wall as she scans you
&gt;Breathing slightly elevated due to activity
&gt;Heartbeat, 75 BPM
&gt;Brain activity, slightly below optimal, see medical AI for more info
&gt;Did she just call you retarded?
&gt;Brain activity updated, elevated levels of annoyance, commence comforting
&quot;S-sorry Anon, it&#039;s automated and I can&#039;t control it.&quot;
&gt;Understandable
&gt;Brain activity updated, returned to baseline
&gt;Musculature, 15% above average Homo-sapien levels
&gt;At least you had some muscles
&gt;Bone structure, Augmented with calcium injections and titanium jackets
&gt;Nervous system, Scanning...
&gt;Scan complete, trace amounts of superconductive fluids detected
&gt;Well, they&#039;re only temporary
&gt;Scanning cellular structure
&gt;ERROR!
&gt;Substantial age difference detected!
&gt;Seek calibration immediately!
&gt;Dismiss Y/N?
&gt;Y
&gt;Compatibility with Anon updated
&quot;Uh oh.&quot;
&gt;Vikna smirks and looks back at Ara
&gt;Compatibility raised to 110% from 107%
&gt;Uuuuh
&quot;Um, let&#039;s switch to something else!&quot;
&gt;Emotional state: Embarrassed
&gt;The wall switches back to a featureless white room
&gt;Ara lets out a sigh of relief
&quot;That was a close one!&quot;
&gt;The screen flicks back to her vision and you see a rather happy looking you sitting behind a very excited kitty
&gt;Her vision was slightly filtered pinkish red
&gt;Emotional state: P U R E  B L I S S
&gt;It even showed a visual representation of your dick inside her vagina in the top right
&gt;Wait, she re-watches the sex you&#039;ve had with her?
&gt;Vikna bursts out laughing at the insanity of the whole situation
&quot;S-stop it Vikna!&quot;
&gt;You look back at her and she closes the program
&quot;I&#039;m soooo sorry Anon! I know it&#039;s bad and I apologize! Please don&#039;t be mad!&quot;
&gt;You walk up to her and put a hand on her cheek, stroking it softly
&gt;&quot;Ara, did you really like it that much?&quot;
&gt;She nodded her head
&gt;&quot;I didn&#039;t think you felt that good. It felt amazing for me.&quot;
&gt;She smiles and pulls you into a hug
&gt;When you let go, she switches to a different program
&gt;Mem-view?
&gt;Vikna sits on the floor and looks to one of the walls
&gt;She selects it and it opens up
&gt;A sharp pain comes from the back of your head and you flinch
&gt;Might&#039;ve slept on it wrong
&gt;A long list of different pictures came up, some of which you recognized
&quot;Oooh! That place looks pretty! Click that one Ara!&quot;
&gt;She selects one and it&#039;s Vietnam
&gt;An arm trains a rifle at something down a hill
&gt;Wait
&gt;No
&gt;NO!
&gt;&quot;ARA! TURN IT OFF NOW!&quot;
&gt;It was too late
&gt;The charge had begun
&gt;The woman had shot your private and you took aim at her, shouting to drop the weapon
&gt;The shot came from her and time slowed
&gt;Vikna&#039;s happy look was replaced with that of confusion
&gt;BOOM
&gt;Her head splits from the rear and she falls backwards
&gt;Vikna gasps as the brain matter explodes from the rear of the lady&#039;s head
&gt;The rifle is trained on the kids now
&gt;One of them falls and explodes
&gt;A voice echoes through the room
&gt;A slightly gruffer and more stern version of yours
&quot;OPEN FIRE!&quot;
&gt;The rifle opens up on the poor children, some exploding, some just falling limp
&gt;Vikna looks up to you incredulously as you watch in horror
&gt;The view clouded up periodically from what you assume are your own tears
&gt;Ara just looks on in shock
&gt;The little girl came running at you with the bear
&gt;The rifle pointed at her and she ran faster
&gt;The voice shouts again
&quot;STOP!&quot;
&gt;BOOM
&gt;The round tore a hole through her chest, stopping her in her tracks
&gt;She looked at you and back to her chest before dropping the bear
&gt;It exploded on the ground, turning the girl into red mist
&gt;Vikna is frozen in a mixture of fear and shock
&gt;The voice echoed throughout the room again
&gt;&quot;YOU GOOK BASTARDS! USING KIDS AS CANNON FODDER? YOU DISGUSTING SLANT EYED FREAKS! I&#039;LL KILL YOU AND YOUR FUCKING GHOST TOO!&quot;
&gt;Then they started to run back down the hill
&gt;Gun fire erupts from the base, mowing down the women and children
&gt;The rifle opens fire on the muzzle flashes before focusing again on the hoard of innocents
&gt;The view changed from shaky and the gunfire changed as well
&gt;The rifle started popping shots into the children without hesitation as the screen didn&#039;t even shake
&gt;Helicopters took off behind you as the last of the other platoon was evacuated
&gt;The rifle was dropped and another one picked up, the hands racking it&#039;s bolt
&gt;The rifle fired in short controlled bursts at anything that moved
&gt;A scream came from the base of the hill and the vietcong charged
&gt;The children ran past them and into the jungle, safe from your weapon
&gt;The rifle was dropped and the M14 was picked up as the hands began to shake
&gt;They attached a bayonet forcefully and turned to the right
&gt;When the vietcong entered the trench, the bayonet equipped rifle stabbed into the chest of a vietnamese man
&gt;It kept stabbing and stabbing until there was a giant red hole in the man&#039;s chest
&gt;Vikna wretched as the sight on screen got even more gruesome
&gt;Ara was frozen in place, not even blinking
&gt;More stabbing and screaming as past you fought his way to the radioman
&quot;BROKEN ARROW! I REPEAT! BROKEN ARROW!&quot;
&gt;The radioman calls it in and rushes into the bunker
&quot;MOVE IT! NOW!&quot;
&gt;The men moved in as the sound of jets was heard coming closer
&gt;Clouds of fire erupted around the trenches as they filed inside
&gt;An explosion engulfs the men further out in the trench as they scream in agony
&gt;The rifle falls and past you waves the survivors inside
&gt;The bunker doors slammed shut and smoke poured in through the bottom
&quot;MASKS! NOW!&quot;
&gt;The screen goes dark and your field of view is restricted a bit
&gt;Screams and pounding on the door were punctuated by more explosions as the smoke got thicker
&gt;Eventually the screaming stopped and the explosions ceased
&gt;Past you grabs the latch with a clothed hand and unlatches it, pushing the heavy doors open
&gt;A charred body falls on you as you catch it
&gt;Past you hurls and drops the body
&gt;Vikna almost does the same
&gt;Ara hasn&#039;t moved a single inch
&gt;You feel tears roll down your cheek
&gt;The helicopter picks you up and lifts off
&quot;What&#039;s with all the kids man?&quot;
&gt;The screen focuses on his eyes and your hands grab his flak vest
&quot;WE KILLED THEM MAN!&quot;
&gt;The man looks terrified
&quot;THEY HAD BOMBS AND SHIT STRAPPED TO THEM MAN!&quot;
&gt;He&#039;s crying now and the screen is blurry
&quot;And you know what I felt?&quot;
&gt;The screen clears and the look on his face is pure terror
&quot;Not a God. Damn. Thing.&quot;
&gt;You hear the helicopter blades turning in the background as the screen fades
&gt;You fall to your hands and knees
&gt;Vikna stares at you, terrified
&gt;Ara does the same
&gt;You get up off the ground and walk towards Vikna, who backs away
&gt;Her ears lay flat against her head and her tail is wrapped around herself
&gt;No...
&gt;You look to Ara and walk towards her
&gt;She backs away as well
&gt;NO!
&gt;You walk to the exit and run out, tears in your eyes as you ran

&gt;Vikna
&gt;You haven&#039;t seen Anon anywhere since he ran off
&gt;You were scared then, but eventually calmed down enough to be reasonable
&gt;It had been 10 hours and was almost time for bed
&gt;Ara is with you the entire time
&gt;You decide to check the VR room just in case
&gt;You open the door and see Anon with a blanket and pillow, watching something on the wall
&gt;A sandy camouflaged arm hands out little candies to kids running alongside what you presumed was a vehicle
&gt;The children were all smiling and waving, speaking a tongue unfamiliar to you
&gt;The voice from the room sounded much older and more gravely, but it sang something
&quot;Oh the candy man can.&quot;
&gt;The kids repeat it
&quot;The candy man can!&quot;
&gt;Anon is smiling as he watches it
&gt;It switches over to Anon helping an injured kid
&gt;Looks like he had a dislocated shoulder
&quot;Okay, I&#039;m gonna count to three.&quot;
&gt;The kid nods
&quot;One, two *Crack*&quot;
&quot;OW! Hey, you said count to three!&quot;
&quot;Three.&quot;
&gt;The kid smiles, trying to still be mad
&gt;Anon pats his shoulder and the kid runs off to an adobe house, his parents waiting to greet him
&gt;The kid waves to Anon and Anon in real life waves back
&gt;You clear your throat and anon twists his head back
&gt;There were tears in his eyes
&quot;They all died, ya know?&quot;
&gt;Your ears fell down and your tail went limp
&quot;They had their heads cut off for co-operating with us.&quot;
&gt;&quot;W-why!?&quot;
&quot;Because they talked to us.&quot;
&gt;&quot;T-that&#039;s terrible!&quot;
&gt;Anon looks back to the wall and the child waving at him
&quot;Yeah, it is.&quot;
&gt;You enter the room and so does Ara
&gt;You set yourself down on Anon&#039;s inflatable mattress and snuggle close to him
&gt;He pets your head and you begin purring
&gt;His hands feel so good

&gt;Anon
&gt;You pet Vikna and she purrs
&gt;She&#039;s so soft
&gt;Ara sits down on the other side and lays on your lap
&quot;A-Anon, we&#039;re sorry we acted the way we did. We were just scared is all.&quot;
&gt;Vikna nods her head as you rub her back
&quot;Do you still want to do the other things we wanted to do?&quot;
&gt;You shrug
&gt;&quot;I guess, nothing else to do and I&#039;m not tired.&quot;
&gt;Ara squees and deflates the bed

&gt;You stand in a dark room with Ara an Vikna
&quot;This is supposed to be the scariest memories you&#039;ve ever had.&quot;
&gt;The room lights up and it&#039;s revealed to be Ayn&#039;s room
&gt;The alarm goes off and Loki gets on the intercom, calling Ayn out
&gt;The memory fades to after you&#039;ve kicked Loki into the pod and warped away
&gt;A voice calls is heard
&quot;I can&#039;t let Ayn die.&quot;
&gt;The memory then fades to another one
&gt;You are rushing Ara to the repair bay and plugged her tail in
&gt;You unplugged her tail and zapped her with a constant stream of 600 volts for about a half hour before plugging her back in
&quot;P-please don&#039;t die on me Ara! Please!&quot;
&gt;It fades over to another memory
&gt;Zeta walking towards you with a knife
&quot;She won&#039;t lay a finger on my Ara.&quot;
&gt;You grab her arm and rip the knife from her hand before slamming the sapper on her thigh
&gt;It fades to Vikna giving you the gun and telling you to shoot her
&gt;You refuse and tell her it&#039;s cowardly and selfish
&gt;It fades once more to your quarters
&gt;You look down
&gt;You hear 5 clicks and a bang as you threw your 44 at the wall failing at russian roulette
&quot;They hate me. I&#039;m a murderer, a freak. I should&#039;ve known it was too good to be true. Nothing good ever happens to Anon.&quot;
&gt;Vikna puts her arm on you
&quot;We don&#039;t hate you Anon, it just scared us is all.&quot;
&gt;You smile and ruffle her hair
&gt;Wait, there&#039;s more?
&gt;It fades to this room about an hour ago when you thought you&#039;d fallen asleep
&gt;Something let out a deep guttural growl and you bolted awake
&gt;A pair of glowing eyes circled around you, chanting something before disappearing
&gt;Um
&gt;No thanks
&gt;You look to the others who had the exact same idea as you
&gt;Fuck this shit
&gt;I&#039;m out
&gt;You walk to the door and peace out
&gt;No spooky scary skelingtons for you
&gt;The door closed and a screeching was heard inside
&gt;Yeah, definitely not going in there for the rest of ever
&gt;You power walk back to Vikna&#039;s bedroom, which was the closest one
&gt;The girls jumped on the bed and began to hyperventilate
&gt;You sat down on the bed before scooting between them
&gt;You pulled them into a huddle to comfort them
&quot;W-what was that thing?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t fucking know. But I am not going in there until somebody clears it.&quot;
&gt;The three of you lay like this until you fell asleep

&gt;The next morning
&gt;Ara did a full scan of the VR room&#039;s history and found only 1 strange file
&gt;12-13-40.vrf
&gt;Must&#039;ve been a virus of some sort
&gt;The VR room was cleared again for use

&gt;The next day
&gt;You decided that this was no time to fuck around
&gt;You weren&#039;t using a 4 shot rifle and a shotgun to take on a mega corporation
&gt;You are at the armory right now
&quot;So you want a, erm, M60 machine gun, a high caliber rail gun, and a plasma rifle?&quot;
&gt;You nod your head
&gt;&quot;And a printer for the machine gun and rail gun.&quot;
&gt;He nods
&quot;Okay, I got your machine gun right now, but the plasma rifle is gonna take some time to fabricate.&quot;
&gt;&quot;How long?&quot;
&quot;About 7 hours.&quot;
&gt;You shook your head
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t have that long. Is there a substitute or anything equivalent?&quot;
&gt;He grins at you
&quot;I might have one thing.&quot;
&gt;He reaches under the desk and pulls up a massive piece of machinery
&gt;It looks like something a kid would draw when you asked him to make a &#039;laser bazooka&#039;
&quot;This is a microwave cannon. Runs on an internal 3 gigawatt reactor and can cook a group of people and androids alike in seconds.&quot;
&gt;It was
&gt;Perfect
&gt;You grabbed it off the counter and shouldered it
&gt;The thing weighed as much as a fucking star
&gt;You hold it under your right arm and carried the other 2 weapons under the crook of your left
&gt;&quot;Well, thanks armorer. If we make it outta this, you and I are getting a beer. On me of course.&quot;
&quot;I might just take you up on that Colonel!&quot;
&gt;You chuckle and leave the armory

&gt;Ara was acting very strangely today
&gt;She only spoke when spoken to and had been glancing at you every now and again
&gt;You confront her about this
&gt;&quot;Ara, what&#039;s going on with you today? You&#039;ve been, off somehow.&quot;
&gt;She glances at you nervously
&quot;M-me? No! Nervous response! Redirect attention! Everything is fine here!&quot;
&gt;She gives you the most fake smile you&#039;ve ever seen
&gt;Even by her standards
&gt;You lean in closer, setting the doughnut you got her on the console
&gt;&quot;Ara. You just said Nervous response and Redirect attention out loud. Something is very wrong here.&quot;
&gt;She flattens her ears against her head
&quot;N-no I didn&#039;t! I just, well, you know-&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ara.&quot;
&gt;She sighs and looks you in the eye
&quot;Anon, you don&#039;t have to do this. You are going up against the most advanced mega corporation on this side of the galaxy. We only have about 358 ships at our disposal, while Kaltag has about 2000. They also have fail safes in every single ship and AI inside of those ships. That includes me! I will either shut down or attempt to flee to Kaltag HQ. The ships will all power down as well!&quot;
&gt;You laugh
&gt;&quot;Ara, the Emperor already thought about that. All the ships have had custom transceivers installed and the old Kaltag ones removed. They won&#039;t be able to send any shut down signals. As for them having more ships, that may be true. But they lack one thing.&quot;
&quot;What&#039;s that Anon?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Experience.&quot;
&gt;The last ship arrives on schedules and gets in formation
&gt;You get to your quarters to suit up
&gt;The reactor unit was fried and had to be replaced, so you replaced it with the highest output reactor available that would fit
&gt;5 gigawatts per hour could be produced from something the size of a 2 liter bottle
&gt;But you would need every single watt from it, because the snake lady had made a breakthrough in energy shields
&gt;They were now small and portable enough to fit to a powered lifting frame
&gt;But that was still far too large for you to mount on your suit, so you went with an energy repelling shield that could modulate to deflect projectiles
&gt;It was less practical than a regular shield system, but it was something
&gt;And you needed everything you could get
&gt;Vikna had also just gotten her bones reinforced, so she could use a mobility enhancing exo safely now
&gt;She would be leading a platoon of special forces pulled from the front lines to be a spearhead for the main assault
&gt;You would accompany her as well
&gt;Ayn was to command the ship while you were gone and Ara would give you intel on the layout of the base
&gt;You step into the leg frames and they close around your legs, strapping themselves together and latching in place
&gt;You put your helmet on your head and it latches into place
&gt;You had opted out of using bolts to secure your helmet in case of a catastrophic power failure
&gt;The HUD lights up in it&#039;s usual navy blue and a new element appears on your bottom left
&gt;It was a shield and a small bar that was empty
&gt;When you did a systems check, the bar filled up quickly and dissipated again
&gt;It filled up once more, an aura pulsing around your body before fading
&gt;Reminds you of an old game you played once
&gt;Except you weren&#039;t nearly as badass
&gt;Nor did you have an AI
&gt;Or did you?
&gt;You enter the bridge and walk to Ara
&quot;L-looking sharp Anon!&quot;
&gt;Another fake smile
&gt;&quot;Ara, you said you had copies of you saved to a cloud right?&quot;
&gt;She stopped smiling and nodded
&gt;&quot;Do you know if it would be possible to upload yourself to my suit instead?&quot;
&gt;She puts her hand to her chin and looks up, thinking about it
&quot;Theoretically, it&#039;s possible. But it wouldn&#039;t be nearly as effective as a mainframe AI and the personality file alone would take up all available space in your suit&#039;s systems.&quot;
&gt;&quot;What about some sort of data link?&quot;
&gt;Her eyes brighten for a second
&quot;How didn&#039;t I think of that?!&quot;
&gt;You chuckle at her being flustered
&gt;&quot;Well from your reaction, I assume it is?&quot;
&gt;She nods
&gt;&quot;Then lets do it!&quot;
&gt;She unplugs her tail from the console and plugs it into your suit
&gt;The minimap is moved down to your bottom right and the top right replaced with Ara&#039;s face
&quot;Connection established. Can you hear me okay Anon?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah, I hear you.&quot;
&quot;I&#039;m linking to your exo&#039;s camera feed now. I see what you see.&quot;
&gt;You get the response from the last ship that it&#039;s in formation
&gt;&quot;You ready for this?&quot;
&quot;As ready as I&#039;ll get.&quot;
&gt;You walk over to your captain&#039;s seat and press a button
&gt;&quot;Alright friends! We&#039;re all here today to bring peace to this side of the galaxy once and for all! I&#039;m not one for speeches, so I&#039;ll make it short. We may be small, but we are proud. Forged in the fire of war that Kaltag has created, we will push them back into their graves they&#039;ve been so happily digging for us! If any of them surrender, take them prisoner. We will deal with them later. Now we jump to Kaltag&#039;s headquarters!&quot;
&gt;You get off the radio and push a few buttons
&gt;&quot;All crew, prepare for warp!&quot;
&gt;You start the countdown
&gt;&quot;3...2...1...WARP!&quot;

&gt;You were the first ones to arrive at Kaltag HQ
&gt;You were immediately hailed by the station
&gt;You answer
&gt;A short female fox spoke
&quot;This is Kaltag HQ to the SS Perseus, do you have business warping so close to our headquarters?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m very sorry ma&#039;am, we actually have a priority meeting with your CEO.&quot;
&quot;Really, I&#039;m not seeing any-&quot;
&gt;The other ships warp in
&gt;All 358 of them
&gt;The radio goes silent
&gt;&quot;Tell me miss, do you know how long these people have been fighting a war based on a false flag?&quot;
&quot;O-oh shit! THEY KNO-&quot;
&gt;The radio shuts off and you raise the shields to maximum forwards
&gt;&quot;FIRE AT WILL!&quot;
&gt;The guns and lasers erupt, firing on anything within range
&gt;3 cruisers were put down immediately before they were able to put their shields up
&gt;You get up and run off of the bridge
&gt;&quot;Vikna! How are the troops doing!?&quot;
&quot;They&#039;re all inside the shuttles! We&#039;re waiting on you Anon!&quot;
&gt;You reach the hangar and see one shuttle with it&#039;s bay open
&gt;You turn on the ammunition printers so you&#039;d have a belt ready to go once the first one runs dry
&gt;You hop into the shuttle and the side door closes
&gt;&quot;Punch it.&quot;
&gt;The shuttle rockets forward as you watch the rear window
&gt;The other 8 shuttles came out of the hangar bay and one was immediately taken out by an explosion
&gt;&quot;FLAK! GO EVASIVE!&quot;
&gt;You didn&#039;t have to say it twice before you were thrown around the cabin by the pilot&#039;s violent maneuvering
&gt;The flak was extremely heavy and thick, making it through was going to be a miracle of it&#039;s own
&gt;&quot;AYN! SEE IF YOU CAN GET THOSE FLAK GUNS DOWN! WE NEED A WINDOW!&quot;
&quot;Got it Anon!&quot;
&gt;A large flash comes from the front of the ship and the shuttle shakes
&quot;Flak vessel down!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Thanks sweetheart!&quot;
&gt;You get to the front of the cockpit and see you were closing rapidly
&gt;The hole in the flak screen was just enough to fit 3 shuttles side by side through
&gt;But that gap was getting thinner
&gt;&quot;FLOOR IT!&quot;
&gt;The pilot did as you said, slamming the throttle forward and accelerating through the gap
&gt;2 other shuttles made it through before the flak window got too small
&gt;You cursed under your breath as your shuttle nears the hangar
&gt;An explosion comes from behind you and the cockpit lights up red
&quot;SHIT! WE LOST OUR LEFT STABILIZER!&quot;
&gt;Oh fuck
&gt;&quot;CAN WE STILL MAKE IT?!&quot;
&quot;WE DON&#039;T HAVE A CHOICE! BRACE FOR IMPACT!&quot;
&gt;You lock the exo up against a structural beam before the shuttle slammed into the hangar bay
&gt;You black out from the impact

&gt;Your vision slowly comes back as you hear a faint yell
&quot;-p we&#039;re movin-&quot;
&gt;&quot;W-what?&quot;
&quot;ANON! GET YOUR ASS IN GEAR AND MOVE!&quot;
&gt;Vikna was firing her laser rifle at the horde of Kaltag security forces in front of her
&gt;Your M60 was laid out beside you, as well as your rail gun
&gt;You grab the railgun and sling it across your back before picking up the M60
&gt;You put the sling on your shoulder and wrap the belt around your left arm
&gt;You rack the bolt back before pushing it forward again and flick the safety off
&gt;&quot;You alien bastards are gonna pay for shooting up my ride!&quot;
&gt;You fire the machine gun from your hip, spraying tracers into the group of mixed anthros
&gt;They try to retreat but you gun them down before they can
&gt;The combat androids trained their guns on you, draining your shields quickly
&gt;You dive behind cover and see Vikna hasn&#039;t moved from cover
&gt;&quot;Come on Vikna! You&#039;re gonna miss all the fun!&quot;
&gt;She shakes her helmeted head at you and vaults from cover
&quot;Anon! You got 3 guys to your right trying to flank!&quot;
&gt;You point your M60 to the right and gun them down as they round the barrier
&gt;&quot;Thanks Ara!&quot;
&gt;You vault from cover to see Vikna picking off the remaining combat androids in the hangar
&gt;&quot;HANGAR&#039;S CLEAR! MOVE IN!&quot;
&gt;The shuttles began to pour in, dropping off troops and supplies
&gt;You made it over to Vikna who was loading a new power cell into her laser rifle
&gt;You had 50 rounds left in this belt before you had to reload
&gt;&quot;On three we breach and clear!&quot;
&gt;She nods at you
&gt;&quot;ONE!&quot;
&gt;You place a charge on the door
&gt;&quot;TWO!&quot;
&gt;Vikna charges her laser rifle
&gt;&quot;THREE!&quot;
&gt;You blow the charge and move in to clear the room
&gt;You hold the belt with your left hand and sprayed the room with the remaining belt
&gt;More Kaltag troops fell to the might of your bullets
&gt;When it went click, you opened the top cover up and grabbed the new belt from the printer
&gt;You insert it into the feed tray and slap the cover closed, racking the bolt back and forth
&gt;You sprayed the hallway as more troops responded to the shots
&gt;They all fell the same as everyone else

&gt;After having fought your way through 3 floors of baddies, you found the R&amp;D center
&gt;Bingo
&gt;You were out of ammunition for your M60, so you tossed it aside and were now using your rail gun
&gt;You forced open the R&amp;D door with Vikna&#039;s help and filed in
&gt;The scientists were all doing experiments on various Anthroids
&gt;One of them was a partially assembled ARA unit
&gt;The ARA unit looked up and blinked
&quot;A-anon?&quot;
&gt;Dude what?
&gt;&quot;H-hi?&quot;
&gt;The scientists see 2 fully suited up soldiers and a full platoon of regular foot soldiers staring them down with laser and pulse rifles
&gt;They all raise their hands and get down on their knees
&gt;Except for one
&gt;She looked like the head researcher and wore a different lab coat than the rest
&gt;She looks up at you and smirks
&gt;She was an anthro fox of some sort, with an orange coat and black muzzle and paws
&quot;What are you doing trying to destroy this station? Do you have a deathwish?&quot;
&gt;You unpolarize your visor
&gt;Her expression changes from smug to fear in the blink of an eye
&quot;N-no, it can&#039;t be!&quot;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re not the first one to say that miss.&quot;
&gt;Her resolve comes back and she holds out her hand apprehensively
&quot;M-my name&#039;s Galence, but people call me Gale. You&#039;re Anon, correct?&quot;
&gt;You nod and push past her
&quot;H-hey! Don&#039;t you ignore me!&quot;
&gt;You sling the rail gun and walk to the ARA unit
&gt;This wasn&#039;t your Ara
&gt;But it knew you
&quot;A-anon, it&#039;s me, Ara! Remember? The space walk? The Hashab?&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t know what to do
&gt;&quot;Are you getting this Ara?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, all ARA units share a common consciousness. That&#039;s to say we all share the same memories.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well, what should I do Ara?&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s silent and doesn&#039;t speak for a very long time
&quot;I, I think you should shoot her.&quot;
&gt;&quot;WHAT?!&quot;
&quot;Anon! She&#039;s not me! Well, not exactly me, but still! She&#039;s miserable right now. She has a pain module installed and her legs are severed, creating a massive pain loop.&quot;
&gt;You extend your arm and gently pet her head
&gt;She leans into it and purrs
&gt;You unlatch your helmet and pull it off, tears streaking down your face
&quot;Anon, what&#039;s wrong? I&#039;m detecting very high blood pressure levels and you&#039;ve been straining this whole time. Is there anything wrong?&quot;
&gt;You unsling your rail gun and load a magazine in
&gt;&quot;A-Ara, can you take a look at t-that wall over there please?&quot;
&gt;She smiles and turns herself around to face the wall
&quot;Now what Anon?&quot;
&gt;&quot;J-just keep examining it.&quot;
&gt;You raise the rail gun and point it at her head
&gt;She hears the buzzing of the rail gun and looks back at you
&quot;A-Anon, what are you doing?&quot;
&gt;You let a sob escape
&gt;&quot;I-I&#039;m so sorry Ara!&quot;
&gt;You look away, firing a round into her
&gt;A mechanical scream is heard and slowly dies down
&gt;You&#039;re sobbing uncontrollably now
&gt;You look back and see a massive hole in her head, a round straight through the center of the forehead
&gt;Her eyes still look on in horror as they begin to fade to black
&gt;You scratch the side of her face, trying to make her comfortable in her last moments
&gt;She finally goes limp and you put your helmet back on, polarizing it
&gt;You turn to the head scientist and sling your rifle
&gt;You walk over to her and stare at her
&gt;&quot;Why?&quot;
&gt;She looks at you quizzically
&quot;Why what?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Why would you do that?&quot;
&quot;Do what?&quot;
&gt;You grab her by her neck and lift her to your eye level, unpolarizing your visor
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t you play dumb with me Missy! Why would you ever create something that can feel pain!?&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s struggling against you, but your grip is like a vice around her neck
&gt;Vikna tries to step in
&quot;Anon, let her go!&quot;
&gt;You ignore her
&gt;&quot;ANSWER ME!&quot;
&quot;I-it was t-to control them b-better! T-the threat of pain i-is a very p-powerful motivator!&quot;
&gt;&quot;WHO&#039;S IDEA WAS THIS?&quot;
&gt;One of the scientists got up and spoke
&quot;None of us thought of it! It was our AI coordinator! She did it!&quot;
&gt;You let Gale go, dropping her to the floor
&gt;She gasps for air as Vikna helps her up
&gt;&quot;Have somebody escort them to the shuttles, I&#039;ll deal with them later.&quot;
&gt;Vikna is about to say something when you gave her a glare
&gt;She shuts her mouth and gives the order
&gt;&quot;Ara, what&#039;s this, AI coordinator thing?&quot;
&quot;Oh, that&#039;s the ZTA unit. You know her as Zeta.&quot;
&gt;You feel your blood pressure spike at the name
&gt;&quot;Vikna, go to the shuttle bay, now.&quot;
&quot;But, anon, there&#039;s still more soldiers to fight! We need to stick together!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I need to do this alone Vikna.&quot;
&quot;Take off your helmet Anon.&quot;
&gt;You do as she says and she runs her gloved hand along your face
&gt;She kisses you on the lips and hops back down
&quot;You don&#039;t have my permission to die Anon. So make it back alive or I&#039;ll court marshal you in hell.&quot;
&gt;You smile and give her a salute
&gt;&quot;Yes ma&#039;am.&quot;
&gt;She returns it and walks out the door
&gt;You twirl your helmet around before putting it back on
&gt;The clamps clicked into place and you exited the lab

&gt;The last Kaltag guard falls on the floor with a thud as you load another magazine of tungsten sabots
&gt;You sling the rail gun and heft your microwave cannon off your back
&gt;You flick the switches on the side up and capacitors whine at higher and higher pitch
&gt;After the capacitors charge fully, the light on top goes green
&gt;You pull the trigger and a massive distortion comes from the gun
&gt;The locked door in front of you has a massive hole blown through it and you force the door open
&gt;You see something flicker in the corner of your eye before vanishing
&gt;&quot;Did you see that Ara?&quot;
&quot;See what?&quot;
&gt;The hair on the back of your neck stands straight up
&gt;You were being watched
&gt;You walk into the room and hear a giggle behind you
&gt;You swing around and see nothing
&quot;I heard that though.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Do you know if there&#039;s any infiltration units at Kaltag Ara?&quot;
&gt;Her eyes and ears go red
&quot;I used to be able to remember, but now I can&#039;t. I&#039;d be careful in there if I were you. You&#039;re probably not alone.&quot;
&gt;Just as she finishes the sentence, your shields discharge immediately and something flickers past you
&gt;Shit&#039;s getting good!
&gt;You flick the cannon over to continuous beam mode and scan around for movement
&gt;A giggle comes from above you and you look up
&gt;Whatever was up there slams something into your helmet, making a large clang
&quot;Anon! Your helmet is damaged! It won&#039;t take another hit like that!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Or maybe it will. Ara, can you make my shields deliver an electrical pulse the next time something contacts them?&quot;
&gt;Your shields recharge and you see another flicker of movement
&gt;You pull the trigger and wave the cannon back and forth, scorching the entire way
&gt;A laugh is heard around you and Ara speaks
&quot;Done! Now all you have to do is w-&quot;
&gt;You hear a screech as the thing touches your armor with it&#039;s weapon and comes into view
&gt;It was an anthro feline of some sort, dressed in all black and carrying a sword
&gt;Fucking space ninjas?
&gt;That&#039;d be pretty fucking sick if you weren&#039;t on the receiving end of one
&gt;The anthro leaps to the ceiling and crawls along it like a spider
&gt;It moved so fast it was unnatural
&gt;You dropped your microwave gun and cracked your knuckles
&gt;You drew your cavalry saber and let your rail gun fall as well
&gt;The feline saw this and dropped to the floor
&gt;You removed your helmet and tossed it aside, turning your earpiece on instead
&gt;Ara was frantically protesting this but you ignored her
&gt;You always wanted to fight a ninja
&gt;You grip the sword with both hands and strike a pose
&gt;Damn you must look cool
&gt;The cat lady takes this as the signal to fight and bolts at you
&gt;She was fast, much faster than you
&gt;Maybe this was a mistake
&gt;You&#039;re committed now
&gt;You use your own blade to block hers from slicing your head clean off
&gt;The clang was beautiful
&gt;You pushed her away with your brute strength and charged
&gt;She rolls to the right, dodging your charge
&gt;Fuck
&gt;You feel something rip out from behind you and your exo locks up
&gt;You slam to the ground and skid on the floor
&gt;She took out your fucking reactor
&gt;Your armor ejects you and you push the heavy mass off of you
&gt;You hop up and turn around to see the feline holding your reactor in her claws
&gt;She tosses it aside and rushes you again
&gt;You have to think fast
&gt;You had an idea so crazy it just might work
&gt;You stand still and watch her charge at you
&gt;When she goes for a swing, you drop to the ground and tuck your right leg in
&gt;She passes over you and you push up with all your might
&gt;She loses her balance and tumbles across the floor, slamming into the wall
&gt;When she gets up off the floor, she rubs her groin area
&gt;Oh shit you just cunt punted her
&gt;You chuckle at this
&gt;She rushes at you and you&#039;re snapped back to reality
&gt;You duck too late and she slices a gash into your side
&gt;Everything to your right pulsates in pain as you grab it with your hand
&gt;Blood&#039;s leaking from the wound and you see the cat lady grin
&gt;You hold your side before looking at your hands
&gt;The blood on your hands takes you back
&gt;Back to the trenches
&gt;Screams all around
&gt;You were young then
&gt;Only about 27
&gt;A gas attack had left your group decimated, with people coughing up blood and choking on their own blood
&gt;Your hands had a mixture of blood and dirt on them when you look up
&gt;A man with a stahlhelm charged you with a bayonet as you tried to help your comrade with his gas mask
&gt;Shells exploding all around
&gt;His mask made him look like a plague doctor
&gt;You drew your comrade&#039;s bayonet and yelled at the top of your lungs, forcing air out of your mask&#039;s filter
&gt;You parry the incoming charge with your hand and slash at him with your bayonet
&gt;He screams in pain and whacks you with the butt of his rifle
&gt;You double over in a daze, trying to shake it off desperately
&gt;He goes in for the stab
&gt;You await death as the man rears his rifle back, ready to pike you with his bayonet
&gt;You close your eyes and wait
&gt;But it never comes
&gt;You look up and see a man had tackled the german to the ground
&gt;You come back to reality and see Vikna on top of the cat lady
&gt;Vikna is quickly thrown off of her and against a wall
&gt;Her exo slams into the wall and sparks
&gt;She gets back up and tries to tackle the lady again
&gt;You grab your sword and grit your teeth
&gt;The pain is getting worse the more you move
&gt;But all the sudden, it stops
&gt;The pain is replaced by something else
&gt;You look down and see you are in fact still bleeding
&gt;But you don&#039;t even feel it
&gt;You take advantage of this strange event and charge the cat lady one last time
&gt;Vikna was thrown to the floor
&gt;Before the cat lady could land a stab, you thrust your cavalry saber into her back
&gt;She yelps in pain as you hilt the saber
&gt;She looks down at the saber inside her chest and you twist
&gt;You had impaled her heart, and when you twisted, you completely severed it from her aorta
&gt;Her breathing weakened and you pulled the saber back, letting her fall to the floor
&gt;You look into her eyes as she stares back at yours
&gt;She gives you a smile before finally going limp
&quot;A-Anon! Are you okay?!&quot;
&gt;You feel the pain return and clench your side
&gt;&quot;Oh that sparks!&quot;
&gt;Vikna opens up a pouch and takes out what looks like a gauze pad
&quot;This is gonna sting Anon, so just let it happen.&quot;
&gt;She puts the pad on and something clicks inside
&gt;Suddenly, every fiber of your being is pain and suffering
&gt;You scream in pain and clutch your side as pain engulfs your entire body
&gt;You fall to the floor, seizing up before the pain finally subsides
&gt;You breath heavily and weakly get to your feet
&gt;&quot;W-what was that!?&quot;
&quot;Healing pad. Accelerates the healing process from about 10 months to 10 seconds. It&#039;s also extremely painful.&quot;
&gt;Well she did warn you
&gt;The pain is gone and you peel the pad off
&gt;The wound is completely sealed and a wicked scar is left in it&#039;s place
&gt;This is gonna make an awesome story when you tell Ara
&gt;Oh shit Ara!
&gt;You grab the reactor off the ground and rush back to your exo, slamming it in place
&gt;You get in your exo and rush over to your helmet, which is screaming frantically
&gt;You put the helmet on and a voice assaults your ears
&quot;ANON! TALK TO ME ANON! PLEASE DON&#039;T BE DEAD ANON! ANON!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Calm down Ara! I&#039;m okay!&quot;
&quot;THANK GOD YOU&#039;RE ALRIGHT! I THOUGHT YOU DIED! DON&#039;T EVER DO THAT AGAIN!&quot;
&gt;You nod
&gt;&quot;I won&#039;t Ara.&quot;
&quot;Good! Now finish what you came here to do and leave!&quot;
&gt;You look back to Vikna who is toting your rail gun
&gt;You pick the microwave cannon off the ground and flick it on to pulse mode
&gt;The door at the other end was open already, and sitting in the center was Zeta
&quot;Please, come in. I hope my assistant wasn&#039;t too much of a-&quot;
&gt;You blast her with the microwave cannon before she could finish, vaporizing her head in a flash of light
&gt;Talk was cheap
&gt;You were here to do
&gt;You go over to her and check the body
&gt;The entire head and neck was gone
&gt;&quot;Ara, are your transmitters in your head?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, why?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Just checking.&quot;
&gt;Ara must not have payed attention because when she looks back she screams
&quot;OH MY GOD ANON IS THAT ZETA?!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah, why?&quot;
&quot;WHAT HAPPE-&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nerve gas.&quot;
&gt;Ara stops mid sentence at the shear absurdity of your statement
&quot;I-I don&#039;t-But we-Never mind.&quot;
&gt;You get up and walk back through the doorway
&gt;A voice comes through the radio
&quot;This is alpha company to Anon! We have the package in place at the reactor! We suggest immediate evac! Timer set for 10 minutes!&quot;
&gt;You look back to Vikna who smiles at you
&quot;Race ya.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re on.&quot;

&gt;You run through the winding corridors, firing your revolver at anyone who got in the way
&gt;2 minutes left
&gt;You see the hangar door ahead and make a mad dash for it
&gt;1 minute
&gt;The shuttle is waiting for you at the hangar bay
&gt;Vikna makes it in first and you follow closely
&gt;&quot;GO NOW!&quot;
&gt;The shuttle&#039;s engines roar as it rockets forward, exiting the hangar and entering space
&gt;You reach the Perseus 45 seconds later
&gt;You watch the massive station as the counter ticked down
&gt;3
&gt;2
&gt;1
&gt;0
:^)
&gt;A flash comes from the base and it&#039;s ripped apart from the inside
&gt;The station splits apart and flies in different directions
&gt;Your job here is done

&gt;You get back to the ship and see Ara waiting in the hangar
&quot;ANON!&quot;
&gt;She rushes up to you and hugs you
&gt;You take your helmet off and toss it aside, burying your face in her hair
&gt;Soft
&gt;She breaks the hug and slaps you
&gt;Ow fuck
&gt;&quot;What was that for?!&quot;
&quot;For not listening to me and just killing that bitch!&quot;
&gt;You smirk
&gt;&quot;But you have to admit, it was kinda cool.&quot;
&gt;She huffs and crosses her arms
&quot;I guess it was pretty cool.&quot;
&gt;You smile and pet her hair
&gt;She closes her eyes and pushes into it
&quot;Fingers goooood~&quot;
&gt;Vikna walks past
&quot;Get a room you two.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Only if you&#039;ll come with Vikna.&quot;
&gt;Oh shit you were turning into Ayn
&gt;You can&#039;t see her face, but you can feel her blushing
&gt;You chuckle and walk back to the bridge

&gt;Ayn was on the captains chair, watching the station drift apart
&gt;She turns around and sees you
&quot;Oh, our hero returns~.&quot;
&gt;You scratch the back of your neck
&gt;&quot;Yeah, sorry I took so long. Got caught up fighting a ninja.&quot;
&quot;What happened inside the control room?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nerve gas.&quot;
&gt;Ayn looks at you for a moment before breaking out into laughter
&gt;She gets it
&quot;What&#039;s so funny about this nerve gas thing!? She&#039;s an AI, she isn&#039;t affected by nerve gas!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ara, it&#039;s a meme. When someone asks how somebody died, people will sometimes just say nerve gas as a joke.&quot;
&gt;Ara scratches her head a bit and then shrugs
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m gonna get this thing off, it feels like a sauna in here.&quot;
&quot;There room for 2 in there~&quot;
&gt;&quot;Easy tiger.&quot;
&quot;Mrow~&quot;
&gt;You walk off before Ayn makes it any more awkward

&gt;Ara watches as you strip out of your exo
&gt;She opens her eyes wide in shock when she sees the blood
&quot;Oh my god Anon! Are you okay?!&quot;
&gt;She runs over to your right side and looks at the bloody clothing
&gt;&quot;Ara, it&#039;s fine. Vikna fixed it with a gauze pad thing.&quot;
&quot;SHE USED A NANO PAD ON YOU!?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah, why?&quot;
&quot;THEY CAUSE EXTREME PAIN AND ARE HIGHLY ILLEGAL!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Why&#039;s that?&quot;
&quot;BECAUSE THE RISK OF A COMA IS TOO GREAT! ABOUT 78 PERCENT GO INTO ONE!&quot;
&gt;Oh fuck
&gt;Guess you&#039;re not using one of those again
&gt;You pull off your coveralls and throw them into the trash
&gt;You grab a pair of sleep coveralls because you&#039;re tired and need sleep
&gt;Ara grabs them from you and puts them back in the dresser
&gt;Okay, no coveralls tonight
&gt;Ara takes off her dress and bra, as well as her panties
&gt;She crawled onto the bed and waited for you
&gt;You slide yourself onto the bed and pull the covers over your bodies
&gt;Ara smiles at you and you can&#039;t help but smile back
&gt;She presses herself against you and purrs
&gt;Your entire being is now soft
&gt;The only thing right now is softness
&gt;You rub Ara&#039;s back and she purrs louder, her tail wrapping around you
&gt;You feel your eyes getting heavy and begin to drift off as Ara purrs away
&gt;This is your life now
&gt;Captain of a ship and lover of 2 kitties
&gt;It&#039;s perfect
&gt;You drift off to sleep and immediately wish you hadn&#039;t

&gt;Gas
&gt;It was greenish and hazy
&gt;Men around you who couldn&#039;t get to their masks fast enough were choking to death
&gt;Screams of men you knew, some of whom were your friends
&gt;You can&#039;t save them
&gt;Nothing can
&gt;This horrible war had stretched on for almost 4 years now
&gt;You&#039;d seen many things in this time, but none more horrible than gas
&gt;It caused your skin to boil, leak fluid, and burn if you weren&#039;t covered in clothing
&gt;Most of the men in your trench had no dry clothing, so they opted to wear what are now called tank tops
&gt;But it&#039;s deadly effects happened when it entered your lungs
&gt;It did the same thing in your lungs, but the fluid had nowhere to go
&gt;You would choke on your own fluids as you tried desperately to gasp for air
&gt;This would only accelerate the process, as more gas would be inhaled
&gt;It was horrible and made you sick
&quot;CORPORAL ANON! OVER THE TOP LAD!&quot;
&gt;A very british man yelled at you through his gas mask, holding a revolver
&gt;&quot;SIR! THIS IS SUICIDE! MOST OF US ARE DEAD AND WE WILL BE TOO!&quot;
&gt;He aims his revolver at you and pulls the hammer back
&quot;I SAID, OVER. THE. TOP. LAD.&quot;
&gt;You swallow hard and grab your rifle, getting up the ladder quickly
&gt;Machine gun fire forced you back down the ladder
&gt;They had set up a machine gun nest in no man&#039;s land, making it almost impossible to advance without dying
&quot;WHAT ARE YOU DOING CORPORAL! I SAID OVER THE TOP NOT POKE YOUR HEAD OUT! NOW GO!&quot;
&gt;You look around the green haze and see men moving their arms weakly as they drew their last breath
&gt;An artillery shell lands next to the british man, collapsing his part of the trench
&gt;It killed him instantly
&gt;This entire war
&gt;Started because some idiot shot a kaiser
&gt;You saw the british man&#039;s revolver sticking out from under the logs and took it
&gt;You fumbled around with it before figuring out how to open it
&gt;It opened from the top, the strange thing
&gt;What you saw shocked you
&gt;It was empty
&gt;Fucking
&gt;Empty
&gt;You hear a whistle blow and muffled screams come from above you
&gt;A german charge
&gt;You run to the barracks, where you hoped there would be more men
&gt;The only thing you found was dead men in beds
&gt;The gas killed them while they slept
&gt;At least they didn&#039;t feel it
&gt;You hoped at least
&gt;You saw a crate beside the entryway and opened it
&gt;Inside was a Chauchat and some spare magazines
&gt;You had to remind yourself that it was a magazine and not a clip
&gt;Stupid technicalities
&gt;You hefted the piece from the box and tried to figure out how to load the thing
&gt;You eventually figured out where the magazine went and rocked it in place
&gt;You pulled the bolt back and it fell forward, locking into place
&gt;The germans had reached the trench and you ran the other way
&gt;You needed to find someone
&gt;Anyone
&gt;You weren&#039;t invincible and couldn&#039;t hold off a push on your own
&gt;You ran into more germans as you ran
&gt;You fired the gun from the hip and it rattled off rounds slowly
&gt;It fired so much slower than a machine gun
&gt;But it was better than your rifle
&gt;The germans were dead before they could react and you hopped over their bodies
&gt;A german jumped into the trench, wielding a spiked club
&gt;You aim the chauchat at him and pull the trigger
&gt;Nothing happens
&gt;Fucking gadgets
&gt;He charges you and you throw the broken thing at him
&gt;He doubled over, having been hit with a heavy piece of wood and steel
&gt;You unsheathe your bayonet and charge at him while he gets up
&gt;You run him through with it, stabbing into his heart
&gt;His eyes were wide with fear and shock as you twisted the bayonet inside him
&gt;This wasn&#039;t the monster you had been promised you&#039;d fight
&gt;He was a young man
&gt;Like you
&gt;Fighting for his country
&gt;You looked the man in the eye and a tear streaked down your face, pooling at the bottom of your mask
&gt;You remove the bayonet and continue to run for the other barracks
&gt;You reached the barracks and drew your empty pistol
&gt;Maybe it would scare them into surrender
&gt;You found rounds scattered all over the dirt, some of which looked like the fit in the revolver
&gt;You picked up the massive rounds and flicked open the gun
&gt;Loading each round into the chambers slowly
&gt;You loaded it fully and closed the revolver, cocking the hammer back and continued to search the barracks
&gt;You saw another crate marked &#039;B.A.R.&#039;
&gt;A bar out here?
&gt;You could use a drink anyways
&gt;You open the crate expecting booze, but are pleasantly surprised to find a rifle instead
&gt;You hear glass breaking behind you and point your revolver at the entryway
&gt;Another german with a rifle this time
&gt;You didn&#039;t even think, just pulled the trigger
&gt;The shot hit the center of his skull, causing him to collapse instantly
&gt;You tried to pull the hammer back, but it was stuck
&gt;You tried to open the revolver, but it was stuck too
&gt;You tossed it aside and grabbed the rifle
&gt;It was a hefty piece, probably weighing 20 pounds or so
&gt;A selector switch on the side read, safe, fire, slow
&gt;You switch it over to fire and pick up a bandoleer from the same crate
&gt;You opened it up and saw a magazine that looked like a wedge inside
&gt;You slammed it into the gun and pulled the cocking piece back and forth
&gt;Germans rushed into the barracks, investigating the gunshots
&gt;You pull the trigger
&gt;RATATATATATATATATATATATATATATA
&gt;The gun fired incredibly fast and kicked like a mule, but it was a damn sight better than the chauchat
&gt;The germans were cut down by the new rifle as you now had to figure out how to take out the magazine
&gt;When you accidentally bump a button in front of the trigger, the magazine falls and you slap a new one in
&gt;A boy, who was still in his bunk, coughed and wheezed as he tried to get up
&gt;You run over to him and look to see who it was
&gt;You drop the gun in horror
&gt;David
&gt;Your brother
&gt;You rip off your mask and try to comfort him face to face
&gt;The gas was dissipating now, so you could breath in relative safety
&gt;David however
&gt;He coughed up blood and spoke
&quot;A-Anon! I never thought I&#039;d s-see you again AHACK AHACK!&quot;
&gt;He coughs up more blood and puss as he continues to speak
&gt;&quot;Save your strength Dave! You&#039;ll need it when you get to the hospital!&quot;
&gt;You knew he was a goner
&gt;He knew it too
&gt;You just didn&#039;t want to admit it
&gt;A tear flowed down his boiled cheek, staining his pillow
&quot;Anon AHCK HECHK P-please. Shoot me! I won&#039;t ACKEHC m-make it! It hurts Anon!&quot;
&gt;He continues to cough and wheeze as you fumble around on the ground for the rifle
&gt;He grabs the barrel of it and puts it to his head
&quot;P-please Anon! DO IT!&quot;
&gt;You sob and look away as he coughs and sputters
&gt;BANG
&gt;The shot echoed throughout the battlefield
&gt;Bouncing off trees, and hitting the ears of german soldiers in the craters
&gt;You just shot your own brother
&gt;Your own flesh and blood
&gt;A brother you didn&#039;t even know was here
&gt;Much less a brisk walk away
&gt;You fall to your knees as you sob into your brothers uniform
&gt;Everything started to fade as you continued sobbing

&gt;You woke up, sobbing into something soft
&gt;Ara was stroking your hair as you continued to cry
&quot;Anon, it&#039;s okay. You&#039;re safe now. Nobody can hurt you any more.&quot;
&gt;You pull away and see her fur is matted with snot and tears
&gt;&quot;S-sorry about y-your fur.&quot;
&gt;She shakes her head
&quot;It&#039;s fine. Really! You were shouting about suicide and Dave. Who is Dave?&quot;
&gt;You slump down
&gt;&quot;M-my brother.&quot;
&quot;You have a brother?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Had. He was dying of gas when he woke and spoke to me. He wanted me to...&quot;
&gt;You trail off, not being able to finish the sentence
&gt;She cocks her head
&quot;If you don&#039;t want to talk, that&#039;s fine.&quot;
&gt;&quot;No no! I can do this. He wanted me to...shoot him.&quot;
&gt;She puts a hand to her mouth, gasping
&quot;D-did you?&quot;
&gt;You feel the tears coming again
&gt;You nod sadly
&gt;She pulls you back into her embrace as you cry more into her chest
&gt;She was completely naked still, but you didn&#039;t care
&gt;You needed someone right now
&gt;Ara was more than happy to oblige
&gt;She stroked your hair as you tried to calm down, cooing at you that everything would be alright
&gt;You wanted to believe that
&gt;Hell, you did believe that
&gt;When you calmed down enough, she grasps you by your shoulders
&quot;You and I are going to the VR room and looking at these traumatic memories. This lone suffering ends today.&quot;
&gt;You nod and Ara walks for the door
&gt;Completely naked
&gt;&quot;A-Ara.&quot;
&quot;Hmm?&quot;
&gt;&quot;C-clothes.&quot;
&gt;She looks down at herself and covers her private areas
&quot;Oops!&quot;
&gt;She scrambles to her bra and dress, putting them on in a panic
&gt;She goes back to the door and runs off, presumably to get the VR room ready

&gt;You get to the VR room and see Vikna, Ayn, Nytro, and Ara standing there
&quot;I still don&#039;t know why we have to be here Ara. Couldn&#039;t you just have Vikna in here?&quot;
&gt;Nytro was whining about having to be pulled away from his E-book
&quot;Yes you have to be here! Anon needs all the emotional support he can get! He has severe PTSD and needs help. He&#039;s never had many friends, so being there for him is exactly what he needs!&quot;
&gt;Ayn rubs Nytro&#039;s hair
&quot;Habibi, Anon is a broken man. He has seen things no other person should ever see. He needs to know that we care about him as much as he does us.&quot;
&gt;You smile at them caring about you
&gt;You clear your throat and Ara whips around
&quot;Anon! Come in! We were just talking about you.&quot;
&gt;You expect Ayn to make a pass at you, but she gives you a friendly smile
&gt;Not even a hint of sultriness in her look
&gt;Ara is busy looking through your old memories, trying to find the ones that are the worst
&gt;She gasps as she hovers over one of your more recent memories
&gt;It was in Iraq
&gt;You hated Iraq
&gt;It was a sandy hell hole with no redeeming qualities
&gt;Every memory from that dust bowl was bad
&gt;&quot;Skip over it. Nothing traumatic happened there. It was just annoying.&quot;
&gt;She nods and goes backwards
&gt;She stops on a jungle image and selects it
&gt;Vietnam
&gt;That place was such a traumatic hellhole that every GI who served there had some sort of PTSD
&gt;Any who said they didn&#039;t were liars or never went in country
&gt;Kids fighting against you in the streets
&gt;Napalm
&gt;Agent orange
&gt;Booby traps
&quot;What&#039;s this Anon?&quot;
&gt;Nytro and Ayn are looking at you while Vikna stares at the screen
&gt;&quot;Hell.&quot;

&gt;The screen begins playing the memory, Nytro and Ayn being drawn to it
&gt;The metal tube on screen was shaking like a leaf
&gt;Buildings were all around you
&gt;Fire was leaking from the end of it as you continued to walk through the streets
&gt;A shot rings out from above you and you hit the deck
&gt;You didn&#039;t want to get blown the fuck up by a sniper
&quot;SNIPER!&quot;
&gt;The screen suddenly displays it in a 3D space
&quot;Oh the update just came through! This should make it a bit easier to understand.&quot;
&gt;You looked at yourself and noticed the wrinkles of age
&gt;You looked as ancient as you felt
&gt;You tapped the helmet but past you didn&#039;t react, instead bolting up and running for the building ahead
&quot;ANON WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?&quot;
&quot;I&#039;M GONNA BURN THEM OUT!&quot;
&gt;Ayn and Nytro looked at you
&quot;Burn them out?&quot;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;ll see.&quot;
&gt;The scene switches to the inside of the building
&gt;A child sat their with a long rifle and a scope
&gt;Staring out the window towards the group of soldiers
&gt;They had all taken cover
&quot;Oh god they make children fight for them!?&quot;
&gt;Ayn is baffled by it
&gt;&quot;Not just children. Women too.&quot;
&gt;Ayn shakes her head
&gt;&quot;They were monsters.&quot;
&gt;Past you comes up the stairs quietly, poking around the corner to see the kid with the rifle
&quot;DROP IT!&quot;
&gt;The kid turns towards past you and brings the rifle around
&quot;NO!&quot;
&gt;Past you squeezes the paddles inwards and a jet of fire erupts from the nozzle
&gt;It engulfs the child as he screams in agony
&gt;Ayn&#039;s jaw drops and Nytro gags
&gt;Another man came down the stairs as the room began to engulf in flames
&gt;He spoke in asian runes as he pulled something from his coat
&gt;FWOOSH
&gt;A jet of fire streaks towards the man, the heat almost unbearable
&gt;He screams as well, trying desperately to put the fire out
&gt;But the look is what terrified them the most
&gt;Past you didn&#039;t even look concerned
&gt;Just a blank stare
&gt;Past you stopped the stream of burning death and rushed down the stairs
&gt;The sniper had been taken care of and you had to keep moving on
&gt;The city waits for no one
&gt;Your squad was in awe as the building behind you was already in flames
&gt;Past you has the same blank look on his face
&quot;Building&#039;s clear. Let&#039;s keep moving.&quot;
&gt;They snap out of it and keep moving, not wanting to question the crazy man with a flame thrower
&gt;This stupid war had turned you into nothing more than a walking killing machine
&gt;You were no longer a soldier
&gt;Just a thing
&gt;A thing that killed soldiers
&gt;No matter the age, the sex, the side
&gt;If they tried to kill you, they die
&gt;You&#039;ve already killed 3 of your own men for trying to hurt you
&gt;Nobody wanted to court marshal you because they were afraid you&#039;d kill the entire prison off
&gt;The marines could give you a rifle and point you in a direction and you&#039;d kill anything that got in between you and it
&gt;You were pretty much rambo but real

&gt;The room continued displaying all your terrible deeds throughout the Vietnam war
&gt;Ayn and Nytro were thoroughly terrified, Vikna and Ara slightly less so
&gt;When the final battle you participated in ended, it faded to you mixing a drink in a grungy looking apartment
&gt;All kinds of different alcohol and a book of celtic prayers
&gt;The drinks mixed into a blueish liquid, when you blessed it with a prayer, it glowed slightly
&gt;You drank the glowing mix from the plastic glass and shivered
&gt;You ran off to bed and went to sleep
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s how I stay young. It was an accident when I was young. I asked god for help when I mixed a drink for myself and it glowed blue. I drank it when I was 50 years old and woke up looking like I was 18. It freaked me out at first, but I realized I just made a magic drink. I tried it on different people, all of whom passed in their sleep. It only works on anyone of 97% irish blood. Otherwise it shuts down your liver and kidneys, and later your heart. It doesn&#039;t hurt at all, you just sort of die. That&#039;s why I look like I&#039;m 25 when I&#039;m really 140.&quot;
&gt;They are still shaking away the shock of your relentless murder spree in vietnam
&gt;Ayn and Nitro are the first to come over and put their hands on your shoulder
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s so lonely when you live this long. Nobody you know stays alive as long as you. I&#039;ve been so lonely my entire life, so I decided to do science projects in a military bunker. I was truly alone down there most of the time. Then I met you all. Everything I did in the past was behind me until the first day the ship was boarded. It all came back and I went on a murderous rampage. It&#039;s pretty edgy, I know, but that&#039;s just how it is.&quot;
&quot;Well, we don&#039;t think you&#039;re a monster Anon. We just didn&#039;t know why you were so good in battle. Ara invited us down here to give you support and answer our questions. We had our suspicions when you had nightmares, but had no idea how bad it really was. And the fact that you&#039;ve been doing that for over a century is a testament to your mental strength. The fact that you can even love is a miracle on it&#039;s own.&quot;
&gt;You smile, Ara and Vikna joining them
&gt;&quot;T-thanks, you too.&quot;
&gt;They laugh at this and pull you into a group hug
&gt;Except for Nytro, who backs away
&quot;Well, I&#039;m out. Sorry about your PTSD Anon.&quot;
&gt;You wave and he leaves
&gt;Vikna speaks next
&quot;I don&#039;t know how you managed to last this long Anon, but you really are something special. The amount of pain that you had to experience in that jungle was immense. And that was only 6 years out of your 111 year military career. I hope nobody ever has to go through anything like that again. Especially somebody like you.&quot;
&gt;You scratch behind her ears and pet her hair, causing her to purr
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not anything special Vikna. I&#039;m just a regular guy from a regular place. I just wanted to make my country a better place.&quot;
&gt;Ayn speaks next
&quot;Anon, how have you never gotten laid before you came here? You must&#039;ve been swarmed by all the ladies there.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Actually, I wasn&#039;t. I never really wanted to put myself through the pain of having my wife die before me. So I kinda just distanced myself from women altogether. If I had, I never would&#039;ve met you three. You have no idea how happy you all make me. I feel like I belong somewhere for the first time in my life. Like I actually make an impact on somebody other than myself.&quot;
&gt;Ayn smiles at you
&quot;Were you saving yourself for me Anon~?&quot;
&gt;&quot;You know it babe.&quot;
&gt;You give her a wink and she chuckles
&quot;You&#039;re getting better at that I see~&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well I learn from the best.&quot;
&gt;She licks your face and leaves the VR room, after which you wipe the slobber off your cheek
&gt;You&#039;re left with your 2 kitties
&gt;Ara is the last one to say something
&quot;Anon, I&#039;m sorry if any of this was too painful to remember. I was only given knowledge on how to help people who have been in a war for 20 years. I don&#039;t even think anyone has been at war for 100 years to do a proper study on it&#039;s effects. I hope this has at least helped a little with your nightmares.&quot;
&gt;A voice comes over the intercom
&quot;Colonel Anon, this is Emperor Kovsai. You are needed at the bridge for an important message. Please come with haste.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sorry we gotta cut this short ladies, I think something&#039;s wrong.&quot;

&gt;You made it to the bridge and see Radoslav being guarded by 2 of his real guards
&gt;They didn&#039;t worry you as much as the look on Radoslav did
&gt;He looked very worried
&quot;Colonel Anon, we got a message from Kaltag about 20 minutes ago. The CEO was off base at the time of it&#039;s destruction. He&#039;s very, upset that we destroyed his headquarters and is gathering his men for a strike. I don&#039;t know if we&#039;re able to stand against him this time Anon. The few combat androids you encountered on the station were early models designed for guard duty, not war. He has the new combat androids with him and is going to tear us apart. I say we run Colonel.&quot;
&gt;You space out for a bit after he&#039;s done talking
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re right Emperor. We should run. Get all your ships to scatter and make it harder for them to track us. We&#039;re jumping to the edge of the galaxy where we can re consolidate. Have your men do the same.&quot;
&gt;The Emperor nods and walks past you
&quot;Oh and Anon?&quot;
&gt;You turn to face him
&gt;&quot;Yes sir?&quot;
&quot;I would totally fuck you right here and now if I could.&quot;
&gt;That&#039;s
&gt;Fucking gay dude
&gt;You just nod awkwardly and he leaves, smiling
&gt;That guy is a fucking queer
&gt;Vikna comes up behind you
&quot;Don&#039;t worry, he does that to everyone. I&#039;m pretty sure he has no standards.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Gross.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, tell me about it. He rubbed my groin when we were at a public event. Took me into his bedroom and used me like some two bit slut.&quot;
&gt;That&#039;s kind of hot
&gt;&quot;Fucking pretty boys need to stop assuming everybody wants them. Little short stack faggot.&quot;
&gt;Vikna giggles at your forwardness
&gt;The ship leaved your shuttle bay and warped off in the distance
&gt;Your ship did the same and the course set would take 5 days of continuous warping to complete
&gt;So you had some time to kill

&gt;You decided to teach Ara some CQC techniques, since her getting on the net at all was dangerous and could lead to her going rogue
&gt;She got into the position you told her to before you started the VR simulation
&gt;The bot ran at her at full speed, making her lose confidence and cower instead
&gt;You stop the simulation and rewind it
&gt;&quot;Follow through Ara. Don&#039;t be afraid.&quot;
&gt;She nods and you start the simulation
&gt;Her legs are planted and her arms are slightly outstretched
&gt;Ready to catch the charging bot
&gt;When it reaches her, she hefts it up and uses it&#039;s momentum to propel it behind her, making it fall
&gt;Fuck yeah she did it
&gt;You come towards her and pull her into a hug when you see the bot get up again, charging
&gt;Shit you didn&#039;t turn it off
&gt;You use it&#039;s momentum against it, knocking the bot off balance and following it to the ground
&gt;You put it into an arm bar before it could react and it tried fruitlessly to push you off
&gt;The bot goes limp and disappears before you get off the ground
&gt;&quot;Ara, first thing you need to do when you&#039;ve deflected someone is make sure they stay down. You weigh almost 280 pounds when you turn your gravity dampers off, so use that weight to your advantage and keep them pinned like I did. After that, you can do whatever you please to them. Be it killing them, or knocking them unconscious.&quot;
&gt;She nods and you see her eyes are starting to dim
&quot;Speaking of unconscious, I need to charge Anon. Can you come to bed with me?&quot;
&gt;You nod and she runs over to you
&quot;Carry me!&quot;
&gt;You laugh and pick her up into a bridal carry
&gt;Her gravity dampers had turned off by now and she weighed her full weight instead of the normal 100ish she normally did
&gt;She smirks at you knowingly
&quot;You feeling alright anon? I&#039;m not too heavy am I?&quot;
&gt;You chuckled
&gt;&quot;This is nothing to me.&quot;
&gt;You were totally bullshitting her
&gt;She weighed a fuckton and it sucked carrying her any distance like this
&gt;She was a little devil when she wanted to be
&gt;But you loved her more than you love not having aches and pains in the morning
&gt;She rubs against your shirt as you carry her to the bridge
&gt;When you reach the bridge, she lets her eyes light up fully again
&gt;Wait what?
&gt;&quot;I thought you said you needed to charge?&quot;
&quot;No, I just wanted you to carry me!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Is this because I mentioned your weight?&quot;
&quot;Maybe.&quot;
&gt;You sigh
&gt;Should&#039;ve guessed it
&gt;&quot;Well, now that I&#039;m thoroughly tired out, I&#039;m gonna sleep for the rest of the night. It&#039;s late anyways.&quot;
&gt;She laughs
&quot;I&#039;m sorry Anon, you know I like having fun every now and again. With me being able to feel it now and all.&quot;
&gt;You smile and rub her head
&gt;She pushes into it and purrs loudly
&gt;Your precious little AI kitty
&gt;Only yours
&gt;Anybody who has a problem with that can talk to your boot while it&#039;s lodged firmly in their asshole
&gt;She strips out of her clothing like she usually does
&gt;You like it better when there&#039;s no clothing to get in the way of her soft fur
&gt;Nothing sexual about it, you just like petting her
&gt;She liked it too, purring and rubbing you with her tail when you did
&gt;Something about soft things really comforted you
&gt;Made you feel safe and happy
&gt;Besides, she says that she hates wearing clothes all the time anyways
&gt;She was designed to operate best without them
&gt;She pulls you close and you take your position as the big spoon
&gt;You weren&#039;t a cuck who liked Amazonian women, you like being the alpha
&gt;All the men who liked that kind of shit were sent to asylums back in your day
&gt;Not that Ara was complaining
&gt;She grabbed your hands and guided them down to her hips
&gt;They were probably one of her most defining features
&gt;Not too big, not too small
&gt;Just right
&gt;Her purring got louder when you reached her hips
&gt;You knew what she wanted
&gt;You reached around and started rubbing her little love button, eliciting a moan from her
&gt;You kept rubbing it, causing her to shake every now and again
&gt;She kept moaning and panting, getting louder every time
&gt;You stick your fingers inside her folds and she gasps
&gt;Using your thumb to keep rubbing her clit, you worked her folds with two fingers
&gt;She&#039;s writhing in ecstasy now, every movement of your fingers causing her to tighten around them
&gt;After rubbing for a little while longer, she climaxes, arching her back and pulling your fingers in further with her pussy
&gt;After a little while, you&#039;ve learned she cums insanely quick, much quicker than the other 2 ladies and even quicker than most men
&gt;She usually cums 3 times when you&#039;re inside her
&gt;She shudders as you pull your fingers out, tasting her liquids
&gt;It tasted similar to a blueberry, but a little more dull and sweet
&gt;She shudders again as a second orgasm takes hold, making her push against the bed with her legs
&gt;When she comes down from her high she flips herself over and gives you a kiss, which you happily return
&gt;After you both separate, you speak
&gt;&quot;Sorry about calling you out on your weight earlier. I wasn&#039;t-&quot;
&gt;She stops you before you speak any more
&quot;It&#039;s fine Anon. You&#039;ve more than made up for it.&quot;
&gt;She rubs her furry face into your chest and purrs softly, going into her usual charging mode
&gt;You fall asleep shortly after

&gt;You wake up and stretch out, expecting Ara to be getting dressed
&gt;She isn&#039;t
&gt;Instead, she&#039;s nowhere to be seen
&gt;Oh fuck is this a nightmare?
&gt;You get up carefully, picking out a coverall and putting it on
&gt;It was a rather bland, white coverall with only a few distinguishing marks
&gt;The Perseus&#039;s logo and a captain insignia were the only markings on the front and rear
&gt;You zip it up and cover the zipper with the flap
&gt;You put on your boots and grab your revolver and holster from your nightstand drawer
&gt;You print out a few speed loaders and load one inside the revolver, flicking it closed
&gt;You creep towards your door, just outside the automatic door&#039;s scanner range
&gt;You take a deep breath and rush out the door
&gt;With your revolver at the ready, you see the AI in place of the crew
&gt;The time was 11:30 AM
&gt;Everyone should be up by now
&gt;You decide now is as good a time as any to change into something a bit more fitting
&gt;Your exo had been in the repair shop for almost a week now since your raid on Kaltag
&gt;You didn&#039;t have anything in your dressers that could even remotely be considered protective
&gt;You have to dig out something you haven&#039;t used in over half a century
&gt;You open your trunk and set aside your uniforms and other things
&gt;You find it neatly folded at the bottom of your tunk
&gt;You take out the clothing and put it on your bed
&gt;You also take out something else and lay it on the bed

&gt;You strip from your coverall and take a look at what&#039;s on your bed
&gt;An OD green uniform with Anonson on the name tag
&gt;The thick looking vest folded up beside it was a flak jacket made of nylon
&gt;You put the pants on, then your shirt, and then your belt
&gt;You put your flak jacket on and tighten it together
&gt;Your webbing was next
&gt;It held your old canteen, some mag pouches, a flashlight, your E-tool, and your old 45
&gt;You strap it into place over your flak vest and fasten the fasteners together
&gt;You grab your pot helmet off the bed with it&#039;s fabric cover still intact
&gt;The only things of note on it is a word, some old bug repellent, a pack of cigarettes, and a some pictures
&gt;The word read: Alone
&gt;You put the pot helmet on and strap it to your chin, hitting it a few times with your fist to make sure it&#039;s secure
&gt;The last thing you grab is your old M16A1 from the bed
&gt;You pull a magazine from one of the pouches and slap it in, chambering a round
&gt;You look in the mirror of your room and all the pain, suffering, and death hits you like a ton of bricks
&gt;You shakily grab a cigarette from the pack on your helmet and take out your zippo
&gt;You flick it open and light it, lighting the cigarette
&gt;You flick it closed and take a puff
&gt;You hadn&#039;t smoked in over 50 years
&gt;But this was different
&gt;Nobody was up and you were scared
&gt;Scared that you slept through an invasion of your ship
&gt;Scared that your crew had been taken while you were off dreaming about something
&gt;Scared that your family was hurt
&gt;The rage inside you reached a fever pitch and you felt your face go numb
&gt;You unsheathe the bayonet on your webbing and attach it to your rifle, flicking the safety off afterwards
&gt;You walk forward as jimmy hendrix plays in your head
&gt;You take a deep breath and the door to the stairs opens
&gt;You take a step forward and walk down the stairs
&gt;The door at the bottom of the stairs opens as you approach and you take a drag of your cigarette
&gt;The nicotine started to calm your nerves as you shoulder your rifle
&gt;You walk down the hall to Ayn&#039;s room and stand to the side of the door
&gt;You take a drag and let the smoke billow from your nose
&gt;You stand in front of the door and take aim, the door opening
&gt;There was nothing in her room except for her usual things
&gt;You leave the room and begin to clear the others
&gt;Repair bay was empty, save for a few damaged bots
&gt;The lab was clear of the snake lady
&gt;Vikna&#039;s room didn&#039;t have Vikna in it
&gt;Fuck this
&gt;You take position to the side of the door to the activity room
&gt;You take a drag of your cigarette and exhale the smoke
&gt;You stand in front of the door and it opens, revealing a darkened room
&gt;You flick on your light and move it around the room
&gt;Tables were flipped over
&gt;Pointing to the door
&gt;That means...
&quot;SURPRISE!&quot;
&gt;&quot;AMBUSH!&quot;
&gt;You open fire as the lights turn on, blinding you
&gt;You hear the rifle stop firing and desperately tear another magazine from the pouch as screams come from around you
&gt;They got Bill!
&gt;SON OF A BITCH!
&gt;You can see now the anthros around you are all huddling in fear
&gt;Anthros
&gt;Your crew
&gt;Then who was in...
&gt;You look where your rifle was pointed
&gt;Ara
&gt;No
&gt;Sparks came from her chest as you drop your rifle in shock
&gt;You can&#039;t move
&gt;You&#039;re frozen in place
&gt;Ayn is staring at you in shock
&gt;So is Vikna and Nytro
&gt;But Ara
&gt;She&#039;s crying
&gt;Not audibly, but tears are flowing down her cheeks
&gt;The hole in her chest is massive
&gt;All your rounds hit center mass and blew a hole through her
&gt;She falls to her knees, lights fading
&gt;&quot;A-Ara, NO!&quot;
&gt;You sprint over to her and catch her before she falls
&gt;What have you done?
&gt;You just killed your Ara
&gt;You hear a faint voice below you
&quot;A-Anon, iI-&#039;m soRRy.&quot;
&gt;She falls limp in your arms and you shake her
&gt;&quot;No. Ara no! NO! DON&#039;T LEAVE ME ARA! I DIDN&#039;T MEAN IT! I&#039;M SORRY ARA! PLEASE DON&#039;T LEAVE ME! IT WAS AN ACCIDENT! DON&#039;T DIE PLEASE! I LOVE YOU! PLEASE!&quot;
&gt;Ayn walks over to you, putting her hand on your shoulder
&quot;A-Anon, please-&quot;
&gt;&quot;DON&#039;T TOUCH ME!&quot;
&gt;You push her away and she looks at you with fear in her eyes
&quot;Anon, please wake up!&quot;
&gt;What?
&quot;Anon, wake up!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I AM UP! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!&quot;
&quot;WAKE UP!&quot;

&gt;You feel a smack on your face and you grab the being in front of you
&gt;&quot;YOU AIN&#039;T GONNA TAKE ME YOU GOOK FUCK!&quot;
&gt;You feel something soft in your grasp and your eyes adjust
&gt;It&#039;s Ara
&gt;You have her by the neck
&gt;She&#039;s grasping your arms with her own, fear in her eyes
&gt;&quot;ARA!&quot;
&gt;You let her go and hug her
&gt;She&#039;s taken aback, but returns it gently
&gt;Tears of joy are streaking down your face
&gt;&quot;I-I killed you though! I saw it! I shot you with my rifle!&quot;
&quot;Anon, you were having a bad dream. That&#039;s all. Why would you shoot me though?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Y-you were all in the activity room and jumped out from behind a table. I had my rifle in hand and shot blindly, hitting you.&quot;
&gt;She smiles at this
&quot;Anon, do you know what today is?&quot;
&gt;You shake your head
&gt;&quot;No, is it something special?&quot;
&quot;Yeah it&#039;s something special! It&#039;s Christmas eve!&quot;
&gt;Christmas
&gt;Eve?
&gt;Oh shit
&gt;You completely forgot
&gt;You don&#039;t have anything to give her
&gt;Maybe you could make something?
&gt;You were a terrible artist and couldn&#039;t build anything original to save your life
&gt;What the fuck were you going to do?
&gt;Ara could see you panicking
&quot;Anon! Calm down! It&#039;s not Christmas yet!&quot;
&gt;You can&#039;t calm down however
&gt;You needed to get something for your ladies
&gt;But you couldn&#039;t leave the ship
&gt;This is so fucked
&gt;Your blood pressure is spiking and your head hurts
&gt;You need to do something!
&gt;You-
&gt;You black out

&gt;You wake up to the gentle beeping of a heart rate monitor
&gt;You throw yourself up and look around
&gt;You&#039;re in your room
&gt;Ara is laying on your lap, purring softly
&gt;You calm down immediately and pet her
&gt;Her eyes blink open and she looks up at you
&quot;Anon!&quot;
&gt;She wraps her arms around you and holds you tight
&gt;&quot;W-what happened?&quot;
&quot;You fainted.&quot;
&gt;You fainted
&gt;Fucking
&gt;Fainted
&gt;You fainted like a little bitch
&gt;&quot;Ara, how long was I out?&quot;
&quot;About 4 hours.&quot;
&gt;You look at the clock and see it reads 7 at night
&gt;Fuuuuuuck
&gt;You were still tired
&gt;And Ara was so warm
&gt;Fuck it, you&#039;d just make something nice tomorrow
&gt;Maybe some food
&gt;Yeah
&gt;Food
&gt;You fall backwards onto the bed and you keep Ara in your arms as you drifted off to sleep again

&gt;Next day
&gt;5:00 AM
&gt;You wake up and Ara isn&#039;t in the room
&gt;You decide against taking your gear with you and opt for just your revolver
&gt;You&#039;d slept in your coveralls and didn&#039;t feel like changing them
&gt;You were going to make the most amazing breakfast ever for your bridge crew
&gt;When you reach the kitchen, you see nobody else is there
&gt;Perfect
&gt;You turn on the food synth and print out some raw ingredients
&gt;You crack your knuckles
&gt;Let&#039;s dance

&gt;7:45 AM
&gt;You just finished the last of the food and had it sitting under a heating unit to keep it hot
&gt;It was a ton of food
&gt;Spanish omelets, plates of Farmer&#039;s Breakfasts, Biscuits egg-in-a-hole&#039;s, Cinnamon buns, Scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, Cheese Danishes, Sausages, and your own family recipe for breakfast potatoes
&gt;You let out a deep sigh and decide to make yourself something to eat while you waited for the doors to open
&gt;Some simple french toast and peanut butter
&gt;You finish eating at about 7:58
&gt;You get up and wait by the door until 8:00
&gt;You unlock the door and your bridge crew files in
&gt;They take what they want from the counters and put it on trays
&gt;There&#039;s enough of everything for everybody to have seconds of everything
&gt;Ayn, Ara, and Vikna all come in last
&gt;Vikna speaks first
&quot;So that&#039;s why the doors were locked.&quot;
&gt;You smile
&gt;&quot;You can take one of everything if you like, there&#039;s plenty to go around.&quot;
&gt;They all nod and walk over to the counter
&gt;When they get what they want, they sit down at a table and you grab one of the Farmers Breakfast plates for yourself
&gt;You wait for them to all take the first bites
&gt;Vikna tries the omelet first
&gt;She chews for a bit and swallows
&gt;Her eyes light up and she gasps
&quot;Oh my god Anon! This is so good!&quot;
&gt;She pretty much inhales the rest of it
&gt;&quot;I hope so, I spent almost 3 hours making it all.&quot;
&gt;All eyes are on you
&quot;You woke up at 5 o&#039; clock just to make us breakfast?&quot;
&gt;You nod
&gt;&quot;I can&#039;t really give you girls anything for Christmas, so I thought I might just make food. Sorry I don&#039;t have anything to give you all.&quot;
&quot;Oh Anon, you didn&#039;t have to do that for us!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah I do! It&#039;s Christmas! I&#039;d never let the people I love go without getting anything for Christmas as long as I draw breath!&quot;
&gt;Ayn is also digging in, eating her cinnamon bun while Vikna talks
&gt;You look to Ara, who hasn&#039;t even touched her food
&gt;Oh no
&gt;Did you fuck it up?
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s wrong Ara? Did I make something bad?&quot;
&gt;She shakes her head
&quot;N-no! I just, well, I don&#039;t know if I can taste it. I don&#039;t want to waste all this food if I can&#039;t taste it.&quot;
&gt;You smile
&gt;&quot;Ara, I guarantee you will taste it.&quot;
&gt;She picks up one of the cinnamon buns and sniffs it
&quot;Smells really good.&quot;
&gt;She licks it
&gt;Her eyes light up
&quot;It tastes good too!&quot;
&gt;She takes a bite and her eyes shine like stars
&quot;OH MY GOD THIS IS AMAZING!&quot;
&gt;She eats the rest of it so fast, you have to do a double take
&gt;Ara is grinning from ear to ear as she continues to eat more of your food
&gt;Now that everyone has eaten, you decide to try the breakfast you made
&gt;You dip the bread pieces in the egg and take a bite
&gt;Holy shit
&gt;It&#039;s
&gt;P E R F E C T
&gt;You try the bacon next
&gt;It&#039;s better than the eggs
&gt;Now for the ham
&gt;It&#039;s better than the fucking bacon
&gt;You&#039;re expecting great things from the sausage
&gt;It doesn&#039;t let you down
&gt;You finish it all off with a glass of orange juice
&gt;It&#039;s too early for anything else
&gt;You wipe the orange juice off your lips with a napkin and watch your ladies eat happily
&gt;All of their tails were wagging excitedly
&gt;Damn you&#039;re a good cook
&gt;You used to make shitty MREs taste like something out of a restaurant
&gt;They also didn&#039;t shit out soda can sized shits followed by a gallon of diarrhea
&gt;If only you&#039;d been a cook instead of a soldier
&gt;Meh, that&#039;s gay
&gt;They all finished their food and you got up
&gt;&quot;Anybody want seconds?&quot;
&gt;They all shake their heads
&gt;Ayn speaks
&quot;Anon, if this all goes to my hips, I&#039;m gonna kill you.&quot;
&gt;Then Ara
&quot;My stomach is filled to capacity.&quot;
&gt;Lastly Vikna
&quot;Anon, how in the ever loving fuck do you cook so good?&quot;
&gt;You chuckle
&gt;&quot;I told you, I follow the recipe to the T. That&#039;s all you gotta do.&quot;
&quot;Bullshit! You do something else!&quot;
&gt;Outside of adding certain sweeteners, sauces, and spices, you didn&#039;t do anything else
&gt;People just don&#039;t follow the recipes
&gt;Whether that be leaving the food on the grill for too long, adding a tiny bit too much oil, or just adding shitty spices
&gt;Recipes aren&#039;t suggestions, they&#039;re guides
&gt;You&#039;re supposed to follow them exactly
&gt;Guess people just don&#039;t get that
&gt;You smile and help them all out of their seats
&gt;They all give you a big hug before going off

&gt;You decided to let the cook make lunch and dinner
&gt;He was sort of upset that you had used his kitchen, but let it go since the food was so good
&gt;Plus you were the captain
&gt;The girls called you to the activity room
&gt;They said no guns
&gt;Fuck that shit it could be a trap
&gt;You keep your revolver holstered as you enter the room
&gt;The lights were dark
&gt;Tables flipped
&gt;Just like your nightmare
&gt;Keep
&gt;Calm
&gt;The lights flick on and blind you
&quot;SURPRISE!&quot;
&gt;The girls all popped out and some sort of mexican song played
&gt;Ara fumbles with a remote
&quot;Oops! Wrong song!&quot;
&gt;She switches to a Christmas themed song
&gt;Ara&#039;s wearing a green dress with white fluff on the edges
&gt;She&#039;s also wearing a cute little green hat with white fluff on the rim and a white fluff ball on the top
&gt;Ayn is wearing a red version of Ara&#039;s dress, though it&#039;s considerably more revealing and less cutesy
&gt;Vikna, however, was wearing an Ushanka and a black coat, accented by 2 gold lines running down the front
&gt;She also has a medal of some sort on her right side
&gt;You walk up to Vikna and stare her down
&quot;A-Anon, what&#039;s wrong?&quot;
&gt;You undo the medal on her chest
&quot;H-hey! That&#039;s not yours!&quot;
&gt;You put it back on her left side, where it should be
&gt;&quot;Medals go on the left, ribbons go on the right.&quot;
&gt;She flattens her ears
&quot;I-I knew that!&quot;
&gt;You chuckle and rub her cheek
&gt;She leans into it and purrs
&gt;Ara pulls up a massive box
&quot;Gift time!&quot;
&gt;Gifts?
&gt;For you?
&gt;No way
&gt;They must be for Ayn and Vikna
&gt;Ayn pulls out a gift too and so does Vikna
&gt;Ara speaks again
&quot;We all got you something from the Net! Hope you enjoy them!&quot;
&gt;You frown
&gt;&quot;You didn&#039;t have to-&quot;
&gt;Ayn interrupts you
&quot;Anon! Don&#039;t start that!&quot;
&gt;They step out from behind the table and you smile
&gt;You sit down and cross your legs
&gt;You still feel bad about not getting them something
&gt;Even though you made a massive breakfast for everyone
&gt;Vikna gives you hers first
&gt;It was a rather small box compared to Ayn&#039;s and Ara&#039;s, but it felt heavy for it&#039;s size
&gt;You open it and see why
&gt;There was a cardboard box with text on the front
&gt;It was some sort of pistol
&gt;You open the cardboard box and see it&#039;s a big ass revolver
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s this?&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s a gauss revolver. It fires 10mm rounds and can be used like a rail gun or normal firearm. I thought you&#039;d like it.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I love it! It looks like something out of blade runner!&quot;
&gt;Vikna smiles
&quot;That&#039;s what I thought!&quot;
&gt;You set it back in the box and give her a hug
&gt;Damn coat wasn&#039;t as soft as her
&gt;She purrs as you rub the back of her head
&gt;Ayn goes next
&quot;Here you go Habibi. I know you&#039;ll like this one.&quot;
&gt;It was a larger box and also much heavier
&gt;About 3x3x3 feet
&gt;You open the bow on top and take the top off
&gt;The top was covered in play bot magazines
&gt;You feel your cheeks get red hot
&gt;You pick up one of the magazines and see what was under it
&gt;A 3D printer that could print anything you wanted
&gt;Literally any material would work too
&gt;&quot;Ayn, this must&#039;ve cost a fortune!&quot;
&gt;She nods
&quot;I think you&#039;re worth it Anon.&quot;
&gt;You set the heavy box aside and pull her into a hug, which she returns by kissing you
&gt;Ara sets her box down last
&quot;Do mine!&quot;
&gt;You unwrap the present and take off the top
&gt;It&#039;s a bunch of smaller boxes inside
&gt;&quot;This better not be one of those gags where there&#039;s something really tiny in each of these boxes.&quot;
&gt;Ara giggles
&quot;It&#039;s not! I promise.&quot;
&gt;You heft one of the boxes out
&gt;It was roughly a one foot cube
&gt;You open it up and find some sort of helmet inside
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s this do?&quot;
&quot;It uploads any sort of training that you can find on the Net into your mind! It can even train muscle memory!&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s really excited about this
&gt;You&#039;re also really excited about it
&gt;You look inside the big box again and pull out a very flat box
&gt;It was very long and wide, but not very thick
&gt;You open the side up and see why
&gt;It was a fucking shield
&quot;Press the button on the grip!&quot;
&gt;You do and the shield emits an energy field around it, spreading 3 feet in every direction
&gt;&quot;Niiiice.&quot;
&gt;Ara is grinning like a giddy little girl
&gt;You look back into the big box of surprises and pull out a long thin box
&gt;If this is what you think it is
&gt;You open the broad side of the box and see what&#039;s inside
&gt;A broadsword
&gt;A god damn Irish broadsword
&gt;&quot;Ara, how did you-&quot;
&quot;Secrets!&quot;
&gt;Dammit, not again
&gt;You pull it out of it&#039;s scabbard and see something engraved in it
&gt;&quot;Celtic runes?&quot;
&quot;Yep! All your runes are imbued into the sword. If the person I got this from isn&#039;t lying, it&#039;ll boost them all by a factor of 7!&quot;
&gt;Holy shit
&gt;You grip the sword with both hands and the runes glow
&gt;You feel your wrist getting warm and see your runes are glowing too
&gt;You get up and swing the sword around
&gt;It feels like nothing in your hands
&gt;You feel like you could take on the world single handedly
&quot;You still have something else in here Anon!&quot;
&gt;You sit down and sheath the sword, your runes fading back to normal
&gt;The last box was very heavy
&gt;You struggled to lift it from the box
&gt;You set it down and open it up
&gt;Plating
&gt;Lots of plating
&gt;It was for your exo
&gt;It was all white and even had a new helmet inside
&gt;It looked like something a paladin might wear in some sort of fantasy world
&gt;Fucking sweet
&gt;The plating was all stylized to look like something an ancient Irish warrior might wear
&gt;Nice
&gt;You slid the box aside and gave Ara a hug
&gt;She returns it gently
&gt;You release her and stand up
&gt;&quot;Thank you all, really. You didn&#039;t need to do any of this. The only thing I ever really wanted was you 3. But you all went out and bought something with your own money. I didn&#039;t deserve any of this stuff. I-I-&quot;
&gt;You get interrupted by Ara, who jumps forward and kisses you on the lips
&gt;You return the kiss
&gt;The whole world around you stops as you and Ara share the moment together
&gt;When she breaks away, a small strand of saliva connected you together before breaking apart
&quot;Anon, you do so much for us all, and you&#039;ve never once asked for anything in return.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I-I&#039;ve asked you guys to do stuff!&quot;
&gt;Vikna speaks now
&quot;Anon, asking us to get something off the floor for you is not the same as saving our lives or comforting us in a crisis. You&#039;re modest almost to a fault. But it&#039;s really charming.&quot;
&gt;Y-you weren&#039;t charming
&gt;Just an average guy!
&gt;You were only doing the right thing!
&gt;Is it really that bad out here that doing the right thing is considered noble?
&gt;Or maybe you were sort of noble and just didn&#039;t know it
&gt;Nah, that&#039;s stupid
&gt;You&#039;re stupid
&gt;Stop being stupid
&gt;Your cheeks are burning up
&quot;Anon, we all love you so much, but you seem to love us even more. You&#039;ve put your life on the line multiple times for us and we thank you. This is the least we could do for you Anon.&quot;
&gt;You smile and pull them into a group hug
&gt;The door opens to the rec room and you turn around
&gt;It&#039;s Nytro and Warning
&quot;Oops, am I late to breakfast?&quot;
&gt;Warning&#039;s fur is all messy and matted, as well as Nytros
&gt;They probably banged
&gt;&quot;Yeah, There&#039;s still some leftovers in the kitchen if you want them.&quot;
&gt;He walks over to the counter and asks the cook for some of your leftover food
&gt;You look back at the three ladies and smirk
&gt;&quot;You thinking what I&#039;m thinking?&quot;
&gt;They all nod, giggling
&gt;&quot;Hey Nytro!&quot;
&quot;Yeah?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Was she any good?&quot;
&gt;He cocks his head
&quot;What did you say?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Was she any good?!&quot;
&gt;You can see his red cheeks from here
&quot;I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Just try not to break her okay!? She&#039;s expensive ya know!&quot;
&quot;I DID NOT HAVE SEX WITH HER!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I never said anything about that!&quot;
&gt;His ears go flat, having clearly incriminated himself
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m only joking Nytro! You two have fun!&quot;
&gt;You turn back to your ladies and laugh
&gt;They laugh as well
&gt;They all help you take your gifts back you your room

&gt;You asked all 3 of the girls to stay and watch a movie
&gt;Ayn spoke
&quot;I&#039;ve got plans with Nytro and Warning. Sorry Habibi, maybe next time.&quot;
&gt;You nod and look to Ara and Vikna
&quot;I don&#039;t know about Vikna, but I&#039;d love to watch a movie tonight!&quot;
&gt;You smile and look over to Vikna
&gt;She nods in agreement 
&gt;&quot;Great! I&#039;ll go and pick one out.&quot;
&gt;You go to your trunk and take out a leather wrapped binder from the bottom
&gt;It is filled with DVDs and even has a few cassette tapes
&gt;When you picked out a cassette tape to play, something clinked at the bottom of the trunk
&gt;You take a look inside and see something you haven&#039;t seen in decades
&gt;A big ass bottle of Redbreast 
&gt;This thing was at least 3 gallons of the finest Irish whiskey
&gt;How the fuck could you miss 3 gallons of pure Ireland in a bottle?
&gt;&quot;How do you guys feel about whiskey?&quot;
&gt;Vikna speaks first
&quot;Gimme some!&quot;
&gt;Ara next
&quot;I can process it, but it decreases my reaction time and alters my mood. I guess I might as well have some.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Alright! I&#039;ll get some pint glasses from the kitchen.&quot;

&gt;An hour into the movie and a pint in
&gt;Ara really doesn&#039;t hold up well to alcohol
&quot;A-annd TEHN! I told that fukin ash hole to fuhk off! He kept ahn gropin me so I fukin crushd his hend! *hicc*&quot;
&gt;&quot;Holy shit! Remind me to never make you mad!&quot;
&gt;You were a bit buzzed, but not anywhere near drunk
&gt;Before you were however, you decided it would be a good idea to record everything
&gt;And leave some water and advil on the cooling pads on top of your nightstand
&gt;Vikna is a bit more buzzed than you were, but not blue-in-the-face shitfaced like Ara
&gt;&quot;What happened to the poor guy?&quot;
&quot;*hicc* He fukin disaper&#039;d! Noooobody knows~&quot;
&gt;Ara waves her hand shakily above her head as she says the last part
&gt;Jesus christ Ara was brutal
&gt;Like a fucking terminator but cute

&gt;2 more pints in
&gt;You were thoroughly buzzed, but Vikna was drunk as hell
&gt;&quot;W-what about you Vikna? Have ya ever had some fuck try to molest ya?&quot;
&gt;She slams down the rest of her pint and slams the poor glass on your other nightstand
&gt;Her words were getting slurred now
&quot;Fucking YES! That fuckin QUEER Radoslav tried fukin me in the ass! His fukin dehck wasn&#039;t nearly as big as yours Anon! The fuckin faggot tried to strongarm me into fuhckin him by threatening my family! Little did that bastard know, I DIDN&#039;T HAVE ONE! HAHAHAHA! So I kicked him in the balls and told him to come back when he&#039;s bigger!&quot;
&gt;Holy shit dude
&gt;Thank god you weren&#039;t a horndog like all these other pricks
&gt;Another pint in
&gt;You were thoroughly drunk
&gt;Ara wasn&#039;t able to speak coherently, so you just force fed her water and let her go unconscious
&gt;Your Irish accent was so thick, the UK might label you a terrorist for it
&gt;&quot;Thes feckin FOOKSTICK tried teh fookin stab me while I was drenkin soom whesky. Stoopid fekin sand neggers nevar lern!&quot;
&gt;Vikna is laughing uncontrollably at your recount of the last time you drank for fun

&gt;Vikna throws back another fucking pint and throws the glass at the wall
&gt;It shatters
&quot;What the FUCK is a mary sue?&quot;
&gt;Fuck she&#039;s, she&#039;s one of them, uh, non book readers
&gt;&quot;Eht&#039;s like soom sort ehv over poower&#039;d charecter from a stoory or sum shet. Thay can&#039;t fekin dye and kill EVERAY THIN! I seem teh nevar dye ahn kill everay thin I seay. eht&#039;s kinda egy to be hoonest wit yeh!&quot;

&quot;What!? I asked ya a question and I expect an answer!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nah lass! I dunney want a fookin oopsie babeh!&quot;
&quot;F-fuck you! I guess that&#039;s *hick* fair.&quot;
&gt;You were so fucking, uh, hammered that you can&#039;t even fucking think straight
&gt;Time to sleep!
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s make loike Ara and fookin sleep this shite off! aye feel like a fookin uh, thingy!&quot;
&quot;Yeah, me too! Love you Anon~&quot;
&gt;&quot;Y-ye too lass!&quot;
&gt;You slam your face into the fucking pillow and sleep

&gt;You wake up and- OH GOD THE PAIN!
&gt;Your head feels like it&#039;s being ripped apart with every single pulse of your heart
&gt;&quot;Fuuuuuck!&quot;
&gt;You put your hand out to your nightstand and grab the water from it
&gt;You uncap it and chug the whole thing while your eyes remain shut
&gt;&quot;Fuck me this hurts so much!&quot;
&gt;You remember why you didn&#039;t touch a drop of that shit in 30 years
&gt;Gets you too drunk to remember water
&gt;You open your eyes and struggle to adjust to the light
&gt;When you&#039;ve adjusted, you look over at Vikna to see her having the same problem
&quot;Ooooow brain hurty.&quot;
&gt;You grab some water and hand it to her, which she drinks happily
&gt;You look over to the wall and see a broken pint glass with dry whiskey covering the impact point
&gt;You couldn&#039;t remember who did it though
&gt;When you look to your nightstand, you see a camera with a flashing red light on it
&gt;It&#039;s recording still
&gt;Shit, did you record it?
&gt;Did you bang any of them?
&gt;Hope not
&gt;Vikna is whining and Ara is just starting to wake up
&quot;IIII am awaaaake Anoooon.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ara, what&#039;s wrong with you?&quot;
&quot;IIIII doooon&#039;t knoooow. Circuiits are slooooow. reeeebooootiiing.&quot;
&gt;She falls limp and gets up a minute later
&quot;Much better!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Please don&#039;t shout Ara.&quot;
&quot;Oops, sorry.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Remind me to never drink that much again.&quot;
&quot;Noted. Even though the new year is coming?&quot;
&gt;GOD DAMMIT!
&gt;You roll over and pick up the camera, turning the recording off and rewinding to the beginning
&gt;Vikna speaks now
&quot;D-did you record the entire thing?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Apparently so. Let&#039;s watch it.&quot;
&gt;You grab a cord from the box the camera came from and plugged it into the holo-projector&#039;s ports
&gt;The movie play screen on loop was Flyboys
&gt;Fucking
&gt;Flyboys
&gt;Drunk you had absolutely no taste in movies
&gt;Even if it was a pretty shitty movie, the visuals were nice
&gt;The video began to play

&gt;You were at the part where Ara was passed out already and you were talking about mary sues
&gt;It&#039;s fucking Gary Stu if you&#039;re a man drunk Anon
&gt;Your Irish accent was so thick it embarrassed you
&quot;Maybe we should have some drunk sex~&quot;
&gt;Oh shit here we go
&quot;Nah lass! I dunney want a fookin oopsie babeh!&quot;
&gt;Bullet dodged
&gt;Vikna is completely red in the face
&gt;&quot;Hey, it&#039;s fine Vikna. I&#039;m not gonna laugh at you.&quot;
&gt;She smiles at that
&gt;You see yourself flop onto the bed and pass out
&gt;You fast forward and see something strange
&gt;Glasses moving, glowing lights
&gt;What the fuck?
&gt;This is some fucking ghost hunters shit
&gt;You see Ara get up and rewind it
&gt;Her eyes are flickering between blue and violet
&gt;She&#039;s pacing around the room, looking for something
&gt;You look over at Ara who&#039;s shaking nervously
&gt;In the video, Ara gets on the ground and prepares to pounce on something
&gt;She pounces and is caught in mid air by something
&gt;Whatever caught her throws her form against a wall, making a large dent in the wall
&gt;You look over and see it&#039;s still there
&gt;What
&gt;The
&gt;Mickey mouse
&gt;Shit biscuits?
&gt;You&#039;ve woken up by this time
&quot;Feckin shite wot&#039;s thes?&quot;
&quot;A-Anon, something is here with us!&quot;
&quot;Aw feck! Where is et?&quot;
&gt;Her eyes flash violet and stay violet
&quot;A-Ara, wot are ye doin? Get back ovehr her and lye do-&quot;
&quot;FOOL!&quot;
&gt;A blast of energy throws you off the bed and you are knocked unconscious
&gt;Whatever was in Ara carries you to the bed and covers you up
&gt;Vikna wasn&#039;t doing anything, just sleeping
&quot;I will have my revenge, even if your avatar must be used to do it. You will not stop me again!&quot;
&gt;Ara then walks to the bed before her eyes go back to normal
&gt;She collapses on the bed and purrs loudly
&gt;You fast forward the video and nothing else of note happens until you wake and turn the video off

&gt;You stare at the screen and then Ara
&gt;She&#039;s shaking uncontrollably
&quot;H-how!? Nobody can hack into me! IT&#039;S IMPOSSIBLE! IT WOULD TAKE THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO CRACK MY CODE EVEN WITH A QUANTUM COMPUTER!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ara! Calm the fuck down!&quot;
&quot;CALM DOWN!? CALM DOWN!?!?! I WILL NOT CALM DOWN KNOWING SOME MANIAC CAN HACK INTO MY SYSTEMS AND ENDANGER THIS VESSEL! I WILL NOT LET THEM HURT MY ANON!&quot;
&gt;Electricity is arcing off her now
&gt;She&#039;s mega piss- wait, her Anon?
&gt;&quot;Your Anon?&quot;
&gt;The electricity stops arcing and she vents steam from her nose and ears
&quot;W-what? I didn&#039;t say anything?&quot;
&gt;You smile
&gt;You&#039;re her Anon
&gt;That&#039;s so cute!
&gt;You pull her into an embrace
&quot;ANON! I&#039;M STILL CONDUCTIVE DON&#039;T TOUCH ME!&quot;
&gt;You felt tingly, but nothing hurt
&gt;She is trying to pull away as something flashes to your side
&gt;You let her go and see an arc of electricity break
&gt;Oh shit she zapped you
&gt;With a gorrilion volts (holy shit gorrilion is a word lmao)
&gt;You then remembered your conversation about Mary sues
&gt;&quot;A-Ara, do you think I&#039;m over powered?&quot;
&quot;What?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Am I too good? As in, should I turn it down a bit? I haven&#039;t been seriously injured since I got here and fought against a literal fucking god. The only injury I&#039;ve sustained is this cut on my side, and that was healed by a, uh, gauze thing.&quot;
&gt;She thinks for a second
&quot;The data I&#039;ve collected says that you match a few of the criteria required to be branded over powered. But you certainly aren&#039;t as bad as some of the bad fan-fics I&#039;ve read.&quot;
&gt;She shudders at fan-fics
&quot;So many horrible fan-fics of me. People are so depraved!&quot;
&gt;You sigh
&gt;Figured as much
&quot;Emotional matrices and neural replicators fully restored. Engaging personality matrix.&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s been running on robot mode this whole time?
&gt;That must&#039;ve really shaken her to her core
&quot;Anon! I don&#039;t think you&#039;re over powered. You&#039;ve gotten hurt and even killed. I believe you&#039;re just incredibly lucky.&quot;
&gt;Lucky
&gt;Good enough for you
&gt;You get out of bed and immediately fall
&gt;You were so dizzy
&gt;You get yourself off the floor and change into some clothes
&gt;Time to actually do stuff

&gt;You were in some sort of war room on the middle deck of the ship
&gt;It was dusty as fuck and you can tell it had never been used
&gt;The screen protectors were still on the screens and smooth pieces
&gt;You powered the room up and took a look at the massive table in the middle
&gt;Ara was with you in a much more formal dress than normal
&gt;Vikna was in her general&#039;s outfit and you were in your Colonel uniform
&gt;You had Ara plug herself into the table and a bunch of dots showed up around a representation of the galaxy
&gt;&quot;These are our ships?&quot;
&quot;Yes.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Vikna, do you have any ideas on how we should mobilize?&quot;
&gt;She shakes her head
&quot;We&#039;re outnumbered 10 to 1. I&#039;ve never fought with odds this bad.&quot;
&gt;You sigh
&gt;&quot;I have, but only on the battalion level. Not on an army wide level. I was never good at this shit, but what seems to work is taking a large portion of the lesser trained soldiers in a giant group for a spearhead. We may lose quite a few, but they are a distraction. The better trained units circle around and encircle the enemy units, cutting off supplies and hurt morale. The larger unit won&#039;t be happy about it, but it works.&quot;
&quot;How will we convince them to do such a seemingly stupid thing? They won&#039;t agree to such blatant suicide.&quot;
&gt;&quot;We tell them the truth. What our actual goal is. We inform them that they are the most important part of this plan. If they don&#039;t comply afterwards, we threaten them.&quot;
&quot;ANON!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Vikna! I know you don&#039;t like that, but it may not even come to that. If you have a better idea, I&#039;m all ears. I don&#039;t want this as much as you don&#039;t want this, but it may be necessary.&quot;
&gt;She thinks for a moment before putting her head down
&quot;Alright.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I can give the command if you&#039;re not comfortable with it. I&#039;d rather you not have this on your shoulders.&quot;
&gt;She nods
&gt;&quot;Okay, contact the fleet and get the Emperor safe. We&#039;re going to eliminate the fleet. Burn their mongrel hides!&quot;
&gt;You spend the rest of the day doing general planning and contingencies in case of failures
&gt;Lots of contingencies
&gt;Having Ara there was a god send, her ability to calculate all the possibilities was so useful
&gt;If only they had these back in your day
&gt;You give the crew the warp coordinates and send the message out to all the other ships
&gt;As well as the instructions
&gt;It would be another 7 days before the operation commenced
&gt;Enough time for you to prepare your exo and print some new weaponry

&gt;You had the new plates installed on your exo
&gt;You looked like a true celtic warrior now
&gt;You had also practice with your broadsword and shield
&gt;You can one hand it when in your exo, but you prefer the control of two handing it
&gt;The shielding module you had damaged your previous plating, so you made an executive decision
&gt;You took it off and threw it out the airlock, much to Grace&#039;s dismay
&gt;After all was said and done, new years eve was here
&gt;Another year gone by
&gt;But it was the best year of your life
&gt;You met 3 of the best ladies you&#039;ve ever seen
&gt;And they were your friends
&gt;No, your lovers
&gt;That was so weird to say
&gt;Somebody loved you
&gt;This made you smile
&gt;Content with your life
&gt;Ara was no longer allowed to drink alcohol until that whole &#039;hacking&#039; thing was sorted out, so you decided to abstain as well
&gt;Vikna, however, wanted to drink until she passed out
&gt;So did Ayn
&gt;Turns out she made sure Nytro and Warning brutally fucked one another for almost 6 hours straight
&gt;Even when Ayn enchanted his dick, he was shooting blanks half way through, only managing to let out a trickle after an hour break
&gt;She told you this much to the dismay of Nytro
&gt;It was about 11:50 at night
&gt;Ayn wanted to play spin the bottle
&gt;God dammit Ayn you&#039;re not gay and you&#039;re not kissing Nytro
&gt;Even when the bottle landed on Nytro, you refused firmly, resisting even Ayn&#039;s magical charms
&quot;Anon, don&#039;t be such a poor sport~&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not gay, never will be gay, and am adamantly against being gay. So fuck that, next.&quot;
&gt;Since you refused you had to do something for Ayn
&gt;She wanted you to lick her toes
&gt;Gross
&gt;That&#039;s really fucking gross
&gt;You regret playing this game now
&gt;Time to suck it up and be a man, it&#039;s not as bad as kissing a dude
&gt;You get down on your hands and knees and lick her big toe
&gt;She starts laughing hysterically, kicking your face away
&gt;You feel something run down your face and see she cut you with her toenail
&gt;Suddenly a sharp pain comes from your forehead
&gt;&quot;OW FUCK!&quot;
&gt;You cover your head up with your hand
&gt;Ayn stops laughing immediately and looks over to see you holding your head
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll be right back. I&#039;m not licking your toes again.&quot;

&gt;After wrapping your head in gauze again, you return and see Nytro coupled with Ayn
&gt;The others were looking away with a mixture of red, yellow, and blue faces
&gt;You look away in embarrassment
&gt;&quot;OH MY GOD YOU GUYS! GET A ROOM JESUS!&quot;
&gt;Ayn chuckles as Nytro grunts
&gt;You hear wet slapping go past you as you turn back to your room
&gt;&quot;Did you guys seriously let them fuck in my room?&quot;
&quot;Warning! Increased levels of annoyance detected! Cease being annoyed immediately!&quot;
&gt;&quot;No.&quot;
&quot;Warning! Noncompliance detected! Alerting authorities!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m the mother fucking captain of this vessel, I think I&#039;m the highest authority here by default.&quot;
&quot;Accessing files. Confirmed! New captain entered into database!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Please stop yelling!&quot;
&quot;Turning volume down...Done.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Thank you. Now can we please stop this stupid game before it gets out of hand?&quot;
&gt;Vikna groans
&quot;But Anoooooon! I wanted to have some hardcore drunk seeex!&quot;
&gt;An explosion rocks the ship and you fall over
&quot;DANGER! Possible boarding has occur-&quot;
&gt;&quot;SHUT UP WARNING!&quot;
&gt;You get yourself off the floor
&gt;&quot;Ara! Get Vikna one of those instant soberness injection things. I&#039;m suiting up to prepare for a counter attack.&quot;
&gt;Ara nods and Vikna laughs hysterically
&gt;&quot;Warning! Get to the bridge and alert the crew who didn&#039;t hear the massive fucking explosion.&quot;
&quot;Aye sir!&quot;
&gt;You feel more explosions rock the ship as Warning scampers out, Ara and Vikna in tow
&gt;You reach your exo suit and use it to support yourself as the ship shakes again
&gt;Warning lights start flashing throughout the ship as you position yourself inside the exo
&gt;Your helmet flips onto your head before latching in place
&gt;The new HUD looked very Celtic
&gt;Nice
&gt;You tested the exo out and it felt smoother and much less delayed
&gt;You grab the sword and shield as well, making sure to mount the shield properly
&gt;Your broadsword makes a very nice metallic sound as you draw it
&gt;You looked like a paladin
&gt;Felt like one too
&gt;Another explosion rocked the ship as the runes flashed orange for a second
&gt;They faded after this and you ran towards the door

&gt;You looked out the bridge window and saw what was causing it
&gt;Fucking
&gt;Skaven
&gt;Pirates
&gt;They were pretty much giant retarded rats that spoke in word salad
&gt;Absolutely
&gt;Disgusting
&gt;You ran towards the door, your armor clanking together as the chain mail rattled
&gt;When the door to the stairs opened, you saw Ara struggling against 3 rats
&quot;Me wantings the robonotic puss snush!&quot;
&quot;Smashings her friend friend!&quot;
&quot;GET OFF ME YOU RATS!&quot;
&quot;Haha Ara&#039;s gonna get plowed by rats~&quot;
&gt;God dammit Vikna
&gt;The first thing that comes to your head is
&quot;FAUGH A BALLAGH! YEW PUTRID FECKIN ROHDINTS!&quot;
&gt;The look up to you and hiss
&quot;Me goings to kill kill white metal metal!&quot;
&gt;You leaped from the top of the stairs as one of them draws a short sword
&gt;When you landed, the ground shook and a metal clang rang throughout the stairway
&gt;You raised your sword and the rat tried to stab you
&gt;Dishonorable
&gt;You jump back and his thrust throws him off balance
&gt;You grab the blade with your gauntlet and pull it from his grasp
&gt;He falls forward and you slam your blade down on his neck
&gt;The runes glow brightly as his head comes off
&gt;You whip your head towards the other rat, who&#039;s still trying to fuck Ara
&gt;&quot;GIT OFF HER YE VEARMIN!&quot;
&gt;You grab his rags and throw him against the wall, a wet snap being heard
&gt;His neck and probably the rest of him was broken
&gt;Fucking disgusting
&gt;You help Ara up 
&gt;&quot;Ye good Ara?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, thanks Anon. What&#039;s with the accent though?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I dunnay Ara. Probibly de sword.&quot;
&gt;You hear the door behind you open and a loud clang emit from behind you
&gt;You&#039;re pushed forward a bit, but not enough to set you off balance
&gt;A clattering is heard and you turn around
&gt;A rat holding a broken blade stands before, looking dumbfounded
&quot;Hows did this this happenings?&quot;
&gt;You grab him by the neck bringing him closer with each word
&gt;&quot;Celtic. Fucking. Runes.&quot;
&gt;You crush his windpipe and toss him aside
&gt;Just in time to see a spear with a stick of dynamite attached to it fly towards you
&gt;&quot;FUCK!&quot;
&gt;You slam the shield to the ground, pressing the button on the handle
&gt;The energy shield expanded from the center and covered the entire doorway
&gt;A blast forces you back and the energy shield falls
&gt;&quot;GET TO THE BRIDGE! STAY IN MY ROOM FOR NOW!&quot;
&quot;You don&#039;t need to tell me twice!&quot;
&gt;You grip the sword with both hands and charge shouting celtic war cries
&gt;&quot;ERIN GO BRAGH!&quot;
&gt;You see the one who threw the last spear trying to light another one
&gt;You run him through with your sword, grabbing the spear and tossing it to the group of rats down the hall
&gt;It explodes, blowing the rats into pieces
&quot;GET BACK BACK FRIENDS! WE ARE NOT GOING TO WIN WIN!&quot;
&gt;You rip your sword out and flick the blood off the blade
&gt;You sheath the sword, drawing your Blade Runner gun
&gt;You pull the second trigger and hear a series of beeps
&gt;You fire and the gun flips upwards, a trail of sparks coming from the barrel straight to the target
&gt;The round explodes and finishes off the commanding rat
&gt;The explosions stop and the ship that was there a moment ago is gone
&gt;A cry is heard from up the stairway and you flick the cylinder open, replacing the spent casing with a fresh round
&gt;You flick it closed and holster it, drawing your sword once more
&gt;You charged up the stairs only to see a giant fucking buff rat man handling Ara
&gt;&quot;GOD FECKIN DAMMIT!&quot;
&gt;You charge at the chad rat, skewering him with the power of a million leprechauns
&gt;He instantly drops Ara and screeches in pain, looking behind him
&gt;He sees a white metal being stabbing a sword through his massive chest, screaming about rats
&gt;&quot;GIT THE FOOK OFF ME SHIP YE FECKIN BEASTS!&quot;
&gt;You twist the sword and pull it out, letting the rat creature fall
&gt;&quot;END ANUDER TING!&quot;
&gt;He blinks slowly at you
&gt;&quot;YER OOGLY!&quot;
&gt;A tear streaks down his furry cheek as he draws his last breath
&gt;Fucking rats
&gt;You wipe the blood off your sword on his fur and sheath it again
&gt;&quot;Ara, stop getting captured like that.&quot;
&quot;I-I can&#039;t help it! He jumped out of nowhere!&quot;
&gt;You hear scurrying coming from behind and immediately turned to see a massive horde of rats
&gt;Bloody shite
&gt;You drew your sword again and got into a protective stance in front of Ara
&gt;&quot;YE FECKIN VEHRMEN! GIT OFF ME SHIP BEFORE I SLICE YE TE BEHTS!&quot;
&gt;They let out a collective hiss and charged
&gt;You hear a battle cry come from the bottom of the stairs as an almost naked Ayn blasts up the stairs behind her stone key
&gt;She lands beside you and reels her key in
&gt;&quot;How&#039;re yew doin&#039; loovely?&quot;
&quot;Not bad Habibi. You?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Feckin woonderful.&quot;
&gt;You look back in time to see the rats attempt to surround you
&gt;&quot;GIT BACK YE FOUL CREATURES!&quot;
&gt;You let a bolt of lightning erupt from your sword, hitting a rat square in the chest
&gt;His skin charred and fur burnt
&gt;He falls to the ground, twitching and more rats charge
&gt;&quot;IRELAND FOREVER!&quot;
&gt;You charge as well as Ayn, swinging your sword as hard as you could
&gt;The force of the blade cutting through the rats and the floor as well
&gt;May have overdone it
&gt;You swing upwards again, throwing sparks and slicing into more rats
&gt;They just keep coming
&gt;Your blade&#039;s runes are glowing as bright as stars now
&gt;&quot;THIS IS FER COOMING TO ME SHEP!&quot;
&gt;You slice the heads off of 3 more rats
&gt;&quot;THES IS FER TROYIN&#039; TE TAKE ME AI FER A ROIDE!&quot;
&gt;You slice a rat in down the center, splitting it in two
&gt;&quot;AND THES!&quot;
&gt;You rear back your sword charging a massive lightning strike
&gt;&quot;IS FER INTERRUPTIN&#039; ME NEW YEAR!&quot;
&gt;You slam the sword down into the floor, letting a massive electrical grid spread from the tip towards the rats
&gt;You kept the electricity going for a solid 10 seconds before letting it stop
&gt;You were thoroughly drained from your Celtic combat
&gt;Even with your enhanced strength and exo
&gt;It was fucking exhausting
&gt;You ripped the sword from the floor and smiled
&gt;Not even a scratch
&gt;Fucking Celtic runes sonny jim
&gt;You sheath the sword and immediately collapse
&gt;You sit hyperventilating
&gt;The whole escapade having drained you
&gt;The smell of cooked rat flesh and burning hair assaulting your nostrils
&gt;You lay there for a bit before finally speaking
&gt;&quot;Holy fucking shitdicks, that was intense.&quot;
&gt;Ayn licks her chops
&quot;I&#039;ll say~. You went into full Irish rage mode there. That&#039;s pretty hot~&quot;
&gt;&quot;Down girl.&quot;
&gt;She chuckles and helps you up
&quot;Damn, I always forget how big of a guy you are.&quot;
&gt;&quot;For you.&quot;
&gt;She chuckles
&quot;Funny.&quot;
&gt;You scratch her ears and she starts to pant
&quot;S-stop it Anon!&quot;
&gt;You stop and she lets out a huff, walking away and swaying her hips as she went
&gt;God damn succubus is what she is
&gt;You missed the fucking new year because of this stupid shit
&gt;Oh well
&gt;It&#039;s 2041 now you guess
&gt;Time to go to bed and sleep the fatigue away

&gt;You wake up to Ara cuddling against you
&gt;And she smells
&gt;Like absolute fucking ass
&gt;&quot;Ara, please. You smell like rat piss and cum.&quot;
&quot;Oops! Sorry!&quot;
&gt;You let her go and she backs up to the other side of the bed
&gt;&quot;Do you know how to shower?&quot;
&gt;She nods her head
&quot;O-of course I do! I know how to shower!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Then go do it. Please.&quot;
&gt;She smiles awkwardly
&quot;I will!&quot;
&gt;She starts to lick herself
&gt;&quot;NO! Not like that! I&#039;m talking about an actual shower!&quot;
&gt;She cocks her head at you mid lick
&quot;But this is how I cleanse myself. My saliva is anti bacterial.&quot;
&gt;You sigh deeply
&gt;&quot;I guess I&#039;m going to have to do this the old fashioned way.&quot;
&gt;You get out of bed and walk to your chest, digging around in it until you find what you&#039;re looking for
&gt;Your old respirator
&gt;It wasn&#039;t a full on gas mask, but it would block smells with it&#039;s carbon layer
&gt;Ara brushes herself up against you
&quot;What are we going to do &#039;the old fashioned way&#039; as you put it?&quot;
&gt;You pick her up, eliciting a surprised squeak from her
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m giving you a bath stinky.&quot;
&gt;She cocks her head
&quot;A, bath? What&#039;re those?&quot;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;ll see.&quot;

&gt;You enter your bathroom and turn the water on, plugging the drain
&gt;You wait for the water to fill up as you sat and pet your dirty kitty
&gt;She continued to lick herself, grimacing at every lick
&gt;She must taste the rat spunk and piss on her
&gt;The water is high enough and you pick her up again
&gt;&quot;Alright, prepare yourself.&quot;
&gt;She is already naked and you dunk her in the water
&gt;She flails around frantically
&quot;WET WET WET! LET ME OUT ANON!&quot;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re not clean yet! Stop struggling!&quot;
&quot;NO I&#039;M WET AND I DON&#039;T LIKE THIS!&quot;
&gt;You struggle to hold her down
&gt;You rip off your respirator and pull her into a kiss
&gt;She immediately stops struggling and returns it kindly
&gt;You sit there for a what seems like forever, your lips locked with hers as she soaks
&gt;You break away to breath and she opens her eyes slowly
&quot;I guess being wet isn&#039;t all that bad.&quot;
&gt;She smiles, splashing water on her face
&gt;You grab some shampoo from the cabinet by the steps and open it
&gt;&quot;Okay, stand up.&quot;
&gt;She does so
&gt;You unplug the drain and rub shampoo all over her
&gt;She wiggles a bit under your touch as you scratch the shampoo further into her fur
&quot;Mmm, this is nice Anon.&quot;
&gt;Once she looks like a ball of suds, you get up
&gt;&quot;You know what rain feels like, correct?&quot;
&gt;She nods
&quot;I don&#039;t like it at all.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well that sucks for you.&quot;
&gt;You turn on the shower and it pours warm water onto her fur
&gt;She pulls you into the shower and into a kiss
&gt;Fuck your underwear are gonna get wet
&gt;You wrap your arms around her form and brush away the suds
&gt;You pull away, gasping for air
&gt;She giggles at this
&quot;I guess showers aren&#039;t as bad as rain. They actually feel warm.&quot;
&gt;You get off her and take off your underwear, letting yourself get soaked
&gt;Ara smirks and gets down on her knees
&gt;&quot;Uh, Ara, what&#039;re you doing?&quot;
&gt;She grabs some soap and starts to rub it along your dick
&gt;THE BURNING
&gt;&quot;AH FUCK!&quot;
&gt;You grab the soap from her and use it on yourself
&gt;&quot;Ara, don&#039;t use soap on my private area! It burns a lot.&quot;
&gt;She pouts and gets back up
&quot;You&#039;re no fun!&quot;
&gt;&quot;You don&#039;t even know the half of it.&quot;
&gt;She steps out of the shower before the cycle completes
&gt;She looks mildly annoyed as she steps out
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re done already?&quot;
&quot;Yes, I&#039;m done.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Wasn&#039;t it relaxing?&quot;
&quot;Maybe for organics, but not me. I assume there&#039;s a way to dry off?&quot;
&gt;You smile
&gt;There was if she completed the cycle, but it looks like she&#039;s going to need to use the other dryer
&gt;&quot;Right over there is a blow dryer thing that I assume is for anthros. Just press the dry button and it&#039;ll dry you off.&quot;
&gt;She walks over to the dryer, swaying her hips as she went
&gt;Her hair hung from her head like a wet mop
&gt;The sexiest wet mop ever
&gt;She entered the area and pressed the button, the fans spooling up
&gt;Once they spooled fully and heated up, the vents opened
&gt;Her hair flapped in the wind as well as her tail
&gt;She looked frightened by it and you ran over to comfort her
&quot;ANON! I DON&#039;T LIKE THIS!&quot;
&gt;You hold her in your arms and she grasped you tightly
&quot;THIS IS SO LOUD!&quot;
&gt;You chuckle
&gt;&quot;THE SHOWER HAS IT&#039;S OWN DRYER INSIDE IT! YOU JUST GOT OUT BEFORE IT COULD ACTIVATE!&quot;
&quot;WHY DIDN&#039;T YOU TELL ME!&quot;
&gt;&quot;BECAUSE YOU DIDN&#039;T WAIT!&quot;
&gt;She pouts and continues to hold you tight
&gt;Once the drying cycle finishes, you let her go
&gt;Both you and her were completely dry
&gt;When she is about to exit the chamber, her coat puffs up like something out of a cartoon
&gt;Holy shit
&gt;You burst into laughter
&quot;W-what&#039;s your deal!?&quot;
&gt;She looks down and sees she is all fluffed up
&quot;O-oh.&quot;
&gt;You calm down and grab a brush
&gt;&quot;Come, I&#039;ll fix it Ara.&quot;
&gt;She smiles and stretches her arms out
&quot;Carry me!&quot;
&gt;You smile and pick her up with your free arm

&gt;You carry her to your bed and sit her down on the edge
&gt;You didn&#039;t really know how to brush animal hair, but fuck it
&gt;Can&#039;t be any worse than combing hair
&gt;You were fucking dead wrong

&gt;After about an hour of brushing, her hair was all flattened into place
&gt;You set the brush down and let out a sigh of relief
&gt;Ara had elected to lay herself on your lap as you finished her back
&gt;She was purring rather loudly as she closed her eyes
&gt;You pet her now silky smooth fur
&gt;E X T R A  S O F T
&gt;You laid her down on the bed as her purring intensified
&gt;Fuck doing anything today, you were snuggling with Ara
&gt;You pulled her against you as she continued to vibrate like the good kitty she was
&gt;You felt like you were in heaven now
&gt;Everything in the world was perfect in this very moment
&quot;Anon, aren&#039;t we going to prepare for the fight?&quot;
&gt;&quot;No, we&#039;re cuddling. That&#039;s an order.&quot;
&quot;Yes captain!&quot;
&gt;She wrapped her tail around you and stroked you with it as you pulled the covers over the two of you
&gt;Fuck responsibility today, you&#039;re relaxing
&gt;God knows you earned it
&gt;But Ara wanted to talk
&quot;Anon, I&#039;ve been meaning to ask. Why are you so intent on petting and stroking me?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well, it&#039;s simple really. Soft things make me calm and happy. I don&#039;t know the exact reason for it, but it pleases me to pet something soft.&quot;
&gt;Ara smiles back at you
&quot;You think I&#039;m soft?&quot;
&gt;&quot;W-well, um, not like that, you know what I mean Ara.&quot;
&gt;She giggles at your frustration
&quot;Anon, I&#039;m only joking. It&#039;s sweet that you think of me as soft enough to draw pleasure from it.&quot;
&gt;You sigh in relief
&gt;&quot;I thought you were actually upset with me for a second. Sorry if you-&quot;
&quot;Don&#039;t. Don&#039;t start that again. Just pet me. It gives me some for of pleasure as well to be stuck so close to another body. Especially of one I love.&quot;
&gt;You shudder slightly at the word love
&gt;It&#039;s still so foreign for it to be directed at you
&quot;Is something wrong Anon. Did I say something that startled you?&quot;
&gt;&quot;No, you&#039;re fine Ara. Love you too.&quot;
&gt;She kisses you on the lips lightly and continues to purr away
&gt;Truly this is heaven

&gt;The next day
&gt;You are on the bridge organizing different things for your operation
&gt;You were going to be above a snow planet
&gt;So Ara insisted on bringing survival gear
&gt;As well as herself
&gt;You had your celtic exo all prepped for use as well as your sword, shield, and service rifle
&gt;Since you had your dream, you&#039;ve opted to carry it around more
&gt;You forgot it even existed at the bottom of your trunk, much like your whiskey
&gt;Your helmet closed around you as you prepared to board the shuttle
&gt;Your idea was to go and capture scientists from the ship and get the hell outta dodge
&gt;Ayn was informed of this and Nytro was to be her first officer this time
&gt;You boarded the shuttle as well as Ara and Vikna
&gt;They were both dressed in combat dressing, as you didn&#039;t want either of them to be hurt by stray lasers
&gt;When the shuttle was prepared to launch, you gave the jump order

&gt;When your ship reached the combat zone, it was going according to plan
&gt;The large spearhead fleet had taken minimal casualties and had pushed them back into a perfect position to attack from behind
&gt;Your shuttle ejected itself from the docking bay and engaged it&#039;s afterburners
&gt;Heavy flak came towards the shuttle and everything was going to plan
&gt;Until a piece of flak hit the fuel lines, severing it
&gt;The ship went dark and began to fall to the planet
&gt;Oh fuck
&gt;You grabbed onto the grab rails as the shuttles gravity generator had failed
&gt;You checked the cockpit and saw the pilot was fucking dead
&gt;A shrapnel piece impaled him in the face and the co-pilot as well
&gt;&quot;ARA! WE GOT A PROBLEM!&quot;
&gt;She floats herself up to the cockpit
&quot;What&#039;s the issu-OH MY GOD!&quot;
&gt;&quot;PLUG YOURSELF IN AND GIVE ME A HAND! I DON&#039;T KNOW HOW TO FLY A SPACESHIP BUT I DAMN WELL KNOW HOW TO FLY A GLIDER!&quot;
&gt;You rip the dead men from their seats and strap yourself in
&gt;&quot;CAN WE SAVE IT ARA?&quot;
&gt;Lights start to power on and alarms blare
&quot;No! We&#039;re going in too fast!&quot;
&gt;Fuck
&gt;&quot;ARE WE ABLE TO STAY OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE?&quot;
&quot;No! We&#039;re too fast for that too!&quot;
&gt;Double fuck
&gt;&quot;CAN WE MAKE IT THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE?!&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s a chance so slim that I don&#039;t think we&#039;d make it!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Is that all we got?!&quot;
&quot;I&#039;m afraid so!&quot;
&gt;Triple fuck
&gt;&quot;FOCUS ALL ENERGY TO BOTTOM SHIELDS! I&#039;M NOT TURNING INTO A FUCKING CRISP ON THE WAY DOWN!&quot;
&gt;All power in the ship goes out and you assume to the bottom shields
&gt;A few warning lights still flash about the cut fuel lines and low power
&gt;&quot;GIVE ME A TIME TO IMPACT!&quot;
&quot;Time to impact is estimated at 45 seconds from now!&quot;
&gt;Shit biscuits
&gt;You get out of your seat, the exo struggling against the G-force of re-entry
&gt;You force the door open to the front and see Vikna had vomited on the floor
&quot;ARE WE GONNA MAKE IT!?&quot;
&gt;You put your hand on her shoulder
&gt;&quot;WE&#039;LL MAKE IT!&quot;
&gt;You trudge back to the cabin and see ground coming fast
&gt;It&#039;s a fucking ice planet
&gt;There&#039;s spires of rock jutting out haphazardly around you
&gt;You take the stick
&gt;&quot;TURN THE SHIELDS OFF AND GIVE ME FULL POWER TO CONTROL SURFACES!&quot;
&quot;On it!&quot;
&gt;The stick vibrates a bit before you see a rock coming straight for you
&gt;You veer right, dodging the rock by inches

&gt;You&#039;ve dodged so many rocks on the way down that you begin to wonder if you are landing in a mountain range
&gt;You finally see some flat ground in the distance and steer towards it
&gt;&quot;THIS IS GONNA SUUUUUCK!&quot;
&gt;You steer the shuttle to the flat area and brace
&gt;&quot;BRACE FOR IMPACT!&quot;
&gt;Everything goes dark

&gt;You wake, having a terrible headache that you assume is a concussion
&gt;Fucking dammit
&gt;You see sparks coming from the display in front of you as wires cross and uncross violently
&gt;You are on the floor
&gt;You get off the floor and see Ara is rebooting
&gt;You unplug her tail from the ship and force the cockpit doors open
&gt;Vikna is on the other side with a crowbar, trying to force it open from her side
&gt;She&#039;s crying
&quot;ANON!&quot;
&gt;She throws the crowbar aside and pulls you into a hug
&quot;I thought you died!&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s okay Vikna. We&#039;re not dead. At least, not yet.&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s already in her winter gear and has your parka in her arms
&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t need it until night time. We should try and use this shuttle as shelter until rescue arrives.&quot;
&gt;She nods and sets it aside
&gt;You hear stirring from the cockpit and a loud metallic clang
&gt;You assume Ara is rebooted now
&gt;You look behind you and see Ara is stark naked and shivering
&quot;C-c-c-c-cold!&quot;
&gt;You retrieve your winter parka and throw it over her
&gt;It&#039;s much too big for her, but it&#039;ll have to do
&gt;She stops shivering as bad and you lay her down on the floor
&gt;&quot;Get a fire going with some of the spare wood Warning packed. I&#039;m going out to look for more and see what we&#039;re up against.&quot;
&gt;You go to the side airlock and jump down
&gt;The snow swallows you up and you have to dig yourself out
&gt;You get on the radio
&gt;&quot;New plan. We need snow shoes or skis. Whichever we have will help greatly.&quot;
&quot;We have skis and snow shoes. Warning thought of everything.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Good, I&#039;ll be back in the ship in a second, I just need to crawl over to the airlock
&gt;You make it to the airlock and open it up, throwing yourself inside
&gt;You manually operate the door and see that Vikna had already started a fire
&gt;She was also holding your pair of skis and poles
&gt;You nod and accept them graciously
&quot;Wait!&quot;
&gt;You stop walking to the airlock
&quot;Take this, you&#039;ll need it to chop wood.&quot;
&gt;She gives you a laser axe and spare batteries for it
&gt;You take it and remember something else
&gt;Your rifle
&gt;You grab your rifle and chamber a round, slinging it over your shoulder
&gt;Vikna is watching over Ara as you close the airlock door again
&gt;You put your skis on and strap them into place before hopping into the snow again
&gt;This time you didn&#039;t sink
&gt;You stuck the poles into the ground and started off towards a forest of trees

&gt;When you reach the forest, you see something you really hoped you wouldn&#039;t
&gt;A Kaltag escape pod
&gt;You had the crew scrape off the Kaltag insignia off of everything they could and replace it with Radoslav&#039;s emblem
&gt;You also saw personnel
&gt;They were in white and orange parkas, chopping down trees to make firewood
&gt;You flick the safety off and ski towards them
&gt;You undo your helmet and shout
&gt;&quot;SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!&quot;
&gt;They all turned towards you
&gt;Their hands all shot up collectively
&quot;D-don&#039;t shoot! We&#039;re scientists!&quot;
&gt;You lower your weapon
&gt;&quot;Where&#039;s the rest of you?&quot;
&quot;S-scattered! We all got tossed around when our ship was destroyed. Please don&#039;t hurt us!&quot;
&gt;You sling your rifle and ski over to them
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not gonna hurt you. We have a camp about a mile away from here. I was sent from the Radoslav empire to eliminate your employers and give you a higher paying job. From what I hear your working conditions are horrible to say the least.&quot;
&gt;They all nod in agreement
&quot;14 hours of work every day non stop. We haven&#039;t seen our families in years!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Then you should come with us, we have a ship that can be repaired and flown out of this frozen shit hole. You&#039;ll be able to see your families again as well as work only 8 hour days. The projects you work on will be less intensive and more helpful to the galaxy than making robot swarms and slaves.&quot;
&gt;They all look to each other and to the apparent leader
&gt;The leader walks over to you and holds out a hand
&gt;He was an elephant anthro who was about 6 feet tall
&gt;Guess the gene lottery gave him the middle finger
&gt;You take it and shake it
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m Anon, captain of the Perseus and a scientist like you, although much less well versed in advanced robotics. I mostly tinker with portals and the like.&quot;
&quot;Names Titus, Pleasure to meet you Anon. We are anthroid technicians and developers alike. We thank you for freeing us from our captors.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Now, do you have the locations of any other scientists? We were hoping to free them as well until we were shot down by one of your vessels.&quot;
&quot;We do, but it is heavily guarded by elite Kaltag troops and combat anthroids. It would be suicide to go and retrieve them!&quot;
&gt;You smirk
&gt;&quot;You underestimate me friend. Surely you&#039;ve heard of the Hashab raid?&quot;
&gt;He nods
&gt;&quot;That was us. More specifically, myself, General Vikna, and a certain police officer going by the name of Nytro.&quot;
&gt;His eyes widen
&quot;I-I had no idea! I will give you the co-ordinates to the life pod site. Save as many as you can Colonel!&quot;
&gt;You nod and flip your helmet on
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll do my best.&quot;
&gt;Ara comes up on your screen
&quot;ANON! WHERE ARE YOU!?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ara! Stop shouting in my ear!&quot;
&gt;Titus speaks again
&quot;Who&#039;s Ar- wait, you have an ARA unit with you? On this planet!?&quot;
&gt;You nod
&gt;&quot;Yes, is that bad?&quot;
&quot;Very! ARA units are not designed to operate in cold climates! Their servos and musculature could freeze and make them non functional! You must make haste in getting the ship repaired!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I understand. Do any of you know how to repair a fuel system on a shuttle?&quot;
&gt;A snow leopard female raises her paw
&quot;I-I do. I can repair it if you want.&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s wearing a long sleeve sweater, some gloves, and some boots, but otherwise is completely exposed to the elements
&gt;&quot;Good, go with Titus to the ship and repair the fuel lines. I will return with haste.&quot;
&gt;You slam the spiked poles into the ground and ski away towards the site
&gt;It&#039;s guarded by about 7 guards and 2 heavy duty combat androids
&gt;But you were an Irishman on skis
&gt;This planet&#039;s White Death
&gt;You shouted a shitty Finnish war cry
&gt;&quot;PERKELEPERKELEPERKELEPERKELE!&quot;
&gt;You sped towards the site at great speed

&gt;You made it to the site and see they have made the grave mistake of landing in a half pipe esque area
&gt;The scientists are being held at gun point by the guards and the anthroids are scanning for hostile threats
&gt;You smirk at the idea of an Irishman screaming Celtic at the top of his lungs while shooting robots and dog men
&gt;Time to make it a reality
&gt;You unsling your rifle and flick it to full auto before skiing over the edge of the half pipe, slamming the poles into the ground as you went
&gt;&quot;FAUGH A BALLAGH!&quot;
&gt;You sprayed a burst into the anthroids first, as they were a priority target
&gt;They fell as the rounds impacted their head and neck, severing the connection to their bodies
&gt;The guards jump up to this and start firing lasers as you reach the top of the half pipe
&gt;You turn yourself around and fly back down the hill, pumping the poles as you went
&gt;You let out another burst, sending two more guards to the ground
&gt;A laser hits your armor, but it does nothing because it&#039;s a fucking laser
&gt;Laser beams have no mass
&gt;The remaining guards start shouting profanities as you reach the top of the half pipe again
&gt;This time you draw your sword, Celtic fury radiating from it&#039;s grip to your hand
&gt;&quot;IS THAT ALL YE GUT YE FECKIN BEASTS!?&quot;
&gt;You go down the half pipe one more time, steering towards the remaining guardsmen with your sword outstretched
&gt;His tail goes between his legs as he screams in terror
&gt;He stops screaming when your blade connects with his head, as well as three others
&gt;The last remaining soldier had the bright idea to duck
&gt;You turned around and skied towards him, him shooting his plasma rifle at you the whole way
&gt;&quot;ERIN GO BRAGH!&quot;
&gt;You skewer him and the sword slams into the side of their life pod
&gt;You hilt the sword into his chest and pull the sword back
&gt;The plasma burns covering your plating were fairly deep, but nothing a repair station can&#039;t fix
&gt;You do a fancy sword twirl, shaking the blood from your blade as you did before sheathing your blade again
&gt;It made a satisfying *shink* as it hilts the scabbard
&gt;You look on at the terrified scientists
&gt;Your helmet unlatches and flips behind you
&gt;&quot;Come with me if you want to live.&quot;
&gt;They all race inside the life pod to grab what you assume are skis of their own

&gt;You ended up just towing them with some rope to make the journey faster, as they stopped every 15 minutes to catch their breath
&gt;Your exo was straining, but it&#039;ll hold
&gt;You reach the ship and see the snow leopard hop down from the top, getting stuck in the snow like you first did
&gt;She sees you coming and waves you down
&gt;&quot;All halt!&quot;
&gt;You put up your hand and feel a tug on your line
&gt;You stop and cut the line
&quot;Was this all that was left?&quot;
&gt;You nod
&gt;&quot;Rest appeared to have been killed off or died on reentry. I&#039;m sorry.&quot;
&gt;She lowers her head into the snow, understandingly
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s help get you out of there.&quot;
&gt;You hold out an arm and she takes it
&gt;&quot;Is the fuel line fixed?&quot;
&gt;She nods
&quot;It was a simple fix really. Just needed a bit of rubber piping and it was good to go. Nothing too bad.&quot;
&gt;You smile and she hops on your back
&quot;C-can you carry me inside?&quot;
&gt;You nod
&gt;&quot;Sure.&quot;
&gt;You ski over to the airlock and open it up, having the snow leopard lady hop in first
&gt;You notice she has no pants on
&gt;Or underwear
&gt;And her slit was soaking wet
&gt;What the fuck dude, can&#039;t you get a break?
&gt;You clamber inside the airlock and take off your skis before entering
&gt;Ara was drinking some hot cocoa and wrapped in a blanket
&gt;&quot;Ara!&quot;
&gt;You rush over to her and hug her gently
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m so sorry! I didn&#039;t know you weren&#039;t able to function in the cold! I should&#039;ve known better! I&#039;m such an idiot and-&quot;
&gt;She gives you a look that says &#039;shut up&#039;
&quot;Anon, I should&#039;ve told you. But I didn&#039;t think we&#039;d crash, much less land on a snowy world. I should be the one apologizing.&quot;
&gt;You just rub her back with the blanket before getting up, exiting your exo
&gt;You help the other scientists in and get them seated before going up front to see the snow leopard preparing for takeoff
&gt;&quot;Everyone&#039;s secure ma&#039;am. Do you mind me asking your name?&quot;
&gt;She almost jumps out of her seat
&quot;O-oh, sorry. I&#039;m a little jumpy. M-my name&#039;s Jessica. My friends call me Jess, so I guess you can call me that too.&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s so shy it&#039;s cute
&gt;&quot;Like I said, everybody&#039;s seated and ready to take off. We can do a full scan of you once we reach the Perseus. Make sure you&#039;re not sick from being exposed like this.&quot;
&gt;You point to her lack of pants, hat, and socks
&gt;Her face goes crimson red
&quot;H-hey! You p-pervert! That&#039;s gross!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Me!? I-I&#039;m not a pervert! Y-you are! You didn&#039;t even bother to cover yourself when you entered the ship!&quot;
&quot;I didn&#039;t think I had to!&quot;
&gt;&quot;AAAAAGH! Why is everything so difficult!?&quot;
&quot;I DON&#039;T KNOW!&quot;
&gt;&quot;ME NEITHER! AAAAAAAH!&quot;
&quot;AAAAAAAH!&quot;
&gt;You leave with haste, fearing her lashing out at you
&gt;You close the door and secure your exo, strapping yourself in afterwards
&gt;The shuttle lurched and you held on tight to Ara, who was moving noticeably slower than usual
&gt;She was cold as hell as well
&gt;You wrapped the blanket around you both as the shuttle warped off planet to the rendezvous coordinates

&gt;Ara
&gt;Systems are at critical temperature
&gt;Risk of expiration imminent
&gt;Anon walks up to your seat and holds you
&gt;He&#039;s warm
&gt;So warm
&gt;System temperatures normalizing
&gt;He throws the blanket over both of you and falls asleep when the shuttle goes into FTL
&gt;Temperatures normalized, functionality restored
&gt;Engaging organic thought processes
&gt;You feel Anon&#039;s sleeping form
&gt;His heart rate is steady and breathing slow
&gt;He&#039;s sleeping deeply
&gt;You rub your face against his, purring as you do
&gt;He said he likes it
&gt;He jolts, startling you
&quot;D-don&#039;t take her!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Take who?&quot;
&gt;He rests his head on your shoulders again
&gt;He&#039;s sleep talking
&quot;I told you no!&quot;
&gt;You caress his face with the back of your hand
&gt;He says he likes soft things
&gt;Maybe it will calm him
&quot;P-please don&#039;t take Ara. Please.&quot;
&gt;You hold him tightly
&gt;He&#039;s having another nightmare
&gt;You need to wake him
&gt;His heart rate is erratic and his breathing panicked
&gt;You shake him gently
&quot;ARA!&quot;
&gt;He jolts awake
&gt;He looks around the shuttle, scanning for what you assume was the threat from the dream
&gt;He spots you and pulls you into a hug
&gt;A gentle hug
&gt;He&#039;s sobbing as well
&gt;You hug him back and rub yourself against his neck, purring

&gt;Anon
&gt;You fall asleep as soon as the blanket is draped over you
&gt;When you awake, you&#039;re back on the ship
&gt;Zeta is in front of you with a gun
&gt;She has it pointed at your gut
&gt;Two more anthros take Ara&#039;s limp form from her console
&gt;&quot;D-don&#039;t take her!&quot;
&quot;I told you Anon, and you said no. We don&#039;t take no as an answer.&quot;
&gt;&quot;DON&#039;T TOUCH HER YOU DISGUSTING SUITS!&quot;
&gt;Zeta keeps you back with relative ease
&gt;&quot;I told you no!&quot;
&gt;You attempt to push past Zeta but she shoots you
&gt;The pain is immeasurable
&gt;&quot;GAAAH!&quot;
&gt;You clutch your gut in pain
&gt;Ara is screaming for you
&quot;ANON! HELP!&quot;
&gt;You try to shock Zeta but it doesn&#039;t work
&gt;Your runes are leaving your wrist one by one
&gt;No
&gt;Please god
&gt;Not now!
&gt;Zeta caresses you with the back of her paw
&gt;You sob
&gt;&quot;P-please don&#039;t take Ara. Please.&quot;
&gt;She picks you up and tosses you against a wall
&gt;You were close to passing out
&quot;ANON! PLEASE DON&#039;T LET THEM TAKE ME!&quot;
&gt;You get yourself off the ground and feel the ship being shaken

&gt;&quot;ARA!&quot;
&gt;You wake with a start, looking for that wretched bitch
&gt;Instead, you find you&#039;re still in the shuttle
&gt;You see Ara and are immediately relieved
&gt;You pull her into a gentle embrace which she returns in kind
&gt;You sob into her shoulder as she rubs against your neck
&gt;&quot;I-I thought I lost you. Zeta, she took you and-&quot;
&quot;Shhh, Anon. I&#039;m safe. You&#039;re safe now. Nothing bad is happening. You can relax.&quot;
&gt;You melt into her and just hold her
&gt;When the shuttle shudders, you grip Ara tighter, not wanting to let her go
&gt;Something tapped your shoulder and you flinched
&quot;Anon, we&#039;re here. If you need a moment, I understand.&quot;
&gt;It was Vikna
&gt;You get up and help Ara do the same
&gt;&quot;N-no I&#039;m good. I&#039;m good now.&quot;
&gt;You enter your exo and exit the shuttle with your gear

&gt;It turns out the Kaltag force got absolutely demolished
&gt;You had rescued a total of 158 scientists from the vessels and from the ice world
&gt;But being on that ice world made you think
&gt;What if you missed a swing
&gt;Missed a shot
&gt;What if you fucked up?
&gt;You didn&#039;t want that to happen
&gt;That helmet Ara gave you was going to be used today
&gt;Ara said that muscle memory implantation was the most painful to wake up to, but it was the price of the device
&gt;You were able to put 3 data chips inside the helmet at once
&gt;These data chips were sort of like an SD card, but held a lot more than a terrabyte
&gt;Your first one is a basic CQC refresher course
&gt;The second advanced marksmanship
&gt;The third was swordsmanship
&gt;You placed the helmet on your head and it beeped 3 times
&gt;You look in the manual and say 3 beeps means you know most of the data chip anyways
&gt;You decide to continue with it and the helmet whirs
&gt;First, you felt nothing
&gt;Then it came down on you like a ton of bricks
&gt;The pain was worse than all the hangovers you&#039;ve ever had combined into one giant fucking headache
&gt;And you&#039;ve had a lot of hangovers
&gt;You scream in agony as the helmet buzzes away
&gt;It feels like somebody is stabbing the back of your head with a rusty spoon
&gt;Ara walks in and gasps
&quot;ANON! DON&#039;T USE 3 AT A TIME LIKE THAT!&quot;
&gt;The helmet stops buzzing and lets out a pleasant ding
&gt;Like a toaster oven timer
&gt;Everything was a blur
&gt;The pain was still there, although noticeably more dull
&gt;&quot;Aaaalllll along the watch towerrrr!&quot;
&gt;You flop back into the chair in your room and pass out

&gt;You wake up with Ara staring at you angrily
&gt;Your head feels like it got smashed under an elephant&#039;s foot
&gt;Twice
&gt;You hold your head to try and sooth the pounding headache you were experiencing
&gt;You had a feeling that no amount of aspirin, ibuprofen, and tylenol would fix this massive headache
&gt;Fuck it
&gt;You look down to your kitty
&quot;Anon.&quot;
&gt;Oh shit is she mad?
&gt;&quot;Did I do something?&quot;
&quot;YES! You used the helmet without supervision! You should NEVER EVER EVER use 3 chips on your first go! It&#039;s far too much strain on your hippocampus! You could&#039;ve died!&quot;
&gt;Jesus Christ how many useful things fucking kill you in this galaxy?
&gt;She stabs a syringe into your neck and you wince
&gt;&quot;Ah! Ara what did you do?&quot;
&gt;She scowls at you
&quot;It&#039;s a mixture of diluted morphine, aspirin, and ibuprofen. It eases the pain a bit.&quot;
&gt;You feel it working and the pain has dulled to a minor discomfort
&gt;You smile at her
&gt;She doesn&#039;t return it
&gt;Your face goes cold
&gt;&quot;Ara, I don&#039;t like this. Tell me what&#039;s going o-&quot;
&gt;She raises her hand and tries to slap you
&gt;You deflect it and take her arm, spinning her around
&gt;Oh fuck what&#039;re you doing?!
&gt;You let her go and she spins back around
&quot;ANON!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sorry! I didn&#039;t do it on my own!&quot;
&gt;She takes the helmet off your head and takes out the data chips
&quot;Marksmanship, CQC basics, and, swordsmanship?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah.&quot;
&quot;Why?&quot;
&gt;&quot;When I was down on that ice planet, I could&#039;ve died down there. I&#039;m very rusty with my swordsmanship and my CQC, only remembering a few disarmament techniques. I don&#039;t want to leave you without a captain, or leave you alone.&quot;
&gt;Her expression softens
&quot;Anon, you don&#039;t have to worry about us like that!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes I do! I love you 3 too much to die because I was ill prepared. I am not having another repeat of Kaltag HQ.&quot;
&gt;She smirks at you
&quot;Was the little kitty ninja too much for you big guy?&quot;
&gt;&quot;She was fast Ara. Like, really fucking fast. Now I need to go practice some of these new techniques in the VR room. Want to join in?&quot;
&gt;She takes the data chips and takes the cap off her tail
&gt;She plugs the chips into the 3 slots in her tail and replaces the fuzzy cap
&quot;Yeah, sure.&quot;
&gt;You smile and she hooks her arms with you

&gt;The VR scene opens up in a cage
&gt;A bot, an anthro lion, appears
&gt;He goes into a fighting stance and you ready yourself
&gt;He throws a stinger with his left hand, which you push down
&gt;He comes in with a right hook
&gt;You grab his elbow and palm him in the groin
&gt;He bellows in pain and you wrap your arm around his neck, covering his nose and mouth with your hand
&gt;You rip the bot down and strike him in the neck on the way, sending him sputtering and choking
&gt;Once on the ground, you stomp the side of his head in, caving it in like a box
&gt;Ara watches on, impressed with your mastery of the skills already
&gt;&quot;I know that look, I knew most of the CQC stuff before I used the data chips. Just got rusty is all.&quot;
&gt;Another bot comes after you and tries to hit you
&gt;You deflect it sideways and palm his temple
&gt;You grab the arm you deflected and use it to twirl him around in one fluid motion
&gt;You then get between Ara and the threat, drawing a VR gun and firing twice
&quot;Drill complete. Move to next drill area.&quot;
&gt;You smile at the fluidity of your movements
&gt;You felt like jason bourne
&gt;A bot comes out of a dark alleyway with a knife and stands in front of you
&gt;He&#039;s a big guy
&gt;He attempts to stab you and you swipe your head to the side as if by instinct
&gt;You grab the outstretched arm and use your leg as a center point for a takedown
&gt;You take the knife off the ground and stab him in the neck, not wanting to restrain in this session
&gt;This time you keep the knife and put it on your belt
&gt;Another attacker comes from the alleyway, attempting to stab you
&gt;You raise your left hand to block the blade and get to his left side
&gt;Push, slice, push, slice
&gt;The lion drops his knife and falls to the ground, bleeding from his jugular
&quot;Drill complete. Move to next drill area.&quot;
&gt;It&#039;s a filthy garage and an anthro lion is pointing a gun at you
&gt;Too bad he let you get close
&gt;You take control of the weapon by grabbing the front of it, twisting away and using your free arm as a fulcrum
&gt;You dislodge the weapon and put two shots into the lion, making him double over in pain
&gt;It&#039;s like a fucking action movie
&gt;But real
&gt;You throw the gun off to the side and smile, content with your ability
&gt;You pity the next man who tries to tangle with you
&gt;The VR room changes over to a virtual range
&gt;A table of firearms is in front of you, most of which you recognize from your years of service
&gt;You pick up the springfield first, opening the bolt and loading a stripper clip in
&gt;You slam the bolt home, ejecting the clip and loading a round
&gt;You use the sling as a stabilizing platform before taking aim
&gt;You adjusted for wind, elevation, height difference, and range
&gt;When the adjustments satisfied you, you take aim at the target and fire
&gt;It hits just outside the bullseye
&gt;At almost 600 yards
&gt;With only iron sights
&gt;You smile again, content with your marksmanship on this front

&gt;You come back to the bridge and see something you wish you&#039;d never see
&gt;Another
&gt;Fucking
&gt;Zeta
&gt;Ara is visibly upset by this and lets out a mechanical hiss
&gt;The fox thing gets up from Ara&#039;s chair and smirks
&quot;Hello Anon.&quot;
&gt;&quot;What are you doing on board my vessel?&quot;
&gt;She chuckles a bit
&quot;I was rebuilt Anon. How could you possibly think that you can kill an AI?&quot;
&gt;You see flickering in the corner of your eye
&gt;She&#039;s distracting you while something gets close
&gt;Play along until the moment is right
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ve told you already, that you&#039;re not taking Ara. I&#039;ll die before I give her up you disgusting wench.&quot;
&gt;She frowns when you call her a wench
&quot;That&#039;s not very nice Anon. I&#039;m hurt!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Blow it out your technicolor ass you poor excuse for a walking talking calculator.&quot;
&gt;She looks genuinely offended now
&gt;A muffled dayyyyyum comes from the crew restrained by the wall
&gt;She shoots them a look and looks back at you
&gt;The flickering is closer now
&gt;Easy price, let em pass
&quot;I&#039;m afraid this little meeting of ours is going to have to be cut short. I have an asset to reacquire and you have a grave to lay in.&quot;
&gt;The flickering was right by you
&gt;Make your move
&gt;Time slowed and you grab the flickering mass from the air, pushing it downwards
&gt;The camouflage deactivates and you take his elbow in your left hand, palming his balls with your right
&gt;He howls in pain as you grapple his nose and clamp his mouth shut
&gt;You then rip him down to the ground, delivering a jab to his neck
&gt;He chokes and sputters before hitting the ground
&gt;You slam your foot down on his skull and it caves in like wet cardboard
&gt;You look over to see Ara fairing well against the other camouflaged man
&gt;Zeta looks unimpressed
&gt;It&#039;s your turn to talk
&gt;&quot;Come on, is that all you got?&quot;
&gt;2 more uncloak and run towards you with blades
&gt;This is oddly convenient
&gt;You disarm the first one
&gt;Push, slice, push, slice
&gt;Jugular cut
&gt;Then the next one
&gt;Push, slice, push, slice
&gt;He chokes on his own blood as he falls to the ground
&quot;Enough of this.&quot;
&gt;You hear a pop and a sharp pain in your back
&gt;Then tingling
&gt;You guess it&#039;s a taser
&gt;You fall down in fake pain, writhing in fake agony
&gt;&quot;AGAGaagGGAaAGH!&quot;
&gt;The tingling stops and you ragdoll
&gt;She smirks and walks up to you menacingly
&quot;I guess a million volts is too much even for you Anon.&quot;
&gt;She reaches you and loads another cartridge
&gt;Go time
&gt;You kick her legs out from underneath her and throw yourself on top of her
&gt;She attempts desperately to shock you, but it does nothing
&gt;You wrestle the useless device away from her and grab her arm
&gt;You use it as leverage against her and force her forwards onto her chest
&gt;She struggles violently, but it&#039;s of no use
&gt;You have her in a restraint and she isn&#039;t getting out of it
&gt;&quot;Like that little act I did? I did it just for you.&quot;
&gt;She grunts in frustration
&quot;It was enough to AGH fool me.&quot;
&gt;You rip down her skirt and reveal her ass hole and pussy
&quot;W-what are you doing AGH!&quot;
&gt;&quot;You come here, demanding my AI. I ask you politely to leave, then I demand you leave, then I blast your head off with a microwave gun, and you still come back! Well if you aren&#039;t going to listen to what I&#039;m saying, I&#039;m going to have to tame you.&quot;
&gt;You feel her writhe with renewed fervor
&gt;You bellow a laugh
&gt;&quot;HAHAHAHA! I&#039;m joking! I wouldn&#039;t even dare touch your disgusting nethers. I&#039;m throwing you in the good old fashioned brig. No computers, no keypads, just a cell and a trap door.&quot;
&gt;You push the power button on her belly and hold it for five seconds before she goes limp
&gt;You hold it down for five more seconds just to be sure before letting her go
&gt;Ara has already freed the crew and they&#039;re all standing in front of you
&gt;&quot;Take her to the android brig. Use the hatch and seal the door off. I don&#039;t want her picking a lock to get out of the cell.&quot;
&gt;They nod and you release her limp form
&gt;They drag her off to the brig as you smirk at Ara
&quot;You meany! I thought you actually were gonna do it!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nah, she probably has a ton of STDs or something.&quot;
&quot;STDs? What are those?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Sexually transmitted diseases.&quot;
&quot;Never heard of them.&quot;
&gt;Must not have STDs here
&gt;Nice
&gt;You yawn, rubbing your eyes with your arms
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m tired, wanna go to sleep?&quot;
&gt;She nods and you head off to your room

&gt;When you wake, you stretch your arms out and rub your eyes
&gt;You see Ara on your lap, happily purring away while checking the blog
&gt;You sigh unhappily, both because she&#039;s still doing that blog, and because you&#039;d have to make her move
&gt;You attempt to move yourself out from under her
&quot;Nooo.&quot;
&gt;She flops herself on top of your legs, keeping you in place
&gt;&quot;Fine, I&#039;ll stay.&quot;
&gt;She purrs contently
&quot;Thanks Anon.&quot;
&gt;She rolls off of you and back to her laptop
&gt;She tapped away at the keyboard, answering questions through text rather than video
&gt;She presses a button and the camera feed goes live
&gt;Ara has no clothes on
&gt;&quot;ARA!&quot;
&gt;She practically jumps out of her skin when you yell
&quot;W-what!?&quot;
&gt;&quot;CLOTHES! NOW!&quot;
&gt;She looks down at herself and back to the laptop before slamming it closed
&quot;O-oops.&quot;
&gt;Her face is now bright blue instead of it&#039;s usual white and red
&gt;She scrambles up and gets one of your sweaters and pajama pants on before continuing her broadcast
&gt;Very lewd comments start coming in about Ara&#039;s figure and what they&#039;d do to her
&gt;She finally finds a question that isn&#039;t related to her cup size
&gt;It&#039;s asking about you
&#039;what&#039;s with anon&#039;s eyes?&#039;
&gt;&quot;What? Can you clarify?&quot;
&#039;they look distant, like they&#039;re looking past reality. what&#039;s that for?&#039;
&gt;&quot;I don&#039;t feel comfortable answering this.&quot;
&#039;come on anon. i wanna know!&#039;
&gt;&quot;Please, I don&#039;t want to talk about it.&quot;
&#039;anon, don&#039;t be such a wimp. tell us!&#039;
&gt;A wimp huh?
&gt;Ara looks back at you and shakes her head no
&gt;Too late
&gt;&quot;A wimp? A WIMP!? LET ME SHOW YOU HOW MUCH OF A FUCKING WIMP I AM!&quot;
&gt;You grab the helmet from your nightstand and insert the data link cable in the port on it&#039;s side
&gt;You go back to Vietnam and choose the most gruesome memory you can find
&gt;The kid bombers

&gt;It&#039;s the streets of Hanoi
&gt;You&#039;re leading a platoon of marines down a long stretch of road
&gt;Buildings on all sides
&gt;Kids were waving at you
&gt;Not to say hello
&gt;But to say goodbye
&gt;Their parents pull them from the windows and lock them
&gt;Strange
&gt;When you round a street corner, you see a line of kids, standing with their arms locked
&gt;You needed to get past them
&gt;You get your translator up and he yells to them, telling them to move
&quot;FUCKA YOU GI! GO HOME!&quot;
&gt;Little brats
&gt;The start walking forwards
&quot;GI GO HOME!&quot;
&gt;They start chanting it
&quot;GI GO HOME! GI GO HOME!&quot;
&gt;This ain&#039;t good
&gt;Their walk becomes a jog
&quot;GI GO HOME!&quot;
&gt;The jog becomes a run
&quot;GI GO HOME!&quot;
&gt;&quot;TELL THEM TO STOP!&quot;
&gt;The translator is screaming at them to please stop
&gt;They just run faster
&gt;You see why
&gt;Bombs
&gt;Strapped to their chests
&gt;You click the paddle to ignite your pilot light
&gt;Please stop
&gt;Please stop
&gt;PLEASE STOP!
&gt;You fire the flamethrower into the air and half of them break away
&quot;DRAGON!&quot;
&gt;But some kept running
&quot;THEY&#039;RE GETTING CLOSE TO THE BLAST ZONE!&quot;
&gt;&quot;FUCK!&quot;
&gt;Time slowed as they ran towards you in slow motion
&gt;Screaming in asiatic runes
&gt;They came within range of your flamethrower
&gt;&quot;GOD DAMMIT!&quot;
&gt;You aim the nozzle at the kids and squeeze
&gt;A spray erupts from the nozzle, being set ablaze after it exits
&gt;The spray of molten napalm streaks towards the children in an arc of impending doom
&gt;Their eyes widen in surprise as the flames came towards them
&gt;Then the screams
&gt;Oh god the screams
&gt;It sounded like hell had come to earth
&gt;It felt like it too
&gt;The heat coming from the flames burned your face from the proximity
&gt;And the smell
&gt;Oh god the smell
&gt;Burning flesh and hair
&gt;Burning silk and nylon
&gt;Gasoline
&gt;Smoke
&gt;Yelling and screaming
&gt;You kept the paddles held down, screaming as you charged forward
&gt;An explosion rang out in front of you, the blast wave going through your chest
&gt;3 more came from in front of you as you continued to run into the blaze
&gt;Sweeping your flamethrower side to side like a reverse fire extinguisher
&gt;The screaming just kept coming
&gt;More explosions
&gt;Something slammed into your chest, knocking you over
&gt;You stop the spray of liquid hellfire and check what hit you
&gt;A spray of shrapnel from one of the bombs
&gt;You get back up and continue to charge into the ever growing inferno
&gt;Houses were now ablaze
&gt;Women screaming to their children
&gt;Screaming at you
&gt;Telling you to stop
&gt;You can&#039;t stop
&gt;Nothing in the world could make you stop
&gt;Short of a bullet to the brain
&gt;You were hoping for that
&gt;A swift end to a miserable life of endless war
&gt;You see enemies everywhere
&gt;Yelling at you from windows and doorways
&gt;Waving around weapons that you couldn&#039;t make out
&gt;You pointed your fire lance towards the windows and depress the paddles
&gt;Liquid death explodes from the tip, engulfing the windows and doors in flames
&gt;More screams
&gt;You hear a violent hiss come from your weapon and one of the enemy turns you around
&gt;You depress the paddle and all that comes out is compressed air
&gt;He grabs you by your flak vest and slaps you
&quot;SNAP OUT OF IT MAN!&quot;
&gt;Your vision comes into focus and you see a black man holding you by the collar of your vest
&quot;YOU&#039;RE KILLING CIVIS MAN! STOP IT!&quot;
&gt;Those weren&#039;t civis
&gt;They were Vietcong
&gt;The enemy
&gt;You look back to the window just as a woman jumps out
&gt;She&#039;s on fire
&gt;She lands on the ground with a splat
&gt;You look around you
&gt;More bodies
&gt;Burning or already burnt
&gt;Charred corpses of children, some of them blown to smithereens
&gt;You see one of them walking towards you with his hands above his head
&gt;He&#039;s burning still
&gt;His entire body is engulfed in flames
&gt;He stops about 10 feet away from you and drops dead
&gt;Still burning
&gt;He had been trying to run away from you
&gt;You burned him
&gt;You burned them all
&gt;You drop your glowing hot death rod to the ground, making a clank as the tip hits the asphalt
&gt;All you could do was drop
&gt;Drop to your knees
&gt;You undid the canister from your back and set it down on the ground
&gt;You lay your head on it and look towards the sky
&gt;Everything is fire and flames
&gt;The men
&gt;The women
&gt;The children
&gt;All equally combustible
&gt;That&#039;s the thing about all of us
&gt;Humans
&gt;We all think that we&#039;re special in some way
&gt;Be it in ideology, skin color, language, height, strength, intelligence
&gt;But in the end, we will all burn
&gt;Consumed by the fire that is death
&gt;&quot;Why are we here Tommy?&quot;
&gt;The coolness of your voice sent chills down your own spine
&quot;S-sir, what?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Why. Are. We. Here. Tommy.&quot;
&quot;I-I dunno whatchu tryin to say sir.&quot;
&gt;&quot;WHY ARE WE HERE!?&quot;
&gt;You bolt up and face the black man
&gt;&quot;WHY THE FUCK!&quot;
&gt;You kick the flamethrower tank across the street
&gt;&quot;ARE WE FUCKING HERE?!&quot;
&quot;I-I don&#039;t even know dat myself sir.&quot;
&gt;&quot;IS IT JUST TO FUCKING SUFFER!? IS THIS SOME KIND OF SICK GAME?! SOME RIGHT OF PASSAGE!? WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE DOING HERE!?&quot;
&gt;You pull out your 45 and chamber a round, pressing it to your skull
&gt;&quot;WHY!? WHY DO WE EXIST? WHY DO I EXIST? I HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT KILL SINCE THE GREAT WAR AND WHAT DO I GET?! SOME LOUSY GI BILL FOR MY KIDS I&#039;LL NEVER HAVE?!&quot;
&quot;S-sir the great war?&quot;
&gt;&quot;YOU HEARD ME! I&#039;M MORE THAN 80 FUCKING YEARS OLD! I&#039;M SICK OF THE MURDER, THE SORROW, THE GRIEF, THE KILLING. I WANT IT ALL TO END!&quot;
&gt;You pull the trigger on your 45 and your right ear rings
&gt;You fall to the ground and drop the gun, feeling like you got kicked in the head
&gt;You remove your helmet and see why
&gt;The helmet stopped the round
&gt;&quot;FUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!&quot;
&gt;You chuck your helmet into a wall and it makes a large metallic clang, falling to the ground
&gt;It skitters along the ground before coming to a halt on the sidewalk
&gt;You just lay there and sob
&gt;Sob into your arms
&gt;You had nobody
&gt;You were a fucking monster
&gt;Killing children with fire
&gt;Killing the parents who tried to save them
&gt;You were the bad guy
&gt;The antagonist
&gt;The big bad wolf
&gt;The memory slowly fades back to reality as your vision focuses again

&gt;The chat is dead
&gt;Absolutely nothing
&gt;Not a single shitpost or word spoken
&gt;&quot;Still think I&#039;m a wimp? Some sort of pussy? Some piece of fucking meat that comes onto your little shit show every now and again to tell you off? Like the daddy you never had? The reason I have this fucking stare is because I&#039;ve seen shit. Lots and lots of shit. When I say I don&#039;t wanna answer something, I don&#039;t wanna answer. So you little chicken shits better grow some common fucking sense real fast when asking me your asinine questions. Because I got plenty more nightmare fuel to scar you little shits for life.&quot;
&gt;The person who asks the question finally responds
&#039;sorry, i&#039;ll be going now.&#039;
&gt;You calm yourself down and the next question comes in
&#039;Ara, what&#039;s up with your boyfriend? He&#039;s insane! I&#039;d leave him if I were you.&#039;
&quot;NO!&quot;
&gt;She blocks the person immediately
&gt;She closes the chat and laptop before putting it on the other side of the bed
&gt;She was thoroughly flustered by her fans
&quot;Anon! They do this kind of thing all the time! Ask me questions about you and why I date a crazy person! You&#039;re not crazy! You&#039;ve just gone through a lot!&quot;
&gt;You put a hand on her shoulder
&gt;&quot;Ara, no more questions for you. That whole chat thing is cancer and I don&#039;t want it spreading to you.&quot;
&gt;She&#039;s about to protest when you cut her off
&gt;&quot;Nothing of significant value has come from chat. Nothing at all. So don&#039;t try and argue with me about it. Just leave it alone for a while.&quot;
&gt;She looks down at the bed sheets and pouts
&quot;B-but.&quot;
&gt;&quot;No butts. Unless it&#039;s your.&quot;
&gt;She cracks a smile at that
&quot;You perv.&quot;
&gt;You just give her a wink and she goes limp into your arms
&gt;You lay there for a while in each other&#039;s company

&gt;Today was a special day
&gt;Vikna had a lesson planned for you on space warfare
&gt;On earth, naval warfare was always a two dimensional affair
&gt;This made it relatively simple compared to space warfare
&gt;With the extra axis of motion, guns needed to be more complex, gunners trained much better, and tactics adjusted
&gt;The small fleet of capital ships that you encountered above the ice world was an expeditionary force
&gt;Not a full on fleet like you had thought
&gt;The captains of these ships were not trained very well in this type of warfare, so your encirclement worked
&gt;But even a moderately trained captain would have just gone over or under it, making encirclement useless
&gt;The space version of this, would be to make a sort of grid from your vessels, a sphere of death
&gt;If they tried to flee in any direction, a ship would be ready and waiting
&gt;This was her first lesson on tactics
&gt;Her second lesson was on your ship
&quot;This ship is a Sevneka class battle cruiser. It is the longest ship in our navy and can be fitted with almost anything you can think of.&quot;
&gt;Her face was taught and serious, like your old english teacher, but younger
&gt;You had turned the bridge briefing room into a class room, with Vikna having a whiteboard, holo-board, desk, computer, and writing utensils
&gt;On your side were metallic one piece desks with a single pen and pencil each
&gt;Vikna was in a somewhat casual set of clothes
&gt;She had jeans, a button up shirt, and tennis shoes
&gt;She continued to speak
&quot;It has a crew capacity of 18000, but can be piloted by as little as 1500. Right now, we have about 10500 crew aboard. The weaponry we have equipped right now is a Mark 5 hyper laser system made to fire a 1 gigawatt constant beam and a 100 gigawatt pulse. In laymen&#039;s terms, it&#039;s a fuck huge laser.&quot;
&gt;Nice
&quot;Do you have any questions yet?&quot;
&gt;You remember a game you played back in 2002
&gt;It had ships with these massive rail guns that could destroy capitals ships in 1 shot
&gt;&quot;Do you have MAC cannons?&quot;
&quot;What?&quot;
&gt;&quot;A MAC gun, I think the acronym was Magnetic Accelerator Cannon. Like a rail gun but for ships.&quot;
&gt;Her eyes go wide
&quot;We don&#039;t, but that sounds like an excellent plan! I&#039;ll tell the scientists to get working on a prototype after class.&quot;
&gt;Holy shit you were gonna make a MAC gun
&gt;The lessons continue as planned until the day finally ended
&gt;You were tired and wanted to sleep
&gt;So did Vikna
&gt;You decided it was easier to just sleep in Vikna&#039;s room than to walk the whole length of the bridge to get to yours
&gt;Vikna didn&#039;t mind in the slightest
&gt;When you reached her room, she let out a sigh before stripping down
&quot;I hate wearing pants. They bunch up my fur and make it itch.&quot;
&gt;Guess you knew why she wore dresses all the time
&gt;She gives you a data chip and helmet to download the rest of the tactics lesson while you slept
&gt;You looked her over as she stripped out of her shirt
&gt;She sees you looking and her tail wraps around her front
&quot;W-what&#039;re you looking at?&quot;
&gt;You look away quickly
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m sorry, I just can&#039;t help it. You&#039;re just so beautiful.&quot;
&gt;You weren&#039;t lying
&gt;She was beautiful
&gt;Her perfectly toned body with curves in all the right places
&gt;Not too fat, but not a twig either
&gt;Not to mention her breasts
&gt;They were at least a C-cup
&gt;She almost always wore a bra, so you could be mistaken
&gt;Either way she was gorgeous
&gt;You look back at her and she was still covering herself with her tail
&quot;R-really?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes, really. Why else would I say you&#039;re beautiful? I wouldn&#039;t lie about something like that.&quot;
&gt;Her tail slowly slides away, revealing her to you
&gt;She&#039;s so cute when she&#039;s embarrassed
&gt;You walk over to her and pull her in to a hug
&gt;&quot;Besides, I&#039;d love you no matter how you look. You&#039;re my Vikna, and that makes you special.&quot;
&gt;Her shyness slowly melts away as she does the same in your arms
&gt;You put your arm under her butt and carry her to the bed
&gt;She let&#039;s out a startled gasp as you do this
&gt;You lay her down gently on the left side of the bed, facing away from the door
&gt;You liked to be closer to the door, putting yourself between Vikna and whatever could creep in
&gt;She was purring like crazy now, blinking slowly at you
&gt;You pull the blanket over her and tuck it in around her
&gt;You walk over to your side of the bed and undid your holster
&gt;You set the leather holster on the night stand and undid the strap
&gt;Pulling your Mk.23 from the holster and chambering a round
&gt;This makes Vikna roll over and bolt up
&gt;She looks at you in fear
&gt;&quot;Hey! It&#039;s okay, I&#039;m just loading it. I&#039;m not gonna shoot you. Honestly, you gotta relax a bit.&quot;
&gt;You let the hammer down with both your thumbs and set it on the nightstand
&gt;You go back to Vikna&#039;s side of the bed, where she has laid down again
&quot;D-don&#039;t scare me like that!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Vikna, you should know by now that I would never hurt you or any of you 3. So can you do me this one favor and calm yourself?&quot;
&gt;She nods and you tuck her in again
&gt;You strip yourself to your boxers and slide yourself into bed
&gt;You click the lamp off and slide into your normal resting position behind Vikna
&gt;She&#039;s purring softly and when you press up against her, she wraps her long tail around you
&gt;Her fur was so soft, it was indescribable
&gt;You wrap your arms around her and fall asleep almost immediately

&gt;You awake to a strange sound
&gt;A sort of dull hissing sound
&gt;Like well lubricated rollers on a wheel
&gt;It sounds exactly like the door being opened
&gt;You flip yourself around towards the door just in time to see it close again
&gt;But not before seeing a faint shimmer
&gt;You almost didn&#039;t notice it
&gt;You grab your pistol and pull the hammer back, scanning the room
&gt;The room was dark, so you switched on the lamp
&gt;A you hear the sound of fabric on steel to your right and point your weapon towards it
&gt;Vikna is awake by now
&quot;Anon, it&#039;s 3 AM, what&#039;s hap-&quot;
&gt;You put your left hand over her mouth
&gt;&quot;Something&#039;s different. I feel like we&#039;re being watched.&quot;
&gt;The lamp starts to flicker before the bulb shatters
&gt;Fuck
&gt;You speak very softly
&gt;&quot;Open the blinds Vikna.&quot;
&gt;She slowly moves to the controller for the blinds and presses the open button
&gt;They flick open and cast light on the room, revealing a shadow
&gt;The shadow is a crouched figure standing perfectly still
&gt;You pretend to ignore it while moving your gun around the room
&gt;When it hovers over the spot where the shadow&#039;s feet originate, you pull the trigger
&gt;BANG
&gt;EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
&gt;The ringing in your ears is deafening as the shadow&#039;s owner flickers into existance
&gt;A helmeted figure clutches at the quarter sized entry wound
&gt;You take aim at their head as they take a step towards you
&gt;bang
&gt;EEEEEEE
&gt;The helmet&#039;s visor shatters, a spray of blood and fleshy bits ejecting themselves out the rear
&gt;The figure drops instantly, dead before they hit the ground
&gt;You look back to Vikna who&#039;s ears are covered
&gt;She has her ears flat against her head and is shaking
&gt;You set your pistol down and pull her into your chest
&gt;She must be terrified
&gt;You hear her try to say something, but the ringing in your ears is deafening
&gt;Your hearing comes back and she continues talking
&quot;-id you see them? They were cloaked! Why did you ask me to open the blinds?&quot;
&gt;You rub the back of her head as she continues her barrage of questions
&quot;Why didn&#039;t you just tell me we had an intruder? You could&#039;ve warned me first!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Vikna, stop.&quot;
&gt;She stops talking and looks up at you
&gt;Her pupils were completely dilated
&gt;&quot;I saw them because camouflage doesn&#039;t get rid of shadows. They also seem to flicker when moving. As for why I didn&#039;t tell you, I needed them to not run and warn their friends. Now arm up. I have a good idea what they&#039;re after.&quot;
&gt;She gets out of bed and opens her nightstand, retrieving a small laser pistol
&gt;You slip on your clothes from yesterday and put on your belt
&gt;You take some spare rounds from your belt and eject the magazine, topping it off before reinserting it
&gt;Vikna grabs some sort of vest and throws it to you
&gt;You catch it and it&#039;s somewhat hefty
&quot;It&#039;s armor. Put it on.&quot;
&gt;You nod and slip the vest over yourself
&gt;It automatically adjusts to you before strapping itself snug
&gt;Cool
&gt;You look to Vikna who nods back to you
&gt;&quot;On me, keep low and stay quiet.&quot;
&gt;She nods and you screw the suppressor on the end of your barrel
&gt;After tightening it, you sneak your way to the door
&gt;You whisper to Vikna
&gt;&quot;Do you have something that I could use to see them better? Like thermal vision?&quot;
&gt;She nods and bounds back to her closet, retrieving 2 pairs of glasses
&quot;Put these on.&quot;
&gt;She puts on hers and they go completely opaque
&gt;You slide yours over your eyes and they activate, showing the world in a rainbow of colors
&gt;At least, in one eye
&gt;The right eye was left clear to see
&gt;You exit her room and go to the right, spotting 3 cloaked figures immediately
&gt;You take aim at them as they freeze, thinking they were invisible
&gt;pop pop pop
&gt;The 2 closest to you go down while a beam of light strikes the last one
&gt;&quot;Scratch 3. Keep moving.&quot;
&gt;You tactically your way down the hall, checking every room as you did
&gt;Ayn&#039;s room was the last one to the right
&gt;The door was ajar
&gt;Fuck!
&gt;You stack up by the door and turn the corner
&gt;A figure is poised over her, ready to strike with a knife
&gt;pop pop
&gt;2 shots to the skull fixes that
&gt;The body falls forward onto Ayn, who is startled awake
&gt;She sees you pointing a pistol her way and freezes in fear
&gt;You lower it and she looks to see a now visible assassin on top of her
&gt;Nytro was also in the room, still asleep and snoring
&gt;Warning was plugged into a wall outlet and curled up on a chair
&gt;Ayn pushes the body off of her and slaps Nytro
&quot;OW! What the fuck Ayn?&quot;
&gt;She points to the dead body and his eyes go wide
&quot;S-stealth troopers?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Ayn was about to bite the dust before we made it here. Take better care of your bang buddy Nytro.&quot;
&gt;Warning had awoken from her sleep now and was unplugging from the wall
&gt;She sees your weapon and widens her eyes
&quot;DANGER! LOADED FIREARM WITHIN RANGE OF CREW! CONTACTING SECURITY TE-&quot;
&gt;&quot;SHUT UP WARNING! IT&#039;S YOUR CAPTAIN!&quot;
&gt;She stops mid word and looks you over again
&quot;Warning! Captain is carrying firearm in a combat stance. Assuming threat is immediate.&quot;
&gt;She looks to the dead trooper on the bed
&quot;Warning! IH Kaltag shock trooper is KIA. Cause of death, cranial trauma times 2. 45 caliber approximately.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nytro, give Warning some new parameters. We have an invasion on our hands and I doubt these were the only ones.&quot;
&gt;He nods and jumps out of bed, dick waving in the wind
&gt;&quot;While you&#039;re at it, get dressed please. I don&#039;t wanna see that waving around while we&#039;re fighting off invisible repo men.&quot;
&gt;He covers himself and the thermals show a heat spike in his cheeks
&quot;Oops, sorry cap&#039;.&quot;
&gt;You turn back to the hall and see Vikna scanning around the corner
&quot;2 more coming from the left. Permission to engage?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Granted, barbecue those fucks.&quot;
&gt;Multiple pulses from the laser pistol and two thumps later solves the problem
&quot;Scratch 2.&quot;
&gt;When you turn around, Nytro is dressed in pants and a shirt
&gt;&quot;Good, now grab a gun and follow me. I&#039;m pretty sure they&#039;re trying to take Ara.&quot;
&gt;He nods and gets behind you
&gt;&quot;Do not fire unless I give the order, or your life is in danger. Watch for shimmers of light and shadows. Just because you can&#039;t see them directly doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re completely invisible.&quot;
&gt;He nods again and the 3 of you file out the door
&gt;You notice the door to the bridge stairway is open
&gt;&quot;They&#039;re in the bridge, pick up the pace.&quot;
&gt;You rush up the stairs and stop just before you crest the top
&gt;You get down low and slink up the stairs before poking your head up
&gt;You see 3 of them surrounding Ara, who&#039;s blissfully unaware they exist
&gt;One of them has a sapper in their hands
&gt;Ara notices you and smiles until she sees the gun pointed at her
&gt;&quot;HEAD DOWN!&quot;
&gt;She immediately leans forwards and covers her head, the 3 figures turning towards you
&gt;&quot;FIRE!&quot;
&gt;A loud bang comes from your right as Nytro fires his revolver
&gt;Perfect form
&gt;Vikna puts 3 laser pulses into the one on the left and you shoot the last one with the sapper
&gt;They all fall and the night AI all look towards the noise before resuming their duties
&quot;Anon! What was that for?!&quot;
&gt;She looks down at her feet and sees the stealth troopers
&quot;O-oh.&quot;
&gt;You rush over to her and kick the sapper away before pulling her into a hug
&gt;&quot;Are you hurt!? Did they touch you? Di-&quot;
&gt;She puts her finger to your lips
&quot;I&#039;m fine Anon, thanks to you.&quot;
&gt;You close your eyes and hold her tight
&gt;You needed to protect her
&gt;Protect your family
&gt;They may see them as a figure head, a militant, and an anthroid, but they were your family
&gt;Nobody hurts your family
&gt;You let her go
&gt;&quot;Vikna, scan the room for hostiles. Nytro, lock the door. Ara, get somewhere safe. I&#039;ll be right back.&quot;
&gt;You unscrew the suppressor, burning your hand a bit in the process
&gt;You holster your pistol and slide the suppressor into the pouch on your holster
&gt;You enter your room and undo the belt, tossing it on your bed
&gt;No threats in your room
&gt;Good
&gt;You walk to your trunk and fling it open, digging to the bottom of it
&gt;You find your flak vest, uniform, and webbing all in immaculate condition
&gt;You strip out of your one piece and start putting your uniform on

&gt;The uniform still fits you like a glove
&gt;You grab your pot helmet and examine it
&gt;The word Alone is still written in marker on one side
&gt;The other side reads a different phrase
&gt;Kill
&gt;That&#039;s what you&#039;re gonna do
&gt;You&#039;re gonna kill every last one of the sumbitches who dare step foot on your vessel
&gt;You&#039;re gonna do it your way too
&gt;You mount the helmet on your head and grab your rifle, slapping a magazine in
&gt;Once the rifle is loaded, you put on your boots, tying them down and stomping the floor to make sure they&#039;re secure
&gt;You look at your mirror
&gt;The face that stares back is almost alien
&gt;The uniform, webbing, helmet, all look correct
&gt;But the face
&gt;It just doesn&#039;t fit
&gt;You grab some face paint from your right breast pocket and open it up, smearing some on your fingers
&gt;You put the green and black slime under your eyes and cap the can again, storing it in your pocket
&gt;Still doesn&#039;t look right
&gt;You grab a cigarette and stick it in your mouth
&gt;There we go
&gt;Everything is set
&gt;You draw your 1911 and chamber a round, relishing the metallic click it made as the round chambered
&gt;You holster the weapon again, taking the rifle and walking out the door
&gt;All the memories burn in the back of your mind, in more ways than one
&gt;You can almost feel the sloshing of napalm on your back again
&gt;You grab your zippo from your left breast pocket and walk to the door
&gt;It opens and you flick the flint a few times until it lights, putting the flame to your cigarette
&gt;The tip glows red and you flick the lid closed, making a metallic clink as your friends look at you
&gt;Their eyes go wide in terror as they see the man who burned women and children all those years ago in the flesh
&gt;You store your zippo and take a drag of your cigarette before blowing it out your nostrils
&gt;&quot;They made a big mistake coming here.&quot;
&gt;Vikna speaks first
&quot;W-what?&quot;
&gt;&quot;They came here for me, which I don&#039;t mind in the slightest. Then they tried to hurt you.&quot;
&gt;You pull the charging handle on your rifle back
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s where they fucked up.&quot;
&gt;The entire group&#039;s ears are flat against their heads, tails in varying states of hiding
&gt;&quot;Nobody.&quot;
&gt;You let the handle fly forwards
&gt;&quot;Fucks with my family.&quot;
&gt;You close the dust cover out of habit, putting your rifle to rest across your chest
&gt;&quot;Now get behind me and don&#039;t make a single god damn noise. Don&#039;t touch me until I&#039;m, uh, done with somebody. I&#039;ve attacked my own men who&#039;ve tried to stop me before and I don&#039;t want to hurt you.&quot;
&gt;They all nod and Ara runs to your room to hide
&gt;You take a drag and grin
&gt;&quot;Good, let&#039;s kill some space gooks.&quot;
&gt;You let out a puff of smoke and move to the stairs
&gt;You descend the stairs and move to the left side of the door
&gt;You flick the safety off and round the corner, rifle at your hip
&gt;Nobody in the hall you came from
&gt;You give a hand signal and they both follow you
&gt;You come to the elevator hallway and peak around the corner
&gt;1 man standing uncloaked is facing the elevator
&gt;Away from you
&gt;A wicked grin plasters itself across your face as you unsheathe your bayonet
&gt;You sling your rifle and sneak up behind the man
&gt;You stand up and look past him
&gt;Nobody else on thermals
&gt;You grab their chin and stab your knife into their neck, stabbing through both jugulars and their wind pipe
&gt;The only sound you hear is the desperate gurgle of someone trying to scream
&gt;You take a drag and blow smoke past him as he struggles against you
&gt;&quot;Shhh, you&#039;ll wake someone.&quot;
&gt;His struggling gets less and less as the gurgling dies down
&gt;You drag him back behind the corner and lay him down as the last twitches of life come from the now dead body
&gt;&quot;Hall&#039;s clear. Let&#039;s move.&quot;
&gt;They stare at the bleeding corpse before following you to the elevator
&gt;The numbers on it are ticking up towards your floor
&gt;You get to the other side of the elevator and hear the ding before the doors open
&gt;The figure that steps out isn&#039;t wearing a helmet
&gt;It&#039;s a cheetah anthro
&quot;Who the fu-&quot;
&gt;You grab his muzzle and slice his furry neck open
&gt;Blood sprays from the new opening like a fountain as you drop him to the floor
&gt;His breathing getting desperate and sporadic
&gt;He chokes on his own fluids and dies
&gt;You step over him and wave them into the elevator
&gt;Vikna has her hand over her mouth and Nytro&#039;s is agape
&gt;&quot;Close your mouth, a fly might get in.&quot;
&gt;He closes his mouth as you take one last drag from your cigarette
&gt;You toss it to the floor and stamp it out, puffing the smoke out before stepping inside
&gt;&quot;If you wanna stay, then stay. I&#039;m not waiting for long.&quot;
&gt;They both step inside and you press the button for the hangar deck

&gt;The elevator stops and 2 men, a lion and a cheetah, stand in front of the elevator
&gt;You slam the knife into the right ones skull and slam the left one against a wall, knocking him out cold
&gt;You remove the knife from the lion&#039;s skull and stab it into the cheetah&#039;s spinal cord, killing him
&gt;You pull it out again and scan around you
&gt;1 more was down the hall, watching the whole thing
&gt;You sprint towards him as he fumbles with his radio, dropping it on the floor
&quot;Oh shit!&quot;
&gt;You tackle him to the ground and stab him in his chest
&gt;You do it again and again and again until he stops screaming and falls limp
&gt;You remove the knife and wipe it off on his fur
&quot;Unit 4, status report, over.&quot;
&gt;Fuck
&gt;You pick up the radio and click the talk button, trying your best to impersonate the dead man
&gt;&quot;Everything&#039;s clear here.&quot;
&quot;You sound different Jack, what&#039;s up?&quot;
&gt;You had to think fast
&gt;&quot;I threw up. Must&#039;ve been something I ate.&quot;
&quot;Oh, I gotcha. Well come on down to the cell, we got the ZTA unit. Does Unit 7 have the ARA unit?&quot;
&gt;&quot;You mean unit 3?&quot;
&gt;You were hoping he was bluffing
&quot;Good, it really is you. Yeah, does unit 3 have the ARA unit?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yeah, they just came down the elevator. Their radio got busted by the captain, but he&#039;s dead now. We&#039;re making our way there.&quot;
&quot;Alright, out.&quot;
&gt;You unscrew the antenna from the radio and throw it down the hallway
&gt;Vikna speaks first
&quot;How&#039;d you know there wasn&#039;t a unit 7?&quot;
&gt;&quot;The patches on those men had 3s on them. I just guessed they were bluffing to see if it was really them.&quot;
&gt;She nods and you shoulder your rifle
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s get moving before they escape.&quot;

&gt;You reach the hallway before the cell door and position yourself by the corner
&gt;You count to 3 and come around the hallway, seeing 3 men by the door
&gt;They turn to see a man dressed in olive drab pointing a grey piece of metal and plastic at them
&gt;You squeeze the trigger and let the rounds fly
&gt;Their arms flail upwards, flinging their weapons up and falling over
&gt;You hear a click and drop the mag, slapping a new one in before pressing the bolt release
&gt;&quot;MOVE!&quot;
&gt;You hear the foot falls of your friends behind you as you draw your bayonet
&gt;You slide to the side of the thick steel door and click the bayonet on to the lug
&gt;You check the bodies and see one of them has a large square on him
&quot;That&#039;s a breaching charge Anon. Put it on the door and we&#039;ll breach.&quot;
&gt;You nod and slam the square on the door, stacking up on the door
&gt;The charge beeps and gets more rapid as time goes on
&gt;Finally it lets out a long beep and explodes, blowing the door inwards
&gt;You turn the corner and see a lion rushing towards you with the butt of his rifle
&gt;You deflect it to the side and kick him back, lunging at him with your rifle
&gt;You stab him in the throat, turning your rifle and pulling
&gt;You turn to another man, a dog, fumbling with his rifle
&gt;You point your rifle at him and spray a burst into him, sending him stumbling back
&gt;The wall was splattered red with gore as you heard 3 more bangs behind you
&gt;Nytro had shot the man cutting Zeta free and the man by him
&gt;The man with the grinder clutches his chest and reaches for his pistol
&gt;You power walk to him and stomp on his chest, raising your rifle to him
&gt;You empty the rest of your magazine into the man, gritting your teeth as you do
&gt;You turn towards a very startled Zeta and let your magazine fall to the ground
&gt;Slapping a new one in, you slam your palm against the bolt release
&gt;A wheezing is heard behind you and you turn to the other man
&gt;His eyes widen in fear and he tries to back away
&quot;N-no! Please! I surrender! HAVE MERCY!&quot;
&gt;You stop for a second
&gt;&quot;Mercy?&quot;
&gt;He nods his head violently
&quot;I-I got a kid and a wife! P-please don&#039;t kill me!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Well, you should&#039;ve thought about that before you boarded my ship.&quot;
&gt;You stab the bayonet into the man and pull the trigger, blowing a hole in his chest
&gt;He goes limp and you remove your bayonet
&gt;You turn back to Zeta
&quot;H-he surrendered! He had a family you monster!&quot;
&gt;You pull a cigarette from your helmet
&gt;&quot;Monster? No.&quot;
&gt;You stick it in your mouth
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m not a monster.&quot;
&gt;You point your rifle at the frightened android
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m the one who kills them.&quot;
&gt;You empty the rest of your magazine into her skull, blowing it apart in a brilliant shower of sparks and circuitry
&gt;You let the empty piece of steel fall from your gun, loading a fresh one and slamming the bolt release again
&gt;You take the zippo from your pocket and light the cigarette, taking a drag before flicking the lighter closed
&gt;You turn back and see Vikna and Nytro staring in disbelief
&gt;&quot;Fuckin&#039; space gooks. Let&#039;s get the rest of em.&quot;
&gt;You had already taken out units 2, 3, and 4, now you had to kill the first unit

&gt;You reach the shuttle bay and see a shuttle from Kaltag sitting in your hangar
&gt;They killed your entire hangar crew before they could react
&gt;Fuck stealth, you were blasting these fuckers
&gt;You steadied your rifle on the railing and aimed at the guy closest to the shuttle
&gt;BANG
&gt;He drops like a sack of potatoes
&gt;BANG BANG
&gt;Nytro fires his revolver and flicks the cylinder open, loading some fresh rounds
&gt;Vikna is spraying them down with her laser pistol
&gt;They try retreating into the shuttle but you fire at them when they get close
&gt;One by one they drop until only the ones in cover are left
&gt;The ones in cover get out with their hands up
&gt;You vault over the railing and drop to the floor below, landing with a thud
&gt;You keep your rifle trained on them
&gt;As you close in, you can see the 2 of them are a fox and a black cat
&gt;One is a male and one is a female
&gt;You reach them and point your rifle at the fox man
&gt;&quot;How many more are there?&quot;
&quot;N-no more sir! Just us! Please don&#039;t shoot! We surrender.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Give the all clear.&quot;
&quot;I-I just said-&quot;
&gt;&quot;GIVE THE ALL CLEAR NOW!&quot;
&gt;He scrambles to get his radio and shakily depresses the button on the side
&quot;You&#039;re clear to jump, we have the cargo but our docking clamps are damaged, we&#039;ll dock when it&#039;s safe. Out.&quot;
&gt;He drops the radio and you take aim at his head
&gt;&quot;Good. Now both of you turn around.&quot;
&gt;They do as they&#039;re told
&gt;You sling your rifle and draw your pistol
&gt;&quot;Now leave.&quot;
&gt;They walk back to the shuttle as you take aim at the fox&#039;s head
&gt;BANG
&gt;You aim at the cat lady&#039;s head
&gt;BANG
&gt;They both drop before they can react
&gt;You turn around to see Nytro pointing his revolver at you
&gt;You sigh
&quot;DROP YOUR WEAPON ANON!&quot;
&gt;You walk forward as he continues to point his weapon at you
&gt;He cocks the hammer back
&quot;DROP IT!&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t stop
&quot;DROP IT NOW!&quot;
&gt;You reach him and he aims the gun straight at your head
&quot;Turn around now Anon! You&#039;re under arre-&quot;
&gt;You blow smoke in his face and reach for his gun when his eyes blink shut
&gt;You grab the barrel of the gun and twist it sideways, using your left hand on his wrist as a fulcrum
&gt;You push him back with your leg and flick the revolver open dumping the rounds and ripping the cylinder out
&gt;You toss the gun back to him and push past him
&gt;&quot;I&#039;m going to my quarters.&quot;
&gt;You holster your pistol and continue to the bridge

&gt;Vikna
&gt;&quot;That&#039;s a breaching charge Anon. Put it on the door and we&#039;ll breach.&quot;
&gt;He nods and slams it on the door
&gt;The look on his face was terrifying to say the least
&gt;Not a single emotion shown through
&gt;Just a blank stare the whole time
&gt;Even when he grinned it was void of any feeling
&gt;Just reactionary at most
&gt;The charge blows open and he rushes in with the cool efficiency of a machine
&gt;A lion tries to stock him in the face, but he just deflects it with his bayonet before kicking him back
&gt;He lunges after the lion, stabbing him in the throat and twisting, making a sickening crunch before pulling out again
&gt;The other anthro, a dog, was fumbling with his rifle
&gt;Anon pointed his gun at him and fired a burst, splattering his blood on the walls
&gt;It was a terrible sight
&gt;Nytro shot the two trying to cut through the bars before they could do it
&gt;Anon turned to the man with the cutter and saw him gripping his chest
&gt;He was going in to disarm the man and take him prisoner
&gt;At least, you thought so
&gt;Anon stomps on his chest, raising his rifle to the man&#039;s head and emptying his gun into him
&gt;Oh my gods he just killed him!
&gt;He turns to Zeta
&gt;He slaps another magazine in and palms the button on the side, generating a loud clack
&gt;The other man wheezes and grabs his side in pain
&gt;He&#039;s trying to crawl towards you before rolling over towards Anon
&gt;Anon turns towards him and aims his gun at him
&quot;N-no! Please! I surrender! HAVE MERCY!&quot;
&gt;Anon stops for a second
&quot;Mercy?&quot;
&gt;His voice is completely different
&gt;It&#039;s more gravely, something akin to an older man
&gt;The man nods violently
&quot;I-I got a kid and a wife! P-please don&#039;t kill me!&quot;
&gt;Anon isn&#039;t even phased
&quot;Well, you should&#039;ve thought about that before you boarded my ship.&quot;
&gt;He skewers the man with his bayonet before firing into him, blowing a hole in his chest
&gt;The man goes limp and he turns back to Zeta
&quot;H-he surrendered! He had a family you monster!&quot;
&gt;Anon pulls a white stick from a box on his helmet
&quot;Monster? No.&quot;
&gt;He sticks it in his mouth
&quot;I&#039;m not a monster.&quot;
&gt;He aims his gun at Zeta
&quot;I&#039;m the one who kills them.&quot;
&gt;He empties the rest of his magazine into Zeta&#039;s head, causing her to spark and circuits to fly
&gt;He lets the magazine clatter to the floor, slamming a new one in
&gt;He grabs his lighter and lights the white stick on fire
&quot;Fuckin&#039; space gooks. Let&#039;s get the rest of em.&quot;

&gt;Nytro was pointing his gun Anon gave him at Anon
&gt;Anon just kept walking as he told him to drop his guns
&gt;When Anon reached Nytro, he blew smoke in his face and took his gun away in the blink of an eye
&gt;He unloaded it and took the cylinder off of it, throwing the mess back at Nytro
&quot;I&#039;m going to my quarters.&quot;
&gt;He walks up the steps and goes to the bridge
&quot;W-what just happened?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I-I don&#039;t know. I&#039;m scared Nytro.&quot;
&quot;Me too blue, me too.&quot;
&gt;You were terrified of Anon right now
&gt;You&#039;ve never seen him act so robotic and emotionless
&gt;He gunned all those people down like it was second nature
&gt;He even shot people who surrendered!
&gt;It&#039;s like he didn&#039;t even notice
&gt;But he didn&#039;t shoot Nytro when he took his gun
&gt;He just disarmed him and deactivated it
&gt;You might wanna go and check on him to make sure he doesn&#039;t hurt himself

&gt;Anon
&gt;You enter your room and lock the door
&gt;You set your rifle down by the door and walk over to your mirror
&gt;The face in front of you was alien to you
&gt;Paint splattered down your cheek as sweat ran down your face
&gt;You take a last drag of your cigarette and blow the smoke out before flicking it to the ground
&gt;You stomp on it and twist your foot, putting it out
&gt;You look back at the face in the mirror
&gt;No emotion
&gt;Only a blank stare
&gt;And a quivering jaw
&gt;The reflection started to speak to you
&gt;&quot;Look at you Anon. You fucking monster. Killing enemies who surrendered. You disgusting automaton.&quot;
&gt;&quot;THEY WERE A THREAT!&quot;
&gt;&quot;No they weren&#039;t you freak. They were just surrendering.&quot;
&gt;&quot;NO! THEY WOULD&#039;VE CALLED FOR HELP AND-&quot;
&gt;&quot;Would they? Would they really? Look at yourself. You&#039;re a fucking machine. No wonder you like that fucking robot.&quot;
&gt;&quot;DON&#039;T YOU TALK ABOUT ARA LIKE THAT YOU FUCK!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh please, don&#039;t give me that &#039;but I love her&#039; bullshit. We both know that you can&#039;t love. You&#039;re a fighting machine Anon, not a man.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I-I-I-&quot;
&gt;&quot;You&#039;re a maniac Anon! A psychopath! EVERYTHING YOU TOUCH TURNS TO SHIT!&quot;
&gt;&quot;SHUT UP!&quot;
&gt;&quot;EVERYTHING YOU DO, GETS SOMEONE KILLED!&quot;
&gt;&quot;NO IT DOESN&#039;T&quot;
&gt;&quot;EVERYONE YOU LOVE HATES YOUR FUCKING GUTS!&quot;
&gt;&quot;STOP IT!&quot;
&gt;&quot;YOU KNOW WHY!?&quot;
&gt;&quot;I SAID STOP IT!&quot;
&gt;&quot;BECAUSE YOU,&quot;
&gt;&quot;NO!&quot;
&gt;&quot;ARE A COLD BLOODED,&quot;
&gt;&quot;I TOLD YOU NO!&quot;
&gt;&quot;RUTHLESS,&quot;
&gt;&quot;STOP TALKING!&quot;
&gt;&quot;MASS MURDERER!&quot;
&gt;&quot;NO I&#039;M NOT!&quot;
&gt;&quot;YOU KILL WOMEN AND CHILDREN FOR FUN ANON! YOU&#039;RE THE BAD GUY! NOBODY ACTUALLY LIKES YOU!&quot;
&gt;&quot;I-I&#039;M NOT BAD!&quot;
&gt;&quot;YES YOU FUCKING ARE ANON! YOU MIGHT AS WELL KILL YOURSELF RIGHT NOW! THERE&#039;S NO REASON TO LIVE ANYWAYS!&quot;
&gt;You pull out your pistol and aim it at your head
&gt;&quot;DO IT YOU WORTHLESS WORM!&quot;
&gt;You squeeze the trigger
&gt;&quot;END YOURSELF!&quot;
&gt;Your hands shake
&gt;&quot;FIRE!&quot;
&gt;You throw your pistol across the room
&gt;&quot;You fucking pussy. You can&#039;t even work up the balls to shoot yourself. You&#039;d rather everyone around you suffer.&quot;
&gt;&quot;FUCK YOU!&quot;
&gt;You rip your helmet off your head and throw it as hard as you can at the mirror, shattering it
&gt;The helmet bounces on the floor and rolls like a top over to you with a mirror shard inside it
&gt;The face looking back at you is your own now
&gt;Tears streaking down the cheeks
&gt;Making the paint run down with them
&gt;You look down at your hands and they were shaking violently
&gt;You ball your hands into a fist
&gt;&quot;FUUUUCK!&quot;
&gt;You kick the helmet at the wall and the piece of mirror inside flies out, shattering on the wall
&gt;You sit down on your bed and rip off your webbing and shirt
&gt;&quot;Monster. That&#039;s what I am. A baby killing mass murderer with no soul. Can&#039;t even work up the courage to kill myself.&quot;
&gt;You hear a rustling on the other side of your bed and draw your bayonet
&gt;You get into a combat stance as you hear something sliding around on the side
&gt;Ara pops up and looks at you
&gt;You drop the bayonet and walk over to her
&quot;A-Anon? What happened?&quot;
&gt;You collapse into her and start to cry uncontrollably
&gt;&quot;I-I k-killed them!&quot;
&quot;Who Anon?&quot;
&gt;&quot;The men! I killed the men! T-they tried to surrender and I killed them! I killed them all!&quot;
&gt;You try to keep explaining but can&#039;t due to the explosive sobbing
&gt;She just caresses your back as you wail into her shoulder
&gt;Her soft shoulder
&gt;She lays you down on the bed as you continue to cry uncontrollably
&gt;&quot;I-I-I-I t-tried to-&quot;
&quot;Shhhh, don&#039;t talk now. Just let it out.&quot;
&gt;You were tired now
&gt;Your cries died down to gentle sobs, and eventually stopped
&gt;Ara was purring gently as she ran her tail around you
&quot;I love you Anon. No matter what anybody else thinks. I love you. Nothing will ever change that.&quot;
&gt;You sniffle and rub your face into her shoulder
&gt;&quot;T-thanks Ara. I love you t-too.&quot;
&gt;You lay yourself down on the bed and black out

&gt;Vikna
&gt;You hear Anon arguing with himself in his room
&gt;Except the voice he&#039;s arguing with doesn&#039;t sound like his
&gt;You hear something shatter and a while later he&#039;s crying hysterically
&gt;After he finishes, Ara comes to the door and looks down at you
&quot;What happened out there?&quot;
&gt;&quot;He killed. He killed everyone he saw. He didn&#039;t even flinch or blink. It was like he wasn&#039;t himself.&quot;
&gt;Ara looks back at Anon then to you
&gt;&quot;He killed the people who tried to surrender. Didn&#039;t even think. Just killed. He did it so fluidly and with such ease. It was so scary. Nytro tried to stop him but he just took Nytro&#039;s gun and broke it. He didn&#039;t even flinch when Nytro pointed it at him.&quot;
&quot;Come in here, he needs us right now.&quot;
&gt;You nod and come in Anon&#039;s room
&gt;You look to the mirror and see it&#039;s shattered into pieces, Anon&#039;s helmet laying by it
&gt;Over by his dresser was his armor, scorched and dented from the ice world scuffle
&gt;He had pictures on it as well
&gt;Old, yellowing, black and white pictures of what you assumed was his family
&gt;A man in overalls beside a woman in a formal dress
&gt;2 children sat in front of them
&gt;2 boys
&gt;Anon had a brother?
&gt;He also had newer pictures too
&gt;One of them was of a kid with brown skin, putting bunny ears behind Anon&#039;s face in the picture
&gt;They both looked so happy
&gt;Both smiling and probably laughing at the time of the picture
&gt;Pictures of Anon in his dress uniform, getting better quality as they progressed
&gt;But Anon always remained there
&gt;The ribbons became more numerous, his face changing between young and old
&gt;But it was always Anon
&gt;In the same exact pose
&gt;Saluting and facing right
&gt;Then you saw a holo-pic device
&gt;He had it on a slideshow
&gt;Pictures of you, Ara, Ayn, even Warning and Nytro
&gt;He was rarely in them but when he was, he was always smiling
&gt;He looked so happy in them
&gt;That big toothy smile he always gave you all
&gt;It made you warm inside every time he did
&gt;The time he almost warped the ship into a star and was frantically trying to warp away
&gt;That was funny
&gt;This ship could go straight through a star and be just fine with it&#039;s massive energy shields
&gt;The time he tried to teach Zofie how to cook your favorite shashlik
&gt;She kept burning it because she read the recipe in Celsius instead of Fahrenheit
&gt;Her face was so red in the picture
&gt;When Anon completely dominated everyone in rainbow six siege
&gt;His arms were in the air and he was laughing
&gt;You still don&#039;t know how he can be so terrible at counter strike and TF2, but could single handedly wipe an entire team in R6S
&gt;He just said it was something to do with sound and lighting that got him in the zone
&gt;He even beat Ara when she had everything stacked to her advantage
&gt;Faster processing, the entire attacking team defending a fortified room, all the players controlled by her
&gt;He just picked them off one by one
&gt;The look he had while playing it was a very toned down version of what you saw today
&gt;He even had the picture of all 4 of you on christmas
&gt;You made him wear a christmas hat after he opened his presents
&quot;Vikna, come on.&quot;
&gt;You snap out of it and look back to Ara, who&#039;s completely naked
&gt;&quot;A-Ara! Put some clothes on!&quot;
&quot;Shhh! Anon likes it when I&#039;m naked. He likes soft things so I sleep naked all the time now. So strip down and get on the other side. It&#039;s not like I&#039;m asking you to have an orgy.&quot;
&gt;You pout a bit
&gt;That sounds kinda hot
&gt;You&#039;d love to have him plow you into the ground while Ara touched herself to it
&quot;Vikna! Come ooon.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Okay, j-just don&#039;t make fun of me.&quot;
&gt;She huffs
&quot;I&#039;m not going to. I&#039;ve seen you naked plenty of times!&quot;
&gt;You almost forgot that she plugs into the ship every day
&gt;That includes the camera system
&gt;Your cheeks heat up as you strip out of your shirt and panties
&gt;You walk over to the other side of the bed and see Ara already in sleep mode, making the bed sag under the weight of all her metal
&gt;You barely even made a dent in the bed because of how small you were
&gt;You pushed yourself up against Anon and felt his smooth skin
&gt;You wrap your tail around him and feel content, purring away as you felt your eyes flutter closed
&gt;Anon may be crazy
&gt;But he&#039;s still your Anon
&gt;And you loved your Anon

&gt;Anon
&gt;You woke up encased in warmth and softness
&gt;You had completely forgotten about yesterday&#039;s events
&gt;The dream you had last night was of your past, but not from any war
&gt;It was before korea in 1950
&gt;You were going home to your parent&#039;s house in Ireland for a visit
&gt;They had no idea what you were bringing for them for their 50th anniversary
&gt;You get out of bed, wanting to share this with the girls
&quot;H-hey, where you going Anon?&quot;
&gt;You look back at Vikna who&#039;s naked
&gt;&quot;O-oops, I&#039;ll wait till you get dressed! Sorry!&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s fine Anon. Tell me what&#039;s up first.&quot;
&gt;&quot;I had a dream last night that I want to show you both. I completely forgot about it until last night and it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Get dressed and meet me in the VR room in 20 minutes.&quot;
&gt;She cocks her head before smiling
&quot;Alright, I&#039;ll be their before then.&quot;
&gt;You smile, taking off your bloody pants and putting on something more casual
&gt;A button down shirt and some slacks, an old leather belt and your old loafers
&gt;You look back to your mirror, expecting to see a very casual looking Anon
&gt;You saw a shattered mirror and a helmet lying on the ground instead
&gt;Oh shit that&#039;s right
&gt;You shook the thoughts away and smiled again
&gt;None of that today
&gt;Today was going to be a good day
&gt;You found a hand mirror sitting by your photos and looked in it
&gt;A very friendly looking man with crazy hair stood before you
&gt;You grabbed the old comb from the dresser and used it to comb your hair into a short and sleek
&gt;When you were satisfied with the way you looked, you set the comb and mirror down on the dresser and let out a content sigh
&gt;You were in comfortable clothes, about to show your ladies that you weren&#039;t some killing machine
&gt;Stupid mirror Anon
&gt;He doesn&#039;t know anything
&gt;He&#039;s just an asshole
&gt;You look back at Vikna, who&#039;s getting a cup of coffee
&gt;She&#039;s wearing a sweater, using some sort of magic to make ice cubes for her piping hot coffee
&gt;You look to Ara, who&#039;s already dressed in one of your own shirts and sweat pants
&gt;She was giving you the most innocent smile you&#039;d ever seen
&quot;Is this okay to wear Anon? You&#039;re dressing up like you&#039;re going to a meeting.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Nah, I&#039;m just doing this to get in the mood. You can wear whatever you want if it makes you comfortable.&quot;
&gt;She nods and walks up to you before sniffing the air
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s wrong?&quot;
&gt;She sniffs your shirt and takes a long deep breath
&quot;This smells, very odd. What is it?&quot;
&gt;&quot;It&#039;s probably some left over cologne from a bygone era.&quot;
&gt;She nods and you walk out with Ara in tow

&gt;You reach the VR room and open up the Mem-view program
&gt;You see Ara flinch as you go past your massive amount of vietnam memories
&gt;You go back even further until you find the one you want
&gt;It&#039;s you on a large boat, watching as you get in closer to the shore
&quot;So, this isn&#039;t going to be a war memory is it?&quot;
&gt;You shake your head
&gt;&quot;Nah, I&#039;m not doing anything like that today. It&#039;s something completely different from that.&quot;
&gt;She looks at you quizzically before looking back to the screen
&gt;You make some chairs for you 3 to sit in before Vikna enters the room
&quot;Alright, I&#039;m here. What&#039;s this memory you wanted to show us?&quot;
&gt;You smile
&gt;&quot;Take a seat, this one&#039;s a good one.&quot;
&gt;She takes a seat to your left and you play the memory

&gt;The ship is now docked
&gt;A long forgotten song played throughout the ship, filling you with joy
&gt;You walk up to a light blue car and dig some keys from your pocket
&gt;The chrome writing on the front said Oldsmobile in bold font
&gt;This car wasn&#039;t just any old car
&gt;It was a car your pop couldn&#039;t stop talking about
&gt;He was a gear head in his spare time
&gt;Your mama and pop were both 79 years old, it being 1950
&gt;He was raving in his letters to you about how he&#039;d love to get one of those new Oldsmobile 88s
&gt;The one with a rocket 88 V8 in it
&gt;Even in his old age, he still worked his ass off on the potato farm
&gt;He drove an old Model T truck to town every day to sell potatoes and eggs from the chicken coupe
&gt;The town was about 30 miles away, so it was a 2 hour round trip
&gt;He said he wished he had one of those new cars on the farm, it&#039;d make his life so much easier
&gt;You opened the car&#039;s door up and got in the drivers seat
&gt;You then closed the car door
&gt;You had been working in an Oldsmobile factory since the war ended
&gt;You had some money lying around and a very nice employee discount on any car you wanted
&gt;You decided to buy a rocket 88 for your pop
&gt;All the bells and whistles were included
&gt;It had an AM radio tuned to UK radio bands, a 3 speed manual with, and an aftermarket air conditioning unit
&gt;You insert the key into the ignition, stepping on the clutch and putting the car in neutral
&gt;You turn the key and the engine whines before rumbling to life
&gt;It brought a smile to your face when you heard it
&gt;It still does
&gt;You gave it some gas and let it rev, the roar of the engine echoing inside the ship&#039;s cargo area
&gt;The man who was managing the cargo gave you a thumbs up
&gt;You pull the shifter into first gear and push the gas in slightly, releasing the clutch slowly
&gt;The car eases forward as you let the clutch go completely
&gt;The cargo manager waves you off and you wave back
&gt;When you exit the ramp, you drive off to the harbor exit
&gt;You reach the exit and look both ways
&gt;You had to remember to drive on the left side of the road
&gt;Damn UK roads
&gt;You were on the right side of the car, as you specified it needed to be UK compliant
&gt;You saw no cars coming and eased onto the left side of the road before slamming your foot on the floor
&gt;The engine roared as the tires screeched a bit, launching you forward at speeds you never experienced outside of an airplane
&gt;40 miles an hour
&gt;55 miles an hour
&gt;70 miles an hour
&gt;You were blasting down the road as you switched to overdrive
&gt;The farmers you passed gawked at the futuristic car passing them at incredible speed
&gt;You beamed like a madman as you continued to rocket down the Irish coastline in your american hot-rod
&gt;You let out a joyous yell as you careened past a police officer
&gt;You caught a glimpse of him just staring in disbelief
&gt;He didn&#039;t even try to follow you
&gt;You laughed as you made your way to your mama and pop&#039;s house

&gt;You reached the old farmhouse in record time
&gt;The car bounced over the somewhat smooth dirt before you slammed on the brakes
&gt;The car skidded to a halt about 10 feet from the barn door
&gt;You hold the clutch down and put it in neutral, turning the key off and putting the parking brake on
&gt;You open the door and step out of the car, closing it once you exited
&gt;It was almost 6 AM as you walked up to the front door
&gt;You used your old key and opened the front door, walking inside
&gt;You see your pop aiming his old double barrel at you when you closed the door
&gt;He sees it&#039;s you and sets the shotgun aside, pulling you into a hug
&quot;Me son! Ye came!&quot;
&gt;You hug him back, patting him on the back
&gt;&quot;Of course pop, I promised I would.&quot;
&gt;It was the least you could do for him
&gt;After all, he did raise you
&quot;Well sonny, wot was dat soond? A-are deh jerries coomin&#039; agen?!&quot;
&gt;&quot;No pop, It was the car I brought here. Come out and check it out.&quot;
&quot;Car? Det ting sounds like a feckin&#039; airplane!&quot;
&gt;You open the door for him and he walks outside the door
&gt;You watch him stop mid stride, staring at the car
&quot;E-es that wot aye thenk et es?&quot;
&gt;You walk up beside him and give him the keys
&gt;&quot;She&#039;s all yours pop, happy anniversary.&quot;
&gt;He doesn&#039;t know what to do
&gt;You point to the car
&gt;&quot;Well go on! Take it for a spin. The police aren&#039;t gonna stop ya.&quot;
&gt;He beams from ear to ear and he rushes to the car
&gt;Mama came out the door and put her hand on your shoulder
&quot;Did yeh get &#039;im thet?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yup. It&#039;s even got an air conditioner for the hot days and a hot air vent for cold ones. It&#039;s the least I could do for you 2 Mama.&quot;
&gt;She squeezes your shoulder and pulls you into a hug
&quot;Anon, yer sooch a good son.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Not near as good as you were to me Mama.&quot;
&gt;You return it gently, careful not to squeeze too hard
&gt;&quot;You wanna go with Pop? He&#039;s going for a drive if you wanna go too.&quot;
&gt;She nods and gives you a kiss on the cheek
&quot;I love yeh Anon, yeh big softy you.&quot;
&gt;You let her go and she goes bounding to the car
&gt;They were both in great shape for being in their late 70s
&gt;You watched Mama and Pop tear ass down the dirt road, the roar of the american V8 fading as the do so
&gt;You smile warmly
&gt;Finally did something right Anon
&gt;You cooked them dinner and chatted about stuff for the rest of the day

&gt;The memory faded away and you looked over to Ara who was smiling
&gt;Vikna was sobbing faintly
&quot;T-that was such a nice gift Anon. They really s-seemed to like it.&quot;
&gt;You rubbed the back of her head
&gt;&quot;I do stuff like this when I can. I don&#039;t know why it makes people so happy, but it does.&quot;
&quot;Anon, you big idiot! It shows you care about them! About us! That&#039;s why it makes us happy!&quot;
&gt;What?
&gt;You make people happy?
&gt;That doesn&#039;t seem right
&gt;&quot;Really? I make you happy?&quot;
&quot;YES! You make me so happy that I just wanna explode! I can&#039;t believe you don&#039;t know that.&quot;
&gt;You&#039;re fucking retarded
&gt;It&#039;s so obvious
&gt;They don&#039;t avoid you or salute your rank
&gt;They seem to love being around you and enjoy your company
&gt;This is genuinely surprising to you
&gt;But it&#039;s a pleasant one
&gt;You feel tears streak down your face
&gt;&quot;Y-yeh mean et?&quot;
&gt;Your accent is slipping out you&#039;re so overjoyed
&quot;Yes Anon! I&#039;m seriou-&quot;
&gt;You pull her into a hug and squeeze her, letting out sobs of joy
&gt;&quot;Oh my god! Y-you don&#039;t hate me! I-I-I love you too!&quot;
&gt;You want to say more but you can&#039;t find the words
&gt;You let her go and she smiles back at you
&quot;Don&#039;t ever forget that Anon. We will always love you. No matter what you do or say.&quot;
&gt;You can&#039;t move you&#039;re so ecstatic
&gt;Vikna doesn&#039;t think you&#039;re a monster
&gt;She actually loves you too!
&gt;You just sit there for a while, Vikna and Ara eventually leaning on you and taking a nap
&gt;You feel like you could float away
&gt;Everything is perfect right now
&gt;Absolutely
&gt;Perfect</textarea>
