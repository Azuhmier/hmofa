        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;One beautiful sun-shiny day you, the mayor of [Insert Town Name Here], were taking a nice stroll outside
&gt;pulling weeds from the ground and watering the roses and daisies
&gt;Everyone was smiling and being generally happy
&gt;except for one villager
&gt;the only sheep in the town, Baabara
&gt;She was sitting on the cliff edge that over looks the sea
&gt;The sheep was upset about something
&gt;You don&#039;t like it when one of your people(?) are upset
&gt;You sit next to your woolly friend and ask her what&#039;s wrong
&gt;&quot;Oh *sniffle*, Hello Mayor. It&#039;s nothing you should be worried about, It&#039;s just a me thing.&quot; 
&gt;You call nonsense and state that you are more than willing to her out her problem(s)
&gt;&quot;Well it&#039;s just that no one really wants to hangout with me. I mean like I&#039;m a great sheep to talk to but NO everyone else has &#039;better&#039; things to do than to hangout with the ONLY SHEEP IN THE ENTIRE TOWN! And blablablablablabla etc. etc. etc.&quot;
&gt;&#039;Oh dear&#039; you though. this was going to much harder than you anticipated

&gt;Soon Baabara stops her rant that you were totally listening to
&gt;&quot;I just don&#039;t know what to do Mayor. It feels like everyone and hates me and I hate that.&quot;
&gt;Ah but you have have a plan
&gt;well, a cat you know &quot;&quot;&quot;might&#039;&#039;&#039; have a plan

&gt;You go to the only cat in town whose good with the ladies
&gt;Punchy
&gt;It was hard to find him at first
&gt;you thought that he&#039;d be home but really he was out on a nature walk
&gt;You find the black and white cat sitting on a stump
&gt;sleeping
&gt;you wake the cat up in the most humane way possible
&gt;by making a hellish screech that would shatter glass right next to Punchy&#039;s ear
&gt;He slowly wakes up, not fazed by the hell screech you did
&gt;&quot;Oh waddup mayor, what do you need on this beautiful afternoon
&gt;you explain to him your, well, Baabara&#039;s problem
&gt;&quot;Yes, yes indeed, this is quite the dilemma. Bring me your sheep friend and I will try my best.&quot;
&gt;Punchy is the greatest

&gt;it&#039;s been about 2 hours since Baabara and Punchy started their session
&gt;And though out all of that you can hear stuff breaking and yelling
&gt;soon Baabara storms out of Punchy&#039;s house, going right past you
&gt;Punchy approaches you
&gt;Good Lord he&#039;s covered in injuries
&gt;&quot;Well I&#039;d say that went pretty well, though she might need some more work. Have her come by tomorrow will ya?&quot;
&gt;and of course he isn&#039;t fazed by any of those wounds at all
&gt;you even think is arm is broken
&gt;You politely dismiss your feline friend&#039;s offer
&gt;&quot;Alright then, if you need me I have stuff to do, maybe.&quot;
&gt;Punchy goes back into his house
&gt;you can hear blood curdling screams seconds after
&gt;you find Baabara sitting at the same place
&gt;you apologize to Baabara for what just happened
&gt;&quot;thank you Mayor but next time find someone who doesn&#039;t make insults at you every time when they&#039;re high.&quot;

&gt;You ask your sheep friend if there was anyway to make it up to her
&gt;&quot;well, I do want to go to that new in the city but I don&#039;t have anyone to go with. Maybe you can go with me mayor.&quot;
&gt;Oh
&gt;oh no
&gt;not clubs
&gt;your not a social person
&gt;especially round city folk
&gt;you&#039;ll drop your spaghetti within seconds
&gt;and if you&#039;re with a girl it&#039;ll be worse
&gt;but you can&#039;t just let your friend down, not after what happened just now
&gt;you accept her invitation
&gt;Baabara squeals (baas?) in delight
&gt;&quot;Oh thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou Mayor! You don&#039;t know how happy you just made me!&quot;
&gt;well
&gt;she&#039;s smiling, so that&#039;s a plus
&gt;Baabara gets up and starts skipping back to her place
&gt;oh shit wait.
&gt;did she say when she wanted to go to the club?
&gt;fuck it you&#039;ll call her later and ask
&gt;you head back to your home/castle/estate since it&#039;s getting late
&gt;when you get inside you get a call
&gt;from punchy
&gt;you answer the call
&gt;&quot;heya mayor, I just wanted to let you know you owe me... 700,000 bells for damages&quot;
&gt;Fuck
&gt;to the island you go

&gt;after slaving away for the majority of the night trying to catch gold beetles to pay off Punchy&#039;s hospital bill you final return home
&gt;there&#039;s a few messages on your machine
&gt;one from Mom
&gt;couple of messages from HHA
&gt;one from that smash tournament thing
&gt;and one from Baabara
&gt;you listen to the one from Baabara
&gt;&quot;Hi mayor, I&#039;m leaving this message to let you know that our date will be on saturday because I&#039;m waiting on a dress. Love you bye.&quot;
&gt;today is Wednesday
&gt;perfect
&gt;you have three days to get ready

&gt;Tonight&#039;s the night
&gt;The mayor is wearing a high-end designer suit
&gt;it cost roughly around 800,000 bells
&gt;Safe to say it looks good on him
&gt;his hair has been stylized for the occasion too
&gt;He looks like a million dollars
&gt;The mayor goes out and fetches his date a a gift
&gt;because he&#039;s nice
&gt;some flowers will suffice, roses to be exact
&gt;because he&#039;s vanilla
&gt;The mayor arrives at Baabara&#039;s house and knocks on the door
&gt;The mayor can hear movement behind the door
&gt;&quot;IT&#039;S UNLOCKED!&quot;
&gt;well ok
&gt;the Mayor opens the door and steps in
&gt;He sees Baabara covering herself with a towel
&gt;&quot;Oh Mayor, your here! Can you help me dry off? it&#039;ll take forever if I do it.
&gt;what
&gt;&quot;It already took 2 hours to wash all this wool. maybe I should shear off this wool again.&quot;
&gt;2 hours to take a shower?
&gt;The Mayor hurries on helping his date dry off 
&gt;&quot;here, take this blow dryer and start working on my back.&quot;
&gt;She hands the mayor a high powered-possibly an industrial-blow dryer.
&gt;with the two of them working together it only took 30 minutes to dry Baabara off
&gt;and yes, The Mayor did in fact get to see large, soft sheep tiddies
&gt;It took Baabara 25 minutes to dress herself
&gt;mostly because she needed help getting into her dress that seemed like it was about to burst when she got it on
&gt;&quot;yeah I&#039;m definitely going to shear myself soon.&quot; 
&gt;she doesn&#039;t wear make-up, she says it stains her wool
&gt;Soon both of them are ready to go
&gt;The mayor hands her the roses he got
&gt;&quot;Roses, nice. uh, thank you.&quot;
&gt;She doesn&#039;t sound too happy to get them
&gt;&quot;I like tulips a lot more than roses Mayor, but I do appreciate the thought.
&gt;The Sheep-human couple board the train to the city
&gt;they of course sit next to each other
&gt;Some of the other animal passengers gave the couple looks, mostly because it was weird for the Mayor to be with someone who wasn&#039;t a rabbit or cat
&gt;the two ignored the gawking and waited for destination

&gt;it&#039;s an absolute nightmare
&gt;Baabara is somewhere crying her eyes out
&gt;an eagle is on the ground in a bloody pulp
&gt;The Mayor is restrained by two gorillas so he doesn&#039;t kill the eagle
&gt;there are broken dishes, smashed bottles and glasses, and flipped tables
&gt;it&#039;s an absolute mess
&gt;but how did it come to this?

&gt;Earlier
&gt;Mayor and Baabara arrived at the city
&gt;it was nearing 11 pm when they arrived
&gt;perfect time for people to go clubbing
&gt;Baabara chose a club called Golden Night or something like that
&gt;The Line to get in was long
&gt;But being mayor, The Mayor bought his and Baabara&#039;s way in
&gt;The music was loud and the people louder
&gt;the Mayor managed to hook Baabara and himself a good table
&gt;&quot;Thanks for taking me here Mayor. I wanted to go here for a long time but..&quot;
&gt;The Mayor stops and tells her it was the least he could do after what happened with best cat

&gt;The to were enjoying themselves for a time
&gt;Having some fun dancing and what not
&gt;until an eagle came along
&gt;&quot;My, my, the esteemed [original town name here] &quot;Mayor&quot; and his backwater ewe of a girlfriend have decided to us with his presence
&gt;oh great, it&#039;s the mayor of that shitty town in the mountain side
&gt;&quot;Go away asshole, you&#039;re ruining my date.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Oh I didn&#039;t know that low lives like yourselves were capable of finding love.&quot;
&gt;&quot;Go shove a cracker up your feathery ass Polly before I do it myself.&quot;
&gt;The eagle got noticeably angry at Baabara
&gt;The Mayor tried to get her to stop but she kept throwing insults at him
&gt;to the point where bird brains decks Baabara in the face

&gt;The eagle is laying on the floor
&gt;He&#039;s really injured
&gt;his beak is broken and blood is dripping from his left eye
&gt;The Mayor blacked out because he couldn&#039;t recall ripping the bloody pulp of a bird a new one
&gt;But the blood on his hands and the two massive gorillas holding him suggests he did
&gt;The Mayor broke free from the two gorillas and looked for Baabara
&gt;Not in any of the bathrooms
&gt;Not out in the parking lot
&gt;he did find his sheep date at the empty train station
&gt;baabara was sitting down against one of the pillars crying
&gt;She was spooked when the mayor sat next to her
&gt;A) because she didn&#039;t notice him and B) because he was cover in someone Else&#039;s blood
&gt;The mayor tried to comfort his friend to the best of his ability
&gt;He was also worried that Baabara&#039;s nose/snout/muzzle was broken
&gt;they sat there for some time, apologizing to each other for ruining each other&#039;s night
&gt;They waited until the late night train showed up
&gt;Both of them were glad to leave that city</textarea>
