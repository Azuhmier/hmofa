        <textarea class="textarea">Reel Quick Dating [German Shepherd; Dating, Humor, Public Sex]: Now that Anon and Winny are a happy couple, they get to do all the things couples like to do. Going to the movies is pretty standard, but the German shepherd is never quite happy with &quot;standard&quot;.

Link to &quot;Speed Dating&quot; (part 1): https://pastebin.com/bLyCRBNu

&gt;”How about a dumb dick flick like ‘Metal Agu0r’?”
&gt;You actually wanted to see that one, so you don’t want it spoiled
&gt;”Fine, ‘Night of the Drunken Werewolf’ then?”
&gt;Not really into romcoms…
&gt;Dammit, Anon. This isn’t something we’re going to be actually watching!”
&gt;Right, right
&gt;The German shepherd taps her nail on her phone lazily
&gt;”Here, ‘Super Jackal’. Half a star. Nobody’s going to be there, and it’s starting soon.”
&gt;Sure, why not?
&gt;You and Minny are driving to the budget cinema, where all the already-out-on-video flicks are trying to squeeze out a few more ticket sales
&gt;The crowds are always sparse, and the place gets most of its revenue off overpriced concessions
&gt;Empty seats are what you’re counting on
&gt;The first date you had with your canine girlfriend ended with public lovemaking in an art museum
&gt;It may have ended in tears, but looking back it was a pretty passionate night
&gt;One that Minny suddenly got the urge to try again, now that her life is a little happier
&gt;But, doesn’t her ex-roommate have a bunch of friends who work at the theaters?
&gt;”Shit….”
&gt;Her face then lights up with smugness
&gt;”Actually, that’s perfect. I’d love word to get back to her that my Anon and I have such a close bond now.”
&gt;Guess old grudges die hard
&gt;…Damn, that would have been a good movie to see together

&gt;The cinema definitely looks like it’s budget quality
&gt;The carpets are torn, there are broken bulbs all around the posters, and you’re lucky if you can find a working arcade machine
&gt;You get the tickets, and she gets the snacks
&gt;”Gotta mix the sweet with the salty,” she says with a nudge to your ribs
&gt;You kind of feel bad, considering how much more expensive the food is in comparison
&gt;Then again, she knows you can’t complain about what candy she picks this way
&gt;As you walk toward your theater, Minny runs over and grabs a massive handful of napkins
&gt;”We may need these.”
&gt;Just like you hoped, the room is completely vacant
&gt;You timed it excellently, and the previews are ending just as you sit down in one of the loveseats
&gt;The movie itself is…pretty bad
&gt;You and Minny spend the first half just riffing on the terrible plot and acting, not caring about the volume of your voices
&gt;Now you’re getting anxious to begin your little tryst, but you both agreed to give it some time in case a few last-minute viewers drop in
&gt;Every so often a kernel of popcorn ricochets off your face
&gt;You turn to Minny, who’s nonchalantly watching the screen
&gt;”What?”
&gt;*Bap*
&gt;What?
&gt;*Bap*
&gt;This repeats for some time
&gt;Your cheek is coated in salt and butter
&gt;Minny leans in and licks it off, then moves in for a full kiss
&gt;The two of you share the moment repeatedly, with only a few brief pauses for refreshments
&gt;”Hey, can I have a Sugar Splotch?” she eventually says
&gt;Whoops, all gone
&gt;”What?” she scoffs. “You’re a fucking chowhound! That’s MY favorite candy and you ate a whole box by yourself!”
&gt;She pouts and stands up, hopping over the seats to sit in the row in front of you
&gt;You shoot a kernel at her in revenge
&gt;It sails through her pointed ears like they were goalposts and bounces off her snout
&gt;She turns around and slams the bucket out of your hands, spilling popcorn all over the place
&gt;Guess the fun’s over
&gt;You lean forward and pinch Minny’s ears when she’s facing forward
&gt;She folds them back with a growl
&gt;You start rubbing the base of her ears
&gt;Now you’re scratching them as well as the back of her head gently
&gt;She lets out a content sigh with her tail wagging through the back of the seat, slapping your legs
&gt;Your hands move down to her shoulders, giving them a soothing massage
&gt;”You’re not…getting off that easily,” she hums
&gt;Well, you hope not either
&gt;The massage goes on for a while
&gt;She’s almost catatonic in her relaxation, but the purpose for you two being here floods back to her
&gt;”Alright, loverboy. Let’s do this.”
&gt;Minny turns back around and rests her arms on the seat
&gt;”How should we decide who starts? Maybe about some ‘rock, paper, scissors’?”
&gt;Sure
&gt;”Cool…wait, what’s scissors look like, again?”
&gt;You hold out two fingers
&gt;”Huh? You want to go second after all?”
&gt;She holds up two fingers mockingly
&gt;That fucking girl…
&gt;”You lost. Get over here.”
&gt;You move to her row and forced to the floor
&gt;Uggghhh, it’s sticky
&gt;”Quit your complaining, that’s what the napkins are for.”
&gt;She didn’t want to get quite as cleaned up enough to wear the dress she wore on your first date, but she’s got a pretty short skirt on instead
&gt;Nothing else down there, either
&gt;She grabs the hem and lets you stick your head underneath
&gt;Her legs spread out a bit, giving you full access to her swollen lips
&gt;You grab her waist and go to town
&gt;Her thighs reflexively clasp around your head
&gt;Between the stifling air under her skirt and her own body heat, you’re already starting to sweat
&gt;She pushes down on your head, trying to grab it through the fabric
&gt;”H-ha…An~on…n-nggahhh.”
&gt;There’s only so much noise you can get away with even in an empty theater, and Minny’s trying her hardest to restrain herself
&gt;Oh?
&gt;Looks like there’s a little red dot of candy down there as well
&gt;You glide over it with your tongue, sending a shockwave of pleasure through the German shepherd
&gt;”OoooohhhhOOOHHHH!”
&gt;She quivers at the climax, then slumps over in her seat
&gt;Well, they said, “turn off your phones”, but…
&gt;You pull yours out and bring it under the skirt
&gt;”What, you gonna’ take a picture while you’re down there, you per-AAAHHH!”
&gt;You had kicked on the vibration on your phone, and now you’re pressing it against her slick box
&gt;The sensation almost pushes her over the edge again, but she clamps down with her hands and squeezes you with her thighs again
&gt;”E-enough of that!” she pants. “You’re gonna’ lose your phone if you keep pulling shit like that!”
&gt;That would probably void the warranty, too
&gt;”Alright, get up here.”
&gt;You hop onto the loveseat next to her
&gt;Minny unzips your pants and fishes around for what she wants
&gt;”I hope you won’t make a girl get down on that grimy floor for this,” she chuckles
&gt;You’re about to object to the unfairness, until her muzzle dips down and her tongue laps at your groin
&gt;She coaxes it to full length before you can finish inhaling
&gt;One arm’s around your backside while the other rests on your legs
&gt;She gives it a few more licks before taking the whole thing into her mouth
&gt;You shakily stroke her neck as your other hand intertwines with her paw
&gt;It would be the ideal way to watch a movie, if your eyes weren’t glazing over from the sucking
&gt;You grunt her name as you get close, but she just seals her lips as tightly as possibly
&gt;Your release is quickly swallowed in a few short gulps, and Minny brings you back down by delicately cleaning your shaft
&gt;When she’s done, the German shepherd reaches back to the drink holder and plops down next to you, sipping her soda as though nothing happened
&gt;You can’t even remember how the movie ended
&gt;As the credits roll Minny swings her legs over and sits on your lap, holding on to your neck
&gt;You can already feel your arousal growing a second time
&gt;”So, champ. How do you feel about a ‘double feature’?”
&gt;A poor teenage cat enters the theater to begin cleaning up
&gt;He sniffs the air in confusion
&gt;You’re already thinking of apologies for making such a mess on the floor
&gt;And for the popcorn as well</textarea>
