        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;you decide to crash a party that was happening tonight
&gt;Not wanting to go alone you decided to bring your roommate
&gt;It will be be a great chance to know her better
&gt;You haven&#039;t really hung out socially like this before with her
&gt;You didn&#039;t know anyone having the party so you wanted a bit off protection so you brought your anthro friend just in case
&gt;she was a rat as well, so people usually seem them as vicious due to their teeth
&gt;But she was far from unapproachable, she&#039;s very nice
&gt;She&#039;s actually quite reserved when she&#039;s not with you
&gt;The party is well under way as you always arrived fashionably late
&gt;Luckily you didn&#039;t know anybody there so you could just get straight into the drink
&gt;Plus it would have been awkward arriving first not knowing who was throwing it
&gt;You just saw it on a campus billboard and thought &quot;why not&quot;
&gt;Plus it&#039;s a good excuse to bring your friend
&gt;And she&#039;s female so you won&#039;t feel like a beta if anybody asks if your alone
&gt;But if a girl did ask you wouldn&#039;t lie that you came with a girl
&gt;To be honest, you wouldn&#039;t really want to talk to girls
&gt;This was all really just a chance to hang out with your roommate
&gt;You get into the swing of things making yourself at home with the store bought beer
&gt;There were was some whiff off Mary Jane but you&#039;re not into that stuff anyway
&gt;Still, when in Rome, or a culdesac in this case
&gt;You feel a bit tipsy from a few beers and some shots
&gt;but not as much as your friend you brought
&gt;&quot;Heeeey look Anon, check it out!.&quot;
&gt;You give a groan unamused
&gt;You had no idea she was such a light-weight
&gt;She&#039;s only been having beers
&gt;And with a dash of lemonade with them as well!
&gt;&quot;Look! check it out, I poked a hole in my cup with my tail, CUP TAILS! WOO OOH&quot;
&gt;She waves her tails directly in your face, the plastic cup smacking you across the cheeks
&gt;People certainly found *that* funny
&gt;Besides, you were more of a Tail Spin kid growing up
&gt;You would have laughed, even politely, but she keeps coming in doing the same joke, walking off forgetting she&#039;s talking and then coming back when she thinks she&#039;s just done it for the first time
&gt;&quot;Hey Anon come with me, I wanna show you something~&quot;
&gt;Now this is something new
&gt;She leads you by the hand to a bedroom away from the party
&gt;You&#039;d feel awkward touching her hand but she&#039;s too drunk to care
&gt;You always did feel you&#039;re heart skip a beat when her tail would brush against your leg, or her whiskers grazing your cheek when getting too close
&gt;She jumps on the bed and hangs her head over the bottom and calls you over
&gt;&quot;Y-y-you know like, we&#039;re friends yeah?, Well...since I&#039;m too drunk to care *anyway* I&#039;ll just come out and say it already ....I love you Anon; like, really love you like uh,...shit I can&#039;t think of anything, something something romantic, okay-you-got-it. Now let&#039;s have some fun!.&quot;
&gt;...Smooth...

&gt;She starts to have ago at your zipper jeans, her fingers keep missing the zip, she waves her hand and wiggles her fingers
&gt;&quot;Open sesame let me see that pepperoni&quot;
&gt;Her drunkenness was funny at first but you can&#039;t do this, not in her state
&gt;how could you live with yourself knowing you ruined your long friendship for trashy sex
&gt;&quot;Come on big boy~ let me...ah let me...fluxks yew&quot;.
&gt;Okay, she&#039;s officially shit-faced
&gt;You take her hand away and prop her up and place her head on the pillows
&gt;You pull up her tank top strap falling and put it back on her shoulder
&gt;There&#039;s a glass of water on the bedside table
&gt;You take the glass and help her drink some
&gt;You hope that water wasn&#039;t stored for teeth
&gt;You grab her hand and look into her sleepy eyes
&gt;&quot;I love you too. So I don&#039;t want to ruin it because of a mistake I&#039;d regret, I know I act like like you&#039;re annoying me or I don&#039;t want you around, but in reality I really do.&quot;
&gt;You climb on the bed as your friend opens her arms for you to cuddle
&gt;&quot;But-but didn&#039;t you want me to...to...&quot;.
&gt;She&#039;s to tired to finish her sentence, as she begins to yawn you pull the duvet over the both of you
&gt;&quot;Let&#039;s just get some sleep for tonight, alright.&quot;
&gt;&quot;You sure? This isn&#039;t even my bed, not that you&#039;d no anything about that... jerk&quot;
&gt;Her bedroom is literally next door from yours in the flat
&gt;She slurs under her breath mumbling about Duck Tails of all things
&gt;&quot;Yeah it&#039;ll be fine, I don&#039;t know the house owners anyway so I don&#039;t care&quot;.
&gt;You start getting comfortable under the sheets
&gt;Luckily it was a queen size bed other wise it would be like sleeping in a camping bag
&gt;She was quite tall and lanky
&gt;Her tail feels weird but it gives you a rush whenever she&#039;s coils it around your body
&gt;She&#039;s breathing deeply fallen fast asleep holding you in an embrace
&gt;You lean closer looking at her cute rat face sleeping peacefully admiring her cute features and sofly kiss her forehead.
&gt;&quot;I&#039;ll still love you tommorow&quot;.</textarea>
