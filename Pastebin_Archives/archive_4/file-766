She’s a red panda you’re somewhat close with. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”hey” </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You leave the text on read for a moment so you can put on your clothes.

Beat, and sad from earlier. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s close to midnight when you finally clock out. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You make it to your car and finally power your phone back up. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Two missed calls from May around 10. No texts. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You go ahead and call her. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She picks up after four rings. </div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”There you are, asshole!

        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Be Anon. 
&gt;You’re currently standing buck ass naked in front of your bathroom mirror, fresh out of the shower and shaving your face. 
&gt;Though earlier on you were feeling pretty shit, the shower helped you relax and calm down after today’s events. 
&gt;On the counter beside you is your cell phone, which suddenly chirps loudly, startling you and causing you to nick your upper lip. 
&gt;You rinse the cream off your face, your shave done anyways by now, and put a small piece of toilet paper over the cut to stop the bleeding before checking your phone. 
&gt;It’s a text from May. She’s a red panda you’re somewhat close with. 

&gt;”hey” 

&gt;You leave the text on read for a moment so you can put on your clothes. Then you respond. 

“What’s up May?” 

&gt;”i heard what happened with u and Arlene. U ok?” 

&gt;She was referring to your breakup with your now ex-girlfriend, Arlene. 
&gt;It wasn’t particularly nasty or dramatic. The both of you just realized you weren’t fit for each other, and ended it peacefully. 
&gt;You’d be lying if you weren’t still a little sad over it, though. 
&gt;You leave this message on read for a minute as you head back to your room and finish getting your stuff on for the day. 
&gt;As you slip on your necklace and put your wallet and portable charger in your pocket, your phone chirps again. 

&gt;”Anon?... ;^;” 

&gt;You respond. 

“Sorry, was getting dressed. I’m fine though.” 

&gt;For some reason the difference between your texting style and hers catches your eye. Hers irks you a little bit, for whatever reason. 

&gt;”U sure?” 

“Yeah, I’m sure.” 

&gt;“Okai. do u wanna come over later?” she sends, before sending another. ”We can smash ;D” 

&gt;You roll your eyes at the message. 
&gt;This girl was probably the best person you knew at Smash Brothers, which you admittedly never played much. She always won when it was you she was up against. 
&gt;You go ahead and text back. 

“Not even on your birthday, sport.” 

&gt;”Nonny, come onnnnnnn…” 

“I might be down. Depends on if I get overtime again or not tonight.” 

&gt;”oh, okai. if u wanna just text mi first.” 

“K. I gotta head to work now. ” 

&gt;”byyyyeeeeeee c: “ 

&gt;You put your phone in your pocket, throw on your jacket, and grab your keys before heading out to your car. 
&gt;You’re not sure if you’ll take up May’s offer. 
&gt;The girl was sweet and all, but honestly you weren’t sure how up to it you were tonight. 
&gt;Then again, maybe you could use some vidya and booze… 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt;You did end up getting overtime, not that it really surprised you.
&gt;The shift was painfully dull too, and you were beat. Beat, and sad from earlier. 
&gt;It’s close to midnight when you finally clock out. 
&gt;You make it to your car and finally power your phone back up. 
&gt;Two missed calls from May around 10. No texts. 
&gt;You go ahead and call her. 
&gt;She picks up after four rings. 

&gt;”There you are, asshole! I thought you were ignoring me,” she giggles. 

&gt;You chuckle. 

“Sorry about that, May. My phone was off.” 

&gt;”Did your boss hold you over again?” 

“Yep.” 

&gt;”God, what a dick!” 

“At least it’s money. You still down to Smash?” 

&gt;You smile as you say that last part and hear her giggle again. 

&gt;”Of course I am, Nonny~” She says in that seductive voice she used on her video livestreams. “I’ve been waiting for you all night~.” 

&gt;You’re certain she can tell you’re blushing, as she begins giggling once more. 

&gt;”I’m just teasing, Nonny. Don’t go potato on me.” 

“God you’re a bitch.” 

&gt;”But you looooove me!” 

“Sure I do, kiddo. I’ll be over in twenty minutes or so.” 

&gt;”Heh, okay. See you then!” 

&gt;She hangs up, and you put your phone in your cup holder. 
&gt;You could already tell tonight was gonna be interesting. 


&gt;May simply calls for you to come in when you knock on the door. 
&gt;Her apartment is dark save for the television illuminating the living room. 
&gt;She’s laying on the couch, headset on and controller in hand, intensely focused on some shooter game you can’t name. 
&gt;You’d stopped by the gas station and gotten some junk food earlier, and you go ahead and toss a bag of chips at her. 
&gt;She jumps when it hits her, making her forget to release the grenade she was cooking and it go off in her characters hand. 
&gt;The red panda lets out a huff of annoyance and chucks the bag back at you. She misses. “You dick! I nearly had that checkpoint!”

“Was this so important you couldn’t answer the door?” 

&gt;”Yes!” 

“You’re a terrible host.” 

&gt;You nudge her legs. 

“Scoot.” 

&gt;She crosses her arms and spreads out on the couch more. “No.” 

“Okay then.” 

&gt;You go to sit on her legs, which gets her to quickly move them. 
&gt;With a smirk you put an arm over the back of the couch. 

“The fuck are you playing this for anyways? I thought you wanted to Smash.” 

&gt;”Aww, are you eager, Nonny?” She teases, her fluffy tail waving in your face. 
&gt;You bat it away.

“You wish.” 

&gt;Dodging a little swish of her tail, you grab the plastic bag holding your food and lay it out on the small coffee table that’s cluttered with her other shit. 
&gt;You see the girl at least already got the booze out. 
&gt;May goes ahead and starts up Smash Brothers. 

“I’m not letting you win this time.” 

&gt;You try to sound determined but she merely smiles. “We’ll see.” 

&gt;You spend a solid hour trying to destroy her at Smash Brothers, but you just can’t beat her. Not once. 
&gt;She even tries going easy by using Dr. Mario, and you still lose. 
&gt;Next you go against in her CoD. That you fare somewhat better at, though she is still pretty hard to pin down and kill at times. 
&gt;It eventually devolves to a mere game where every time one of you dies, the loser has to take a shot. 
&gt;Around 3 am, the both of you have grown tired of games and are pretty buzzed. 
&gt;She sets down her controller and you suddenly feel her lean against you, her head on your shoulder.

“May, I-I…” 

&gt;You what? What do you even need to say? Or want to? It’s not like you didn’t want this. Hell, you could use the attention right now. 
&gt;The red panda merely smiles and works her claws with a little more pressure, getting you to take a sharp breath as your shudder.

&gt;Oh lord, that voice…it made the hair on your neck stand on end. 
&gt;You were getting close though. Each stroke made the pressure at the base of your cock grow more and more. 
&gt;You nod, your face alight with blush. 
“Y-yeah..” 

&gt;May’s smile grows and she takes you back into her mouth, now sucking harder and going faster, taking most of your length with each suck. 
&gt;Your toes curl from the pleasure. You won’t last long like this. 
&gt;And you don’t.

&gt;You cum hard, and it shoots down the back of her throat. 
&gt;Once your orgasm dies down she licks your cock clean before coming off of it and wiping at her mouth. 

&gt;”Gosh…you came a lot…” 

&gt;You give a shy laugh. 

“Heh…Arlene was never…she never was that good at giving head.” 

&gt;May climbs back up on the couch next to you, and turns your head. 

&gt;”Poor Nonny…” she teases, before giving you a deep kiss. “Don’t worry…I’ll make sure you don’t get so pent up again~.” 

&gt;Her words make your heart race a little. 
&gt;You could definitely get used to this.
