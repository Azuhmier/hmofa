        <textarea class="textarea">&gt;Today&#039;s been hectic
&gt;You&#039;ve heard that humans are often sought out as mates by anthros, but this is ridiculous
&gt;The moment you step out the door, and you&#039;re tripping on bitches
&gt;The damn wolf twins from upstairs were sniffing around your apartment door
&gt;Again
&gt;They&#039;re lucky the door opens inwards and not out
&gt;&quot;Aw look sis, he&#039;s falling for us.&quot;
&gt;You almost puked at how horrible that was
&gt;&quot;How quaint... Now if only he could lead us the way home. Maybe offer us a bone or two...&quot;
&gt;You don&#039;t have time for this
&gt;&quot;Ella. Emma. Fuck off.&quot; you say sternly, standing up and dusting yourself off
&gt;&quot;With you? Of course...&quot; Ella responds, giving a seductive look while pawing at her groin
&gt;Eugh
&gt;After locking the door and ignoring their nonsense, you leave for work
&gt;Not a few steps down and you&#039;ve caught someone&#039;s attention
&gt;&quot;Hey there, skinny.&quot;
&gt;The grey cat girl, Jannie
&gt;Wearing nothing but a bathrobe
&gt;Course
&gt;&quot;What&#039;s got you in such a hurry, sweet-stuff? Not gonna gimme a pretty smile before ya go?&quot; she says with a smirk, resting on her shoulder against the door frame of her apartment
&gt;You grunt and continue down the stairs
&gt;&quot;Pssh, you&#039;re missing out!&quot; she yells down the stairs
&gt;Just got to go through the lobby, nothing more can ha-
&gt;&quot;YOU.&quot;
&gt;Jesus Christ on a pogo stick
&gt;A big fucking bear is in the way
&gt;AND she has completely bare
&gt;&quot;MAKE LOVE TO ME.&quot; she commands sternly, her voice vibrating the floor beneath you
&gt;Fuck this shite
&gt;After a half hour of tense negotiations, running, and interpretative dance moves, you finally worm your way out of the building to your car
&gt;By the time you arrive at the offices, you&#039;re already late
&gt;Someone&#039;s standing outside of your cubicle
&gt;Probably to discuss your frequent tardiness
&gt;&quot;Hey, Anon. Ms. West called for you, she wants you in her office now.&quot;
&gt;You&#039;ve run out of negative things to mutter under your breath
&gt;You enter her office, sitting down in the empty chair in front of her desk 
&gt;A thick stack of papers obscure most of her form, only her head is visible 
&gt;She gives you a cold stare behind the thin reading glasses perched on her snout 
&gt;&quot;Mr. Anon... You are aware that this is the tenth time you&#039;ve been late this week?&quot; she says 
&gt;&quot;Yes mam, I am.&quot; 
&gt;Removing her glasses and setting them aside on the table, she continues her steely gaze 
&gt;&quot;Mr. Anon, I&#039;m not sure what is keeping you from arriving on time, but in this line of work, I expect workers that respect their job, the company, and their fellow workers. Being late only tells me that you don&#039;t treat this position as seriously as the model worker does.&quot; 
&gt;She closes her eyes and rubs the spot on her snout where her glasses once were 
&gt;&quot;By all means, you would have been fired the third time you were late. Not so many other administrators are so forgiving.&quot; 
&gt;Subsiding her emotionless stare, she glances at the stack of papers 
&gt;&quot;I believe that you can make up for your mistakes, Mr. Anon. I have a... proposition for you, if you can want to call it that.&quot;
&gt;She gently pushes the intimidating, heavy stack of papers towards you 
&gt;&quot;To make up for your late arrivals, I have two offers. You can either format and fill out all of these forms before you clock out. Or...&quot; 
&gt;She pushes the stack of papers to the side, revealing her torso 
&gt;She&#039;s wearing normal, black business attire with a white undershirt and black jacket, the jacket not buttoned together and the undershirt revealing ample amounts of cleavage, with hints of a black bra peeking over the shirt 
&gt;&quot;We can discuss another way to... deal with this problem.&quot; she finally says, still giving an emotionless tone and expression despite the lewd indications
&gt;&quot;What would be your choice, Mr. Anon?&quot; 
&gt;Needless to say:
&gt;You had to work overtime to finish the papers
&gt;It wasn&#039;t until 11 PM that you finally returned to the apartment complex 
&gt;The lobby and leading hallways on each floor are dead silent, each of their residents either asleep or doing something else at this dead hour 
&gt;Upon arriving at your floor, you spot two furry bodies asleep at the foot of your door 
&gt;It&#039;s the wolf twins 
&gt;One of them has their paws down their pants to their groin 
&gt;No wait, it&#039;s down the other twin&#039;s pants 
&gt;Gross 
&gt;Unlocking the door, thankfully without waking the sleeping twins, you step over them and finally enter your home 
&gt;You hang your coat and take off your shoes, then place your keys on the counter near the door 
&gt;A single light illuminates your home, shining from the living room 
&gt;Softly, you walk to the living room, your socks reducing the noise made on the carpeted floors 
&gt;A lit lamp sits atop a small table next to a recliner, it&#039;s back facing the hallway you walk in from 
&gt;Over the seat, you can spot black hair and hear the sounds of soft snoring 
&gt;You quietly walk to the front of the recliner 
&gt;A shrew mole sleeps in the chair, who is no taller than the seat itself, and has a book laid face down on her lap 
&gt;You bend over so your face nears her own 
&gt;And kiss the side of her snout
&gt;She awakes in a shake, rapidly blinking her tiny eyes before calming down 
&gt;&quot;Hey Mura, I&#039;m home.&quot; you whisper
&gt;&quot;Oh, Anon...&quot; she responds, pausing to yawn. &quot;You&#039;re home late.&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Yeah. I had to finish up some extra work... Arrived late again.&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Again? Honey, you gotta...&quot; she says, yawning once more. &quot;...gotta get there on time... You don&#039;t want to lose it.&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Yeah, yeah...&quot; you start, yawning in response to her own. 
&gt;&quot;Want to head to bed?&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Nnn... Yeah.&quot; she murmurs, placing the book next to the lamp 
&gt;You head to your dark bedroom, quietly undressing down to your boxers before lying down in bed 
&gt;Through the darkness, you can see the form of Mura walk into the room, the claws of her toes clicking and clacking loudly against the wooden floor 
&gt;Slowly, she makes her way to her side of the bed and climbs in, burying herself underneath the covers 
&gt;A few minutes pass until you hear Mura softly ask, &quot;Anon?&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Mmn?&quot; you grunt 
&gt;&quot;Do... Do you mind if we cuddle?&quot; 
&gt;&quot;Of course, it&#039;s no problem.&quot; 
&gt;Mura shuffles through the covers closer to you, stopping once her hair makes contact with your skin 
&gt;You lay on your side and wrap your arm over her, pulling her close to your chest 
&gt;Her soft hair, reminiscent of a large teddy bear, and warm body is soothing on your bare skin, easily warming you far faster than the covers could 
&gt;The back of her feet touch your knees despite not being pulled back, her short stature still evident to you 
&gt;Mura releases a satisfied sigh and quietly mumbles &quot;Thanks Anon...&quot; 
&gt;Not more than five minutes and she&#039;s fast asleep again 
&gt;Her rhythmic breathing pushes and pulls the fur of her back repeatedly against your chest, like a wave of calming, pleasant heat upon your skin 
&gt;Your eyelids feel heavy as drowsiness overtakes you 
&gt;And soon, you fall asleep, feeling much like Mura 
&gt;Comfy, content, and peaceful</textarea>
