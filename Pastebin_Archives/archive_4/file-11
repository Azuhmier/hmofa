I see what’s really going on in that mind of yours, and the things it says….”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She puts on a mocking pouty face, running a finger along your brow.</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Things like, ‘Why doesn’t anyone reciprocate my kindness? Why can’t I be rewarded now and then? Why can’t I get the girl?’ My dear Anon…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She gives you a gentle pat on the head</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”That’s what I’m here for. You just want a little validation for all your hard work.

None of them lasted through the night. You won’t be different.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your consciences step up to the challenge</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And even if they fail, you’re determined to make your final night everything you’ve wanted out of a relationship</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Starting with an actual relationship</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sember clocks an eyebrow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”…What do you mean?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You quickly tidy up around the place and offer the hellhound a spot on the sofa</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You certainly like to take your sweet time preparing,” Sember says. “Very well, a little bit of intimacy on the couch before we toss aside the cushions and…oh.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You pull out the remote and begin flipping through the channels for something for the two of you to watch</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her tiny wings flitter as she sets her plump backside next to you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I don’t suppose you’re trying to find something…mmm, pornographic to get in the mood, are you?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Well, there’s an animated movie about dogs and heaven that seems oddly appropriate right now</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You manage to disarm her with the cartoon, at least until the commercial break</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stand up to get a drink and she’s right there in front of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Such a wasteful boy,” she chides. “You would ignore the opportunity just waiting before you? If it’s a drink you want, all you need to do is ask. Or rather, simply take it.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sember folds her arms under her buxom chest and lifts her breasts up</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Did they just get bigger?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You just don’t understand, do you? I have limitless arcane power under my command. I can be any shape you want me to be. I can indulge any fetish you have. No woman will EVER satisfy you like I can.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She’s so far up on her toes trying to shove her cleavage in your face that she’s practically on the points of her nails</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Something clicks within you from hearing her words</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She claims to have “limitless power”,

class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Never would you imagine you’d be the one playing hard-to-get</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s almost a thrill just to have that kind of desirability</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sember follows you around your apartment for the rest of the evening</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Watching what you want, eating what you offer (even if it does nothing for her), waiting patiently outside of the bathroom for you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Kind of a missed opportunity for her there, but you suppose even succubi have some courtesy</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;When it’s time for you to turn in for the night she perks up a bit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Finally, a devious romp under the covers?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You crawl into bed and leave some room for her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She slips in with you, instantly bringing the room up to a soothing warmth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have to watch the horns as she nuzzles

body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It feels incredible to have someone in your bed, in your embrace</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sember keeps trying to turn you on with sensual rubs and squeezes, but all it does is make you even more relaxed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She stares at you in anticipation until you drift off to sleep</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have an uninterrupted night of wonderful rest</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Honestly, you were half expecting to have your soul taken overnight</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;After all, you DID accept her offer of companionship in some way</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But Sember’s still there, still staring at you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Not needing to sleep, waiting to pick up where you left off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Rise and shine, handsome,” she says. “I see SOMETHING has already taken the initiative…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel a silky tail wrap around your morning wood</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your resolve withers, but you untangle yourself and launch out of bed before you can cave in</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sember follows you around once again, into the shower (guess courtesy has its limits) and into the kitchen for breakfast</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have to head to work soon, and you ask if she’ll be here for you when you get back</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s a devilish grin on her muzzle as you leave the apartment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Of course,” she hums. “You have a good day, Anon.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Except she never truly leaves you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hints of the hellhound intrude your thoughts and visions throughout the day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her silhouette is in the shadows</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her voice is in the radio and in the ambient chatter of pedestrians around you</div></li><li class="li1"><div

something else</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It surprisingly makes the day go by so much faster than usual, having so many distractions to keep you from the anger you have toward some of the costumers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Is this her doing as well, as a way to get you home sooner?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before you know it you’re already walking back to your apartment after a productive day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The moment you get inside you see Sember reclining on the sofa</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Steam trails from her nostrils, and her slender digits dig into her nethers with the help of that spaded tail</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”A-ah, it’s just not the same,” she laments. “I can’t find release on my own. Oh! There’s my savior!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She saunters over to you, licking the juices from her paw</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’ve been thinking about you all day.

Let’s see what Anon has brought home for me.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Actually, you were thinking about ordering in the food tonight</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her eye twitches</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Ha ha, still the funny one. You’ve been extremely resilient so far, but it’s only a matter of time before the desire overwhelms you.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s a little hurtful how much she underestimates you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You get Sember to join you in some more television, some games, and some cheap takeout</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She never misses a chance to slip in some innuendo or lewd poses</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You continue to keep her sexual advances at arm’s length, while pulling in the hellhound’s more subdued companionship</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her frustration is evident, but at the same time she’s more than ready to join you in whatever activity you choose</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She wants you, but she can’t reject what she doesn’t quite want out of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Before long Sember’s going through the motions she predicts you’ll do</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She walks into rooms before you and follows you into bed without pushing the idea of copulation any further</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She converses with you when spoken to and listens intently when you talk about your day</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her only opposition to you is the occasional remark of, “How about now?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even that becomes less and less frequent, like a child slowly learning they won’t get their way</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can’t deny her beauty, but you become desensitized to the temptation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s almost been a week since Sember came into your life</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You offer her the remote so she can choose what to watch tonight</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She takes it into her paw and crumples it like a sheet of paper</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”That’s ENOUGH!” she roars</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The lights flicker and dim</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Gone are the eloquence and enticement in her voice</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re hoisted up and pulled against her bosom, her nipples feeling a little more like mini daggers right now than soft nubs of flesh</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”No man has ever been able to hold out for more than a night, let alone several DAYS!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There aren’t enough fire metaphors to cover just how livid she is</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Why won’t you fall for me?

What ARE you!?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Isn’t it as she said?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Can’t she into your thoughts?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She knows everything she can about you already</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re just a generous Anon who’s probably a little too nice for his own good</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You wrap your arms around Sember, rubbing a spot on her spine between her little bat wings</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”No, NO!” she cries. “You aren’t supposed to resist me! You aren’t…”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She tries to wriggle out of your hold, but it looks like being a servant of the flesh doesn’t let you escape a hug that easily</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She lets out a choked sob</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You aren’t supposed to treat me like this!

It’s just lust and m-meaningless sex!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even her tail wraps around you to keep the bond together</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her fur is divinely soft</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Instead of a copious amount of perfume you reckon she’d have, she smells like the smoky air of a cool autumn evening around a bonfire</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If this is her trap, it worked</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You feel yourself give in at last, squeezing her tight and telling her you’re ready for her</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even if it means losing your soul</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Your whole existence is based on trying to please others, and now when you try to make yourself happy it just ruins someone else’s life</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Or afterlife, rather</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sember gasps and pulls away</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Little specks of sapphire drip from those ruby eyes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Just like that? You’d give up your soul…after all that?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s not an easy choice, but here you are</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You brace for her to drop the act and laugh at you; “GOTCHA!” she’d shout</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;But Sember doesn’t look happy or even relieved at your decision</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She looks scared</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”No…no, don’t.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her paws grab your arms, shaking you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Anon, listen to me. I’m sorry for what I tried to do. You can find happiness…you can find LOVE on your own. Don’t throw your soul away just for a one-night stand.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stare at the hellhound, and for a moment you can look past the horns, the brands, the wings</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You think you can imagine her as what she once was, before she became a succubus</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Was she always even a dog?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I have to live with my regrets every single day, until the end of days.

I’m sick of it!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She shakes her head and places a paw on the back of your neck</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You don’t really want to lose your soul, do you?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even your consciences are silent</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A pang of anguish grips your heart</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;If you can’t get a moment of rapture out of sin, then what’s going to keep you going through your life of misery?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;…</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Everyone else</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s what you’ve known all along: even if people don’t always show their gratitude for what you do, they depend on you to keep THEM going</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You have your role, your purpose</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even if it’s maybe a bit selfish to think so highly of yourself at times</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Nobody’s without flaw</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;No, you can’t give up your soul</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As soon as you state your answer Sember clasps a paw over your mouth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Say no more,” she breathes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The hellhound backs away to the center of the room and snaps her fingers</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There shouldn’t be such an echo with the acoustics of your apartment, but there is</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Appearing from a much larger blaze, green and black, is a massive goat demon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A terrifying image of a decaying, heart-stopping avatar of the underworld</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Wearing a pretty spiffy pantsuit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Sember, darling!” the she-goat trills</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Mahbaph,” the hellhound greets in return</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I must say I’ve been a little worried about you,” Mahbaph says. “You usually have the poor humans wrapped around your finger within a few hours.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The goat demon looks to you with a smile, showing a little more bone in her face than just from her teeth</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”This must be Anon. I have to confess he doesn’t look the type to be so elusive. What’s your secret, hmm?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You try to show a polite gesture, but Sember cuts you off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Anon can’t be tempted by me. I’m done with this, Mahbaph.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The goat demon lets out a sweltering sigh</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I suppose everyone has their bad days. You’ve had a flawless record thus far, so we can assign you to some other mortal and-“</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sember stomps her foot, jiggling her breasts and flapping her wings</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”No, you’re not listening to me. I’m done with all THIS!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She motions to her demonic body</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even her spaded tail seems to point out all the accessories you wouldn’t find on a non-succubus dog woman</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Tsk tsk,” the goat demon says. “Sember, honey, I’m afraid you’ve signed away YOUR soul for this kind of opportunity. I’m happy to overlook a small blemish on your performance history, but that shouldn’t be reason to throw in the towel now.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Don’t play coy with me, Mahbaph! We had an AGREEMENT!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;A scroll burns into existence in the hellhound’s grip</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It unfurls in midair to show a contract inked in a magical glow</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I didn’t want to give myself up either,” Sember continues, “but I did because you assured me a chance to go back to living a normal life if this didn’t pan out. You promised to give me my soul back if I ever found a man I couldn’t charm.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mahbaph smoothens out her pantsuit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”But did you really give it your all? Sure, this Anon is a little trickier to crack than all the others, but I’ve bestowed upon you everything you could need to enthrall even the most stubborn of victims.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”That’s beside the point!” Sember barks. “You said I’d be so irresistible that I wouldn’t need ANY of your black magic! That was the DEAL!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Deal</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;That single word lingers like it were the secret to life</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like a much-needed password to the world’s toughest lock</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Like a ringing bell heralding in a chorus of angels</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And here they come, all white robes and hallelujahs</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;An angelic female Greyhound and two male Doberman bodyguards with swords, immaculate golden fur and broad platinum wings, stand in opposition of the goat demon</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s starting to get a little crowded in your apartment</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Ah, Elbelle,” Mahbaph seethes. “I’m surprised to see you here.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You shouldn’t be,” the heavenly dog replies. “You know full well I intend on intervening whenever you feel the need to renege on a contract.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The bodyguards slam their swords down in affirmation</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There goes your security deposit</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You offer your guests a drink to calm the tension</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two larger-than-life women refuse, but the bodyguards begin panting when they see bottles of sparkling water in your fridge</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Guess they still like their earthly pleasures now and then</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As they chug the drinks Elbelle looks at the bottles longingly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I don’t suppose you have one in strawberry?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;One left</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Oh, heavens, I couldn’t accept it then. That’s really the last of it?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You insist, handing her the bottle</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”My scouts have been right about you, Anon. You’re quite the generous individual.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”So, Elbelle,” Mahbaph interrupts, “you claim to have issue with the way I run my domain?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I always do,” the angel says. “I respect the sanctity of the treaty between our realms as much as needed, but you have shown flagrant neglect of your own associates’ rights. If you are not willing to uphold a bargain with THEM, how can we trust you to uphold one with US?</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Mahbaph folds her arms, unamused</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”This sounds like you’re attacking my authority. Do you not trust me to pay my dues?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Trust is an entirely different matter, Mahbaph. However, as much as I loathe to keep a tally on acts of kindness, you have not reciprocated many of our tokens of good faith. So many souls who could have been redeemed, handed over to you on your word they would serve better under your rule.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The two women face off, neither one showing weakness</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Alright, Elbelle,” the goat demon says at last, “what would you like from me?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Again you choose to ignore my lectures, Mahbaph. I want nothing from you except to uphold your end of the agreement. If Sember indeed has a reason to terminate a contract with you, I wish to see it respected.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’ve been so focused on the dueling demigods that you almost forgot about Sember</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;So it’s a bit shocking when you realize you’ve been holding her paw for the last several minutes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You can tell Mahbaph is holding back anger, but it’s tempered by a prideful desire to save face</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You will force no such decision from me. I will honor the pact I have with Sember of my OWN accord.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She turns to the hellhound and materializes her own copy of the contract</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;It’s shredded to ribbons and engulfed in cinders</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Your service to me is terminated, sweetie. You’ve done a fine job under my leadership, and so I will even let you keep your powers as…a ‘severance package’ of sorts.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The goat demon gives a curt bow and a wicked smile that looks even more horrifying than any look of malice you could imagine</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”My door is always open to you, Sember, should you ever reconsider your employment to me.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She implodes into ash, returning to the underworld</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Elbelle takes a sip from her beverage before approaching you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I’m elated to see things resolve as they have. You have done well to stave off Mahbaph’s wiles, Anon. Speaking of which….”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Greyhound turns to the hellhound</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”We can proceed to remove any traces of your demonic taint and give you a more…ah, ‘presentable’ appearance to fit in with the humans.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You stand between the two canines, shielding Sember from the angel</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Anon…” Sember says</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You tell Elbelle you love Sember for how she is, horns and all</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Elbelle’s brow lifts up to the heavens</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”So I see. Well, it’s not my place to judge others for what they find pleasing.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I still have my shapeshifting magic, evidently” Sember says, draping herself over you. “It shouldn’t be too difficult to fit in with Anon’s world.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The Greyhound nods and cradles her bottle</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Very well. I shall have some of my scouts check in now and then to make sure Mahbaph isn’t meddling in your lives. Enjoy your newfound companionship. Sember. Anon.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;The angels disappear in a flash of light and a ringing of chimes</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Now it’s just you and Sember</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She spins you around and hugs you from the front</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Don’t think I didn’t hear what you said, handsome. ‘Love’.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She snickers quietly</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”Of course you’d love me for how I am. I was supposed to entice you with this. I’m this way because of YOU.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;All the while she speaks you’re dancing and twirling with her in the direction of your bed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”But to hear that word come from you when I started to think you wanted nothing to do with me…Anon, you’ve made me so happy. I….”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then she notices the bed</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;And your sheepish smile</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her muzzle pulls back into a knowing smirk</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”You son of a bitch. You goddamn BASTARD. The second I get my soul back and you don’t have to worry about losing yours, and you’re finally ready to fuck me. After all I went through….”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sember pushes you onto the bed and straddles your hips</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;With a snap of the fingers she dissolves your clothes off</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”I was going to give you ceaseless pleasure and full control. You could have done anything you wanted to me, no objections.”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her spaded tail wraps around your neck, and the tip jabs you on the nose</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”But now that I have my freedom, you’re going to help me with decades worth of pent up heat. YOUR. SOUL. IS. MINE!”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;As if on cue, you’re drawn to full erection</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She rubs her slick lips over your shaft, coating it in what feels like lava</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Hot hot hot!</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Even your pulse surges with fervor, but nothing compares to the inferno of her womanhood as she eases down on top of you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;”How long has it been,” she asks herself, “since I’ve done this for MY needs?”</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;She begins pumping on top of you, digging in her claws and licking her lips with that forked tongue</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;You’re sure that thing’s probably going in your mouth (or worse) before the end of the night</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Her tail remains coiled around your neck, but instead of being constrictive it seems to control your breathing for you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every inhale stokes your arousal to its maximum</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s a hellhound of your own inside of you, wrenching your body away with its dominance</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Every buck and thrust and moan is out of your hands</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;There’s no way to tame the beast in you, even if you had any intention to</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Sember growls and snarls as she bounces over you</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Whether her powers slip out of her own control or she’s just being experimental, her figure transforms</div></li><li class="li1"><div

class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp;</div></li><li class="li1"><div class="de1">&gt;Then you feel the caress of a paw on your chin, lifting your head up</div></li><li class="li1"><div

Enter Sember: a succubus canine who fully agrees with him and has a very tempting proposal to give.

&gt;”Hey Anon, could you cover my shift on Thursday?”
&gt;”Anon! Car’s in the shop. Can you drive my grandma to the hospital?”
&gt;”Mr. Anon, will we still be seeing you at the fundraiser next weekend?”
&gt;Your phone is like the punch line to a joke only you know
&gt;Every day you work at a cafe biting your tongue and serving customers who never show the least bit of gratitude
&gt;Every night you’re bombarded with requests from people who know you’re so willing to help them no matter what
&gt;You’re the nice Anon, the generous Anon, and it’s always to your detriment
&gt;You even gave up the last box of a much-anticipated gaming system just because the father who was next in line looked on the verge of tears
&gt;You often feel as though you have two consciences on your shoulders like some kind of cartoon cliche
&gt;One’s an angel urging you to do the right thing
&gt;The other’s an angel threatening you to do the right thing
&gt;Your life is nothing but unrequited good deeds, all done in spite of what you know the outcome will be
&gt;But it’s a vicious cycle of altruism
&gt;Doing good feeds into what little pride and happiness you have left, but the resulting payoff saps all your energy and optimism
&gt;So you try to do better to fill the increasing void, and it keeps repeating
&gt;This is your life and your role in the world

&gt;You return to your cramped, lonely apartment after another agonizing day at work
&gt;You can feel your phone warming up to the barrage of messages it’s getting ready to spring on you when you’re most relaxed
&gt;After a few minutes, it really DOES feel like it’s warming up
&gt;Overheating, even
&gt;Phew, the whole place is roasting
&gt;Did you somehow kick the heat on accidentally?
&gt;Your apartment becomes a furnace, and your vision blurs
&gt;You need to find some way to cool down
&gt;A full-body chill of fear works fine as a pyro erupts in your living room
&gt;When it subsides, nothing looks burned at all
&gt;Except for the smoking-hot figure perched atop the coffee table
&gt;It’s…a two-legged female dog?
&gt;Her jet black fur is so short it might as well be her natural skin, and brands of crimson are tattooed all over her body
&gt;She has ruby eyes and a pair of curved, sharp horns beside her pointed ears
&gt;She’s further accessorized with two petite bat wings and a whippy, spaded tail
&gt;Overall she&#039;s a bombshell, molded from the perfect formula of curves and proportions
&gt;And completely nude
&gt;She’s posed up on her toes as though wearing invisible heels, head tilted seductively at you
&gt;”Hell~o, Anon,” she purrs. When her dark lips part you see sharp fangs and a long, forked tongue
&gt;Her voice reverberates in your skull, as though her echoes are whispered into your ears
&gt;She is, without a doubt, a succubus
&gt;And a hellhound
&gt;She steps down from the table right in front of you
&gt;You don’t remember being so close to her, but you realize you had subconsciously walked toward her at the same time
&gt;”My name is Sember…and I’m here to offer you an eternity of excitement and pleasure.”
&gt;A single, perfectly manicured claw points to your jugular and traces down your torso
&gt;”I’m sure you’re no stranger to how this kind of thing works, handsome,” she continues. “I will give you a taste of what I can offer you for the rest of time itself, and then you will give me your soul without a second thought.”
&gt;You see Anon in the reflection of her eyes
&gt;Or maybe it’s Anon’s soul already locked away under her power?
&gt;Maaaybe you should just take things slow for now?
&gt;The hellhound giggles
&gt;”Whatever floats your boat along the river Styx. We have all night together, so we can start with a little foreplay, if that&#039;s your wish.”
&gt;Sember leans in with a dreamy look on her face, puckering up for an incoming kiss
&gt;Her eyes snap open when her lips collide with the side of your hand
&gt;You had stopped her advance with a very “Three Stooges” type block
&gt;”W-huh?” she says, looking at you in bewilderment
&gt;You have to be honest, you were kind of hoping a kiss would be a little more romantic
&gt;Something that has a story behind it
&gt;”Alright, here’s a story,” she says. “I’m here, you’re there, then I KISS you. Happy?”
&gt;This should be a perfect fantasy for you, but something’s stopping you from handing over your eternal soul
&gt;Maybe some part of you still feels like you’re not deserving of such attention?
&gt;That you’ve given so much of yourself away already that happiness is meant for everyone else?
&gt;Sember cackles, lighting up her eyes and body markings
&gt;”Oh, ANON…you can lie to yourself until the sorrow eats you hollow, but you can’t lie to ME. I see what’s really going on in that mind of yours, and the things it says….”
&gt;She puts on a mocking pouty face, running a finger along your brow.
&gt;”Things like, ‘Why doesn’t anyone reciprocate my kindness? Why can’t I be rewarded now and then? Why can’t I get the girl?’ My dear Anon…”
&gt;She gives you a gentle pat on the head
&gt;”That’s what I’m here for. You just want a little validation for all your hard work. That’s not selfish, it’s just human nature.”
&gt;But her words still sting; she’s completely right
&gt;You do what you do because there’s some hope within you that someday everything you want will be handed to you, just for being the charitable, obedient person you’ve toiled as all these years
&gt;And yet, that’s not what you want to become
&gt;You don’t want to be jaded, or cynical, or expect compensation for everything
&gt;You take her paw in your hands to stop her from getting a little too touchy
&gt;It’s definitely fur you feel, but it&#039;s a velvety layer that numbs your senses with softness
&gt;”I’ve taken the souls of dozens of men,” she says. “Some chaste, some pious. None of them lasted through the night. You won’t be different.”
&gt;Your consciences step up to the challenge
&gt;And even if they fail, you’re determined to make your final night everything you’ve wanted out of a relationship
&gt;Starting with an actual relationship
&gt;Sember clocks an eyebrow
&gt;”…What do you mean?”

&gt;You quickly tidy up around the place and offer the hellhound a spot on the sofa
&gt;”You certainly like to take your sweet time preparing,” Sember says. “Very well, a little bit of intimacy on the couch before we toss aside the cushions and…oh.”
&gt;You pull out the remote and begin flipping through the channels for something for the two of you to watch
&gt;Her tiny wings flitter as she sets her plump backside next to you
&gt;”I don’t suppose you’re trying to find something…mmm, pornographic to get in the mood, are you?”
&gt;Well, there’s an animated movie about dogs and heaven that seems oddly appropriate right now
&gt;You manage to disarm her with the cartoon, at least until the commercial break
&gt;You stand up to get a drink and she’s right there in front of you
&gt;”Such a wasteful boy,” she chides. “You would ignore the opportunity just waiting before you? If it’s a drink you want, all you need to do is ask. Or rather, simply take it.”
&gt;Sember folds her arms under her buxom chest and lifts her breasts up
&gt;Did they just get bigger?
&gt;”You just don’t understand, do you? I have limitless arcane power under my command. I can be any shape you want me to be. I can indulge any fetish you have. No woman will EVER satisfy you like I can.”
&gt;She’s so far up on her toes trying to shove her cleavage in your face that she’s practically on the points of her nails
&gt;Something clicks within you from hearing her words
&gt;She claims to have “limitless power”, but she isn’t completely forcing herself on you
&gt;The hellhound isn’t going to take your soul until you willingly give it to her
&gt;Never would you imagine you’d be the one playing hard-to-get
&gt;There’s almost a thrill just to have that kind of desirability
&gt;Sember follows you around your apartment for the rest of the evening
&gt;Watching what you want, eating what you offer (even if it does nothing for her), waiting patiently outside of the bathroom for you
&gt;Kind of a missed opportunity for her there, but you suppose even succubi have some courtesy
&gt;When it’s time for you to turn in for the night she perks up a bit
&gt;”Finally, a devious romp under the covers?”
&gt;You crawl into bed and leave some room for her
&gt;She slips in with you, instantly bringing the room up to a soothing warmth
&gt;You have to watch the horns as she nuzzles your neck
&gt;”So, when do we start?” she says
&gt;You wrap an arm around her, enjoying the heat of her body
&gt;It feels incredible to have someone in your bed, in your embrace
&gt;Sember keeps trying to turn you on with sensual rubs and squeezes, but all it does is make you even more relaxed
&gt;She stares at you in anticipation until you drift off to sleep

&gt;You have an uninterrupted night of wonderful rest
&gt;Honestly, you were half expecting to have your soul taken overnight
&gt;After all, you DID accept her offer of companionship in some way
&gt;But Sember’s still there, still staring at you
&gt;Not needing to sleep, waiting to pick up where you left off
&gt;”Rise and shine, handsome,” she says. “I see SOMETHING has already taken the initiative…”
&gt;You feel a silky tail wrap around your morning wood
&gt;Your resolve withers, but you untangle yourself and launch out of bed before you can cave in
&gt;Sember follows you around once again, into the shower (guess courtesy has its limits) and into the kitchen for breakfast
&gt;You have to head to work soon, and you ask if she’ll be here for you when you get back
&gt;There’s a devilish grin on her muzzle as you leave the apartment
&gt;”Of course,” she hums. “You have a good day, Anon.”
&gt;Except she never truly leaves you
&gt;Hints of the hellhound intrude your thoughts and visions throughout the day
&gt;Her silhouette is in the shadows
&gt;Her voice is in the radio and in the ambient chatter of pedestrians around you
&gt;Her voluptuous curves dance in the foam of the lattes you brew at the cafe
&gt;Every time you blink you can see a little more of her in something else
&gt;It surprisingly makes the day go by so much faster than usual, having so many distractions to keep you from the anger you have toward some of the costumers
&gt;Is this her doing as well, as a way to get you home sooner?
&gt;Before you know it you’re already walking back to your apartment after a productive day
&gt;The moment you get inside you see Sember reclining on the sofa
&gt;Steam trails from her nostrils, and her slender digits dig into her nethers with the help of that spaded tail
&gt;”A-ah, it’s just not the same,” she laments. “I can’t find release on my own. Oh! There’s my savior!”
&gt;She saunters over to you, licking the juices from her paw
&gt;”I’ve been thinking about you all day. I trust you can say the same about me?”
&gt;You nod
&gt;”I thought so. Let’s see what Anon has brought home for me.”
&gt;Actually, you were thinking about ordering in the food tonight
&gt;Her eye twitches
&gt;”Ha ha, still the funny one. You’ve been extremely resilient so far, but it’s only a matter of time before the desire overwhelms you.”
&gt;It’s a little hurtful how much she underestimates you
&gt;You get Sember to join you in some more television, some games, and some cheap takeout
&gt;She never misses a chance to slip in some innuendo or lewd poses
&gt;You continue to keep her sexual advances at arm’s length, while pulling in the hellhound’s more subdued companionship
&gt;Her frustration is evident, but at the same time she’s more than ready to join you in whatever activity you choose
&gt;She wants you, but she can’t reject what she doesn’t quite want out of you
&gt;Before long Sember’s going through the motions she predicts you’ll do
&gt;She walks into rooms before you and follows you into bed without pushing the idea of copulation any further
&gt;She converses with you when spoken to and listens intently when you talk about your day
&gt;Her only opposition to you is the occasional remark of, “How about now?”
&gt;Even that becomes less and less frequent, like a child slowly learning they won’t get their way
&gt;You can’t deny her beauty, but you become desensitized to the temptation

&gt;It’s almost been a week since Sember came into your life
&gt;You offer her the remote so she can choose what to watch tonight
&gt;She takes it into her paw and crumples it like a sheet of paper
&gt;”That’s ENOUGH!” she roars
&gt;The lights flicker and dim
&gt;Gone are the eloquence and enticement in her voice
&gt;You’re hoisted up and pulled against her bosom, her nipples feeling a little more like mini daggers right now than soft nubs of flesh
&gt;”No man has ever been able to hold out for more than a night, let alone several DAYS!”
&gt;There aren’t enough fire metaphors to cover just how livid she is
&gt;”Why won’t you fall for me? Are you some kind of demon planted here to test me? Are you an angel sent to mock me? What ARE you!?”
&gt;Isn’t it as she said?
&gt;Can’t she into your thoughts?
&gt;She knows everything she can about you already
&gt;You’re just a generous Anon who’s probably a little too nice for his own good
&gt;You wrap your arms around Sember, rubbing a spot on her spine between her little bat wings
&gt;”No, NO!” she cries. “You aren’t supposed to resist me! You aren’t…”
&gt;She tries to wriggle out of your hold, but it looks like being a servant of the flesh doesn’t let you escape a hug that easily
&gt;She lets out a choked sob
&gt;”You aren’t supposed to treat me like this! I’m a succubus! You’re supposed to f….”
&gt;Your hand guides her head to your shoulder
&gt;The hellhound’s ears fold back, and she weeps
&gt;”Nobody s-shows me genuine affection. It’s just lust and m-meaningless sex!”
&gt;Even her tail wraps around you to keep the bond together
&gt;Her fur is divinely soft
&gt;Instead of a copious amount of perfume you reckon she’d have, she smells like the smoky air of a cool autumn evening around a bonfire
&gt;If this is her trap, it worked
&gt;You feel yourself give in at last, squeezing her tight and telling her you’re ready for her
&gt;Even if it means losing your soul
&gt;Your whole existence is based on trying to please others, and now when you try to make yourself happy it just ruins someone else’s life
&gt;Or afterlife, rather
&gt;Sember gasps and pulls away
&gt;Little specks of sapphire drip from those ruby eyes
&gt;”Just like that? You’d give up your soul…after all that?”
&gt;It’s not an easy choice, but here you are
&gt;You brace for her to drop the act and laugh at you; “GOTCHA!” she’d shout
&gt;But Sember doesn’t look happy or even relieved at your decision
&gt;She looks scared
&gt;”No…no, don’t.”
&gt;Her paws grab your arms, shaking you
&gt;”Anon, listen to me. I’m sorry for what I tried to do. You can find happiness…you can find LOVE on your own. Don’t throw your soul away just for a one-night stand.”
&gt;You stare at the hellhound, and for a moment you can look past the horns, the brands, the wings
&gt;You think you can imagine her as what she once was, before she became a succubus
&gt;Was she always even a dog?
&gt;”I have to live with my regrets every single day, until the end of days. But the greatest hell I feel is knowing I let people like you be taken by my corruption. I’ve seen it happen dozens of times. I never get any satisfaction from it in the end. I’m sick of it!”
&gt;She shakes her head and places a paw on the back of your neck
&gt;”You don’t really want to lose your soul, do you?”
&gt;Even your consciences are silent
&gt;A pang of anguish grips your heart
&gt;If you can’t get a moment of rapture out of sin, then what’s going to keep you going through your life of misery?
&gt;…
&gt;Everyone else
&gt;It’s what you’ve known all along: even if people don’t always show their gratitude for what you do, they depend on you to keep THEM going
&gt;You have your role, your purpose
&gt;Even if it’s maybe a bit selfish to think so highly of yourself at times
&gt;Nobody’s without flaw
&gt;No, you can’t give up your soul
&gt;As soon as you state your answer Sember clasps a paw over your mouth
&gt;”Say no more,” she breathes
&gt;The hellhound backs away to the center of the room and snaps her fingers
&gt;There shouldn’t be such an echo with the acoustics of your apartment, but there is
&gt;Appearing from a much larger blaze, green and black, is a massive goat demon
&gt;A terrifying image of a decaying, heart-stopping avatar of the underworld
&gt;Wearing a pretty spiffy pantsuit
&gt;”Sember, darling!” the she-goat trills
&gt;”Mahbaph,” the hellhound greets in return
&gt;”I must say I’ve been a little worried about you,” Mahbaph says. “You usually have the poor humans wrapped around your finger within a few hours.”
&gt;The goat demon looks to you with a smile, showing a little more bone in her face than just from her teeth
&gt;”This must be Anon. I have to confess he doesn’t look the type to be so elusive. What’s your secret, hmm?”
&gt;You try to show a polite gesture, but Sember cuts you off
&gt;”Anon can’t be tempted by me. I’m done with this, Mahbaph.”
&gt;The goat demon lets out a sweltering sigh
&gt;”I suppose everyone has their bad days. You’ve had a flawless record thus far, so we can assign you to some other mortal and-“
&gt;Sember stomps her foot, jiggling her breasts and flapping her wings
&gt;”No, you’re not listening to me. I’m done with all THIS!”
&gt;She motions to her demonic body
&gt;Even her spaded tail seems to point out all the accessories you wouldn’t find on a non-succubus dog woman
&gt;”Tsk tsk,” the goat demon says. “Sember, honey, I’m afraid you’ve signed away YOUR soul for this kind of opportunity. I’m happy to overlook a small blemish on your performance history, but that shouldn’t be reason to throw in the towel now.”
&gt;”Don’t play coy with me, Mahbaph! We had an AGREEMENT!”
&gt;A scroll burns into existence in the hellhound’s grip
&gt;It unfurls in midair to show a contract inked in a magical glow
&gt;”I didn’t want to give myself up either,” Sember continues, “but I did because you assured me a chance to go back to living a normal life if this didn’t pan out. You promised to give me my soul back if I ever found a man I couldn’t charm.”
&gt;Mahbaph smoothens out her pantsuit
&gt;”But did you really give it your all? Sure, this Anon is a little trickier to crack than all the others, but I’ve bestowed upon you everything you could need to enthrall even the most stubborn of victims.”
&gt;”That’s beside the point!” Sember barks. “You said I’d be so irresistible that I wouldn’t need ANY of your black magic! That was the DEAL!”
&gt;Deal
&gt;That single word lingers like it were the secret to life
&gt;Like a much-needed password to the world’s toughest lock
&gt;Like a ringing bell heralding in a chorus of angels
&gt;And here they come, all white robes and hallelujahs
&gt;An angelic female Greyhound and two male Doberman bodyguards with swords, immaculate golden fur and broad platinum wings, stand in opposition of the goat demon
&gt;It’s starting to get a little crowded in your apartment
&gt;”Ah, Elbelle,” Mahbaph seethes. “I’m surprised to see you here.”
&gt;”You shouldn’t be,” the heavenly dog replies. “You know full well I intend on intervening whenever you feel the need to renege on a contract.”
&gt;The bodyguards slam their swords down in affirmation
&gt;There goes your security deposit
&gt;You offer your guests a drink to calm the tension
&gt;The two larger-than-life women refuse, but the bodyguards begin panting when they see bottles of sparkling water in your fridge
&gt;Guess they still like their earthly pleasures now and then
&gt;As they chug the drinks Elbelle looks at the bottles longingly
&gt;”I don’t suppose you have one in strawberry?”
&gt;One left
&gt;”Oh, heavens, I couldn’t accept it then. That’s really the last of it?”
&gt;You insist, handing her the bottle
&gt;”My scouts have been right about you, Anon. You’re quite the generous individual.”
&gt;”So, Elbelle,” Mahbaph interrupts, “you claim to have issue with the way I run my domain?”
&gt;”I always do,” the angel says. “I respect the sanctity of the treaty between our realms as much as needed, but you have shown flagrant neglect of your own associates’ rights. If you are not willing to uphold a bargain with THEM, how can we trust you to uphold one with US?
&gt;Mahbaph folds her arms, unamused
&gt;”This sounds like you’re attacking my authority. Do you not trust me to pay my dues?”
&gt;”Trust is an entirely different matter, Mahbaph. However, as much as I loathe to keep a tally on acts of kindness, you have not reciprocated many of our tokens of good faith. So many souls who could have been redeemed, handed over to you on your word they would serve better under your rule.”
&gt;The two women face off, neither one showing weakness
&gt;”Alright, Elbelle,” the goat demon says at last, “what would you like from me?”
&gt;”Again you choose to ignore my lectures, Mahbaph. I want nothing from you except to uphold your end of the agreement. If Sember indeed has a reason to terminate a contract with you, I wish to see it respected.”
&gt;You’ve been so focused on the dueling demigods that you almost forgot about Sember
&gt;So it’s a bit shocking when you realize you’ve been holding her paw for the last several minutes
&gt;You can tell Mahbaph is holding back anger, but it’s tempered by a prideful desire to save face
&gt;”You will force no such decision from me. I will honor the pact I have with Sember of my OWN accord.”
&gt;She turns to the hellhound and materializes her own copy of the contract
&gt;It’s shredded to ribbons and engulfed in cinders
&gt;”Your service to me is terminated, sweetie. You’ve done a fine job under my leadership, and so I will even let you keep your powers as…a ‘severance package’ of sorts.”
&gt;The goat demon gives a curt bow and a wicked smile that looks even more horrifying than any look of malice you could imagine
&gt;”My door is always open to you, Sember, should you ever reconsider your employment to me.”
&gt;She implodes into ash, returning to the underworld
&gt;Elbelle takes a sip from her beverage before approaching you
&gt;”I’m elated to see things resolve as they have. You have done well to stave off Mahbaph’s wiles, Anon. Speaking of which….”
&gt;The Greyhound turns to the hellhound
&gt;”We can proceed to remove any traces of your demonic taint and give you a more…ah, ‘presentable’ appearance to fit in with the humans.”
&gt;You stand between the two canines, shielding Sember from the angel
&gt;”Anon…” Sember says
&gt;You tell Elbelle you love Sember for how she is, horns and all
&gt;Elbelle’s brow lifts up to the heavens
&gt;”So I see. Well, it’s not my place to judge others for what they find pleasing.”
&gt;”I still have my shapeshifting magic, evidently” Sember says, draping herself over you. “It shouldn’t be too difficult to fit in with Anon’s world.”
&gt;The Greyhound nods and cradles her bottle
&gt;”Very well. I shall have some of my scouts check in now and then to make sure Mahbaph isn’t meddling in your lives. Enjoy your newfound companionship. Sember. Anon.”
&gt;The angels disappear in a flash of light and a ringing of chimes
&gt;Now it’s just you and Sember
&gt;She spins you around and hugs you from the front
&gt;”Don’t think I didn’t hear what you said, handsome. ‘Love’.”
&gt;She snickers quietly
&gt;”Of course you’d love me for how I am. I was supposed to entice you with this. I’m this way because of YOU.”
&gt;All the while she speaks you’re dancing and twirling with her in the direction of your bed
&gt;”But to hear that word come from you when I started to think you wanted nothing to do with me…Anon, you’ve made me so happy. I….”
&gt;Then she notices the bed
&gt;And your sheepish smile
&gt;Her muzzle pulls back into a knowing smirk
&gt;”You son of a bitch. You goddamn BASTARD. The second I get my soul back and you don’t have to worry about losing yours, and you’re finally ready to fuck me. After all I went through….”
&gt;Sember pushes you onto the bed and straddles your hips
&gt;With a snap of the fingers she dissolves your clothes off
&gt;”I was going to give you ceaseless pleasure and full control. You could have done anything you wanted to me, no objections.”
&gt;Her spaded tail wraps around your neck, and the tip jabs you on the nose
&gt;”But now that I have my freedom, you’re going to help me with decades worth of pent up heat. YOUR. SOUL. IS. MINE!”
&gt;As if on cue, you’re drawn to full erection
&gt;She rubs her slick lips over your shaft, coating it in what feels like lava
&gt;Hot hot hot!
&gt;Even your pulse surges with fervor, but nothing compares to the inferno of her womanhood as she eases down on top of you
&gt;”How long has it been,” she asks herself, “since I’ve done this for MY needs?”
&gt;She begins pumping on top of you, digging in her claws and licking her lips with that forked tongue
&gt;You’re sure that thing’s probably going in your mouth (or worse) before the end of the night
&gt;Her tail remains coiled around your neck, but instead of being constrictive it seems to control your breathing for you
&gt;Every inhale stokes your arousal to its maximum
&gt;There’s a hellhound of your own inside of you, wrenching your body away with its dominance
&gt;Every buck and thrust and moan is out of your hands
&gt;There’s no way to tame the beast in you, even if you had any intention to
&gt;Sember growls and snarls as she bounces over you
&gt;Whether her powers slip out of her own control or she’s just being experimental, her figure transforms
&gt;You can feel the shifting of her rump and thighs on your body
&gt;You can see her breasts shape to your ideal tastes
&gt;Her horns seem to curl and grow, and her wings flap to full size
&gt;Now there’s a gust of steaming air creating a vortex of pheromones and sex in your apartment
&gt;Her nails never break the skin, but somehow the claws burrow past your corporeal shell and sink into your essence
&gt;Your soul
&gt;It’s Sember’s now
&gt;You relive every moment when you were away from her the past week: you see her everywhere, you hear her everywhere…
&gt;You can feel her, taste her
&gt;Every noise you make is just you saying her name over and over again
&gt;Sember
&gt;Sember
&gt;SSSSEMBER!
&gt;You should have blown your load by now, especially with how much she’s milking you with those heated insides of hers
&gt;No doubt she’s denying you your climax until she’s good and ready
&gt;”A-Ano~on~on!” she moans
&gt;There’s an ominous pressure building
&gt;You’re so done with fire metaphors by this point, but dammit if you can describe the sensation any way other than an escalating volcano
&gt;You’re drenched with sweat, and between your slick body and the swirling gales in the room you’re actually feeling a chill
&gt;You want Sember’s warmth
&gt;You NEED it
&gt;You’re BEGGING her for it
&gt;She clamps down onto you roughly
&gt;Her tail’s a collar made to get you to sing
&gt;With a trembling plea you call out to her one final time
&gt;And the volcano erupts
&gt;You can feel yourself drain into her with your release
&gt;Your orgasm throbs in every fiber of your being
&gt;The fires within Sember are quelled, or rather they’re pushed up through her own body
&gt;As the orgasm hits, her muzzle belches a gout of flame
&gt;The fire is the last thing in your vision before it’s wiped
&gt;You see nothing except white light
&gt;You hear nothing except the sounds of your own heartbeat
&gt;…
&gt;Welp, you’re dead
&gt;You’ve obviously passed on and you’re stuck in limbo now
&gt;If this is how you’re going to go out, you wouldn’t have it any other way
&gt;The light darkens, and your heartbeat subsides
&gt;Silence
&gt;Stillness

&gt;Then you feel the caress of a paw on your chin, lifting your head up
&gt;You can see again
&gt;It’s Sember, leaning over you with those wild ruby eyes and running her tongue over her fangs
&gt;”Oh no, not yet,” she chuckles
&gt;”What did I tell you? ‘Decades worth’. We’ve only gone a couple of minutes now.”
&gt;She leans in to nuzzle your face, and you grab her horns with shaky hands
&gt;”And in case you were wondering: yes. I love you too, Anon.”
&gt;Your mouths interlock for a passionate kiss
&gt;Ack, here comes the tongue!

&gt;You come home from another day of work with an ear-to-ear grin
&gt;You’ve been promoted, and no amount of obnoxious customers or needy coworkers can get to you
&gt;Sember’s illusions continue to keep you company throughout the day, reminding you of what’s waiting at home for you
&gt;Even the hellhound is in good spirits
&gt;Her own conscience has been cleared ever since her liberation from Mahbaph
&gt;Seems the goat demon is a bit of a poor sport when she doesn’t get her way
&gt;In an effort to purge the underworld of any trace of the rogue succubus, Mahbaph also released all the souls collected by Sember over her tenure
&gt;”They will eventually return to the cycle of life and find peace, either in reincarnation or the afterlife,” one of the dog angels reassures you
&gt;Oh, yeah, those guys are also hanging around too
&gt;You find your apartment occupied on most days by the white-robed canines
&gt;It started out as periodic inspections to make sure your life with the hellhound was going smoothly, but now they’re here for a different reason
&gt;Apart from drinking all your sparkling water, that is
&gt;Next to your bed is a “nurse” angel poking and prodding the titanic swell of Sember’s stomach as the hellhound lies on her side
&gt;Seems not having to fulfill her duties as a succubus doesn’t remove the whole fertility aspect of it
&gt;Or maybe it’s part of the “severance package”; Mahbaph’s last laugh
&gt;Either way, your hellhound lover is borderline incapacitated with the litter of pups gestating inside of her
&gt;Not even her body alteration powers can fully hide her gravid belly or engorged breasts
&gt;There’s gotta be at least a dozen in there, but the angels have sworn to help look after the pups until maturity
&gt;As a gesture of good faith
&gt;And thanks for all the sparkling water
&gt;”Well, Mr. Anon, she continues to show a healthy pregnancy,” the nurse says. “We’ll return tomorrow for our routine checkup.”
&gt;She pats Sember on the stomach
&gt;”Thank you, I appreciate all your help and concern,” Sember says
&gt;The nurse gives a sugary smile at the hellhound’s words
&gt;All the angels vanish with flickers of light and distant bells
&gt;It certainly puts you in a good mood, until you look at Sember’s disgruntled face
&gt;”About fucking time those saintly prudes left! I was about ready to snap a halo in two!”
&gt;She manages to roll herself upright, holding her girth as if keeping herself together
&gt;”Get over here.”
&gt;You walk forward only for her tail to wrap around you like a belt and pin you onto the bed
&gt;Sember’s thighs flex as she lifts herself just high enough to slide you underneath her
&gt;Her belly is right up to your face, radiating heat and showing faint ripples of movement
&gt;”The worst thing you can do to a succubus is ruin her figure. You’re damn lucky I’m not the vindictive type.”
&gt;You can’t recall the last time you’ve voluntarily taken your clothes off, and when you’re in contact with the hellhound you’re almost guaranteed to be in the buff
&gt;You’re left waiting under her bulk, restrained, while she rubs herself in comfort
&gt;”Holy hell do I need this. If it’s not the condescending looks of pity from those devout mutts, it’s their probing fingers almost sending me over the edge!”
&gt;There’s nothing you can see over her rounded middle except her horns, ears, and those gleaming eyes
&gt;But soon you can feel her tail slither around your groin, tugging and rubbing to coax your libido
&gt;”An eternal soul has quite the shelf life,” she says mirthfully, giving her belly a slap
&gt;”I hope those goody-goody angels keep their word about looking after the pups now and then, because we’re going to need a little time alone in that eternity together.”
&gt;There’s no way you can reach Sember’s muzzle like this, so you settle for a kiss on her navel
&gt;She reaches down to take your hands in her paws
&gt;None of the angels combined glows like she does
&gt;You let her be the free-willed (if a little crass) girl she hasn’t seen in forever
&gt;In return, she vents for you so you can focus on the more positive things in life
&gt;And, being the Anon who gives more than he probably needs to, you pay her back in kind by never making her a liar
&gt;Because she’s right: no woman will EVER satisfy you like she can</textarea>
