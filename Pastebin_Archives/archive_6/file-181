>Chana, the slightly chubby cheetah looks at you while you drive the car on to the parking lot of the resort, her eyes filled with concern and a little bit of fear
>”I should be so angry at you for dragging me here, this is so degrading”
>You look at her
>”What do you mean ? This was your idea. All of this was your idea”
>She pouts in faked anger
>”Yeah...but you accepted”
>Sighing you reach over and softly squeeze her chub, she has lost some weight in the last few weeks but she is still your fluffy chubby
>Chana lets out a chirp and slaps your hand, giggling
>You never got about how much they can sound like a bird
>Stepping out you grab your suitcase out of the trunk and start to walk towards the entrance
>Yes, only one
>Chana will not need one, a fact that makes her even more embarrassed
>Before the two of you step through you turn towards her again, watching directly into her green cat eyes
>”Chana...we can still turn around”
>You really mean it, there is no way you will make her uncomfortable
>The cheetah girl stares back before she takes a deep breath and walks through the doors, using her tail to pull you with her
>You smile
>She is really serious about this
>The first you read about the “Venus hotel” was the ad Chana showed you
>An entire holiday resort with a private beach, aiming directly at one crowd of people
>Human-Anthro couples that like petplay
>It is an open secret that petplay is the most common kink in the anthro population while also the one that gets them the  most shame
>So many anthro supremacists like to call out humans for the slave history and so many human supremacists either condemn those relationships or go off the deep end, wanting to bring back slave trade
>So, it is a thin line you walk on
>The “Venus hotel” however took that concept and ran with it
>Every part of it is designed to enhance the pet play part of your relationship
>You have seen the ads, the dog school, the leases and the cages
>Imagine a pet hotel but with anthros
>The entrance hall is pretty tame compared to the ads but if you look closely you can see the small details, like the pretty large cat flap on the door leading to the office behind the desk
>Two bells are sitting on it, waiting for someone to ring them
>One is a simple metal one with “Service” written on it
>The other is covered in red fluff with “Pet” written on it
>For a moment you are uncertain until Chana rings the red bell, smirking at you
>The loud ringing echoes through the room and just a few moments later the cat flap opens
>Out comes a naked dalmatian girl, wearing only a collar
>Chanas jaw drops, she seems to have only noticed the door now
>The dog looks at both of you and crawls around the desk, sitting in front of you
>”Good morning master. How can I help you ?”
>She completely ignores the shocked Cheetah and only talks to you
>”Eahhhhhh...we booked ?”
>She nods and barks once
>She barks
>Barks !
>The door opens again and a human male steps out
>”Ah, welcome to the Venus hotel. I am afraid I am a bit busy right now. Betty, you know what to do”
>The dalmatian nods and walks up to the man, bowing he head while giving you a view of her black pussy
>”May I use the computer Master ?”
>”You may, good girl”
>The male scratches her head which causes her tail to wag and she waits for him to retreat back into the office before she stands up and steps behind the desk
>”Now, welcome from me as well. Please, what is your name Master ?”
>You have a feeling this will be a great holiday
>Chana is still shocked
