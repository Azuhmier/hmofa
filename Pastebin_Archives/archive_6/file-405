A cold and very formal reindeer Holly Anon's supervisor hates Christmas as she doesn't have a special someone and all the Santa related jokes make her mood worse. There's a party at work and Anon drinks more than he should and certain truths slip out. Will Anon be under the mistletoe or under a toilet seat.

>Friday night it's party time
>You got invited to the annual Christmas party
>They were always shit but at least there's booze
>Finally you arrive in the office party room
>Seems like a funeral more than a party
>Everyone seems bummed out for some reason
>They you realise *She's* here. The frosty snow bitch
>She was always so brusk with everybody this time of year
>Everybody would laugh and be merry while she'll be acting like a school teacher
>Maybe it was all the Christmas puns she has to endure this time of year
>Doesn't help her name is Holly
>You spot her putting liter in a bin bag
>She acts like it's over and she's the janitor cleaning up
>You go over to the party pooper she drops the bin bag and looks you up and down
>"Mr Anon is it?"
>She talks like it's work hours
>"Yeah it is and hey, cheer up, its Christmas!"
>The fake smile didn't work, what a buzz kill this woman is
>"Yes. Thank goodness for you to remind me how could I possibly cope without you."
>It's sarcasm but it's better than nothing
>You go to the plastic cups and pour your self some drink
>You offer to Holly but she refuses
>You think to at least try to make the effort to talk to her
>"So any loved ones Holly?"
>"No."
>"..."
>"Err, how about friends?"
>"None."
>You weren't put off you were going to make her talk
>"So, you watch the big reinde- er! I mean game!."
>She scorns practically popping her eyes out at the glare she is giving you
>It will takes some Dutch courage but you can still save it.
>"Sorry you must be sick to death of puns and jokes, I didn't mean to offend, please forgive me
> Her eyebrows return from squinting at you and she actually has a faint smile on her cheek
>"It's alright Anon I'll just blame it on the drink, you can be very mature when you want to be."
>Mission Passed she's talking like a normal co-worker
>Some time passes and you've had a bit too much to drink you start talking and moving without a filter the chat was Holly was quaint and above board witch she seems to enjoy but now, things got more personal....

>Was it the drinks or something else you asked yourself.
>Could it be that you care about her even though she’s cranky all the time.
>Your mind tries to compute but with the alcohol in your body you can’t really think straight.

______________

You drink more and more till the room is practically spinning and your body is a joyful numb
>Suddenly everyone is your best friend and every song is your favourite
>You see her looking at the slow dancers in envy
>You would never would have asked her to dance but in your drunken stupor you wipe your mouth, check your breath and drag your legs to the grumpy wall-flower
