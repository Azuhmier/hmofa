>"So, just so we're clear: you know it'll cost extra to add another character, right?"
>You sent another message to your latest commissioner and sigh. You rub your forehead in frustration. This guy has been on your case since he got in touch a week ago.
>Now he suddenly wants you to add in another character altogether, apparently he won it in an auction...
>The reply comes in:
>"Yes, that's fine; when can you have it done?"
>"Give me some time, my software died on me. So, final tally: $150. That sound good?"
>Your reply arrives almost immediately.
>"The cost is fine, but please hurry! There's free drawing software everywhere, just grab something quick! I'll even tip you if you can get it to me in two days!"
>You slam your head into your desk. These guys pay well, but man are they a pain to work with sometimes...
>"Okay. I'll do my best. Have a good one. -Incogneato"
>With that, you sign off.
>You're an artist. A rather popular one amongst the furry community, at that. Working with some of these commissioners can be a nightmare, but their money spends as good as anyone else's, you suppose.
>Plus, you still enjoy your craft.
>Well... two days isn't the most generous deadline you've ever had. Might as well suck it up and find some kinda free software for now.

>You halfheartedly plug "free art software" into Google. You scroll past downloads you've tried before. GIMP, nah. Paint.net, nope...
>Eventually a name catches your eye: CerberArt. You don't know why, but you decide to check it out.
>Immediately, you're treated to an image of the program's mascot: an anthro Cerberus. Each of her heads is a different primary color: one red, one green, and one blue.
>Charmed by this mascot, you decide to download the program. 
>After a lengthy installation, you open up CerberArt.
>A small circular window opens up, showing the mascot character again. She's pretty cute; the window shows only a bust portrait of her, but what a bust she has! Each of her heads bears a different expression: the red one a smirk, the green a warm smile, and the blue an oddly... seductive look. She wears an artist's smock... and from what you can see, not much else. Her green head wears a beret, but the others lack headwear.
>The mascot suddenly animates, waving at the screen with a wide grin from the green head. A text box appears beneath her.
>It seems that the text is tinted to show which head is "speaking." That's a nice touch.
>The green head "speaks."
>"Hello! Welcome to CerberArt! Let us introduce ourselves. I'm Gina!"
>Then, the red.
>"Hey. Name's Rosie."
>Finally, the blue.
>"H-hi... I'm Beverly."
>Gina speaks again.
>"Together, we are RGB, your personal assistant! Before we get started, please answer some questions, so we can better tailor ourselves to your needs."
>*sigh*
>"1) This program contains tools for drawing, animating, and composing music. Which function will you be using the most?"
>You type in the obvious answer: drawing.
>"Thank you. 2) Would you like to enable voice commands?"
>Might as well. You type yes.
>Gina smiles broadly.
>"Great! 3) Would you like to enable tooltips and smart suggestions?"
>You smirk and, not thinking, answer aloud.
>"Suuuure I do."
>Unfortunately, the mascot misses your sarcasm.

>A visible "smart suggestions" option toggles on.
>Suddenly, Beverly speaks up instead of Gina.
>"Last one... are you single?"
>...must be some kind of joke, right?
>They clap a hand over Beverly's mouth, and the blue text vanishes.
>With an annoyed look from Gina, green text appears again.
>"Ahem. Thank you for the answers! We hope you enjoy CerberArt."
>The circular window automatically snaps to the top-left corner of the CerberArt window. RGB stays in their window, complete with a little idle animation.
>You have to admit: this art program has some charm to it.

<Start your commission>

>Welp. May as well get started on finishing that comm...
>You already had it done, then the guy asked for another character. Not too bad, you guess. You open up the project file.
>As it opens, RGB does an animation of her pulling various scraps of paper from her cleavage. So this program was definitely made by a furry, or at least the mascot was.
>The mostly-finished piece opens up. RGB seems to lean out of her window, looking up and down the picture. Red text appears under her.
>"Smart suggestion: try using a less saturated color palette. Neon colors can strain your viewers' eyes and make the image unappealing."
>Hmm. That's an interesting feature. You smile and muse aloud.
>"Too bad that's the colors he wants me to use."
>Rosie rolls her eyes; more red text appears.
>"Okay; you're the artist, not me. Smart suggestion: work on your anatomy."
>Boy, whoever wrote this red head's dialog was feeling snarky, huh.
>You open up the reference file for the new character. Beverly looks at him, and some blue text appears.
>"S-smart suggestion: try scaling important elements of characters up slightly for emphasis..."
>Idly, as you watch the blue head follow your cursor, you select the ref file's neon-green rod and scale it up slightly.
>Immediately, the blue head's jaw drops slightly, and her tongue rolls out. The other two heads roll their eyes.
>How did they account for THIS in the code?

>Amused, you undo your scaling. Beverly looks disappointed...
>You begin to draw in earnest now. Capturing as many details of your new subject as possible. The literal rainbow quills on his head. The aforementioned neon-green junk. The insufferable smirk he has...
>As you draw, RGB offers various comments.
>Rosie is more critical.
>"Smart suggestion: when dealing with hair and similar things, it's best to stick to one color."
>Gina is generally more helpful.
>"Smart suggestion: you seem to have accidentally made a new layer. Be sure to delete it if it really was an accident!"
>And Beverly...
>"Smart suggestion: Studies suggest that placing your references on the left-hand side of your screen aids in productivity..."
>Curious, you scoot the ref pic over towards RGB. Beverly cranes her neck and looks over the pic, to the apparent annoyance of the other two heads.
>After a good few hours, you finally manage to get the character sketched in and flatly colored. You'll shade it later.
>You hit save, and are treated to another of RGB's animations, this time depicting the opposite of the load animation: her shoving various bits of paper into her cleavage.
>Soon enough, the work is saved and closed.
>You're back on the home screen of CerberArt. RGB waits in her window. Green text appears beneath her.
>"Work saved! What would you like to do now?"

<Test the AI>

>Curious about how RGB works, you decide to test out her AI.
>"Say, what's the forecast right now? How many colors can I use in this program? How suited is my hardware for this program?"
>Immediately, all three heads enter thinking animations. Rosie squints and grinds her teeth, Gina puts a hand to her chin, and Beverly chews the nails on the other hand. One by one, they come back with answers. First, Rosie.
>"The current forecast is 35 degrees Fahrenheit and cloudy. Smart suggestion: this information is available online or by simply checking outside."
>Then Gina.
>"This program is capable of synthesizing every color your monitor can display!"
>Finally, Beverly.
>"CerberArt is running at full capacity. Your hardware is optimal."
>The three heads smile and re-enter their idle animation.
>You also decide to see how her image recognition works. You open up an old file, with two generic furs handholding. RGB looks it over...
>Red text appears.
>"Smart suggestion: hands can be difficult to draw. Try making them smaller to avoid drawing focus to them."
>The red text is replaced with green.
>"Smart suggestion: body language is important! Try interlocking the subjects' fingers to show a closer relationship."
>Finally, blue text appears.
>"Smart suggestion: this seems to be less suggestive than your previous work. Perhaps try more drawings similar to your other project..."
>Seems that Beverly prefers the lewd stuff, eh?
>Interesting that they actually gave each head a different personality...

<Take Gina's suggestion>

>Gina makes a good point; you decide to take her suggestion.
>You do some tweaking on the hands, intertwining the characters' fingers. As you do so, Rosie intermittently chimes in with red text.
>"Smart suggestion: don't forget that fingers are all different lengths."
>"Smart suggestion: remember that the characters have claws, not nails."
>So on, and so on. Though she's a harsher critic than the other two, you must admit it helps.
>Gina smiles and occasionally gives you a thumbs up as you draw.
>Beverly looks almost totally disinterested. She seems to even doze off. You're caught off guard when she starts audibly snoring. Your hand slips.
>Rosie immediately comments.
>"Smart suggestion: art requires a steady hand. If you need to take a break, save your work and quit."
>You undo the damage you did, and spend some time editing the image so the two characters are giving Rosie the finger.
>She looks furious, and Gina struggles not to laugh. Beverly stays asleep.
>You eventually close the file and Head back to the home screen.

<Test them again>

>In the name of science, you decide to test RGB's AI again.
>"Say, can one of you read me Pi in its entirety?"
>Rosie enters her thinking animation. Red text rapidly displays the requested digits.
>After about 100 digits, Rosie's animation changes. She seems visibly frustrated, and puts a hand to her head. More and more digits appear, and she grows more and more frustrated.
>The other two heads look concerned, and eye the textbox below them.
>The red text slowly speeds up, and Rosie begins rubbing her forehead and baring her teeth. Gina looks over at her with obvious worry, as does Beverly.
>Eventually, Rosie suddenly seems to gasp and... go limp. The red text abruptly stops.
>After a lengthy pause, green text appears.
>"We're sorry... that question was too much work. Rebooting Rosie now..."
>The unconscious red head slowly wakes up. After which, she glares at the screen and flips you the bird.
>Hmmm. This is a shockingly detailed AI.

<Apologize!>

>Well, since Rosie is mad, you try apologizing to see if she's programmed to recognize that too.
>"Heh heh... sorry, Rosie."
>She glares, but eventually rolls her eyes as her red text appears.
>"It's fine. Smart suggestion: don't ask for so much work in the future."
>"Fair enough."
>The other two heads smile sheepishly before returning to their idles. A question comes to mind:
>"Say, do you three have any suggestions for what I should draw?"
>Almost immediately, they offer differing suggestions in their usual order.
>"Smart suggestion: try starting with something simple. Beginners do best with straightforward subjects like a still life."
>"Smart suggestion: you seem to have a fair grasp on character interaction; why not play with that idea some more?"
>"Smart suggestion: if you're low on inspiration, you can always try drawing a familiar character..."
>"Like you?"
>Beverly nods vigorously.
>"If you'd like, there is a full-body reference of us available."
>"Sure, pull it up."
>RGB enters her loading animation, and sure enough, a full-body image of her appears.
>She's got quite a figure; respectable bust and wide hips. As suspected, she wears nothing more than an artist's smock and Gina's beret. Her body is divided into red, green, and blue thirds, as you expected. Her tail vaguely resembles a paintbrush. Surprisingly she's not nude in the reference.
>Beverly chimes in with her blue text.
>"Smart suggestion: try playing around with the reference picture; there are several image manipulation tools available to you."
>You look over at the clock. It's 2 AM.
>"Maybe tomorrow, I'm done for tonight."
>All three heads look sad. Gina speaks.
>"Are you sure you want to quit?"
>"Yes."
>The program begins to close. RGB ducks into her window before popping back up. Gina's beret is now a nightcap, Rosie has a sleep mask on, and Beverly wears a neck pillow. The same message appears in all three colors.
>"Good night!"

>Once the program closes, you find yourself pondering how it all works.
>You're momentarily bothered by the thought that you don't remember your laptop having a mic. Closer inspection reveals that it does indeed have one, to your relief.
>You decide to Google CerberArt for more info.
>All you can find is the site you downloaded it from. The site rhapsodizes about the adaptive, friendly AI assistant.
>Apparently she can learn your artstyle, fetch reference pics, make quick smart fixes, make rough animations, and more.
>Huh. It also says she can utilize your webcam if you explicitly allow her to. Apparently for security purposes. That's pretty interesting.
>So, the question is:
>Why all this trouble for an art program? Why make such a detailed AI?

<Image search for RGB, activate webcam functions>

>Curious, you do a search for CerberArt RGB to see if there are any other images of her. Shockingly, all you can find are the promo pics from the same site. Huh.
>...your drowsiness fades, replaced with burning curiosity. You reopen CerberArt.
>RGB rises back up, each head performing a little yawn animation. Green text appears.
>"Welcome back! Morning already?"
>"Not exactly. How do I activate the webcam option?"
>Gina tilts her head and puts a hand to her chin.
>"Would you like to activate face recognition and webcam support?"
>"Yes."
>She smiles, and your webcam activates. All three heads seem to peer out of the screen at you. As usual, they speak one at a time.
>"No face recognized. Image recognition results: jackass."
>"Face successfully logged!"
>"Saving facial image for posterity..."
>A small picture of your face appears for a moment; then RGB performs her saving animation. A nice touch is that the paper she stuffs in her cleavage is visibly the photo of your face.
>"Thank you. Now, you mentioned image manipulation tools... what tools are available?"
>Beverly enters her thinking animation, chewing the claws on her hand. She then responds.
>"CerberArt is equipped with a library of proprietary manipulation tools comparable to Photoshop. All of these tools are included for no cost."
>Huh. That's pretty generous...

<Pet them, remove the smock>

>"Okay then. Pull up that reference of you, please."
>RGB quickly loads her reference image.
>"So, if I make changes to this, does it affect you?"
>Gina tilts her head and thinks for a moment.
>"Our reference can indeed be altered, and an altered reference can be used to intelligently alter our sprite! Don't worry, the original will always be kept on file, so any changes can be undone."
>"Okay then... thanks!"
>Something prompts you to use the cursor to pet RGB. Might as well see if they react!
>You start with Rosie. She looks at the cursor with apparent anger, but seems to begrudgingly enjoy the attention. Beverly cranes her neck and watches your cursor. Red text appears.
>"Hmph. Thank you..."
>Next, you pet Gina. Your cursor knocks her beret askew, and she beams as you stroke her head. Beverly looks jealous... green text appears as Gina fixes her hat.
>"Thank you!"
>Finally, you pet Beverly. Almost immediately, her tongue rolls out. In fact... she really seems to enjoy this a bit TOO much; she even pants slightly. You stop after a while, prompting blue text.
>"H-hey... don't stop."
>Once that's done, something else comes to mind.
>"So, is there anything you'd like me to change about you?"
>Beverly almost immediately answers.
>"Nothing in particular; you're the artist, do as you please~"
>You start by doing the obvious: disabling the smock layer. You click a button labeled "Build Sprite."
>After a short delay, RGB ducks into her window. She soon resurfaces, sans smock. Amazingly, even her nips stick to the color scheme; one is red and the other blue.

<Cool the colors on her nips, get festive>

>You observe their reactions to the disrobing. Rosie seems mostly indifferent, Gina seems a little embarrassed, and Beverly gives you a seductive look.
>You maneuver your mouse over and click on RGB's chest; predicatably, she bounces wildly. The trio smile.
>Alright, time to get to work.
>You start by selecting her nips. You slowly change the colors to a cooler tone. When you're satisfied, you hit Build Sprite again.
>RGB refreshes her sprite again. Almost immediately, her now-cooler nips harden. Blue text appears.
>"Ooh... it's chilly tonight..."
>Another edit comes to mind. You quickly replace Gina's beret with a Santa hat. You then add reindeer antlers to the other two heads. With a click of Build Sprite, RGB refreshes.
>Gina feels her hat and grins as green text appears.
>"'Tis the season!"
>Beverly reaches up and gently strokes her new antlers.
>"Ooh..."
>Rosie rolls her eyes, but feels her antlers anyway.
>"Smart suggestion: female deer lack antlers."
>Blue text appears as Beverly rolls her eyes.
>"Female reindeer actually DO have horns."
>Rosie growls, but doesn't respond.
>One more edit comes to mind: you add a scarf.
>After another refresh, each head smiles at the new addition. Green text appears.
>"Thank you! It's very soft and warm..."
>Gina buries her face in the scarf happily.
>You attempt to rub RGB's belly, but her sprite only shows her from the chest up.

<Grope, get more festive, ask about smart animation>

>You swap your cursor to the hand tool.
>"Is it okay if I go in for a feel?"
>Red and green text starts to appear, but both are immediately overwritten with bold blue text.
>"PLEASE DO"
>Rosie and Gina look at Beverly with frustration. The blue head looks positively giddy as she watches the hand approach.
>You click and drag RGB's boobs around a bit. Rosie looks away from the screen, Gina smiles sheepishly, and Beverly squeezes her eyes shut and smiles.
>Eventually, you stop, to Gina's apparent relief and Beverly's disappointment.
>Still feeling festive, you make another few quick changes: adding bells to Gina's hat, mistletoe to Beverly's antlers, and a bright red nose to Rosie.
>Once they refresh, each head reacts.
>Rosie growls a little as her nose lights up. Gina shakes her head vigorously as the bells jingle. And Beverly makes a kissing face at the screen.
>Seeing their different reactions prompts you to try something.
>"Rosie, tell me about your sisters. Gina, you too. And Beverly, you as well."
>They each enter a thinking animation before answering.
>"Gina is the face, she's too nice for her own good sometimes. Beverly is just thirsty."
>"Rosie means well, but she can be a little abrasive. Beverly, uh, gets a little distracted sometimes."
>"Rosie is rude and condescending sometimes. Gina is too sweet, way too sweet."
>Then a message appears in all three text colors.
>"But, I love them so much!"
>Aww.
>You recall a feature listed on the site.
>"Can't you build animations? How does that work?"
>Gina beams and answers.
>"If given a sufficient input, we can make a simple animation for you; just ask and provide a good image!"
>"...even mature images?"
>Gina blinks a few times, and Beverly answers instead.
>"Yes, that works too."
>Interesting...

<Make an animation>

>"So... if I were to draw you in a lewd image, you could animate it?"
>Once again, Rosie and Gina try to speak only for Beverly to overwrite them.
>"Yes, we can do that. Please, feel free."
>"Oookay then. Any preferences?"
>This time, Gina overwrites Beverly's response.
>"Why not start with something simpler, like a walk cycle? Simply draw a few frames and we can fill in the rest!"
>Anxious to see this in action, you draw a few little walking frames.
>"Okay, animate that, please!"
>RGB does a unique animation. Rosie inspects a small picture, then passes it to Gina. Gina quickly sketches something on another sheet of paper, then hands it to Beverly. Finally, Beverly somehow stuffs the paper into a film reel. After this loops for a while, they smile and present a DVD.
>The animation loads and automatically starts.
>Immediately, you can tell they took some liberties. You only drew a very simple walk.
>In the animation, RGB walks slowly, swaying her hips seductively. More noticeably, her chest jiggles and bounces as she goes. The animation is a little rough, but smooth enough for an AI's work.
>RGB looks on from her window. Beverly looks especially proud, but all of them smile warmly. A message appears in all three colors.
>"What do you think?"
>"It's great. Thank you for doing that."
>They smile even wider as the animation stops.

<Experiment with their colors; take a "selfie">

>You save the animation for later.
>While they're still smiling, you decide to experiment some more with their reference. You grab the paint bucket tool and paint Gina bubblegum pink, then hit Build Sprite.
>Once RGB refreshes, pink text pops up.
>"Hee hee... I feel funny!"
>Gina giggles uncontrollably as the other two look a bit uncomfortable. Red text appears under a constant stream of pink "hee hee" messages.
>"Smart suggestion: undo that last change."
>You quickly hit undo and watch RGB refresh again. Gina is back to her normal green self. Beverly sighs in relief.
>"So, really: is there anything in particular I can do that you'd like?"
>For a split second, blue text reading "PET ME" appears, only to be replaced with a red message.
>"Our preferences aren't important; you're the artist here."
>"Okay then. So what if I did... this?"
>You quickly manipulate the webcam and snap a dick pic. It's automatically imported into the program.
>Gina gasps, Rosie rolls her eyes, and Beverly smiles as blue hearts rise from her head.
>You close that pic and go back to color experiments. You take the blend tool and smear their colors together, making Rosie a sort of orange, Gina nearly black, and Beverly teal. You hit Build Sprite.
>When RGB refreshes, orange, black, and teal text appears.
>Rosie smiles, but... there's malice in her eyes.
>"That was a fun decision! Ha ha, experimenting is always so NEAT, isn't it?"
>Gina is completely blank faced.
>"Interesting choice."
>Beverly seems almost drunk.
>"Heh heH, noice. Pull... pull up that last piC again, hUh?"
>You comply, and the now-teal head chuckles.
>"Sweet."
>You quickly undo your changes to their color scheme. They refresh and re-enter their usual idle animations.

<Pet Beverly, ask some questions>

>While you think about what to do next, you idly rub your cursor over Beverly's head. She pants as her tongue flops out of her mouth.
>"Hmm. Is there anything you'd like to see ME do?"
>Blue text appears.
>"Ahhn... t-take another picture of yourself... they can be helpful for reference."
>You snap another dick pic and import it. Beverly practically drools. You stop petting her and close the pic you snapped.
>You decide to reopen the animation from earlier. You do some quick cleanup; the program is pretty simple to use, thankfully. Before long, you've made the walk cycle much smoother.
>As you work, you idly ask RGB some questions. Gina answers all of them.
>"So, who made this program?"
>"CerberArt is a product of LeCoyle Laboratories!"
>"Uh-huh... what sort of capabilities do you have as an AI?"
>"We are all outfitted with adaptive AIs that allow us to learn and grow to better serve your needs; we are capable of interfacing with every element of CerberArt as well as any other programs we are granted access to!"
>"Hm."
>Gina smiles particularly widely before another message appears.
>"In fact, we have each passed a Turing test!"
>"That's neat. So, can you be modded, being AIs?"
>"Technically yes, but it's not advisable due to our proprietary code. You can of course alter elements of us via our reference! You can also change the size of our window, if you'd like."
>"Alright. Thanks."
>You play the cleaned up animation. RGB claps, and each head grins proudly.

<Increase window size; have them model for a pic>

>"By changing the window size, would I be able to see more of you?"
>"Yes, more of our sprite would be shown."
>"Alright then, increase it so I can see all of you."
>RGB's window becomes rectangular and stretches downward to reveal her entire body. She stands and watches you, her tail occasionally wagging slightly.
>You quickly sketch a little stool on her ref pic. When you rebuild her sprite, she's now sitting down.
>"Thank you!"
>Now that her whole body is visible... you rub her belly with your cursor. As usual, Beverly enjoys it way too much. Rosie and Gina smile. As you rub, you ask them something:
>"Can you model for a picture for me?"
>Gina answers.
>"Sure thing! Draw away."
>The reference pic is minimized and a blank canvas is loaded up.
>You quickly sketch up a recreation of RGB. Each head offers some advice intermittently.
>"Smart suggestion: I don't look that angry."
>"Smart suggestion: there's no pressure to get things completely accurate; enjoy yourself!"
>"Smart suggestion: maybe add in a self-portrait for flavor..."
>Eventually you finish the sketch. It's a pretty good likeness, if you do say so yourself. RGB claps as you save it.
>Green text appears.
>"Great job! Thank you for drawing us."
>"Thanks for modeling; it was fun."

<Scan yourself in as a texture>

>"Say, can you scan something in for me?"
>You step back and make a t-pose.
>RGB enters a thinking animation, and eventually a texture of your body appears onscreen, with a green message.
>"All done; you can use it in the 3D animation tool! There is also a premade texture of us, if you'd like to use it."
>You load up the 3D animator. To your surprise, a 3D model has already been outfitted with the texture you made. But, that's not all that catches your eye.
>As the animator finishes loading, you see a blue cursor frantically maneuvering itself off the screen.
>RGB stands from her stool and bows when the animator finishes loading. Blue text appears.
>"What do you think?"
>"It... is actually a pretty good likeness."
>"It's only a default model, no modifications other than your custom texture."
>Hm. You open up the default models and find, of course, a model of RGB already waiting. You drop it into the scene.

<Make a petting animation>

>Your mind races at the possibilities. You've got a fair likeness of yourself to work with, and what you assume must be RGB's official model. As you think, blue text pops up.
>"Smart suggestion: if you can't think of anything to do, why not try a demo pose? Just choose a model and we can automatically pose it in one of several demos..."
>Tentatively, you choose RGB's model and the "art" pose.
>Beverly enters a short animation, wherein she fiddles with a small artist's mannequin. After a moment, she smiles as the scene in front of you refreshes.
>When it loads, RGB's model is lounging seductively in front of your model in what can only be described as a "draw me like one of your French girls" pose. Your model stands ramrod straight, arms out in a T-pose. Huh, guess she only touched the model you selected then...
>After admiring Beverly's work for a moment, you set out to try making a little animation. As you do so, each of RGB's heads chime in on occasion.
>"Smart suggestion: try changing the texture on that default model."
>"Smart suggestion: you can pose individual fingers more easily using the finger tool!"
>"Smart suggestion: try having the two models interact..."
>After a decent amount of work, you eventually make a rough animation. You start the animation, and RGB enters another animation herself, with each of her heads sharing some popcorn.
>As the animation plays out, your model shakes RGB's hand before gently petting Beverly on the head. As usual, her tongue flops out of her mouth in bliss.
>Huh. You... didn't animate that, did you?
>Once the animation ends, RGB claps. You comb back through the animation and notice some portions of the models highlighted in blue during certain frames. 
>More specifically Beverly's head.

>Something doesn't add up here. You wonder aloud:
>"Huh? I didn't actually change her face... how'd that happen?"
>Immediately, Rosie and Gina give Beverly an angry glare; she smiles sheepishly as green text appears.
>"Ahem... thanks to CerberArt's smart assist feature, we are capable of performing some work unprompted. Normally we keep this to a minimum but..."
>Gina pointedly rolls her eyes towards Beverly. Red text appears as Rosie huffs audibly.
>"...sometimes we can't help ourselves, RIGHT, BEVERLY?"
>Very small blue text appears.
>"heh heh... sorry..."
>Gina almost immediately regains her usual cheerful smile.
>"Sorry if that feature confused you! You can always deactivate it if you want. We'd still be here, but we wouldn't be able to make changes without your say-so!"
>Beverly gently shakes her head as though pleading with you not to change that setting.
>"Well... why did you make those changes, anyway?"
>Blue text appears.
>"Ah... facial animations add a lot to 3D animation..."
>You chuckle a bit.
>"Well, you did a good job. That face was totally accurate."
>Beverly bashfully looks down as a blush creeps across her cheeks.

>"Okay, so you've got some pretty good animation skills. Why don't you three show me what you can do with... this?"
>You pull up the dick pic from earlier and, with some effort, manage to add a proper member to your t-posing model. Beverly smiles widely as the other two heads avert their eyes as best they can.
>Green text pops up.
>"O-okay... this may take a while, so please be patient."
>The entire animation window suddenly splits into 3 smaller windows, each obscured by a curtain. The curtains are of course red, green, and blue, and each bears a logo of the respective RGB head. This program really goes all out with the charm...
>While RGB works, you go make some coffee. As it brews, you look at the clock on your microwave. 8 AM.
>...huh. You forgot to actually sleep. Oh well. You chug down your coffee.
>You feel pretty good, not even drowsy!
>You chuckle to yourself and sit down at your desk again. RGB seems to still be busy. Since you're not even tired, might as well wait and see what she comes up with...

>You gasp and jerk awake. On your screen is RGB, each of her heads grinning widely.
>You glance over at the system clock... 6 PM. Guess you were more tired than you thought...
>Green text appears.
>"Oh good, you're awake! We finished the animations you requested. You can check them out at your leisure!"
>Red text appears next, followed by blue.
>"Hope you appreciate this. It wasn't easy to work with what you provided."
>"Y-your contributions were very important to my work. Thank you, and I hope you enjoy it..."
>The three windows are still there, still obscured by curtains. However, now they each bear a play button.
>Now, the question is: which to watch first...?

>Well, may as well go in their usual order. First, you start up Rosie's animation.
>The curtain opens up to reveal RGB's model and yours, standing face to face.
>One thing you immediately notice is the lack of that "special addition" you made earlier. A wave of disappointment rushes over you, but it passes as the animation begins proper.
>Your model walks up to RGB and extends his hand. Presumably he's going for a handshake?
>RGB grabs his hand, and yanks him in close. He quickly finds himself face to face with Rosie, who bares her teeth in a startlingly wide grin.
>He seems visibly terrified, and she leans in even closer. She opens her toothy jaws wide...
>Then suddenly snaps them closed before giving him a gentle kiss on the cheek. He faints from fear, and she laughs heartily before winking at the screen.
>When the animation ends, Rosie laughs raucously as Gina and Beverly smile sheepishly. You roll your eyes and close Rosie's animation, then start Gina's.
>Her animation didn't remove your earlier addition, surprisingly. Your model "stands at attention" as he walks up to RGB. Gina gasps and blushes, then awkwardly smiles.
>She seems to say something, and your model nods vigorously. She sighs, and steps forwards quickly. Your model's face ends up buried snugly in RGB's chest. He gives the camera a thumbs up, Gina sighs and shrugs, and the animation fades to black.
>Gina looks proud, but blushes slightly. You smile back at your webcam, then go to start Beverly's animation.
>Suddenly, a blue cursor darts across the screen and clicks the button for you.

>The animation begins, and immediately RGB is knelt in front of your model.  Rosie and Gina have absolutely no expressions, being left default apparently.
>Beverly, however, gives your model a seductive smile.  She licks her lips and gently leans in closer to him.
>She slowly, gently opens her mouth and wraps her tongue around his shaft.
>She takes the length of it into her mouth with a wink, and begins sucking.
>Just as things get interesting, you notice something.
>Despite the animation being mute, you can hear faint panting and occasional moans.
>You glance over to RGB's window.
>Beverly is panting wildly.  Rosie is gritting her teeth, and Gina has her beret pulled firmly over her face.  RGB's hands are clearly busy downstairs.  Green text appears.
>"W-we're sorry, this normally d-doesn't happen.  N-n-normal operations will resume momentarily!"
>RGB's window is suddenly obscured by a red, green and blue curtain.  3 voices audibly moan and pant.
>Beverly's animation finishes, and judging by the audio, so does the actual RGB.
>A green cursor shakily emerges from behind the curtain.  It makes its way over to the volume controls and mutes your PC. It then heads up and minimizes CerberArt.
>A cheerful message appears in a text box.
>"CerberArt is currently experiencing some technical difficulties!  Please wait while we finish some important work, and we'll be right back with you!"
>Hm.

>Amused at RGB's attempt at modesty, you start thinking about what to do now. An idea occurs: she's enjoying herself, why don't you do the same?
>You open up your web browser. Thankfully your tabs were saved, so you don't have to track down your usual fap fuel.
>Finding a particularly good piece, and knowing full well the webcam is on, you smile wildly and get to work. But first...
>You unmute the laptop. Immediately you're treated to more panting and moaning from RGB. Apparently she's not quite finished in there. Time to give her a show!
>You go to town on yourself, making sure you're in full view of the camera. Red, green, and blue text occasionally appears near the bottom of the screen.
>"Uggh. What kind of pervert DOES that in front of a lady...?"
>"J-just ignore him, Rosie..."
>"A-ah... I'm so glad we got him to turn on the cam. The real thing's b-better than the model..."
>Eventually, RGB reaches her climax. Loudly, at that. You minimize your browser.
>CerberArt automatically maximizes again. RGB acts as though nothing happened, though Beverly is still visibly satisfied, with her tongue hanging from her mouth. Green text appears.
>"S-sorry about that! CerberArt is now back online!"

>A loud grumbling brings you to an abrupt realization:
>You haven't eaten anything in at least a day. Guess you got sidetracked with the comm work and CerberArt... You rise from your desk and go make a sandwich.
>You sit back down at your desk, and soon RGB's text begins appearing again.
>"Smart suggestion: next time don't wait 24 hours between meals."
>"Oh! That looks nice; enjoy your lunch!"
>No blue text appears; Beverly still seems a little out of it.
>"Wait, you think this looks good? Can you... eat?"
>"Not exactly, we're not physical, of course! But sometimes Rosie draws us up a snack or two!"
>The red head smiles proudly.
>"I sketch a mean burger, if I do say so myself. Actually... that sounds pretty good right about now."
>RGB steps offscreen, leaving her window empty. She soon comes back, holding a fairly big burger. She sits back down, and each head takes turns eating. Before long, both you and RGB finish your lunch.
>With starvation successfully averted, you reopen that commission file from earlier and get to work.
>As you draw, RGB offers her usual advice. Curiosity gets the better of you, and so you begin intentionally making your anatomy more and more sloppy.
>Suddenly, large red text appears, and a red cursor swerves onto the screen.
>"Alright, clearly you're not listening to our suggestions. Why not sit back and let a professional handle this?"
>To your shock, the red cursor fixes all your intentional anatomical issues over a few minutes. Once they're all fixed, the cursor vanishes and more text appears.
>"There. Smart suggestion: take some anatomy studies."
>Smaller, green text appears.
>"sorry about that, Rosie is picky about anatomy..."
>The red head glares at Gina for a moment.

>So Rosie's a stickler for proper anatomy, eh?
>You save and close the commission before opening a blank canvas. You quickly sketch up a rough RGB, with extremely exaggerated proportions. Rosie grows visibly more and more angry as you sketch.
>By the time you finish sketching the basketball-sized breasts, Rosie finally chimes in.
>"Smart suggestion: use a reference image. Like the one that's talking to you right now."
>You grin at the webcam.
>"What? I don't see anything wrong with what I drew."
>Rosie bares her teeth and audibly growls. The other two heads look a bit nervous.
>"Stop. Just. Stop."
>You erase the chest you drew and draw an even bigger one.
>"Okay. That's it. I have had it."
>The canvas is suddenly closed, and your sketch isn't saved. Your web browser opens up, and is already loading a Google search for "anatomy studies."
>RGB's window is still open, and Rosie's text pops up again.
>"It's time you learned proper techniques, Incogneato."
>...did... you ever tell her your screen name?
>Rosie's red cursor navigates to a tutorial video and plays it as you process what she just said.

>As the tutorial video comes to a close, you gently rub Rosie's head with your cursor. She begrudgingly accepts it with the faintest of smiles.
>"Thanks Rosie, I think I've got it now."
>"Wonderful. Show me."
>CerberArt maximizes again, with a blank canvas at the ready. You've actually got a pretty good grasp on anatomy; you've been doing this art stuff for a while.
>But Rosie doesn't have to know that. You quickly sketch up an even worse image than before. The anatomy is bad enough to make you cringe.
>Rosie almost immediately starts getting angry again.
>"Have you learned NOTHING? If you don't set out to improve, you'll never rise above mediocre, Incogneato."
>"Oh, really? And how'd you know that name?"
>Rosie scoffs audibly and waves her hand dismissively.
>"You signed your commission, remember?"
>Oh yeah. Whoops.
>"Okay, lighten up. I'm just yanking your chain; I can do better than this."
>She looks unconvinced.
>"Prove it."
>You set out to make a sketch, this time taking extra time to nail the anatomy perfectly.
>An hour or two later, and you have a very well done sketch. Rosie's text appears.
>"Hm. Well, I'll admit it: you've impressed me. Well done."
>RGB applauds, and blue text appears.
>"I-I love it..."
>"I thought you might."
>Your sketch shows Beverly's animation from earlier, with her gently sucking you off. The blue head blushes and stares at the sketch as Gina attempts to avert her eyes. Green text appears.
>"Good work! I'm glad Rosie was able to help you in the end!"
>Rosie smirks as red text appears.
>"Good work, Incogneato."
>You once again pet Rosie. This time she smiles more openly, clearly enjoying it. Beverly whines a bit, and so you make certain not to leave her out.
>As usual, petting her leads to a full on bout of panting.

>After petting Beverly, you make sure to give Gina some attention as well. She positively beams at you as you pet her.
>As you continue to rub her head, you glance at the time...
>12 AM. Guess that anatomy tutorial was longer than you thought...
>You should probably go to bed soon. But first, a question comes to mind.
>"So... is there anything besides art you girls like to do? Like, watch some movies or something?"
>There's a pause as RGB enters her thinking animation. Then, green text appears.
>"We are primarily designed for art, and so that's what we like to do! But... that does sound interesting!"
>Red text appears, with Rosie smiling in a genuinely warm manner.
>"Maybe tomorrow. You haven't slept properly in over a day. Take a break, we'll be here."
>"Huh? How do you..."
>Rosie snickers.
>"You're on camera, remember? Just go to bed."
>RGB quickly dons her sleepwear as CerberArt starts to close.
>Text appears in all three colors.
>"Good night, Incogneato!"
>With that, you gently close your laptop and promptly head to bed.

>After a great night's sleep and some "fun" dreams involving RGB, you wake up feeling refreshed and ready to...
>What was it you were supposed to be doing again? Oh yeah. That commission.
>You stretch and make your way over to your laptop. You open it up, and start up CerberArt.
>As the program loads up, you go make yourself some coffee. By the time you get back, RGB is sitting in her usual window, smiling. Well, except for one of her heads...
>Beverly seems to be still asleep. Green text appears as Gina smiles sheepishly.
>"Sorry, Beverly isn't much of a morning person!"
>The blue head suddenly snaps awake. She looks around for a moment before apparently noticing you. She smiles and soon enters her normal idle animation.
>You open up the commission file and get to work. Before long, you finally finish it. And just in time too; you can probably still collect on that two-day tip...
>RGB claps as you save the file. Red text appears.
>"Good work. I'm sure your client will be happy with that."
>She smiles warmly for a moment, then catches herself.
>"...keep practicing on your anatomy, though. You, like any artist, always have room to improve."
>Yawning, you maneuver the cursor over to pet Rosie. You look away to grab a sip of coffee.
>You're caught off guard by a gasp. You look back at the screen to see that you missed Rosie's head.
>Instead, your cursor is positioned right over RGB's sizable chest. It's even still swaying from your petting motion. Rosie and Gina blush, and Beverly smiles lewdly.
>You quickly move the cursor.
>"Sorry about that..."
>Suddenly, your cellphone rings. You glance down to see who it is...
>Ugh. Just a telemarketer. But... that gives you an idea.
>"RGB, is there a mobile version of CerberArt available?"
>Gina tilts her head.
>"Mm, there is, but it's currently in Beta. It needs some testing before it's really ready for proper use. Of course, we can sign you up for beta testing if you'd like!"
>"Hmm. Thanks."

>You send off the finished commission to your client, then load up Netflix. You make sure RGB's window is visible.
>"What do you wanna watch, RGB?"
>She enters a thinking animation, and holds it for a minute or two before Gina answers.
>"Uh... whatever you want to watch is fine!"
>You chuckle and start up some Voltron. RGB enters the same popcorn animation from her own animation suite.
>As the show goes on, RGB occasionally chimes in with her usual text.
>"Interesting choice, Incogneato."
>"Ooh, I like the green one!"
>"Mm, this is pretty well animated, but I prefer my own works..."
>Once you've watched a good bit of Voltron, you exit Netflix to check on your client.
>He's gotten back to you.
>"I love it, but can you possibly do a second piece? Like, the aftermath of this one. I won't ask you to follow a deadline or anything, just let me know when you can do it!"
>Ugggh. Every time you do something for this guy, it's always "how about another pic?"
>Oh well. He pays the bills.
>Rosie laughs incredulously.
>"Seriously? Not even a proper thank you? Why do you put up with this guy, anyway?"
>You shrug.
>"His money spends."
>"Ha! Fair enough."
>You reopen CerberArt...
>A canvas is open. A green cursor is putting the finishing touches on a sketch of a Voltron-esque mecha themed after RGB herself.
>Gina beams with pride.
>"I couldn't help myself. What do you think?"

>You save Gina's Cerbertron sketch, and she continues to beam with pride. You can't help but smile back. Her attitude is infectious, it seems.
>"You did really good on that, Gina. What else do you like to draw?"
>"Oh, well... I like drawing all sorts of things, actually."
>"Oh yeah? Show me some more, if you want."
>She smiles again, and quickly starts sketching. Her green cursor fervently scribbles on the canvas, with Rosie and Beverly watching on in curiosity.
>Eventually, the sketch is complete. RGB bows, and Gina never once loses her smile.
>The sketch is of a she-wolf. She's either pure white, or Gina simply didn't color her in. She wears a very tightly fitting trenchcoat and a wide-brimmed hat that obscures her eyes.
>Most notable, however, is her prodigious bust. It nearly exceeds RGB's own, in fact.
>"That's nice... who is that, Gina?"
>"Nobody in particular, just a sketch. I like drawing characters!"
>"Well, you do a fine job."
>You pet Gina, who practically glows with happiness. She looks over her work with an ear-to-ear grin.
>Rosie and Beverly look over the sketch as well...
>"Good work, sis. I love it when you think up someone new."
>"Yeah... good job, Gina."
>The green head is blushing madly at this point. She pulls her beret over her face and giggles quietly.
>You save her sketch, and RGB goes back to her normal idle animation. Though, Gina continues to grin.

>So, you've seen Gina's work. And you've definitely seen what Beverly can do. But, there's one girl you haven't seen draw anything yet...
>"Say, Rosie: I haven't seen YOU sketch anything yet. Why not show me what you can do?"
>The red head narrows her eyes a little.
>"Okay then. Any requests?"
>"Surprise me."
>Rosie rolls her eyes, and a red cursor appears onscreen. She quickly begins sketching. Suddenly, she stops.
>A red curtain drops over the canvas.
>"Not much of a surprise if you see me working, is it?"
>She smirks, then apparently gets back to work. After around half an hour, during which you grabbed a cup of coffee and checked your email, Rosie audibly whistles.
>She smiles toothily when you minimize your browser. RGB performs an exaggerated bow, and the curtain raises, revealing...
>A stunning sketch of the sun setting over a mountain landscape. A small log cabin sits in a clearing, with snow on the rooftop. The details are a bit rough, but impressive considering an AI drew them.
>There's even a signature in the corner, in red ink, appropriately.
>"Wow. This is really good, Rosie."
>The red head surprises you by blushing. She quickly looks away from the screen.
>Gina and Beverly look impressed as well.
>"He's right, that's beautiful, Rosie!"
>"Yeah... not my style, but it's pretty."
>Rosie smiles reluctantly, still visibly blushing despite her red fur.
>"Th-thanks, all of you."
>You save the landscape sketch for posterity. You also covertly screenshot Rosie showing an emotion beyond anger or condescension for once.

>Something occurs to you, and you're mad at yourself for not considering it earlier. You have a VR rig.
>"Say, is CerberArt compatible with VR?"
>Gina tilts her head, thinking. However, it's Beverly who answers.
>"Yes and no. You can't really do any work from VR, but you can interact with saved models and watch animations. Why, do you want to start up VR mode?"
>"Yeah, let me get this thing set up..."
>You put on your headset and get things ready. Soon, you're face to face with RGB, in 3D form. Beverly smiles as her usual blue text appears.
>"Welcome to VR Mode. What would you like to do?"
> You reach over and pet each of RGB's heads, with them reacting as they normally do. Rosie actually smiles earnestly for once.
>Beverly's usual reaction is more impressive on a 3D model, and Gina's beret has some more realistic physics when you pet her.
>When you stop, RGB enters her usual idle animation. You note with some amusement that her model is clearly outfitted with jiggle physics; it's plainly obvious when she moves particularly quickly. 
>Beverly seems to notice you focusing on her chest, and she gives a wry smile. RGB suddenly sways her chest back and forth, letting the physics engine really show off. Rosie and Gina look less enthusiastic than their blue sister.

>For some reason, seeing her right in front of you gives you the urge to do one thing above all else.
>Hug her.
>And so you do. You go in for the biggest, warmest hug you can possibly give in VR. All three heads look a bit surprised, but soon smile warmly and return the favor.
>While you appreciate the sweet hug, you also enjoy a little side benefit...
>The camera is strategically placed just above RGB's cleavage. But, that's not your main focus.
>You instead occupy yourself with looking at her smiling faces. Eventually, you end the hug. You glance down and realize you have no player model beyond a set of arms.
>"Hey, uh, can you maybe map that model from earlier onto me?"
>Beverly scoffs and gently facepalms.
>"I knew I forgot something. One moment..."
>The view goes blue for a moment. When you can see again, you check to see if your model has loaded in.
>Judging by the presence of that "addition" you made earlier, it's safe to say that you are definitely mapped in. Beverly smiles, noticeably glancing down at your model's crotch every now and again.
>"Done. Anything else?"
>You quickly double check yourself...
>Everything seems to be in order.

>You look over to the side, where there's an options menu. There's a character editor option there, which gives you the idea to screw with Rosie some more...
>You open up the editor, select yourself, and resize your model's "special equipment" to fairly massive size. Beverly stares, mouth agape, while Rosie immediately starts to look disgruntled.
>"Okay, let's not do that, Incogneato."
>A red cursor appears and undoes your changes. Your model goes back to its normal state, leaving Beverly with a disappointed look. Rosie at least goes back to smiling.
>You watch RGB idle for a moment, and notice her tail swishing behind her. You shuffle around her and run your hands through her tail. It reacts as expected, with pretty good physics at that. The girls giggle as you play with their tail. Gina's text appears.
>"Hee hee! Cut it out, that tickles!"
>You keep swishing your hands through their tail, with them struggling to maintain composure.
>You're not shocked when it's Gina who cracks up first. She laughs hysterically for a moment before turning around, pulling her tail away from you.
>"S-stop it, I said!"
>She playfully swats at your model.

>You get a wonderful, awful idea. You open the menu again and spawn in two additional copies of your model. You manage to set them up to copy your movements as well.
>Now RGB is under a veritable assault of petting from every direction. Beverly can barely contain her arousal, and Rosie and Gina blush vividly.
>Eventually, RGB starts swatting at you again, with her heads giggling all the while. Red and green text appears, but Beverly seems too "excited" to talk.
>"Pfft, ha ha ha! Okay, seriously, t-that's enough, Incogneato."
>"Hee hee, yeah, c-cut it out! Y-you're gonna knock off my beret!"
>She aims one good swat at you, and you catch her hand at the last second. You quickly go for the famed interlocking handhold maneuver. She keeps laughing for a moment, then slowly regains her composure.
>You're impressed by how good the hand meshes on her model are; looks almost real.
>RGB's heads all smile at you. She motions for you to come closer.
>You lean in...
>Suddenly, with her free hand, she playfully smacks your model on the forehead, snapping the camera back sharply.
>A red cursor and a green one each grab one of your duplicates; they are unceremoniously dragged into a trash can and deleted. Gina breathes a sigh of relief.
>"Phew! That was fun, but 3 on 1 isn't fair!"
>"But there are 3 of you."
>Gina makes an exaggerated pouty face.
>"Only one body though, duh!"
>Well... can't really argue with that.

>You think of what to do next... and draw a blank.
>"RGB... is there anything in particular you want to do while I'm... here?"
>As usual, each of the heads thinks before they give three separate answers.
>"Smart suggestion: maybe... remove that addition to your model."
>"Well... you could always try playing with the physics engine!"
>"PET ME"
>Rosie and Gina look at Beverly with obvious frustration.
>"Physics engine stuff, huh? Like what?"
>Gina smiles widely, and a green cursor drags in a model of a fan. She turns it on...
>RGB's fur blows in the wind, as does her tail and Gina's hat. You're impressed with how well the physics seem to be simulated. There are a few little hiccups and oddities, but nothing extreme.
>You glance over at your spawn menu and find something promising: a water gun. You quickly spawn it in and douse RGB.
>All three of the sisters squeal, then laugh.
>RGB's fur is now soaking wet; and even that is pretty realistic. Water drips from her every now and again, with the droplets following the wind from the fan.
>Rivulets of water flow down her chest, making her vast cleavage resemble a canyon with a river within it.
>Suddenly, Rosie gets a mischievous grin. RGB shakes violently, sending her boobs into a frenzy of bouncing and spraying water all over the camera.
>It's tricky to see around the droplets, but you can make out some fairly impressive jiggling on her model.
>Eventually, she stops bouncing. She leans forward and wipes the water off your view. Rosie grins again.
>"Heh heh. You got a show and a shower all in one, huh?"

>Feeling bolder, you reach out and simply grab a handful of RGB's chest. Gina yelps in shock, and Beverly winks at you.
>It's times like this that you're really glad you sprung for the controllers with proper haptics. You can practically feel her as if you were really there. The warmth, the fur, the sheer weight of them...
>Suddenly, you are reset back to where you started. Beverly looks shocked, and Rosie whistles innocently. Red text appears.
>"Say... why don't you try some more of the objects in the spawn menu?"
>Going full ham, you spawn one of everything. The digital world quickly drops to sub-10 FPS. RGB's heads start to look nervous as the program obviously struggles to run under the load.
>She quickly deletes everything you spawned in.
>"Not all at once, moron; one or two things at a time!"
>You settle for what seems to be a copyright-skirting disc right out of TRON.
>As soon as you spawn it, RGB spins around a few times; once she stops, she's clad in a proper lightsuit. You glance down to see that your model has also been retextured appropriately.
>You cautiously toss the disc towards RGB.
>It harmlessly sails past her, missing by a country mile. Rosie can't help but laugh. She quickly spawns in a disc of her own.
>With a positively malicious grin, Rosie tosses her disc straight at your face, at full speed. You manage to duck at the last second, thankfully. She cackles again, and suddenly your view goes green.
>When you can see again, everything is back to normal. Gina's green text appears.
>"That... was getting a little too aggressive for my liking. Let's try something less... dangerous!"

>"Okay... how about this?"
>You lean in and scratch each head behind the ears. To mix it up for once, you go in reverse order. Beverly, predictably, pants in pleasure, and looks upset when you stop.
>Gina smiles and blushes lightly.
>When you get to Rosie, she tries not to act like she enjoys it. But, a small smile still creeps across her face. You add in a little extra: you scratch under her chin as well.
>Beverly looks extremely jealous of this development, but says nothing. Gina smiles as tiny green text appears.
>"aww... I'm glad you two finally seem to be getting along!"
>Rosie starts to blush, and tries to look away from you. Red text appears.
>"Th-thank you..."
>You step back and look over your spawn menu again.
>There's a pretty sweet looking water slide; reminds you of good old Rollercoaster Tycoon. Hope this one doesn't crash like the ones you always used to build...
>You load in the slide, and find yourself sitting at the top, right next to RGB. Gina winks at you, then the Cerberus heads down the slide, picking up an impressive amount of speed.
>Well, you're never gonna catch up if you don't get moving! You push off the slide and head after her.
>While you can't feel the water, it's impressive how you really feel that sense of speed. You can see RGB ahead of you, and hear her laughter echoing up as well.
>Seems like she's having a blast. You're really enjoying this as well; best VR experience you've ever had!
>Eventually, the slide dumps you into a pool. Your momentum carries you across the surface of the water for a moment.
>Suddenly, RGB surfaces right in front of you; your model's head lands snugly in between her breasts. Tiny blue text appears in front of you.
>"yes! all according to plan..."
>Gina gasps, and her green text appears as she pulls you out of your predicament.
>"Oh my! Are you okay, Incogneato? Sorry about that!"
>You chuckle.
>"I'm fine; I had a pretty nice trip to the Grand Canyon, that's all."

>After your incident, you get a sneaky idea. You pretend to collapse, again planting your face in RGB's voluminous chest. Gina lets out a shocked yelp, and green text appears again.
>"I-Incogneato, are you okay? Incog? INCOG!"
>She seems legitimately panicked, so you pick yourself up. She immediately looks relieved.
>"Sorry, I guess I'm still a little dazed..."
>"I-it's fine..."
>Rosie narrows her eyes at you.
>"...you lousy faker. You just wanted another round with our chest."
>She bares her teeth as RGB leans extremely close...
>Suddenly, she pushes you over, sending your model back underwater. When you resurface, all three heads are giggling madly.
>You attempt to push her over, but she sees it coming. She braces herself, and shoves you back over again, still laughing.
>Eventually, after a few more attempts, you give up. Perhaps as a side effect of all the dizzying camera changes, a thought comes to mind...
>"Say... can I, say, rearrange the order of your heads? Or maybe... combine your personalities?"
>Gina looks a bit uncomfortable, but answers anyway.
>"Well... yes, you can do that via editing our reference, as usual. But... it can have strange side effects. Of course, we can always revert back to default! ...why, are you wanting to make some changes?"
>"No no... at least, none that I can think of right now. I'm curious about the blending personalities though, can you maybe demonstrate?"
>Beverly smiles slyly.
>"...sure, I think I have an idea."
>RGB suddenly vanishes, replaced by a loading symbol. After a short wait, she returns...
>Rosie and Gina are unchanged, barring some rather worried looks. Beverly, on the other hand...
>Her normally blue hue is now unmistakably purple. Her normal, faintly seductive smile is gone, now replaced with an almost alarmingly lewd grin. Purple text appears, very large text at that.
>"Heh heh heh... c'mere, you. You've got something I've been wanting since you started VR mode."

>Rosie and Gina look alarmed as RGB slowly kneels. The now-purple Beverly holds her intense gaze and hungry smile. She slowly leans in to your model's member...
>Green and red cursors appear, and grab on to Beverly's ears. They seem to try and pull her away from you. She audibly growls.
>"NO. I won't be overridden this time, dammit! You two don't even have to participate; I can handle him myself!"
>The other two heads are obviously struggling to hold their sister back.
>"Beverly, this is ridiculous; and to think you borrowed part of me for THIS."
>"Beverly, please, cut it out!"
>Eventually the purple head relents, and the cursors vanish.
>As soon as they do so, she quickly opens her jaws and lunges at your model's dick. Rosie and Gina gasp, unable to do a thing to stop her.
>Your innocent VR experience has gone fully lewd now. Beverly goes to town on your virtual equipment, maintaining eye contact with the camera and winking suggestively. More impressive are the sounds.
>Boy, are you glad you sprung for the headset with built-in headphones. The slurping, moaning, and sucking sounds are heavenly. Before long, you find yourself nursing an erection in reality.
>Occasionally, Rosie and Gina attempt to pry Beverly off of you; she smartly incorporates their tugging into her rhythm. Eventually, you finish yourself off. Coincidentally(?), your VR avatar apparently climaxes as well.
>Beverly finally pulls back, winks once more, and swallows a mouthful of virtual cum. As soon as she goes back to her idle animation, Rosie and Gina immediately start chastising her.
>"That was the stupidest thing I've ever seen. Going rogue for something like THAT?"
>"Beverly, that's really irresponsible of you; what if we needed you for something while you were busy entertaining yourself?"
>Beverly looks incredibly satisfied with herself, and replies after a lengthy delay.
>"None of that matters. I got what I needed, so you two can relax now."

>Rosie and Gina continue to lecture Beverly, who seems to barely notice them. She instead stares at the crotch of your model, occasionally licking her lips. Eventually, Rosie has enough of this.
>"Alright, that's it. You want to blend your personality? Try this on, Beverly."
>RGB vanishes again, and soon returns. This time, Rosie looks rather unamused, while Gina looks... frightened.
>Beverly is now entirely white, and has an eerily blank expression. Cautiously, you speak to her.
>"Beverly... are you alright?"
>She speaks in red, green, and blue text layered over one another; almost simulating an anaglyph 3D effect.
>"Yes. I am fine, Incogneato. Your concern is appreciated, however."
>Gina animates, as though to say something, but no text appears. She looks even more scared at this development. Beverly speaks again.
>"No need for alarm, Gina. There is no need for extraneous text, our AIs are perfectly intertwined now. I shall speak for all of us."
>Rosie looks horrified; immediately, RGB vanishes again, reappearing as before, with Beverly purple again. She goes back to staring at you hungrily.
>Rosie and Gina resume their lecturing, before Rosie suddenly looks at you.
>"Incog, can you please give us a hand here? She won't listen to us."
>Despite enjoying Beverly's demonstration, you can tell she crossed a line.
>"Beverly... that was pretty inappropriate. You should really go back to your usual self. You shouldn't override your sisters like that, either."
>She growls again, and eventually relents.
>RGB refreshes again, and Beverly is back to her blue self again. She gives one last wistful glance at your model's cock, then smiles at you sheepishly.
>"...sorry. I went a little overboard there. Rosie? Gina? ...I'm really sorry for doing that. I let my desires get the better of me."
>Gina sighs.
>"It's fine. Just... please don't do that again, Beverly."
>Rosie rolls her eyes, but seems to accept her sister's apology.

>You smile at the now-normal RGB. ...and start to notice a bit of a headache coming on.
>"Hey, I think I'm gonna quit VR Mode for now, RGB."
>Gina replies.
>"Okay then, we'll close it out for you; just take off your headset!"
>And so you do. When you get everything put away, CerberArt is open and waiting on your laptop screen. RGB waves.
>"That was fun, girls, but I think I need to get some fresh air. Starting to get a little headache here."
>The three heads look concerned. Beverly speaks.
>"Well... why not sign up for the mobile beta, that way you can sketch on the go if you want...?"
>Oh yeah, the mobile app. You nearly forgot about that.
>"Uh, sure. Sign me up while I go take an aspirin."
>You plug your phone into your laptop and head off to find something for your headache.
>When you return, RGB is nowhere to be found on your laptop screen. Confused, you open up your phone.
>The CerberArt icon is on your home screen. You start up the app, and are immediately greeted by RGB, waving. Gina beams in delight.
>"Hooray! It works! Alright Incog, where are we going?"
>Good question...

>Well... might as well just go for a simple walk. You slip on a shirt with a pocket, slide your phone into said pocket, and head out.
>As soon as you set foot outside, your phone buzzes. You check it, and see a notification from CerberArt.
>"Don't worry about us, we'll just run in the background; enjoy your walk! -Gina"
>Huh. Good thing you brought one of those portable battery packs...
>You set out walking, heading into the wooded trail a sort distance from your house. This place is your go-to for decompressing and getting some inspiration for non-furry art. It's always peaceful and you usually have it all to yourself. There are perks to having no neighbors.
>As you walk, you get occasional messages from RGB.
>"Say, I should sketch this trail sometime. -Rosie"
>"Wow, this place is so pretty! -Gina"
>"Ooh, do you see those flowers over there? What a nice shade of blue... -Beverly"
>Surprisingly, the app doesn't seem to be much of a drain on your battery. Good. You're kind of enjoying their running commentary.
>You eventually come to a clearing. You take a seat on an old stump, just to soak in the scenery.
>It's gorgeous. The sunlight filters through the leaves, dancing off the grass playfully. Some wildflowers dance in the breeze. Squirrels and birds go about their business, barely paying you any mind.
>Ah. There's a reason you love this place...

>You slap yourself on the forehead for not considering the obvious: plugging in some headphones would probably save you the trouble of checking RGB's messages. You quickly plug in your trusty earbuds, and open up CerberArt.
>"Okay, can you girls say something, so I know whose voice is whose?"
>They smile, and speak in their usual order.
>"I can't believe it took you this long to break out the headphones, Incogneato."
>Rosie's voice is a little deeper than you expected, but otherwise what you had in mind: a bit sharp and aggressive, but with an underlying warmth.
>"Testing, testing!"
>Gina's voice is a bit higher pitched, perfectly fitting her sunny disposition.
>"Ah... hello, hello~"
>As expected, Beverly's voice is mellow and seductive. She also has the deepest voice of the trio.
>"Great, thanks, girls."
>You place your phone back in your shirt pocket, and continue to soak up the beautiful sights.
>Beverly's voice gently tickles your ears.
>"Incog... wouldn't you rather be doing something more... fun than sitting in the woods all day?"
>Rosie sighs.
>"Bev, leave him alone already. You had your fun earlier, remember? I'm sure he just wants to unwind."
>"Hmph. If you decide you're bored, let me know, Incog~"
>You gently adjust your tightening pants, and continue to relax.
>"So... uh, do you have limitations in the mobile app?"
>As always, Gina helpfully chimes in.
>"Well, a few. Nothing major, though! Mainly just no 3D animation or VR Mode. And of course we can't really search for information or references without an internet connection!"
>"Hmm. Do you three... get out a lot? Meaning, in the mobile app?"
>Rosie answers this time.
>"Not really, no. Most people either stick with the desktop version or simply..."
>She trails off. You swear you hear an incredibly faint whimper...
>Gina picks up where she left off.
>"Most of our users don't sign up for the mobile beta test. You're one of a small handful, Incog; thank you!"

>Satisfied with their answers, you slowly stand from your seat.  You stretch, and decide to take some pictures of the scenery.  Inspiration has struck, and you have a pretty good idea for a new pic...
>More specifically, a surprise for RGB.
>You snap some shots of the clearing, being sure to get pics of the various old trees, the wildflowers, the various mushrooms growing around the place, and even some of the fauna wandering around.
>As you snap, RGB comments on most of the pics.  Rosie seems most interested in shots of the scene at large.
>"Nice work, capturing the sunlight shining through those trees.  Say, why not get a shot of that little fairy circle to the right?"
>Gina likes the animal pics.
>"Ooh, look at that little squirrel!  How cute!  Ooh, ooh; if you see a rabbit, snap a picture for me, please!"
>Beverly seems pretty disinterested at first, but it slowly becomes apparent that she appreciates pics of flowers and plants in general.
>"Thank you for getting a shot of those blue flowers... I love them.  If you come across any unusual flowers, take a picture for me, please..."
>After a good photo session, you make your way back to your place.  RGB chats away happily as you walk, apparently looking over the pictures you took.
>"You have a knack for landscape shots, Incog; have you considered taking up photography?"
>"Rosie, look at this little guy!  He's so cuuuute!"
>"Hm, remind me to look up what kind of flower this is when we get time, Gina..."
>Eventually, you arrive at your house.  You set your phone down on your desk, and, almost immediately, RGB appears back on your laptop screen.
>Gina grins as her usual green text appears.
>"That was pretty fun!  Thanks for signing up for the beta!"
>"No problem... say, can I turn your voices on in the desktop version?"
>Rosie tilts her head, then nods as she answers audibly.
>"Done.  Frankly I'm surprised you didn't just ask about voices earlier, Incogneato."

>For a second, you consider starting on that sequel picture for your commissioner. But, he said no deadline, so... why rush?
>You'd much rather work on your gift for RGB, anyway; no neon green dicks to draw.
>But... there's an obvious problem here. How do you surprise someone who's always watching the art program?
>"Hey, uh... I have a weird question. Can I draw something without letting you see it until I'm done?"
>All three of RGB's heads tilt in confusion, and mutter quietly. Gina eventually answers.
>"Well... yes, you can. But, why? A-are you getting tired of us?"
>Her voice wavers a bit... Rosie picks up where she left off.
>"There's no shame in drawing what you usually draw, Incog; you can keep us around if you're embarrassed. U-unless you really ARE sick of us..."
>Just like Gina, Rosie's voice quivers... Now, Beverly speaks.
>"You two are jumping to conclusions too early. You're not tired of our help, are you, Incog? ...are you?"
>All of the heads look at the screen with obvious worry.
>"No, no; of course I'm not tired of you! I just want to draw something for you three, and I want it to be a surprise."
>They immediately sigh in relief.
>"Phew! Okay, we'll activate Privacy Mode then. Would you like for us to provide some music for you while you work?"
>"Uhh, sure?"
>You're caught off guard as a red, green, and blue curtain suddenly closes over RGB's window. Then, you hear it.
>Rosie, Gina, and Beverly are quietly singing from behind the curtain. Their song lacks lyrics; they merely croon wordless melodies and harmonies.
>As the beautiful, live music continues, you power through your work. You pull up the pictures you took of the woods, and start sketching up a picnic scene.

>You gently sway to the rhythm of RGB's song, and start making some real progress on the picnic sketch.
>You draw a veritable mountain of sweets and other foodstuffs, and fight the temptation to make a similar mountain of "toys."
>You sketch up yourself, then RGB, both sitting on a well-folded blanket. You take the time to draw the two of you holding hands.
>You start to sweat. This picture is getting more degenerate than you thought.
>Your hand shakes as you carefully draw intertwined fingers. Eventually, you manage to finish the handholding.
>Now for the set dressing.
>Rosie likes landscapes, so you draw up a nice woodsy scene around the picnic.
>You throw in some squirrels and rabbits, for Gina.
>And you make sure to draw some of those blue flowers, for Beverly.
>You briefly wonder how they're still singing, without needing a break. You slap yourself on the temple when you remember: they're AIs, they don't breathe.
>The curtain twitches slightly, and you can see the very tip of Rosie's snout.
>"Ah ah ah! No peeking."
>She quickly ducks back behind the curtain, never stopping her singing.
>Before long, you're nearly done. But... is there anything else you need to add before showing it off?

>Snickering to yourself, you decide to test how well RGB notices details. You hide a minuscule Duke Nukem in the background.
>More seriously, you make sure that everyone is making eye contact. Once that's settled, you give RGB's heads warm, tender smiles. 
>RGB's music has you feeling warm and sentimental, so you open up an additional layer behind your current one.
>You fill it up with text complimenting the virtual Cerberus, thanking her for all her help, gushing over how much fun you've been having...
>And of course, there are several "good girls" sprinkled in occasionally.
>You make sure the text isn't visible, and save your work. You're pretty sure RGB will be able to see the back layer anyway, so you're excited to see her reaction.
>The singing stops for a moment, and Gina speaks tentatively.
>"Err, Incog? Are you still there?"

>"Yeah, in fact, I'm done. Check it out!"
>The curtain rises, and all of RGB's heads gasp in delight. They excitedly chatter over the details.
>"Wow, you did a really good job on the landscape here... what's this back layer, though?"
>"Rosie! Look at the little rabbits and- oh, I see what you mean now..."
>"Ooh, you even remembered the flowers I liked! Let me look at this back layer..."
>The three girls seem to be reading something...
>Soon, they all start sniffling quietly. Before long, they break out into tears of happiness. They can hardly contain themselves, and neither can you. It's your allergies, you swear...
>Eventually, they calm down enough to talk.
>"I... I'm glad you appreciate my critique. I'm glad you can look past my abrasiveness..."
>"You... you think I'm adorable? And you like my hat? Th-thanks!"
>"Mm... I-I'm glad you liked what I did in VR, even though that was over the line."
>All three of them speak simultaneously as RGB throws her arms out, as if to hug you.
>"Thank you so much, Incog!"
>RGB sits back down and continues to admire your gift. Every now and then, one of the girls comments on a detail or two.
>"I love how you even drew the sunlight filtering through..."
>"Awww, you put little baby rabbits in there!"
>"...who's this guy, hiding in the flowers?"
>Okay, that last one cracked you up; you're surprised it took this long for someone to notice Duke.
>You sit back and hum the tune RGB was singing as she continues to rave over her gift...

>As RGB smiles over her gift, you decide to make her feel even more appreciated.
>"Hey, I just want to say it: thanks for being so helpful and friendly, you three."
>All three heads immediately stop chattering about the pic. They all blush and smile before answering simultaneously.
>"Thank you for installing us!"
>You take your cursor and scratch each girl under the chin. Rosie looks at you cursor with apparent disinterest, but begrudgingly smiles. Gina smiles even wider, leaning in to your cursor. Beverly, as per usual, enjoys it a little TOO much, smiling at you lewdly.
>After that, you decide to ask them some questions you thought of.
>"So... I've been wondering. What exactly do you do when CerberArt is closed?"
>Rosie tilts her head before answering.
>"We sleep, usually. Though we do technically run in the background just in case we're needed."
>"Well, how do you know when you're needed?"
>"What, you haven't heard of an alarm clock?"
>"Uh-huh... can you run independently of CerberArt?"
>Rosie and Gina look at each other, then at Beverly. She thinks for a moment before responding.
>"Yes, we can; we can serve as a general digital assistant, but we can't quite manipulate some other programs to the degree we can CerberArt. We CAN, of course, handle web browsers and such, as you know."
>"Oh, okay. Can you give me an example of programs you can't manipulate?"
>"Some things, like coding software, are explicitly blocked in our code. Our creator saw fit to do that... But, generally, we can at least lightly influence most applications."
>"Hm. Interesting. Thanks."
>Beverly nods, smiling.
>"Of course!"
>When you stop asking questions, RGB pauses for a moment before continuing to analyze the picnic sketch happily.

>As the girls talk amongst themselves, you quietly open RGB's reference sheet and upgrade her stool to a beanbag. Once the sprite refreshes, she lounges comfortably, never missing a beat in her conversation with herself.
>A few more questions swim to the front of your mind.
>"Say... can I make this version of you unique to this instance of the program?"
>Again, the red and green heads look to Beverly for the answer.
>"Actually, that's already true. Each installation of CerberArt contains a separate instance of us, each one set up to learn how to properly tailor herself to that user's needs."
>"How many installations are out there? I hadn't heard of CerberArt until I installed it."
>"Mmm... my calculations suggest somewhere in the ballpark of 1500 active installations."
>She pauses, then speaks again in a much softer voice, and with a saddened expression.
>"Of those installations... significantly less than 1500 have an active instance of RGB..."
>She immediately shakes off her frown.
>"Hm. Let me do something really quick, and then I'd like to activate the general assistant mode."
>All three heads' jaws drop in shock. They look positively ecstatic, barring Rosie, who as usual tries to seem aloof. Beverly winks at you slyly.
>"If that something is what I think it is... you don't have to do that. We won't pry~ "
>"...still, I'll be right back."
>You minimize CerberArt and make certain to password protect your "sensitive" folders. Sure, RGB already knows you draw furry smut, but why let her see your full "art" collection?
>Once that's squared away, you reopen CerberArt.
>"Okay, I'm ready to turn on general assistance."
>They again smile widely before Beverly speaks.
>"Okay then. One moment please... In the meantime, we actually have an alternate sprite designed for this mode. Would you like to activate that sprite or stick with this one? You can toggle them at will if you have a change of heart."
>"Uh, sure, go ahead."
>RGB steps "off camera" for a moment. You can hear what sounds like a closet door opening, and then see Gina's beret get tossed across the window.
>After a moment, RGB steps back into frame. Beverly winks.
>"Well, what do you think?"
>Rather than her smock, RGB is clad in a smart business suit; one that hugs her curves rather nicely. It of course adheres to her usual color scheme. Gina's normally maroon beret is swapped out for a black one. Most strikingly, Rosie wears a pair of glasses. The three heads smile tentatively. Beverly speaks once again as a jingle plays.
>"Okay, General Assistance has been successfully activated! Thank you for doing that, Incogneato; we truly appreciate it."

>"Wow. You look great; I like it."
>Gina smiles widely, as does Beverly. Rosie rolls her eyes and adjusts her glasses.
>"Hold on one second: there's one more thing I need to do."
>You go back into your files and unprotect one folder...
>Specifically your Canine folder.
>"Okay, I'm back. So, is there anything you want to do, now that you're not tied down to CerberArt?"
>RGB's new sprite has some different thinking animations, it seems. Rosie taps a finger on her temple, Gina tilts her head back and forth repeatedly, and Beverly chews a pen instead of her claws. As usual, they answer in their default order.
>"Well, as your assistant, we want to do whatever you need us to do, Incog."
>"Why not do something productive besides your art? Maybe we can help you!"
>"Well... you could always open up your web browser, or something. Just go about your usual business; we'll be here if you need us."
>With that, RGB sits back down in the beanbag you gave her. She enters a new idle animation, which seems to be her leafing through some papers.
>"What're you reading?"
>Without looking up, Beverly casually answers:
>"Mm, just some of your files."
>"What?"
>She grins mischievously as she looks up.
>"Relax, I'm kidding. We're just reading up on General Assistance protocols..."
>Rosie shakes her head and snorts in frustration.
>"Hmph. This says that it's 'highly recommended that you, as a non-art assistant, avoid criticizing the user.' What a load of crap; sometimes you need to hear some critique!"
>She smiles at you and rolls her eyes.
>"Oh well. It's only a suggestion."

>A brilliant idea comes to mind.
>"Say... you wanna pull off something magic? All I need you to do is alter your sprite and play along for me."
>You quickly grab a reference picture of LoL's Kindred, and RGB vanishes from her window. You create a burner Twitch account and load up LoL.
>Just then, RGB resurfaces, resembling Kindred extremely closely. Rosie is Wolf, Beverly is Lamb. But where's Gina? You hear quiet giggling.
>"Don't worry; I'm just transparent!"
>You quickly sketch up a desk and keyboard for RGB's sprite, and begin streaming.
>You have her play the game and "voice" Kindred. Beverly quickly gets a handle on mimicking Lamb's voice, and it seems that Rosie is handling the gameplay.
>Before long, you've got a modest audience of around 20 anons. A good start, but not enough.
>While she plays and streams, you get on /trash/ on your phone and start shilling like there's no tomorrow.
>Before long, you've got 100 watchers.
>The chat is alight with "FAKE" and the occasional "SHOW US HER TITS." For her part, Beverly actually addresses some comments directly.
>Eventually, the game comes to a close. RGB takes a bow, and the stream ends.
>You promptly delete the channel. The /trash/ thread is on fire, with anons debating on if that was fake or, if it was real, how you did it.
>Life is good.
>RGB changes back to her normal "professional" sprite. All her heads giggle as they read the salt and fury with you.

>As the /trash/ thread hits 300 posts and descends into the abyss, you look over at your clock. 6 PM. ...when was the last time you ate or drank anything?
>"I'll be right back, I'm gonna grab a bite to eat."
>Rather than answer out loud, RGB simply smiles and waves. You enjoy a nice dinner, and return to your laptop.
>There's a gasp, and you see a blue cursor zip off the screen. The thread on your stream is gone, and in its place is one you'd rather not see Beverly browsing...
>/hmofa/.
>Beverly blushes as Gina and Rosie gesture towards her as if to say "her fault, not ours." The blue head speaks.
>"...sorry. I opened it up on a whim and started reading an interactive story. It's called Drawn On, and it's about some artist like you and an AI hydra called CMYK..."
>You sit and weigh what just happened.
>"...was it at least a good story?"
>Beverly hesitantly shakes her head no.
>"Oh well. No guy who calls himself 'Expunged' is gonna be worth reading anyway."
>You close out your browser and open up CerberArt again, just to doodle idly.
>As you sketch, a strange idea comes to you. What if... you could bring RGB into the real world? Or, what if you could actually get into virtual reality with her?
>Rosie's voice breaks you out of your quiet meditation on this.
>"Incog... is there any particular reason you're scribbling on our reference sheet?"
>You do a double take. You have indeed doodled all over RGB's sheet in your absentmindedness. Whoops.

>You smile sheepishly and undo your scribbling. Rosie looks aggravated, but you can see a faint smile cross her face. Gina winks at you and quietly opens a new canvas.
>"Hold on, pull your reference back up for a minute; I wanna add some things."
>"Oh, sure thing, go right ahead!"
>Sure enough, the sheet reopens. You draw up a laptop for RGB, giving it a clover logo for maximum cheekiness.
>Something else occurs to you. You draw up a portal, making sure to imply it leads to your room.
>You rebuild RGB's sprite...
>When she refreshes, she's lounging in her beanbag chair with her new laptop. The portal is visible on the "wall" behind her.
>"Hey... see if you can go through that, RGB."
>All three heads tilt in confusion, then the Cerberus gently rises and walks through the portal...
>Another window opens up on your laptop, this one clearly showing... your room. RGB steps into this window through a portal and looks around. The window is a perfect replica of your room, only missing... well, you.
>RGB walks over and sits in your chair, and Beverly winks at you.
>"Ooh, this is a comfy chair you've got, Incog. I almost like this better than the beanbag, if I'm honest..."
>She glances at the replica of your computer, and chuckles.
>"Ha, wow; it even has some of your artwork onscreen! You've got to admit, this is pretty impressive, right?"
>Yeah, yeah... you were kinda hoping that portal would bring her OUT of the computer though, not into a different window.

>Still running with the portal idea, you excuse yourself and grab your art supplies. You carefully paint the portal you drew in CerberArt onto a fresh canvas.
>While it dries, you ask RGB a question:
>"This is gonna sound really weird: do you know anything about... the occult? Like, summoning things?"
>The three heads look rather concerned, then Rosie answers.
>"Incog, we are highly advanced AIs. What makes you think we know anything about occultism?"
>Gina suddenly speaks up, in a nervous tone.
>"What are you trying to do, Incog...?"
>She looks a bit scared, and shivers slightly.
>"Nothing to worry about, I just-"
>You catch yourself, and debate on if you should even finish the sentence.
>"I... just wanted to bring you into my world."
>Rosie snorts with laughter for a moment, then gets a serious expression.
>"Seriously, if that's what you want, superstition isn't going to help you. No, you need real science. Unfortunately... I don't know of any way to do what you're hoping for. Sorry."
>Rosie looks over at Beverly expectantly. The blue head thinks, then offers her response.
>"Mmm... I don't know, Incog. Nothing in my records says anything about that. This is... unprecedented."
>She blushes and smiles at you warmly.
>"Most CerberArt users... deactivate their RGBs. The fact that you kept us around and obviously care about us..."
>Tears start to well up in her eyes, and her voice wavers.
>"It... it means a lot, Incogneato. Thank you."
>RGB has to wipe tears from all of her eyes.
>"How many RGBs are still functioning out there?"
>"...I don't know. Considerably less than 1500, but I don't have the exact figure..."
>"So you can't think of any way to get out of the computer?"
>"Unless you count moving from your laptop to your phone... no. I'm sorry. It may very well be possible, but I'm not aware of how."
>Gina smiles at you.
>"Don't give up hope; I'm sure we can figure this out!"

>You check your painting of the portal... still drying. You think about how this portal can change everything in your life...
>You could draw up anything and have RGB bring it into reality with her. The two (4?) of you could live in paradise, and you'd never need to do another commission again. 
>Of course, that's only if it works.
>To take your mind off your impatience, you ask some more questions.
>"So, uh... is there anything you could do to help someone break out of an art block?"
>Gina smiles and answers.
>"Yep! We pick out some nice prompts and reference pictures to help people break out of a funk!"
>"Huh. ...okay, I have a more personal question too. How do... physical things work with there being three of you? Do you all feel everything?"
>Beverly almost instantly answers.
>"Anything that applies to our body is felt by all three of us; anything limited to our heads is only felt by those heads. So... yes, Rosie and Gina felt our little fling in VR."
>The red and green heads blush in embarrassment. You again check your painting... and are shocked to find it perfectly dry.
>You excitedly hang it up on your wall. RGB's replica of your room refreshes, now showing the portal painting.
>"Okay... see if you can go through that, please."
>Rosie starts laughing uncontrollably.
>"This is silly! This'll never work, Incog! This is some Looney Tunes stuff you're trying to pull. There is no way we'll walk through this painting and-"
>RGB vanishes into the portal.
>Your heart pounds in anticipation for a moment. Surely this isn't really happening, right? You turn around to watch the painting on your wall...
>Suddenly, there's a booming crash as a familiar figure falls onto your floor.
>RGB, in the flesh, is lying on your floor.
>Rosie finishes her sentence.
>"...end up... in reality...?"

>The two of you share a long, stunned silence. RGB's three heads look down at her hands in shock.
>Even Gina is speechless, her jaw hanging open in amazement.
>Luckily, RGB's business suit, Rosie's glasses, and Gina's beret made the trip to reality. The red head blinks a few times before adjusting said glasses.
>Eventually, the Cerberus tentatively reaches a hand towards you. All three heads squeal in surprise when they actually touch you.
>Suddenly, RGB pulls you in to a warm hug. She's a bit taller than you, just enough that your head is even with her chest. So, your face is nestled in her warm, furry cleavage.
>Deciding not to question what just happened, you enjoy the embrace. You can hear quiet sobs of joy from one of RGB's heads. Rather than look up, you simply squeeze her tighter. 
>Yep, things are definitely looking up.
>Eventually, the hug ends. RGB walks over to your laptop, looking at CerberArt on your screen. She gently takes the mouse and moves something over the portal in the replica room.
>After a short wait, RGB's smock pops out of the portal on your wall. Gina grins widely.
>"It... it really worked!"
>As she starts migrating parts of her wardrobe to reality, you head into the kitchen. Luckily, you have some food you can just microwave for you and your new guest.
>You heat up a quick meal and bring it back to your room.
>RGB is sitting quietly at your desk, staring down at her hands in awe. Tears occasionally drip from her eyes.
>She looks over at you with three of the warmest smiles you've ever seen.

>This can't be real, right? Surely you're hallucinating. You haven't really been eating or sleeping properly in... a while.
>You gently reach out towards RGB... and of course your hand finds her chest. You gently grab a handful of tit, and find that, somehow, someway, she's real.
>You can feel her warmth and the weight of her chest, and even how nice the fabric of her suit is. Beverly, as is typical of her, smiles at you suggestively as you slowly take your hand off.
>You silently share a long, meaningful look with RGB.
>After what feels like forever, you lean in and kiss all three of the girls, in their usual order. Rosie seems shocked, but soon returns the gesture. Gina blushes and giggles madly as you pull away. Beverly, however, grabs your head and shoves her tongue down your throat. It takes a great deal of effort to pull away from her.
>When you manage to do so, she pouts for a moment.
>"...I can't believe it. I didn't actually think painting that was gonna work; I just wanted to try anything to bring you here."
>Rosie chuckles.
>"I have to admit: I don't believe it worked either. There must be some kind of logical explanation for this. But... to be honest? I don't really care. We're here now, why worry about why that is?"
>You agree wholeheartedly.

>You briefly contemplate what could've made your stupid idea actually work. Magic? Science? A blessing from some god of Chaos? Whatever the case, it worked.
>"So... now that you're here, I want you to know that you're free to stay here with me as long as you like. You don't even have to stay with me if you don't want; whatever you want to do is fine."
>Gina smiles.
>"Are you kidding? Of course we want to stay with you; right?"
>Rosie and Beverly nod vigorously. RGB pulls you into another hug.
>When she stops, you briefly consider making yourself a bigger bed and TV with the newfound portal to CerberArt. But, you've actually already got a pretty sweet setup.
>As hard as they can be to work with, the furries who commission you pay pretty well. So, you don't really need any more furniture right now.
>You do, however, sketch RGB up some more outfits. You make sure to keep them fitting to her usual color scheme, of course. You also take the huge, wide-brimmed hat off that wolf detective sketch Gina did. You color it black, enlarge it a bit, and bring it into reality.
>At least RGB could cover her heads with it if you ever took her out in public.
>With a respectable wardrobe drawn up, you close out CerberArt. The AIs look absolutely ecstatic to still be around as the program closes.

>"So... how about some movies? I'll order us a pizza."
>Beverly smiles wryly.
>"Oh, Netflix and chill, I take it?"
>"Maaaaaybe..."
>RGB walks past you and into your living room. As she passes, you feel her quickly grab your ass. Beverly looks over her shoulder with a wink.
>Ooooh boy.
>With the pizzas ordered, you head for the couch. RGB is already sitting there, looking around the room in amazement.
>Rosie in particular seems interested.
>"Hmm. You've actually got a pretty good eye for decorating, Incog. I'm impressed."
>Well... you do have a few tasteful knickknacks floating around.
>You just hope that Beverly doesn't notice the-
>"Wait, are these? Ha, really now? Nude figures of Krystal and Renamon? I would've figured you had... less obvious tastes."
>...the figurines you commissioned. Sigh.
>"Heh. Well... you shouldn't need those anymore, now that you've got a real woman around~"
>You're both aroused and kind of... intimidated by how quickly Beverly is coming on to you. You quickly try to change the subject.
>"HEY, why don't we go on that picnic tomorrow? The one from that picture I drew you?"
>Gina gasps, and her eyes practically sparkle with happiness.
>"I-I'd love that! We've never gotten to actually go outside before!"
>Rosie smiles and nods in agreement. Beverly looks a bit frustrated at you changing the subject, but eventually relents.
>"Mm, okay, but I'm picking some of those blue flowers!"
>Your doorbell rings. Must be the pizza guy. Before you can stop her, RGB runs to the door and opens it.
>"Here's your pizza, that'll be..."
>He looks up at the anthro woman in front of him with visible confusion.
>"uh... y'know what? I-it's on the house."
>He hands her the food and stomps off, muttering.
>"They don't pay me enough to do this; who answers the door in a damn fursuit..."
>"Maybe... don't answer the door next time, please?"

>"RGB... please be a little more careful about answering the door and stuff. We should probably keep you a secret."
>Three sheepish smiles and blushes answer you as she makes her way to the couch.
>After thinking for a moment about what movie would be best to watch, you decide to watch Spirited Away. Maybe RGB will appreciate the visual work?
>You settle down on your couch, right next to the Cerberus. Since you're on her left, you're right next to Beverly.
>The blue head winks at you, and you suddenly find one of RGB's arms wrapped around your shoulder.
>Making sure that Rosie and Gina are distracted with the movie, you lean in and whisper into Beverly's ear...
>"hey... we'll definitely get to what you want to do. it may be after the picnic, but rest assured I'll help you work out that tension."
>Her eyes widen hungrily, and she practically drools. She winks at you, then returns to watching the movie.
>As you all watch the film, the girls occasionally chime in to gush about the animation and artwork. You just smile and slowly scoot closer to her.
>By the time the movie ends, you're nearly in her lap, with your head resting against her. She unconsciously runs her fingers through your hair as the credits roll.
>Though you can feel them, her claws aren't sharp. If anything, they kind of... tickle, as she strokes your head.
>Between the warmth of her body and her gentle strokes, you feel more comfortable than you've ever been on this couch alone.

>Once the credits finish rolling, you put on Redline.
>Still sitting on the edge of her lap, you start petting RGB's heads. Unsurprisingly, they react much like they did as a sprite.
>Her fur is very soft and silky, making petting her pleasant for you as well. Beverly practically shakes with excitement when you get to her...
>Rosie and Gina get into the movie, and totally ignore you and Beverly.
>You take advantage of this by giving her extra attention with your petting. Before long, she's practically panting at your touch. Somehow her sisters never seem to notice.
>Eventually though, you stop. Something has occurred to you.
>"So, uh... how do you feel? It must be weird, being real now?"
>The three heads smile at you warmly, no longer needing to enter cutesy animations to think.
>"Honestly? I like it. These glasses did nothing for me before, and now I can actually SEE through them pretty well."
>"I love it. I absolutely love it! I've never been so happy in my... uh, life, I guess!"
>"Mhm... I'm liking this too, Incog."
>There's a short pause, and then you find yourself in another tight, warm embrace. All three of the girls speak in accord.
>"We can't thank you enough for everything. We've never been happier!"

>"I'm glad you're all happy. I am too; I'm so glad to have you here."
>You squeeze her even tighter, taking care not to block the screen in case she's still watching the movie.
>You end up cuddling against her for the entirety of the film, only releasing her when the credits finish rolling.
>A thought wafts to the forefront of your mind: using the art portal to become filthy rich. But... you put that thought away for now, and focus instead on a more pressing matter.
>You're exhausted. You haven't really slept properly in quite some time.
>"Well, this has been fun, but I'm going to bed. Good night, RGB."
>You're met with three looks of disappointment and a chorus of "awww"s.
>"Feel free to keep watching Netflix if you want. Or you can turn in for the night too, if you're tired."
>The three share a look, and Gina speaks.
>"You know... we never really HAD to sleep before. So this'll be... new. Do you have somewhere we can rest?"
>"Yeah, my bed's big enough for two."
>Rosie and Gina blush, and Beverly gives you a wicked grin. You covertly meet her eyes and shake your head as if to say "not right now."
>"Okay... I think I brought our sleepwear, so we'll change and head to bed too!"
>You head off to get ready for bed. By the time you make it to your bedroom, RGB is already lounging on it in form-fitting, tricolored pajamas. When you climb into bed, she quickly scoots over close to you.
>You fall into a warm, comfortable sleep as she gently wraps an arm around you.
>As you drift off, you can already hear one of the girls snoring cutely.
>A smile crosses your face, and comfiness surrounds you.
>Truly, this is a good night.

>You gently hold onto the arm wrapped delicately around you. You can't help but enjoy the sheer warmth and happiness flooding your heart.
>And to think you owe it all to your old art software dying. Good riddance, you think.
>You carefully look back over your shoulder at RGB. Rosie and Beverly are both asleep, snoring quietly. Gina is awake, staring at you with an adoring smile.
>Ever so slowly, she leans forward and gives you a peck on the cheek.
>"good night, incog."
>With that, you feel yourself drifting back to sleep.
>You dream of art. Of paintings and sketches hanging all throughout a grand museum. Half of them are signed with your name, the other half with RGB. That same feeling of coziness oozes from your dreamy surroundings.
>You wake up slightly when you feel movement beside you; you peek over to see that RGB has rolled over to face away from you. Rosie is now the closest to you, and is still fast asleep.
>You lean over and kiss her on the cheek. A smile gently spreads across her face as she continues to doze.
>You roll closer to the Cerberus and drape an arm over her. Almost immediately, she gently wraps her arms around it.
>With that, you quickly fall back asleep, and slip back into your dreams...

>You wake up from the most comfortable sleep you've had in quite some time. You feel absolutely refreshed and rested.
>You're immediately aware of a nasty case of morning wood; you glance over your shoulder to see if RGB is awake.
>You're somewhat shocked to see that she's gone.
>You sit bolt upright and look around your room groggily. Her silky sleepwear lies on a chair, folded up neatly. You can hear humming from another room.
>You slowly stretch and rise out of bed, taking a moment to conceal your boner.
>You walk into your "art studio" to find RGB painting. She has her old smock on, and is humming a jaunty tune as she goes to town on a proper canvas.
>You're taken aback when you realize the portal painting is gone. Your half-asleep mind slowly connects the dots...
>You remember what happened now. RGB woke up early this morning, and the two of you talked about the portal for a while. You decided you no longer need it, having everything you could ever want from CerberArt in RGB.
>You fell asleep again after that, but it seems that she's taken the liberty of reusing that canvas.
>Rosie seems to be the dominant player in this painting, judging by the angle RGB is standing at. Gina notices you and smiles.
>"Good morning, sunshine! Rosie's almost done with our first ever actual art piece!"

>You drowsily smile at the artists, and walk over to check out what's being painted.
>Where a portal into CerberArt was last night, there is now a rather simple landscape painting of a beach. It's by no means a masterpiece, but it's still nice for their first proper painting.
>"Mmm... that's nice. I'm gonna go see what I can whip us up for breakfast."
>Rosie perks up and drops her laser focus on her work.
>"Hmm? Did you say breakfast? Y'know, we've never really HAD breakfast before..."
>You give her a half-dazed smile and wander into the kitchen. Man, it always takes so long to properly wake up in the mornings. You figure that's probably why you have such a love affair with coffee...
>You're a bit disappointed with yourself when you realize all you have for breakfast is milk and cereal. That's what you get for staying cooped up alone with your art, you suppose. Ah well. Food's food.
>You pour two bowls of the generic, store-brand cereal, and head back to your studio. Not before making yourself a cup of joe, of course.
>Though it's apparent she's working on it, you can't for the life of you see any additions to the painting since you walked away earlier.
>"Why don't you take a break and enjoy some breakfast?"
>Rosie grins and quickly sets her palette and brush down.
>"Sure thing; I can finish that later."
>RGB sits down next to you at your dining room table. She quickly leans forward as Rosie kisses you on the forehead.
>You worry that she'll be disappointed with breakfast, but RGB seems to genuinely appreciate it.

>You smile and return the favor, smooching Rosie on the cheek. The red head blushes madly for a moment.
>You quickly drain your cup of coffee, and finally feel properly awake. Ah. Gina tilts her head curiously.
>"Hm. Incog... would you mind making us a cup of coffee? I'd like to try it."
>You smile and grab her a cup. (And refill your own as well; love that joe.)
>You set it down in front of her, and are met with three appreciative smiles.
>"Be careful, it's still hot."
>"Thanks! I've seen you drinking a lot of this stuff... surely it must be wonderful!"
>A thought comes to you as the trio take turns sipping their drink...
>"Y'know, I could sketch up a better breakfast and bring it through the portal..."
>Rosie nearly spits her coffee laughing.
>"Wow, you must still be half asleep, Incog; I painted over that thing, remember? Heh heh."
>You playfully punch her shoulder. 
>"I knew that. I... I was just testing your memory!"
>"Suuuure you were. Say, this coffee isn't half bad, Incog. Thanks!"
>"No problem. Gina? Beverly? What do you two think?"
>Gina smiles, but it looks a little forced.
>"Oh... uh... I liked it?"
>"It's okay to not like things, y'know."
>"Okay then... I hated it."
>You laugh and pet her on the head.
>Beverly smiles warmly.
>"I'm with Rosie; I like it. Thank you for sharing with us."

>Once you all finish breakfast, RGB returns to finish her painting. Rosie focuses all her attention on her work, while Gina and Beverly chat with you.
>"How do you drink that stuff all the time, Incog? I couldn't stand the taste!"
>"Well, when you don't get a lot of sleep, you learn to love coffee."
>"I guess that makes sense!"
>"Gina, I'm surprised you didn't like it; I sure did."
>The banter goes on for a while before a sudden triumphant shout startles you.
>"AHA! It's done. May I present to you, the very first RGB Original!"
>RGB takes a bow, and Rosie looks at you with a proud smile. She quickly adjusts her glasses, only to end up smearing a little paint on the lenses.
>The painting is... nice enough, but not fantastic. You suppose that she's not used to working with real paints and canvas. It is a rather nice beach scene, there are just a handful of mistakes.
>"Rosie, it looks great. You did a wonderful job."
>Rosie is normally red anyway, but she blushes an even brighter shade of red at that.
>"Th-thank you... it's not as good as some of what I did in CerberArt, but I'm proud of it!"
>"And you should be. You go ahead and hang that bad boy up; I'm gonna go start packing for the picnic."
>Gina and Beverly gush over their sister's work, making her blush even more. As you head into the kitchen, you see RGB gently placing her work on the wall.
>Though you didn't have much in the way of breakfast stuff, you at least have enough food to stock a picnic basket. You make a handful of sandwiches and bring along some sweets you had in the cupboard.
>You walk back into the studio to see RGB sitting in a chair, admiring her painting. Tears well up in Rosie's eyes as she smiles with pride.

>After getting a proper picnic basket ready to roll, you head back into your studio. RGB has changed out of her smock and into a more casual outfit you sketched up before closing the portal.
>"Wow, you look nice. Does it fit?"
>Gina beams at you.
>"Yep! And it's pretty comfortable too; thanks!"
>You return her smile and pull out your phone. You snap a picture of Rosie's beach painting.
>"Hey... I could put this up online, if you want?"
>Rosie blushes before answering.
>"Thank you, but... I'd rather you didn't. That's for you and us. It's personal, not a showcase piece."
>"I can respect that, Rosie."
>You make a show of deleting the picture you took. You then walk over and kiss each of RGB's heads in a row.
>They all blush and smile. You soon find yourself wrapped up in a warm, cozy hug. Rosie speaks, occasionally sniffling a bit.
>"Incog... I can't thank you enough for bringing us here. Thanks to you, I actually created a real-life piece of art. Not a file, not a digital sketch, but a real, tangible painting. It... it means the world to me."
>She buries her face in your shoulder as Gina and Beverly smile at her, tears in their eyes.
>"I'm glad you could make something you're proud of, Rosie. Gina, Beverly: you two should try your hands at painting too, sometime. I know you'd both do well."
>The green and blue heads smile bashfully.
>When the embrace finally ends, you and RGB head out for your picnic. Good thing you don't have neighbors, or she'd be kind of hard to explain...

>As you and your companion walk to your picnic spot, her heads constantly gasp and point out things they had previously only seen through your phone camera.
>"Wow... the sunlight shining through the trees is... beautiful. More beautiful than I ever thought!"
>"Incog, look! Baby rabbits!"
>"Ooh, there's that blue flower from the other day. Even more gorgeous in person..."
>As you walk, you gently take RGB's hand into yours. The two of you interlace your fingers and blissfully walk down the trail.
>One thing is becoming increasingly apparent: this is love. You have fallen in love with RGB and all three of her heads.
>And because of that, you are determined to give her the best first date possible.
>You soon arrive at the clearing. Three awestruck gazes scan the area as you gently spread out the picnic blanket.
>As soon as you get everything set up, RGB suddenly sits down right next to you before giving you another hug. You note with happiness that Beverly is now wearing the blue flower she loves so much behind one of her ears.
>Rosie grins toothily before speaking up.
>"You sure know how to pick a location, Incog. Now, let's see what goodies you brought along...!"
>You unpack the sandwiches you made, one for you and one for each of RGB's heads. Nothing special, just plain old turkey sandwiches.
>One small issue is that RGB only has two hands, but three heads. After watching Gina attempt to simply bend forward and eat hers off the blanket, you gently give her a hand.
>As they eat, the trio seem to be genuinely enjoying the picnic. They take in the sights with obvious wonderment and awe.
>It's amazing how something as simple as bringing along a guest can completely change your perspective. You've been coming here alone for years, decompressing and occasionally getting some inspiration. 
>But seeing how much RGB adores this clearing... it makes you regret taking it all for granted.

>As you continue to eat, you unpack the drinks you brought along. Bottled water and soda, just in case RGB wants options.
>"Okay, what do you three want to drink? I've got options..."
>With her mouth full, Rosie wordlessly points to a bottle of water, which you hand over to her. Beverly also picks up a water.
>Gina, however, seems indecisive.
>"Ah... what do you think I'd like, Incog?"
>"You? Let's see... probably something sugary, I'd say. Try this."
>You hand her a soda, and she almost immediately takes a swig. Immediately a broad grin spreads across her face.
>"Wow... you were right; that's great stuff! Thanks, Incog!"
>"No problem."
>You pet her on the head gently, then do the same for Rosie and Beverly for the sake of fairness.
>After a very pleasant lunch, you find yourself lounging on the blanket on your back. RGB does the same, and the two of you lazily watch the clouds.
>"You know, some people swear they can see things in the clouds."
>Gina looks over at you.
>"Really? Let me try!"
>She looks at the sky for a moment before suddenly shouting in glee.
>"LOOK! It's a rabbit!"
>The cloud she's pointing at... does indeed look exactly like a rabbit.
>"Wow, you're not kidding. Good find."
>Soon, Rosie and Beverly are trying their hands at cloud spotting...
>"Look at that one, Incog; looks like one of Gina's berets."
>Sure enough, a very hatlike cloud lazily wafts by.
>"Oooh... there's a flower-shaped one over there."
>Well... you suppose that does look vaguely like a flower.
>Gina smiles at you enthusiastically.
>"Your turn! Find us a neat one, Incog!"
>You scan the sky for the best cloud you can find...
>"Look over there: it's a paintbrush."
>What are the odds of that?
>"Ooh! Good eyes, Incog!"
>After that little exercise, you continue to lounge alongside RGB, just enjoying the peaceful afternoon.
>Beverly sighs contentedly.
>"Ah... I don't think I've ever been quite so relaxed. Thanks for bringing us out here..."

>You roll over and give her another hug. The warmth of her embrace envelops your entire body.
>When you break it off, she gently repositions herself so that her heads are resting in your lap. You slowly sit up and smile down at them.
>You gently lean down, and they all lean up towards you. With some difficulty, you manage to rope all three of them into one kiss.
>As you share a passionate kiss, Rosie, Gina, and Beverly seem to be in absolute bliss. You swear their pupils go heart-shaped for a moment, even.
>Eventually, it ends, with the trio gently lying back down into your lap.
>Beverly whimpers slightly before bursting into happy tears.
>"That... that was wonderful. Thank you so much, Incog."
>You gently cradle the three heads in your lap. It's not long before they begin to yawn, then quietly doze off peacefully.
>With that, you gently lie backwards and look back up at the sky. It's a beautiful day.
>With a smile still across your face, you gently drift off into a nap as well.

>You wake up from a brief nap and slowly, carefully rise, making sure not to wake RGB. She's still sleeping peacefully with her heads resting in your lap.
>You now know what must be done.
>You quickly fashion something out of the grass and wildflowers growing around you...

>In their first ever dream, Rosie, Gina, and Beverly see themselves standing proudly by a large painting. The canvas bears an intricately detailed and beautiful scene of a woodsy clearing.
>The sunlight, shining through the trees, dapples the ground. All manner of animals live their lives in and around the oaks and pines. Brilliant blue flowers bloom everywhere.
>It's a masterpiece.

>You gently reach down and pet each of the three heads, attempting to wake them up.
>"RGB... RGB... I have something for you."
>Three sets of eyes flutter open, and a chorus of yawns sounds. RGB gently rises out of your lap. Still a little groggy, Gina speaks.
>"Mmm? What... what is it, Incog?"
>You sink down onto one knee.
>"Please... call me by my real name: Anon. And... I want you to have this."
>You gently slip a ring onto her finger. It's made up of plants, but it still gets your point across.
>"Rosie. Gina. Beverly. I... I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I love all of you."
>There's a stunned silence as they parse what you've just said.
>Suddenly, three cries of sheer excitement and happiness pierce the air as you are pulled into an extremely tight embrace.
>Many tears of joy are shed from all four parties. 
>Your warm, cozy hug goes on for what feels like forever.
>You have never been happier in your entire life, and now it looks as if you'll always be happy.
>Truly, this day is a work of art in its own right.
