>Be anon
>Got wolfed a couple days ago
>A half-dozen wolf girls broke into your home and dragged you away to their village
>Your poor pelvis
>Third night, you're asleep in the hut they tied you up in when something wakes you up
>The soft crackle of a radio, and heavy footprints
>The door is booted open suddenly, and you're blinded by a flashlight
>Blinking a few times, you manage to make out a few details
>Body armor, a helmet, a face obscuring gasmask
>Oh thank god, it's rescue
>The figure kneels down and starts cutting your ropes
"Are you hurt? Can you walk?"
>You shake your head no
>Poor pelvis
"Have to carry me."
>Something soft and furry brushes against your leg
>Shit, that's a tail
>Once you're free, the figure takes off her mask, revealing a golden feline face underneath
"Those bitches, hogging all the humans."
>The lioness easily tosses you over your shoulder and carries you out the door
>All your struggles are for naught as you're carried away out of the village, toward a waiting helicopter where a pair of two more felines are waiting
"Yes! We got him!"
>You're tossed unceremoniously into the helicopter
"Oh god. Who are you cats?"
>The lead lioness smirks as the helicopter takes off
"We are the cats in the Human Appropriation Team!"
